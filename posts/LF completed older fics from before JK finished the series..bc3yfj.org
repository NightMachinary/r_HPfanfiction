I'm curious to know what fan fiction authors thought was going to happen or just what direction they decided go in. I'm hoping this will lead to no horcruxes, hallows, or Jesus allegory.

Side note: is “happy Christmas” is a British thing? I've only ever heard merry Christmas or happy holidays used in real life.


** - /Harry Potter and the Lost Demon/ was started before the publication of DH - it also correctly predicted a few things, such as Harry being a horcrux and Slytherin's Locket being inside No 12 Grimmauld Place. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- /Eighth/ Was published right after HBP and correctly guesses that Harry was a horcrux all along. Been a while since I read it, but it was good. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2607390/1/Eighth]])

- /With Malice Aforethought/ - I don't really remember what this one was about, but it's on my favorites list so I guess I liked it at some point. Published 2005. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2527087/1/With-Malice-Aforethought]])

- /Resistance/ - Great fic. Published just before DH. Ignores horcruxes or simply deals with them off screen before the fic starts. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Restoring Hope/ - Published 2005, before DH (ignore the dates on FFN, it was originally on Portkey and reposted to FFN must later). Much is different, and I think it's a rather original piece. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7024025/1/Restoring-Hope]])

- /Angelica/ - started posting just prior to DH (2007), and DeliverMeFromEve continued with her original storyline. Again rather original. But I think I remember this one being a bit better than it really is. I think it starts off a lot better than it finishes. Originally on Portkey.org [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7056]]

**** Yes but it's only really preformed in the West Country, and the term isn't really used in everyday talk in the UK, but American English is an oddly bastardised English, it uses really old English mixed in with its own Italian/Irish/Spanish/french built slang, depending when/where it cropped up in the US, that song or at least is original written variation was from the early 1800, people were still leaving the UK to go to America at this point, and by the end of the 1800 Britain had mass education, at which point many of our more area specific religious practices were fazed out (Due to most schools being faith), including Christmas songs. The concern was so high that we would lose our regional accents and colloquialisms that entire groups were formed to stop this. But still unfortunately in this time speech still used in the US today in everyday conversation drifted out of fashion and then industrialism brought about new carols and slang when people from all over came together in city's and meshed accents. Much of what once was is now lost.
