I postet my first chapter in may and it's still going. Also it's a slash fic for the people who are not interested in this.

Basically this fic is about a MoD Harry who travels back in time and has somewhat questionable morals, with Death tagging along as a character. It's not that dark, but it's probably going to be darker in the future. Not angsty though. I haven't edited all the chapters yet, so there are parts that contain a few mistakes. I would think that my writing has gotten a bit better since I started, but anyway I would love for you guys to check it out an leave me a comment or something if you are interested.

(Also it's tagged underage but there it's not really underage because of time travel and stuff but it's explained in the description)

** QUINE THIS STORY WAS SO SAD I ONLY READ THE FIRST LIKE CHAPTER BECAUSE HARRY IS MEETING REMUS AGAIN AND HE DOESN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT HIM ANYMORE!!! :( :( :( :( WHAT IS THE POINT OF HIM GOING BACK TO SAVE PEOPLE IF HE DOESN'T EVEN CARE WHEN HE GETS THERE? :( NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Also yes that kind of means there is no tension or reason for the READER to care because Harry doesn't care!!!

*** Yeah well Harry will care more in the future it's like he's lost all connection to the people he knows since he's become the Master of Death but he can form new ones (and will) but it takes some time, you know... I actually even wrote a chapter from Remus' pov later on.

***** Yeah, but it really takes a little bit of time... anyway thanks for checking it out either way. :D

Ps. You could just skip forward and take a look at one of the chapters later on so that you get an impression of how Harry acts then, so you don't have to read through all these chapters anticipating a major change, only to notice that you might not be into it. (The chapter that has Remus' point of view is called 'Among the wolves' and it's mostly about Remus staying with a werewolf pack as an Order mission, apart from the first few paragraphs)

****** Yes thank you! :( I'm sorry it is just I love canon Harry BECAUSE he cares about people so much. How he even saves Dudley and sort of gets him to apologize to him and stuff. But you did just strip that away instantly. :( So it is super jarring.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead."---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

** Your story sounds really cool! I'm always intrigued by Peggy Sue fics. Do you have a pairing planned for Harry somewhere down the line, and if so, who are they?
