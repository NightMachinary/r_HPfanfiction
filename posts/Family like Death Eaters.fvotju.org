Do you guys know fics where Tom treats his death eaters like family?\\
I read one a while ago where he still will punish the ones that mess up, but he also looks after them, and demands they look after each other. I'm pretty sure he was still bad but he viewed them as /his,/ there for he took care of them. I believe it was the marked ones only, like those were the ones he cared for and protected. I like the idea of Harry being around the death eaters (kidnapped, joined, doesn't matter) and is like why when he notices how Tom treats them, because you know its the not evil cruel people he imagined.
