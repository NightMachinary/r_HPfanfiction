I've been thinking for a while now about the fact that veritaserum questioning in fanfiction always start the same way. The person asking questions asks for the name and birthdate of the one being questioned and concludes from those two answers that the serum is working... How does that make sense even remotely? Given that those are often public knowledge, a criminal would have nothing to lose by giving out that information. So if I risked being questioned under veritaserum, I'd just learn to act like I'm under the serum, use an antidote beforehand (assuming that such a thing exists, of course) or bribe people to give me water instead, and then just tell people whatever story I wished.

This is mostly based on stories where it is possible to overcome veritaserum in some way, but people ignore that and are satisfied with the above mentioned questions as a test for successful usage.


** Think of it less as them confirming it is working and more of it just in case they need to provide some type of Pensieve testimony. That way there's no real loopholes like "oh it could've been someone Imperiuised or using a polyjuice potion!"

*** Absolutely! If done for the purpose of confirming someone's identity, I wouldn't be posing this question. I'm mostly a little annoyed with fics where the questioner turns around and says something like "the veritaserum is working"

**** That makes me think, was the first or only on screen Veritaserum questioning with Fake Moody? In which case securing their identity was the first question. Did this create a weird fanfic precedent?

** You're right, it doesn't really make sense. But there isn't really a better way to test that it is working. Ideally, you would need to ask something that you know or that can easily be verified, but that the person being questioned doesn't want to admit. But if someone is trying to trick you, they'd probably be willing to answer the embarrassing question anyway.

You could say that veritaserum compelled you to answer truthfully, even when you don't know the truth, so you could ask a question like "how many fingers am I holding up behind my back?" But that makes veritaserum way too powerful. (Though since divination does exist, it's not impossible to imagine that it /could/ work that way, it just /shouldn't/.)

I guess that it /might/ be possible to come up with some sort of question that the person being questioned could subconsciously know and that could be verified, but that they couldn't hope to consciencely know. Like if you shuffle a deck of cards and quickly flip through them, maybe veritaserum would allow them to give the exact order of the cards, even though almost nobody would actually be able to memorize them fast enough. I'm not sure that memory actually works that way though. And I suppose that anyone with fanon!occlumency would still be able to cheat it.

*** u/Avalon1632:
#+begin_quote
  "how many fingers am I holding up behind my back?"
#+end_quote

The truthful answer there would just be "I don't know.", no?

**** If veritaserum is reasonable, yes. My point is that someone could write a fic where veritaserum compels you to give true and accurate answer even when you don't know the answer. But unless they're trying to write a Harry Potter/Minority Report crossover, they probably shouldn't.

***** Fair. I have a similar issue with Pensieves - they're often used to let people reviewing the memory see things the person who's memory it is had no hope whatsoever of seeing.

** Maybe there's a mind magic technique that allows the user to avoid veritaserum by convincing themselves they're someone else who has nothing to do with the situation? Using the same name for your interrogation cover leads to emotion cross-pollution, so interrogators ask for the name and birth date to verify that the avoidance technique isn't being used.

*** Valid point, and the questions in question (heh) would help determine if that particular technique is being used, but it doesn't test for other potential ways to avoid the veritaserum.

** Tone of voice and glassy eyes are supposed to tell you, I guess. I've thought this exact thing; those questions don't establish ANYthing. Some fics try to get around this by telling the person to try to lie, but of course that can also be faked.

The trick would be to ask them a question they don't want to answer. Find one of their Hogwarts roommates to give you some dirt.

Honestly, I think Veritaserum is only effective if the person you give it to doesn't know (i.e., sneak it into their drink, just like Snape threatened to do to Harry).

I remember reading one fic (don't remember title, sadly) where there was a truth SPELL placed on the Wizengamot chambers, that indicated a lie without forcing the truth. Everybody who testified started by telling two truths and a lie, so that everybody could see the results. The lies were of the grandiose "...and I'm the queen of the Amazons" type, which was quite entertaining. (Damn, now I want to track down that fic.)

** For those of us who have taken polygraphs the interrogator asks questions for the baseline that they know should be true and then a question or two that they know are false (e.g. they ask you to lie). That way they see how your body reacts to true answers and when you lie.

I never understood why during veritaserum questioning why they didn't ask a question that they know a person would lie to in order to see if the potion would force a true answer.

As others stated elsewhere I assume that something in the eyes verifies that the veritaserum is working. The monotone voice is too easy to fake.
