Like, she needs a characterization.

I headcanon her as a shy Hufflepuff in Harry's year, and Susan and Hannah's friend, bullied by people like Pansy Parkinson.

I'm looking for fics in which she is actually a character who interacts with the protagonist.

*** She was probably replaced with a Polyjuiced impostor. After all, it worked all through fourth year. By spiking Harry's food and drink, she kept him in a constant state of anger, which prevented him from learning to protect his mind and put him into fruitless conflict with Umbridge, without drawing any suspicion onto herself from Dumbledore.

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.

** Not sure if you've read it yet but she's good friends with Harry in Recnac Transfaerso and the sequel Flawed Perfection by Celebony. She's not the main character or anything but she definitely plays a role
