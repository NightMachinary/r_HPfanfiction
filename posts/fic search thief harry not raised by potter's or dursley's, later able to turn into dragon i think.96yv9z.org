i can't remember the name for the life of me but i do remember a lot of the plot. the potters are alive, he has a younger sister named rose who was wrongly identified as the girl who lived, he ran away from either them or the dursleys and was taken in by an old master thief. fast forward several years, he meets hermione on a cruise, she's dating ron but sleeps with harry. skip forward a bit, he takes ginny to a gala under the name lord skye and lady star, he steals a gem, ginny notices but doesn't care. and that's all i feel like typing but i remember more of it.

  The time turner around Harrys neck shattered sending his soul back in time; where his body could not go. When Harry finds himself in a ten year old body; in his aunts garden he vows to do things right this time and save everyone he lost. First he needs to make his friends into the new Marauders and convince the sorting hat to unite him with his own alternative to Sirius Black.

  [RE-WRITE PENDING] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi
