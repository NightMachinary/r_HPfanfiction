Stories so bad you hate yourself for reading them but you can't stop reading, like a literary version of the movie "The Room".

*/Complete stories only please/*


** Linkffn(Profesor Lupus and the Curse of the Wearwolf) never doesn't make me laugh.

My absolute favorite scene is the sorting one, but the train is a close second.

And yes, for some inexpliciable reason, it's a LoR crossover

** linkffn(Raised by Darkness) cracks me up. Friendly dementors raise Harry, without stopping for a single comma.

The first scene of linkffn(Lord of Caer Azkaban) is ridiculous.

So is the /awfully clever/ letter at the start of linkffn(Poison Pen). (Harry sure put the /Daily Profit/ in their place har har.)

But linkffn(The Boy-Lord of Slytherin) absolutely has to take the cake. I'm in tears by the end of it. It combines every single Lord Potter trope, unnecessary slash and terrible writing, and somehow ends up ... hilarious? The author is a genius.

This is definitely one of my favourite bad ones. It surely is well written (kind of) but I can't help but cringe multiple times a chapter.
