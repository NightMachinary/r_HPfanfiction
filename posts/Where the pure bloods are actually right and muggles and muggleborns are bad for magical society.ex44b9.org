I won't place limits because I've never read something like this and want to scope the field so to speak. Anything and everything that fits the title please.

  All is seemingly well in Wizarding Britain as the last aftershocks of the War against the Dark Lord fade away, but a series of murders lead ace Auror Daphne Greengrass to a threat that may throw her world yet again into imbalance. COMPLETE!

Great story with a lot of interesting ideas where Muggles are actually bad for the magical population and Harry doesn't like it! :D\\

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

*** I think you're confused here my friend, we're talking about works of fiction. You know, fiction, as in something imaginary, not real.

Why wouldn't we be allowed to think/play outside of society's box/mold? You're taking things way too seriously.

***** Reiterating that it's fictional. The KKK is not fictional. You can't compare the two without bringing that up.

It's fictional prejudice against all HUMANS; there are no wizards in real life.

Ever seen Fern Gully? Or District 9? Or E.T.? The story of "people are the bad guys" has been told countless times.

*** No. There are some decent fics that show depth to Voldemorts view without saying 'hey lets genocide all the things' like ' On The Way to Greatness ' by mira mirth. Or ' Sarcasm and Slytherin ' by sunmoonandstars on AO3

***** Or theyre legitimately worried of a stifling governmental structure limiting access to magic and intense registration of various magical gifts i.e. Animagery. Also societal upheaval isnt something to ignore. What exactly decides 1 societal influence gets to entirely supplant another?

For instance. Sunmoonandstars goes into older practices ( entirely fanon of course) where muggleborns are adopted through blood rituals and protected way back in the day, due to religious zealotry of the time.

Its about how you choose to write Voldemorts side. You can make him magic hitler... Which is more Grindlewald, even by canon standards, or you can make him a rebel who wants to limit a (canon) fascist government.

Granted JK Rowling really wanted to write the clear racism allegory, and she did. But there are fics out there that flesh out Ol Voldy and make him less insane. Theres also those who make him less insane but still a murderous genocidal maniac.

Your response smacks of limiting characterization to strictly canon level, which isnt my particular cup of tea. If i wanted rehashed canon I would crack open them sweet 7 on my shelf.

I like the weird. For instance Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man? Not my favorite but I read it and keep up with it because of 1 scene at the end of 2nd year with Dobby. And of course this mostly unexplained concept of Wild Magic and how he did the Lockhart thing. Its not my favorite but its different and nowhere near canon. But plays in the same general universe that I like.

******* Canon government is fascist. Before voldemort takes over. Think 5th year. Also tracking magic use. Mr Weasley's whole job is to prohibit and raid homes to prevent people from enchanting everyday nonmagical items. Differing magical departments to control every facet of society. Seeming governmental control of the major press outlet. That is fascism. When voldemort takes control it just goes from a more passive fascism to violent fascism

Also, what makes you the arbiter of toxicity? There seems to be a lot of projecting your real world beliefs into realms of fiction. What is wrong with Draco in leather pants? What is wrong even, with people writing grotesque and horrible things in works of fiction? Somehow you think a reddit or wider fanon community needs some type of regulatory control. I dont. If some schmucks want to write some racist garbage who cares? Its not going to be popular or well defended.

*** Fics which do this invariably change the setting though, so that vold and the DE aren't murderous terrorists, and introduce some reason for muggleborns to be bad for wizarding society.

Not really any different to how the DE are portrayed as 'stupid evil' and wizards are generally shown as clueless or less logical compared to muggles (which in itself should be racist by your standards.)

Ive read a few 'good slytherin' fics and none of them have pro-KKK stuff because they change the situation and reactions etc.
