Because every once and a while we all like some crappy fic time.

Please give me some: ROR training Time dilation Multiple lordships Time travel shenanigans Dumbledore bashing Insane shopping spree All powerful Etc

I don't care if they are good or bad, incomplete or not,if they are slash or not, or what pairing. Just gimme. Thanks.
