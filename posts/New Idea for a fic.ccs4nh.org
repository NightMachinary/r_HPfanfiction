I'm... tapped out of writing, don't think I've written anything in nearly 10 years, that being said I have ideas still all the time. So I've got one for you guys if you're interested.

​

The story starts out one night with Evanna Lynch checking her phone and seeing all these articles and things about Daniel in some kinda drama and apparently going off the deep end with booze. When she get's on her way home she find him in a literal pile of garbage looking like he's had the shit beat out of him. For plot reasons, maybe to keep him out of the public eye ,she takes him home instead of the hospital and then we get to the main part of the story. Daniel thinks he's Harry Potter but he looks really freaking unstable. From here on out, it's Evanna trying her hardest to be Luna while figuring out how to deal with this. Rupert and Emma, who have been trying and failing to get ahold of him, get dragged into the delusion to keep Daniel's fragile mental state from breaking.

​

Now comes the interesting part of the fic... It's not Daniel at all. It actually is Harry Potter, who has his wand but for some reason his magic is on the fritz and is trying to find his way home and trying to figure out why he's stuck in the muggleworld, why he's apparently a decade into the future, and trying to figure out how to get home.

​

So it's them playing along with a delusion while trying to help him and Harry doing his own thing in the background. And while Harry's magic is messed up he's still doing things though no one's ever there to see it happen.

And while this is all going on the question is "Where actually IS Daniel?"

​

So, there you go, have at it if you want.


** I dunno. Writing fanfic about real life celebrities always struck me as rather distasteful

** interesting premise but might be better off as an original story, with oc's as actors. you could still set it in the harry potter universe by having it be based off of perhaps a netflix series that focused on the marauders or the next gen. that way you could still work with an established world but you'd avoid the the moral dilemma surrounding writing about real people. imo, if it's purely plot with no romance or sex, just friendship and focusing on the progression of the story, then writing about real people isn't so bad. most celebrities tend to be more weirded out by the fact that people are writing romances and smut of them with other people than the fact that people are writing about them in the first place.

** Huh. I think I saw a similar fic somewhere where Harry and Daniel swap universes with both POVs..

*** Trading Places, perhaps? The actor-characters are OCs in that (ie the girl playing Hermione is called Ella rather than Emma) and it takes place while the movies are being made and Harry is still in school. But the basic premise is quite similar.

  A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.

***** Yep, that's the one. I don't think I particularly enjoyed it though. Hope your fic goes well!
