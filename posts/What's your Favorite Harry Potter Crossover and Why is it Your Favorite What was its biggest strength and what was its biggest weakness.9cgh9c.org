  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** littlewhitecat's excellent Harry Potter x Warhammer 40K series. It's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness - not much in jkr's world can touch an astartes in power armor with warpcraft. The author does an excellent job of lowering up the threats though.

*** Nice of you to share this. In the past 6 Hours I read the First Part and am into the six chapters into the Second.

It has been an enjoyable read, because the Charakters seem so clearly defined to me. Sadly, It is quite rare that people so utterly embrace a crossover and dont soften It up too much.

** Well my favorite HP crossover isn't so much for the HP aspects, but the aspects of the series that it crosses into.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ascension of Ra)

The weakness comes from the fact that HP is fairly OOC, and the beginning of his story is pretty ridiculous. It's strength is that its a large crossover with Smallville. I love Smallville. I need more.

** *Visited by a Doctor* is one of the few stories that starts with a nail, and keeps going. The story begins when Harry is a child and hits it stride post war as various alien problems arise to keep him busy. The biggest drawback is despite Harry being the main character, in may ways it is a Who-vien story.

*The Next Lord of Kobol* is probably the best character driven fic I've read about a character finding themselves in another world, showing Harry adjusting to colonies while growing up. On the other hand it is a slow burn and it is seemingly abandoned, although the author has taken long hiatus before.

*** The Next Lord of Kobol is one of my favorites... and now I have to read it again.

Only issue I have is the beginning five chapters. They feel extraneous and are way too long for what pretty much amounts to a prologue, especially as it doesn't really add anything to the story. Other than that, I love it, the characters, the unraveling plot the author builds, and Harry trying to find his place in this world. (And, of course, it being Harry, the Potter Luck loves to rear its head.)

*** I'm honestly at a loss at seeing the amount of praise this trilogy(/tetralogy?) gets. The meld of the two worlds is shaky at best, or rather completely unbalanced. It just doesn't do justice to either of them.

The characters feel flat---especially this version of HP... and the whole thing just feels pointless. Because of the flatness of the characters I'm unable to care about the---I'm going out on a limb here assuming its existence---/plot?/

Or it's like fucking up various HP characters with hellfire was just the scratching of certain itches for the author. I have no idea. I've given up on it after the first part.

It is a bad, bad fanfiction, with a lot of pointless, weightless edginess for edginess' sake.

***** A valid point, and I'm sorry for the emotional outburst : ) It was just one of those pieces of fanfiction which actually upset me, as I'm completely in love with both series.

On that note---and to return to the realm of constructive contributions---I'll share one of my favourites which is a cross with Dresden as well.

linkffn(7779108)

It's unfinished and most probably abandoned, and I've seen it mentioned elsewhere on the sub, but I've still felt it deserves a mention.

** Don't know how to link properly so it's just pasted below, but the Harveste series by kyaru-chan is an all time favorite of mine. It's an Addams Family crossover and I adore it. All Addams' are weirdly dark and OP as hell, but I find the story really entertaining and come back to it often. The main issue is that the author got to the beginning of 6th year and then abandoned the series. Well worth it for years 1-5 though!

As the story progresses, the Addamses just get weirder and weirder. I don't recognize them anymore. I don't know what was the author's inspiration for the darker elements of the story. She mentioned old gods and sacrifices. I remember being so engrossed in reading this fic. I must have read it 3 times before finally giving up when I realized it is most likely abandoned.

** Since Shadow of Angmar has already been mentioned, I'm going to go with my other favorite crossover: linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao).

Biggest strength: The obvious skill of Zenzao at putting words together in a pleasing way. In 8,441 words there is more quality writing than the first three pages of all the Harry Potter (non-crossovers) fics on ffn sorted by favorites /combined/.

Biggest weakness: Well, the obvious answer is that there isn't more of it. So the less obvious is that Evelyn feels just a bit off. She knows a bit of Herbology and Potioneering but literally nothing else about the magical world. So how did she end up in Gringotts at the beginning (when she didn't even know what a goblin was)? She is described as almost a squib, is this due to a lack of magical education or some weird lack of talent/ability?

** Oh god, yes, now /this/ is a question I can answer.

My all-time favourite is linkao3(5030443), a Bleach x Harry Potter crossover. It is /hilarious/, so well-written and captures a number of voices so well. Its problem, really, is just that these fandoms don't overlap much, and it loses something without a decent understanding of Bleach's characters.

Another fave is linkffn(11949378), a Full Metal Alchemist x Harry Potter crossover, wherein Roy Mustang finds himself in the magical world. It's an incredibly satisfying read, with sensible and well-developed characters, but it /is/ still ongoing.

A BBC Merlin x Harry Potter crossover, linkffn(9626943) is always fun to re-read, but features an almost ridiculously overpowered Merlin... major flaw is the point where he spends like 3-4 chapters running through the woods as a mystical deer or something while everyone else does useful things, I always skim that bit.

The Carnivorous Muffin's stories are all incredible, linkffn(11666799) being one of many increasingly-absurd crossovers featuring fem!Harry as ungodly powerful but cripplingly existentialist. This one is Naruto x Harry Potter, but its characters also appear in shorter stories, crossed with things such as (but not limited to) Star Wars, PokÃ©mon, The Lord of the Rings, and My Immortal. The drawback is that you definitely need to read the major fics (this one, Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds, and the HP AU, Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) before you can understand what's going on in the further spin offs. Very worth it, though.

Although it's already incredibly popular, linkffn(7613196) is Harry Potter x Tamora Pierce's Song of the Lioness quartet. It can be (and generally, I think, is) read as just a very AU HP-verse featuring fem!Harry, but it makes a lot more sense (and is /way/ more satisfying) if you've read the Lioness books. It gets recommended left and right on this sub, and for good reason. The author was on an unplanned hiatus for maybe 8 months, but updated again very recently!

Honourable mentions to linkao3(1113600) and linkao3(1134255), both BBC Sherlock x Harry Potter crossovers by the same author. Unlike the rest of my recs, these do feature a pairing (Harry/Mycroft, in both), but it fortunately isn't the focus of the plot.

** Finishing the Hat is probably the one for me.

linkffn(Finishing the Hat)

It's a tri-way crossover (HP, Naruto and Star Wars), with a fem!Harry who is super OP but has to deal with other issues, so it doesn't get boring. The author has a non crossover story called Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, which is pretty surreal and Finishing the Hat can be considered a spin off of a spin off of (and no, I didn't make a mistake typing that) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus.

However when it updated in June it was switched to monthly, so that is good news since that means the author plans to update monthly and this was a recent change. I'm still skeptical though, I've basically never seen an author come back from a 2.5 year hiatus and update at a regular schedule again rather than a sporadic one.

** Linkffn(The Stormreaver)

It's got two thinks I like that makes it stand out for me. One is that it's a crossover with Warcraft, a truly fascinating universe with interesting lore that is criminally underrated within the fanfic community. And two is that it's a Dark!Harry story that at the same time isn't mired in edgy teenage angst.

The only negative is that Harry is somewhat overpowered and is a bit of a Gary Stu but evil (is there a name for that?).

** Mine is a Naruto x HP crossover, linkffn(Effloresco Secundus), in which the war didn't end with Book 7, and a war veteran Hermione is reborn as Haruno Sakura.

I think its strength is the characterisations of the members of Team 7, and how their friendship develops. I particularly enjoy how the author deals with Hermione/Sakura struggling to give meaning to her new life, all the while suffering from PTSD.

Its weaknesses are that it doesn't update frequently enough (:P), and that there is little magic so far, mostly just destructive applications of accidental magic. This seems to be changing in the most recent chapters when Hermione/Sakura discovers that she can interact with ghosts, and this leads to a very interesting development of the relationship between Sakura/Hermione and Sasuke.

So far there is no romance between the main characters, which is a plus for me.

** linkffn(3468902) Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain by nuhuh

Great HP/Dresden Files crossover. I dunno what to list as the biggest strength--it's just great. Good mix of humor, great characterization, etc.

Biggest weakness is the ending feels a liiiittle rushed, which seems to be the case with a lot of fanfics. There's several loose ends. The ending is open, which isn't the issue; there's just a lot of different possible plotlines that are opened up, and they aren't furthered, much less resolved.

Oh yeah, and the sex scene is pretty unnecessary, but it at least does have a smidgen of relevance, I guess. It is better than the laughable one Jim Butcher put into Skin Game, but that's not really saying much.

** My favorite crossovers tend to be ones that fuse settings, rather than just have one character that crooses over into another setting.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/what-wicked-warthings-harry-potter-rwby.614516/reader][What Wicked Warthings]] which is a HP/RWBY crossover which fills that need. It follows a much different Harry competing in the Triwizard Tournament under the guidance of his mentor Tom Riddle. The fic only uses setting details from RWBY such as the Grim, the use of trick wepoans and the White Fang. No RWBY characters have made an appearance so far. Knowledge of RWBY while helpful isn't required.

Summary: "Magic is a curious thing, capable of creating beings that are the embodiment of human emotion; the Boggarts who are Fear, the Dementors who are Despair...and the Grimm, shadowy creatures who feed on pandemonium and Turn those they kill. The Grindelwald Plan has spared us from annihilation, but this war will only end in one of two ways and I'm not one for dying." -Tom Marvolo Riddle

** My favorite crossover is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheTrinity][The Trinity series]] (I linked to the TV Tropes page because it has links to all seven books). It's a crossover with the Nasuverse (FATE/Stay Night and Tsukihime in particular). It's a retelling of the canon stories without Harry. The three main characters split up the things that make Harry stand out, e.g., one becomes the youngest seeker in a century, one is a parselmouth, and the third is the nephew of Sirius Black. The fun part is that one of the characters was a big fan of the books and remembers most of what happened in them, and another liked the movies. However, the more they try to circumvent canon, the worse things get. Voldemort is more cunning, and the bad guys are strong enough to still be a challenge. The biggest weakness is that the end is coming slowly. It's one of those fan conundrums. I want the end to hurry up and get here because I've really enjoyed all of the previous parts, but I know that a) if it's rushed, the quality will suffer and 2) when the end comes, it will be over.
