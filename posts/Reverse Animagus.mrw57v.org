Are there any stories where an animal, preferably Hedwig, becomes a reverse animagus?

Sugamina sounds like a neat name for an animal that can turn into a human, so does Magusanima.

I think it would be great, and I may or may not want to read a HarryÃ—Hedwig fic...


** linkffn(4153867): The requested Harry/Hedwig, along with owlets that can take human form. Not smut, fortunately. Owls are lightweights.

In an entirely different vein, InwardTranscience includes wilderfolk in several works, which are descendants of animagi in their animal forms. They're very much not human, though. A cat wilderfolk, for instance, isn't a half-human, half-cat. They're simply a highly intelligent cat with the ability to have opposable thumbs when it suits them. One of the side characters in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1466644][The Plan]] is Silvie, a wolf wilderfolk who is a bit of an oddball for being interested in how human society functions.

*** Yes! I read about wilderfolk in one of their stories ages ago and meant to check whether they'd been an invention of this one author or have been imported from another fandom. They're a fantastic invention. Some of that writer's other shit is creepy but they also have some excellent worldbuilding details and fem Harry characterisation

  While searching the Black Library for something to destroy Riddle, Harry is led by his oldest, dearest friend to an ancient tome. After reading it, their lives are further linked and forever changed. Very unusual pairing.
