Fics where in sirius has a daughter and is friends with harry, later on becoming paired with him. Basically a Harry/Daughter of sirius fic.

I've read linkffn(Black bond) already and i actually really enjoyed it.

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

** There was a story, where the daughter was a partial veela (shunned by pure-veelas), partially French, student at Hogwarts, only later finding that the notorious murderer Sirius Black was her father. She was NOT paired with Harry. One very minor episode was that then very old (half-retired) Kreacher made a small garden on the roof of Grimmauld Place, where he was spending most of his last days. I really cannot find it anywhere. Any ideas?
