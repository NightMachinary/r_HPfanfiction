*** It involves HP finding the Hall of Gryffindor when he asks Dobby for help with a place to train for the tournament. Godric initiates him into the Knightly Order of the Phoenix.

Mostly guilty pleasure stuff, IMO. Since the tournament is meant for adults, goblet ages his body to 17. Going by the dialogue, I guess it ages his mind to about 25, maybe? Lel. Oh, and Bellatrix ropes Sirius into performing a ritual that makes her 17 again, and enters as the Champion from Durmstrang after intimidating Karkaroff into an unbreakable vow or something similar. These are hardly spoilers - most of this stuff happens in the first 3 chapters or so.

Good thing about the fic is that it does NOT seem to be looking like a canon rehash like everything else. First task is markedly different from canon. Fleur and Cedric were written rather well too, much different from the usual "O woe is moi, boys want me from saaxx and wahmyn hate me" Fleur that we see all the time in fanfiction.
