So I just finished reading the promises unbroken trilogy, and I was really wondernig what you all thought about it. I haven't seen it recommended much and I think it's certainly worth reading, although it's quite old.

I really liked the dark reality of the wizarding war, as well as the interesting development of the marauders and their magic. Sometimes it felt a bit overdone and drawn out, however, and I would have liked a more cohesive storyline. What do you think?


** I liked it, especially Julia's profession and the world building. The Avalon and Azkaban plot was brilliant. Sirius's characterization was spot on. I just finished rereading it.

There were some things I never liked, like the Councilariam. Julia never drew me in as a character. She was...meh and lacked depth.

I guess the thing I liked most is Peter's characterization. He was so believable and lovable. All the Marauders were, to be honest. Voldemort's characterization was also nice.

*** Yessss, I really liked the islands!

I think what frustrated me in the end was the lack I'm successes from the 'good' side of the war. I mean damn.. All the losses, all the capture:p

**** I think the victory at St. Mungo's alone was enough to make up for all that happened. That was simply awesome.

****** Yeah, it did get pretty depressing at times. Especially when Sirius disappeared and the attack on Lacene plus imprisoning all these children. However, it wasn't unrealistic which was slightly surprising. It didn't seem forced to me.

******* Agreed. Although I do fancy a lighter story after this one.

** I thought the first one was the best, with them decreasing in quality following that.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.
