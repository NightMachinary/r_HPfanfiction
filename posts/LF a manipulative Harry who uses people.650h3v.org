Well written stories are a must but feel free to suggest any and all that meet the criteria so I can at least try it out before deeming it readable or otherwise. I'm also looking for stories where Harry seduces/courts/etc a female (Can be anybody except for the usual) to further his own ends and goals. Something like Contractual Invalidation for example per to say if not alil darker and a more ruthless Harry that doesn't care about the moral ramifications of the manipulations.


** - /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]/ --- WBWL!Harry wants to resurrect his sister and blames his parents for her death.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11302568/1/Renegade][Renegade]]/ --- Harry merges with the memories of the scar-horcrux, advances through canon stations while making friends from light and dark alike. Told from various PoVs.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher][Prisoner's Cipher]]/ --- Timeline is post-Hogwarts; the iconic war hero suddenly acquires a jagged personality, ex- death eaters starts going missing.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]/ --- Harry wants to become one.
- /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1149623][Disillusion, by Hermione Granger]]/ --- (short story) an essay by HG that explores how the merger of magical and mundane societies came to be, and speculates exactly how much was it influenced by one Harry Potter. Has some wishful thinking elements.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
