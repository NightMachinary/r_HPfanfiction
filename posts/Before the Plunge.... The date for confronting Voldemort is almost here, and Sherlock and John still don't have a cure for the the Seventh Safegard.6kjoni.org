** I book marked this story. It sound very promising. The photo shop image of John being trampled by Harry's patron us is hilarious.

** Are you the author? I read the first couple chapters but stopped because it was just rehashing. Wondering if that ever stops.

*** Definitely. It was necessary in the initial stages to establish exactly what Sherlock knows - both in view of it as a Sherlock Holmes case, and due to the fact that I wasn't expecting all readers to be up enough on HP lore to follow Sherlock if things weren't stated in the text. (Oh, yes, I'm the author.)

But certainly, things become much more action oriented. Chapter 1 - The worlds clash Chapter 2 - The characters agree to discuss the issue Chapter 3 - The basic case is established (yeah, a lot of rehash) Chapter 4 - Sherlock gives his thoughts on the Snape issue (kind of an odd place to put it maybe, but it's a major plot point later so it had to be established early) Chapter 5 - It's from this point that the action which diverts the course of the future really begins, and the united characters embark on the horcrux hunt.

I know it was a kind of slow start, but it really seemed necessary for the subject matter. And there is intermittent re-statement of facts, which comes up inevitably whenever Sherlock has to explain a deduction. (That can't really be helped.) But yes, the plot diverges very strongly from the original, includes a good deal of action, and winds up in a different place.

** I think you need to work on your hype or titling ability or something. This is a great story, but it doesn't get upvoted very much at all when you post it here.

*** Yes, I notice that I don't seem to write click-bait titles. I'm not certain what would improve them. Do you have any ideas?

And, thanks.

**** I've never seen self-promotion threads get upvoted much (except for maybe one or two sub favourites). It's tolerated but not much liked, I feel. I wonder if there is demand for a pinned weekly/monthly self-promotion thread on here as they have on other subs?

***** Well, it's difficult for someone who doesn't already have a following to apprise potential readers of their story's existence. People do tend to look askance at it - but what else can an unknown do?

**** You're very welcome.

With this title it's a bit hard to notice that the chapter is part of the Seventh Safeguard story until the end. This title sounds more like a normal English sentence than a chapter header. But in general, I don't know what you can do to attract more attention. Put it down to bad taste by readers, or people getting distracted by weird recommendation threads, I guess. There's probably room for a middle ground between clickbait and purely descriptive titling, although I don't have any good advice on how you should go about finding it.

***** Well, I could just do chapter titles, but that isn't always going to be very informative. Maybe I should start with the book title rather than end with it.
