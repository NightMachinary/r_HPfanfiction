#+TITLE: How should I categorize my next fic? It's starring Harry obviously but it takes place on a fusion of Nirn(Elder Scrolls) and Earth(Fallout) with Ciri(Witcher) and potentially one other character from another series.

I was debating doing it as an Elder Scrolls/Fallout crossover with just OC, OC, OC, OC for charas.

Harry's very not-canon in story since he grew up with a foster mum who loved him and dursley. His aunt and uncle are dead. The hp-earth is fucked and they're looking for a new world to escape to. While fallout earth is fairly fucked, it's much less so than hp-earth.

So, thoughts? Just go with hp/most relevant crossover? My original plan? Who the fuck cares, work on your other stories asshole?


** Is it a sequel? Otherwise I doubt you'll get very many people looking at that. If you want readers from the HP fandom you'll need to leave that in there. Is the main setting Fallout? I would advise HP/Fallout with only Harry listed. I think people are much more likely to click that than some Elder Scrolls/Fallout with nothing but OCs listed.

*** The main setting is a fusion of fallout and elder scrolls so more shadowrun than one or the other but i don't really know shadowrun so i can't use it as my setting.

**** I mean the geographic setting. Unless you've physically fused Nirn and Fallout-Earth, your main setting sounds like it will be Fallout, which is what I would put as the second fandom.

** List it under the Witcher and HP tags. Most people were introduced to the Witcher series via the the video games so Ciri teleporting to different worlds/universes is one of the few canon things associated with her. Harry Potter in different universes is almost as common as the HP fan fiction tropes like "Lord Harry" or "Magic wards".
