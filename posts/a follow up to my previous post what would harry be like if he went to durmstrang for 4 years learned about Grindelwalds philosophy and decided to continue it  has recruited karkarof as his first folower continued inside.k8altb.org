you guys seemed to like my previous post. it generated great discussion so if thought I'd continue the discussion . find it here [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k6hoi5/grindelwald_seems_like_a_better_dark_lord_than/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]]

harry shows up 4th year with durmstrang a true believer of Grindelwald for a few reasons his muggle upbringing. the stupidity of the purblood ideology and durmstrangs inate refusal to admit muggleborns .

now harry would know Voldemort is alive via karkarofs dark mark . He'd already be powerful due to a good study habits researching everything about Grindelwald. mannerisms spells ect and just like the man he shares an ideology with he's naturally gifted with magic.

he's recruited about a third of durmstrang to his cause

he'll stay back in Britain to recruit followers mostly dissatisfied muggleborns by using the magic makes everyone unique line. Maybe a British inherentance law keeps him around (thoughts on that one)

idk if id want to keep the hallows plot & have harry be obsessed like Grindelwald except the elder wand (never liked the hallows) unless they get expanded in FB 3 4 5. maybe instead he goes after info on the philosopher stone ( I don't think it would be destroyed personally) so gets close to Dumbledore& Fluer and thats another reason he stays in hogwarts

a few other things

events at hogwarts have continued as in canon but with Neville instead of harry. Except for a few differences .

1 the philosopher stone in the mirror was a fake (thiers probably been thousands of attempts to steal it Voldemorts was no different i doubt flamell would destroy it over another one)

1. Dumbledore is not evil & manipulative.

3 Dumbledore would already have reformed the order due to\\
trelawneys prophecy in 3rd year about Peter escaping

4 Krum Neville& harry would all compete crouch would drop both names in as now both harry & Neville are enemies of Voldemort. (harry would horrify Dumbledore once he sees the spells harry uses as they be grindelwalds famous ones.)

5 this would Kickstart Neville a year earlier

6 Karkarof would rejoin Voldemort as a spy for the alliance just like snape for Dumbledore (hey Karkarof is headmaster to the darkest school in Europe I think that would be enough to get him off Voldemorts immediate shit list he has info on harry too!)

7 harry would use his fame to start turning public opinion & the ministry against Dumbledore & towards the alliance viewpoint maybe in OOTP he helps Umbridge ( i liked harry potter junior inquisitor). He never uses his fame getting in good with the the FUDGE era ministry is something I rarely see and no madame bones!!!

8 in OOTP (the order has to be a bit more competent because thier now fighting the alliance and death eaters

members such as moody & tonks go & assassinate low lvl death eaters & spy in the ministry were as in the criminal Underworld its a competent mundungus Fletcher vs madam Zabini. thief vs assasin

in the ministry its Agusta against lucius against harrys proxy bathilda bagshot

creature wise. its lupin vs greyback vs vampires on harrys side giants & dwarfs vs goblins on harrys side (he promises to give them wand rights & return all goblin forged items including the sword of gryffindor

thoughts on turning Sirius to Harry's side?

harry would get the philosopher stone in this book

Voldemort is knowledgeable in rituals parsletounge & horrucruxs and lacks in other magical area's due to the whole thier is only power mindset and how he is in the book due to the stupidity of splitting his soul 7 times! + wizards taking on muggles and shattering the SOS that way is just a recipe for annihilation for wizard kind

one of the lines I'd use as an insult against Voldemort in the story "your a frightened child playing with a toy he doesn't understand, play by the rules no cheating my child" (in regards to horrucruxs) the philosopher stone i feel is something used not to cheat death but to prolong your life until your work is done i feel just like in canon the flamell s would accept death & so would harry once everything is established for a few generations

harrys justification for the wider muggle world in regards to guide the muggle for thier own good is the cold war. (they barley avoided MAD numerous times & they didn't learn from 2 world wars & now everyone has nukes! but he'd also talk about good muggle inventions. TV the advancement in medicine the Civil rights movement ect imagine if wizards were guiding & directing muggles everyone doing what they'd be best at with wizards on top!

thats all I got so far

harrys side

Karkarof

half of durmstrang
