Im looking for fics focused on Harry training D.A, as either a replacement for defence against the dark arts during umbridges reign, or Harry and CO. During D.A into a competence fighting force, such as in bobmin356's "Dumbledore's army"

Also, I've already read DAATYOD, and its not my cup of tea.

Any ships sans Harry/Draco, or Harry/Voldemort. Any rating.

Thank you for your time.


** Not quite the DA but a slightly different group of muggleborns in an AU where things are going downhill for them a lot more obviously, using guerilla tactics and large quantities of duplicated explosives.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
