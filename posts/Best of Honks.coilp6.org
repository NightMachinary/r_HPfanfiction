** Ive had an idea for one for a while that Im honestly surprised hasnt been done before; post hogwarts battle remus dies but Tonks lives and the harry/ginny ship never quite rematerializes, Harry ends up taking his responsibility as Teddy's godfather seriously and helps Tonks with raising him(alternatively timeskip of Harry spending a year or two on a walkabout after book 7). Ultimately Harry and Tonks end up bonding and theirs lots of fluffy goodness.

*** There is something like this on ffn. Or at least it use to be. Can't remember what it's called, though.

Both Ginny and Remus die, but Tonks lives. It was a good few chapters, but was a slow burn with a competent extension of canon Harry.

** !linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change)

An (unfortunately abandoned) fic in which a seventy year old Harry is thrown into an alternate universe. This is probably the only good young Tonks fic out there. The pairing is technically Harry/Hermione/Tonks

!linkao3(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus)

Post-canon EWE fic. Tonks was never interested in Remus and is assigned as Harry's partner in the auror department.

!linkffn(To Date a Metamorph)

A newer fanfiction where Tonks is only interested in dating people her parents don't approve of. Her parents are aware of this and trick her into pursuing Harry.

!linkffn(Dawn of Darkness)

A highly canon divergent fic where Harry and Tonks find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy after Slughorn is murdered after his Christmas party. The plot is really unique and it has a good sense of mystery to it.

!linkffn(Teddy's Excellent Adventure)

A shorter and more lighthearted fic where Teddy Lupin goes back in time and tries to set up his mother with Harry, the only person he ever knew as a father. The author has also written a few other short Harry/Tonks fics, like !linkffn(The Dark Lady Tonks)

!linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black)

This fic is also abandoned, but it's also one of the only fem!Harry/Tonks fics

!linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool)

This is the other fem!Harry/Tonks fic. Harry has nothing to live for, so he goes back in time and ends up in the body of a female version of himself. Antics ensue as Harry tries to leave the magical world for good after killing Voldemort, only to be roped into taking the position of transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts.

!linkffn(Harry Potter and the Metamorph)

Harry leaves the country after Sirius dies, and lays low in the U.S. until he's of age. He winds up reconnecting with Tonks after he realises that he has repressed metamorphic abilities and needs a tutor to teach him how they work.

***** Yeah I know it's AU but it lies mostly on the HP canon until this part of the story (Slughorn party in HBP) and some things may be intended as AU but it's presented in a way that I can only see canon errors. The one that made me quit was the error with the Fidelius (and I know it's not the only one, I don't remember all the others and this was the one too many for me).

As recall they mention the same Fidelius charm as in canon. Fidelius which can protect a secret (in this case a house) and only the secret keeper can give the secret except if he dies in which case anyone having the secret becomes secret keeper. In the fic Harry even asks if it's the same one as in Grimmauld Place which Tonks confirms. Tonks apparates Harry to the house and giving him the secret by just bringing him there (on the doorstep as in DH so no problem). But we later learn that the secret keeper is her mother (which isn't dead).

It's too bad because the story had potential in my opinion but I'm too nitpicky on things like this to enjoy the story.

************** Okay yeah, are you just being mean now? You don't have to mock my xD usage. I use them to indicate that I'm havin a good time. Sorry if they annoy you so much you have to mock me with it though. I never even USE "lol" or whatever...

Guess I'll disable inbox replies and cut this convo short, if you're just starting in on me now. No use in it. I THOUGHT we were having a genuinely nice conversation here. At least, I was trying to.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
