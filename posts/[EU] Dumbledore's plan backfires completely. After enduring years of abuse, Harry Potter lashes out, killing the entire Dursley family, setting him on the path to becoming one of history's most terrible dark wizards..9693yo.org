** Oh, it's WritingPrompts... *looks at top comment* how much you want to bet it's some kind of twist ending?

WTF is wrong with that subreddit?

*** They like twist endings? ...So do I?

More seriously, I think the "problem" here insofar as there is one is that somethign like [[/r/WritingPrompts]] can usually only get its contributors to do short stories or novellas, and there's a long-standing tradition for a great many short stories to have twist endings.

That's fine. Who doesn't?

Literally every time I visit that sub for some reason or another I see some mindfuck/twist ending type of story. If everything has a twist ending it completely defeats the purpose of a twist: Being surprised.

***** Sure they all have twist endings. The new challenge then becomes not to surprise because there is a twist, but because of what the twist is. It doesn't really allow for mediocrity to shine, instead forcing more creativity and originality.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
