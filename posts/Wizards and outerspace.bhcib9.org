Do you think that wizards have visited outer space? Does the Department of Mysteries research anything related to it? I wonder if they have gone to space, that maybe they've seen other intelligent beings. Is it possible that maybe some magical creatures live out there and there are wizarding farms to manage them? Are there any fanfictions that actually explore the concept of wizards and space?

What do you think?


** That's a good question for JKR.

Depending on your needs, your story can either:

1. Make magic only available on Earth, or dependent on the existence of living beings. This will give future advantages to Muggles once they finally break out into the space.

2. Make magic prevalent everywhere. This will make Space colonization and exploration much much easier than just with Muggle technologies. Just imagine what extension charm, portkey, and duplication charm alone can accomplish!

*** I wonder if a Portkey could reach the Moon. We see no limit on them in canon, but the distance between just Earth and the Moon is incredible.

**** Portkey is better used between space ships/stations in low planetary orbits and planetary surface. Apparition should also work. In fact, most â€˜Wizards in Space' fics give them this ability.

******* The spell works, but since the moon is so heavy magic finds it easier to just move you to it alarmingly quickly rather than the other way around.

Scenario 1: By the time you realize what's happening and how to stop it, the air is thinning out quicker than your problem solving skills can handle. You pass out and your corpse eventually arrives on the moon and becomes a NASA mystery.

Scenario 2: the change in velocity is centered on your wand, it slips out of your grip, but not before your shoulder is dislocated. Your wand bounces off the international space station, becoming a NASA mystery and inspiring the incredibly expensive hobby of space doodad woodworking. Because astronauts don't think 'wand' when a artsy looking wood thing bounces off the window in space.

Scenario 3: you flub the spell and banish the moon instead. Eventually, the moon escapes orbit, because magic, and collides with Mars, causing it to glow brightly from the superheated rock and physics that happens when big things bump into each other, causing a centaur rebellion, because Mars is just way too bright and they can't handle it. And all the other effects of the moon leaving, such as tides not happening anymore.

Scenario 4: you don't flub the spell and successfully summon the moon. You have three months to regret your impulsivity before the moon finishes being summoned, and arrives with every bit of it's momentum.

Roll 1d4.

We do, actually. Grindelwald uses a Portkey to leave Britain and return home, which is somewhere in continental Europe, and Newt uses one to get to Paris. We also know people from all over the world used Portkeys to show up to the Quidditch World Cups.

[[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/799670686495162369][JKR has answered this:]]

#+begin_quote
  Victor: Why couldn't Newt have used a portkey? It can't have been difficult for him to register one since he works at the Ministry.

  J.K. Rowling: Consider the effect on the contents of his case...
#+end_quote

And this of course implies that a Portkey /could/ be used to travel across the Atlantic Ocean.

**** I see no reason why it can't. Or if not a Portkey, then why not some Vanishing Cabinets? You could set up a whole stargate network, with the only problem being that the portals are paired rather than being able to dial every other cabinet

** As far as fanfics that explore wizards and space:

The DSS Requirement series is good and marked complete, but short and feels like it needs more. Messing with the Room of Requirement, the DA discovers a spaceship from the Stargate universe and it slowly changes their lives. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818]]

The Mischief's Heir series is a crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but we mostly only see Loki and later SHIELD. Harry pursues his curiosities and starts a space agency. Long, but overall I enjoyed it. The author treated magic as, well, magical and unique and different from Muggle lives, and the attitudes and culture reflected that. Various issues of the Wizarding World and stations of canon are solved in ways I've not seen in any other fics. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

There's also a bunch of crossovers, like Browncoat Green Eyes (Firefly), one of nonjon's earlier works. Or the current Invincible by Darth Marrs, a BSG crossover. Plenty of Star Wars and Trek crossovers of course, particularly by Darth Marrs and plums. Ynvr's Voyage of the Starship Hedwig is an original one, but leaves off on a cliffhanger and the entire story can be summarized as "and then things got worse".

*** Also, if you can find it (I can't), /The Star Empire/ by RahXephon was a non-crossover where Harry was a space pirate, in what I remember being a fairly hard sci-fi (no FTL) setting.

It was never completed, and the quality was slightly rough, but it was long, and /Harry was a freakin' space pirate/.

**** It originally had explicit scenes in it, so it got repeatedly taken down on FFN. The author followed that up with a Mass Effect crossover, where Harry was taken as a Batarian slave. That got taken down for explicit content, too.

Darth Marrs's Revenge of the Wizard started similarly to the Mass Effect crossover, now that I think about it.

** The biggest of the DoM's secrets is that they know why astronomy is taught at Hogwarts. When the stars are right, they'll launch their ship. Unfortunately something else is also out there, waiting in the dark, for the stars to be right, hidden behind KBO 55323 R'lyeh.

** I've always liked the idea that a few wizards have given it a shot, but upon realising space is pretty much empty they all just got bored and never bothered much with it again.\\
After all the main reason for most of humanity's interest in space has been science and satellites, given that the wizarding world doesn't care much for either (routinely ignoring physics as they do) they'd not have much reason to care.

** I think wizards have definitely traveled to space. They've colonized the moon and Mars. When muggles in general inevitably discover the existence of magic and wizarding communities, wizards will have to flee to space to escape an all out war on Earth. By then muggle technology will probably have advanced enough to send missiles to blow up the moon or Mars so wizards have also begun long distance space travel to other habitable planets.

The question is... do those planets have living species of their own? If so, how far advanced are you these species? Are they sentient? Do they have advanced technology? Do they have magic? Is their technology and/or magic different from ours?

** Wizards have not made it to space but other magicals have. Since myths have root in truth it stands to reason that ALL the creatures muggles consider mythological were once real. Instead of going extinct like wizards think they did, they actually just fled the planet. We have house elves but I'd like to think there once existed "elves" of the LotR variety. They all moved to the moon or Mars or some habitable planet in another solar system. Wizards have forgotten about such things because of some spell that was placed on their ancestors who were left behind because they were too stupid/annoying to join everyone else.
