Any good fanfics where Harry decides to not sacrifice himself after seeing Snape's memories?


** By that time, don't you think it would be too late to back out?

Also, to get to that point, the Harry you have must be the canon one, and it would be totally OOC if that Harry backed out.

Therefore, Harry must know about his condition much earlier, and he must have a quite different personality.

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), basically has a Harry telling the entire British wizarding world: go **** yourself!

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

*** I think that the canon Harry could back out if he had a bigger reason to stay alive... For example, if he had a child or smt like that.

**** And even then...why would he do that?

At that point refusing to die is basically saying "yup, go ahead Voldemort, you win. Here's magical Britain on a platter"

  I mean, if the story has a Harry that's less heroic and somewhat more egoistic than the average person, going to Voldemort and saying "I'm your second last Horcrux" is a pretty good way to live safely and comfortably all your life.
#+end_quote

Someone wrote a story where Voldemort figured out that Harry was his last Horcrux and when he surrendered himself in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort just stunned him and took him to the Chamber of Secrets. He kept him alive but as a prisoner and a torture subject. Not quite the same situation as what you suggested, but imo it would be closer to Voldemort's reaction if he did figure it out.

****** And that's the point, a Harry that was more egoistic and whatnot would not tread the same canon path through seven books to the Penseive and Forbidden Forest. Like [[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]] said, if you've already reached that point in the story diverting it would be severely, almost hilariously out of character.

** Now that would be something (hell maybe there's another way to remove the horcrux (they didn't ask the DOM for example!) - if Harry learned that, would he really go and get himself killed?)!

So I second that request :)
