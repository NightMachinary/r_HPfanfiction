Looking for fics with a Hermione that isn't a know it all book worm that always follows the rules. Give me a Hermione that is still smart but likes to swear and has no problem interacting/flirting with others. A Hermione that uses her knowledge to do things outside of normal cannon magic would be nice too.


** One could argue that canon Hermione is already badass Hermione.

** linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) - scarily smart Hermione

linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) - qualifies for "uses her knowledge to do things outside of normal canon magic"

linkffn(Hermione's Plan by chemprof) - a bit OOC Hermione, but still smart and has no problem interacting/flirting with others

linkffn(Reign of the Serpent) - extreme AU and still in first year, but this Hermione is amazing. Love her

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her - and yet... Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar? (Reincarnation fic)

*** Second this one. Currently following, and loving it.

Have a few complaints about things she does that don't seem... correct? Like things that don't quite mesh with her characterization as written, but it's a great story overall.

I also love just how BAMF Hermione is in this story. Definitely a good read.

**** Fundamentally, I feel like my problem with the story is that it takes away Hermione's agency- Vector essentially removes tension that exists in earlier books, where the climax is "Book Climax" + "We Have a Professor!" It ruins the whole point of removing Dumbledore whenever the stakes got high. There's also the minor issue of arithmancy being OP instead of basically a form of numerical divination, but that's not uncommon in fanfics. It's definitely better than 90% of other fanfiction, has good grammar, etc., but it feels poor as a story.
