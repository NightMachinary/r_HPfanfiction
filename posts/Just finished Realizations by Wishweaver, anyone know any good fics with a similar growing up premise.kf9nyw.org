I really enjoyed the fic and whole heartedly recommend it to others although be warned it has a rather abrupt ending and isn't completed I don't think.

I was just wondering if anyone who had read it could recommend similar fanfics? Would be much appreciated!

**** It's a rewrite of the fic you linked that goes beyond the previous one, not the same fic.
