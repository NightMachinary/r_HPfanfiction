Like, I highly highly doubt there's an anti-venom for a basilisk bite, and even if there is I doubt Hogwarts would have it. Also basilisk venom does not seem like something that would eventually filter itself out of Harry's system. I just makes sense that there would be some sort of change.

Are they unworthy of having fawkes tears? If they tried then why are they still catatonic?

A true cure all wouldn't make sense in any case. So, they have to be conditional somehow. Do they only work for open wounds and poisons? Or do they somehow change the body to be able to survive it?

***** Ooh interesting !!

I'm currently reading a Fem!Harry x Tom Riddle fanfiction on Ao3, it's called Appetence by elysian_drops and the author has a similar headcanon about Parselmouths. Basically, Parselmouths are more than just people who can talk to snakes.

The mouth of a Parselmouth has a different structure than the mouth of a normal human being, it's more similar to that of a snake, which allows them to make the hissing sounds of Parseltongue. When they bite someone, their canines become longer and sharper to pierce the skin and reach the veins. And a Parselmouth's bite is lethal, because they produce their own venom which is extremely deadly and can kill someone in a few minutes for muggles and a bit longer for wizards.

There is no antidote for a Parselmouth's bite, nobody knows anything about it because of how rare Parselmouth's are.

Only another Parselmouth can survive Parselmouth Venom, but even if they don't die, it's gonna be painful and it'll take weeks for their body to completely eradicate the Venom and they're gonna be weak, sick and constantly feel tired until the venom is completely gone.

Of course, I accepted this headcanon in a heartbeat, and I'm adding yours to the list! So basically, Parselmouths are people who can talk to snakes, and who are both poisonous and venomous.

****** This story also has a weird twist on the parselmouth abilities. You might like this one too and even though it's tagged slash, it is complete and they only have a platonic family like relationship. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27949034/chapters/68449268]] Being a Parselmouth came with the inherent predisposition to understand snake behaviours and imitate them. It was relieving Harry wasn't going to kill anyone with venom, nor petrify them with his gaze. But also, somewhat frustrating as it was all completely useless. None of the skills that came with being a Parselmouth would help Harry survive Voldemort.

It might, in fact, have the opposite effect. For all Riddle's fury that Harry was the cause of his elder self's defeat, he was fascinated by the fact Harry was also a Parselmouth. He had grabbed Harry's face, turning him side to side looking bemusedly enraptured by Harry's threat display. “At your age, I was imitating much more vicious snakes than this, Harry.”

That may have been all well and good, but Harry didn't feel very vicious. He felt very threatened and in over his head.

Harry goes on vacation and tries to have fun and stay inconspicuous. He's successful in the first part of his plan. Not so much with the latter. He ends up mentally (and physically) traumatizing many, /many/ bad people, starting a wildly successful business venture with a couple of mad scientists, and getting mistaken for a primordial god of war and death. Mostly by /turning into/ a primordial god of war and death.

He doesn't really notice.

The fic is made of high-grade crack and it is delicious.

** If Harry is: A) Got Toxic blood like some suggest. B) Immune to other poisons and venomds. And C) pretty much immune to pain. Then I imagine Harry starts to develop Hagrid-Syndrome in regards to venomous creatures or those that only offer small bites.

Someone slips a spider into his bed and he calmly scoops it up and doesn't even notice as it bites him.

He gets stabbed during the second task and accidentally poisons the three merpeople.

Voldemort uses crucio and he takes the oppertunity to catch his breath as the spell fails. (who knew Basilisk Venon coursing through your veins hurt more than a spell to cause pure agony.)

Umbridge uses the blood quill and he just stares at her with a grin as he writes all the lines she wants.

When she finally uses the Torture Curse he takes it and slugs her across the jaw.

Snape also finds Harry able to concentrate amazingly even under bombardment of Legilimency and recovers quickly as he is able to ignore the painful headaches that come after.

Harry even actually manages to kill Nagini by letting the snake bite him. His toxic blood took quick care of the beastie.

** Ooh I like this prompt.

"I don't understand! " *Umbridge said after a 5th night of detention that should be causing untold pain as the words 'I must not tell lies' were etched in the skin of the student before her. Every night it had been like this, Harry Potter would come in, write in lines and then leave when they were done. At first she thought he had just very strong Ocoullmancy shields to keep the pain from showing. However this night, their 6th, instead of being her pawn and doing anything to end the pain, he had thanked her for the time to further his studies looked relieved! The pink woman looked down at the student in front of her who looked almost shocked at her outburst.

#+begin_example
    Harry pushed his glasses up as he stared shocked at the woman. *they..they really hadn't?....* 
#+end_example

"I haven't been able to feel anything since Second year" /harry pointed out as he watched Umbridge turn a shade of red that Vernon would have been proud of. He quickly continued/ "and I thought you were told. That it was Dumbledore's way of protecting the school. Having a member of the Order here to 'punish'' those found violating Ministry rules..when really you just give them uninterrupted time to study..I really thought they would have told you. " /he shook his head/ "regardless the extra time was very nice" /he said sincerely as Umbridge seemed to be considering him./Harry was used to people planning things without consulting him.so he could sympathize with her as he waited for the shock to wear off.

** As cool of an idea of this is, and it is cool, I don't think he should be taunting someone like Umbrigde with “do your worse!” She is an incredibly petty individual and punishment/revenge by proxy is something she'd probably do. Other than that it's a very interesting idea.

Certainly not, as properly it's "Do your /worst/," not worse.

** I like the idea of him not telling her that just to have the pleasure of tricking Umbridge for hours. He'd put on an act in her office and then laugh about it with Ron and Hermione later.

** So, kinda like Deadpool? The venom is constantly trying to kill him and the phoenix tears are regenerating his cells - a continuous process.

Makes you wonder what would be the result of a mixture of basilisk and phoenix abilities be? What if Harry loses his magic (wand cores not working anymore) but gains abilities like wizarding world's answer to X-Men.
