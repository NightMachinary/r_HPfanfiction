If that's the case, then this option is functionally identical to magic not existing at all. If magic has no influence on the broader world then it is equivalent to the toothfairy, santa claus, etc. If its effects can't be measured or proven, then it might as well not exist, for all the (nonexistent) utility it provides.

Functionally, you have given us a choice between the Harry Potter books existing vs. the Harry Potter books not existing. I'd choose the former.

** Honestly, so much more would happen if it did exist. Like if you think about the muggles in any of the Harry Potter books they all have something happen in the muggle world where you know that magic is real and even Jacob in fantastic beasts. If magic was real, you would feel it even if you didn't know it existed.

**** Ah, I see.

I don't like the idea of an entire society of super powered beings that have access to incredible things but keep it hidden. I don't like the idea of being helpless against them, particularly when ones who hate muggles exist. Also, Dementors exist, which means there's a small possibility that I could be minding my own business and have my soul devoured.

However! The Dementor thing makes me realize that if the magical world exists as portrayed by the Harry Potter series, that means souls and the after-life exist. I don't believe they do in real life. So the only choice for me is the second option.

** IMO the wizarding world seems like a terrible place to live, whether you're magical or a muggle. It's dangerous, there is a horrible lack of balance of power (I always think about how easy it would be for a wizard to rob/murder/rape muggles) and there would be a ton of oppressed creatures that I didn't know about. Not worth it, even if I did get to experience magic. Harry Potter is an amazing fantasy world, but I think it's probably a terrible real one.
