Ideally, I'm looking for something sort of like a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and am NOT looking for one of the dozens of fics where Harry is the great great great great grandson of Merlin or whoever and instantly becomes the leader of the Wizengamot. I would be amenable to reading a fic where he is changing Wizarding Britain, but I'd prefer something like he's creating a new society; where Wizarding Britian is all but destroyed and there are few left to rebuild or he travels somewhere new and encounters another group that he helps rule.

I've read two that are sort of like this, but the more detailed work regarding building and expanding plays second banana to action and drama.

- linkffn(11132113) In this, Harry travels to Westeros and rules some Free Folk, I think it's rather good, and is basically exactly what I'm looking for.

- linkffn(10912355) Which is a crossover with Star Wars that was rather decent. But most of the building a society is thrown by the wayside.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

** Mm...I don't have anything to recommend, but you made me wonder; are there any fics where Harry goes back in time and helps a historical civilization to grow in the first place? Setting Right What Once Went Wrong?

Like, what if he was sent back in time to some prehistoric place, like ancient Mesopotamia, and ended up with the responsibility of using alchemy to create farmable crops, or making sure so-and-so invention is invented, or halting a plague before it wipes out the first civilization?

** This kind of reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10177155/1/Tricksters-and-Gods][Tricksters and Gods]] by sakurademonalchemist. It's different in the way that it involves an MCU crossover where Harry was Loki in his past life (?). Essentially, Harry gained Loki's ability of Silvertongue and became a lawyer (as amusing as it sounds). Using the ability to find loop holes in politics, he brought the magical world forward. The fic really is a fascinating read in my opinion.
