So in this fanfic Hermione and Snape were married but only they and Dumbledore knew. Hermione believes he died and tries to move on with Ron but decides she can't. She's then magically taken to Snape and she sees he is alive and they reveal that they have real feelings for each other. They attend an awards ceremony and everyone is shocked to see he is alive.


** Don't know about this one, but there is a FANTASTIC fic on AO3 by Lariope called "Second Life" where Dumbledore and Moody marry Hermione to Snape as a matter of OotP business. I can't stress how good and genuine of a read it was. The characters were so convincing that I heard their dialogue in the voices I imagined when I was reading the books as a kid.
