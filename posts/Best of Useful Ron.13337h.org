Love him or hate him, Ron is a really well-developed character. Unfortunately, his roles in the books are fairly limited. He's the insight into normal wizarding life, he's the plucky comic relief, he's Hermione's FOIL and love interest, he's Harry best friend... but that's about it.

I'm looking for some good fics that feature Ron as a stronger, more significant presence in the trio.

I'd rather not read slash, but I'm open to it if it's really /really/ flipping good.

Suggestions?


** I always felt like Rowling really cut Ron short in the 7th book. His strengths are supposed to be his loyalty and being good at chess, i.e. strategy. So of course he contributes neither to the Horcrux hunt. I, too, would love to read a story with a kickass Ron.

** I've always wanted to read something set between DH, and the Epilogue, where Harry and Ron are both badass aurors, hunting down the last of Riddle's followers. Don't know if anything like that exists though..?

** This is a story I finished earlier this year. I found Ron intimidating as hell to write in the beginning because I was trying so hard to keep him out of the Second Banana Zone, but it got easier as time went on. There are a few scenes near the end that are all about him.

** This is an older fic, and fairly well known i think, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Always and Always]] has a pretty strong Ron in it i believe, although he still takes a backseat to Harry and Ginny when they come back to fix the past.

*** I suspect most peeps in the fandom have already read the Backwards with Purpose series.
