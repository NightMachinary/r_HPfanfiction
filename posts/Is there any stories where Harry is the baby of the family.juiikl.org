:END:
Can anyone help me find a Harry Potter fanfic where Harry is the youngest and is the baby of the family where everyone is protective of him and I would prefer if he had brothers rather than sister also if it's possible if Harry is innocent


** Are you looking for Harry specifically raised by the Potters or would it count if Harry was adopted into a family like the Weasleys when young?

Lily and James had Harry at 20, so given their young ages, you might not find many fics where Harry has an older biological sibling who is much older, let alone multiple older siblings. Your best bet, if you want a Potter family fic, is to look through WBWL (wrong boy who lived) fics. You can search for them on this subreddit or look at the "WBWL" tag on ao3. The trope is that Harry has a twin (or, less frequently, an older/younger sibling) who is believed to be the boy who lived, usually given that title by mistake. In some of these types of fics, Lily and James are bashed and/or Harry is the older/protective sibling, which is not what you're asking for, so you'd have to sort through them. If you're okay with Harry having a twin, maybe other users know of a fic where Harry is the younger, more innocent brother. Most I know make Harry's brother the naive/more innocent one.

*** It doesn't really matter if he was raised by the potters or adopted just any fan fiction where Harry is the youngest and is innocent
