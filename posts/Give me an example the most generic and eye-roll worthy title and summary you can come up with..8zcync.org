It has to be so bad that you instinctively know it's going to be shit from just glancing at the title and summary. Let's say you're scrolling through dozens and dozens of fics, and then one gloriously cringy one stands out. What would it look like from your own opinions and tastes?

Edit: Did I flair this right?


** *Green eyes, dark heart*

Summary: Nothing is as it seems to be: Can a moody potions professor with a heart of gold help Harry? What are the Malfoys really up to? Severitus, MoD!Harry, Dumbledore bashing. Story is better than summary. Read and review.

Characters: Harry P., Severus Snape, <Hermione G., Draco M.>

There's a bunch of great stories, and I still gravitate to the trainwrecks. I think part of the problem is that I tend to read a lot of stories at the same time, like I have 15 stories opened in tabs right now, and two pinboard tabs, actively reading 4 of them.

I don't get stuff like this. I'm totally willing to suspend my disbelief if the author just gives me the tiniest glimmer of hope that there's some reason to the madness. I just wanted to flip my table when Harry just proposed out of the blue and Hermione accepted. It immediately made me imagine the real Hermione stepping from backstage and saying something like: "Honey, that's very sweet of you, but a) I don't want to get married at 18 b) we've just been a couple for a few hours c) we didn't even have our first fight as a couple. This is a bad idea right now. Lets talk about this in a few years okay?"

But I clearly don't know any better and continue to start stories with cliche summaries just to be less than surprised when they do their eventual [[https://youtu.be/Xyy2T1WyAqI?t=24][bellyflop]].

Harry Potter doesn't come to Hogwarts because he has been missing for eleven years and no one knew it. What happens when a crazed headmaster tries to cover this fact up. Harry is secondary to Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape in this story. Plus you get a small taste of the of the Labyrinth's goblin king. Not enough to be a crossover, but an appetizer.

In regards to "They're only 30 years apart" apparently Megan attends Hogwarts at 6 and is in love with a 36 year old Snape. Do people not bother to look up characters ages before they write things? my god.
