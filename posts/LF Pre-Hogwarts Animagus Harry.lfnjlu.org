Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13017336/2/Instinctive-Behaviour][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13017336/1/Instinctive-Behaviour]] or Quoth The Raven. No Harry turns into a dragon, I've read enough of those.

No Riddle/Harry pairing of any sort, thank you.


** Well, "the Accidental Animagus" on fanfiction.net is something of a classic.

** The Accidental Animagus has him become an Animagus at age 5, running away from the Dursleys. Fair warning for 11-year-old politicians tropes, but it's still a well-written story even with that. While Harry's more powerful than in canon, he's by far not the only person to have been level-grinding.

There's other fics that use roughly the same premise - Growing Up Kneazle, for example, has him run away as a kneazle and end up at the Weasleys. I think there's an unfinished "sequel" on SIYE.

Parsel has him turn into a snake when he's left on the Dursleys' doorstep. I won't link it because of some uncomfortable discussion on female anatomy late in where the author left the fic.

I will also take the opportunity to plug my own story, Flying Free. It's early stages (as in, he just got into Hogwarts), but Harry becomes a snowy owl animagus as a toddler, due to what happens on Halloween. I'll mostly be focusing on slice-of-life, with Voldemort being permanently gone as part of the premise.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Severus Snape, repaying his Life Debt, gives James and Lily Potter forewarning before going into exile, leading to Voldemort's permanent death and their survival. How will Harry Potter's life be with parents who love him, and without a prophecy hanging over his head?
