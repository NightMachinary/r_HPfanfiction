I just started reading linkffn(7584519) where in there's a marriage law and Snape doses Hermione with a sleeping potion and then sleeps with her. The author doesn't seem to understand that this is rape. It's stories like these that put a negative light on the pairing. Regardless of how you feel about a particular pairing or character, there are always fics better than the rest. What fics have you come across that ruin the fandom and feed negative stereotypes?

*TL;DR* share fics that you've seen that perpetuate stereotypes against your chosen pairing/character


** A lot of canon-pairings and Harry/Hermione shit on each other and the authors try to prove how wrong the other alternative would be. IMO if you want to show how good two characters would be together, you should show exactly that rather than trying to make some strawman argument about the wrongness of an alternative. Often, it is not even thinly veiled.

**** The way Harmony shippers bash Ron and popularized Ron the Death Eater and the whole Ginny has been dosing Harry with love potions thing really infuriates me. I used to be pretty onboard with Harmony but I feel like their nastier fans have chilled me towards the ship.

**** From what I've seen, it's about 50/50. Some are truly nasty in regards of their almost missionary disdain for Hermione, the others are true to canon in regards to their friendship.

I like both, but I find Harry/Ginny difficult to enjoy because it almost inevitability comes with Ron/Hermione, and that's not a pairing I see lasting longer than a weekend. Especially since a lot of the fics I've read had a dynamic very focused on their fights as some twisted, misguided expression of love inspired by RomComs rather than real life. Which is a shame because there are almost no fics with Harry/Ginny, a strong friendship with Hermione yet her not fucking any Weasley (or even worse, Death Eater).

** In some sense, any 'shipping-centred fic that rewrites one or both partners' personality from scratch is an argument /against/ the 'ship. For example,

- /Harry Crow/: Harry and Hermione could be a lovely couple... if Harry were raised by goblins.
- /What We're Fighting For/: Harry and Hermione could get together... if Harry were an emotionally stunted killing machine with a heart of gold and Hermione were isolated and helpless.
- /Unsung Hero/: Harry and Hermione could happen... if Harry were much more hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and level-headed.
- Majority of Dramione fics: Draco and Hermione could fall in love... if Draco were suave and steadfast and Hermione were a flighty ingenue with no personality or values.
- Majority of Haphne fics: Harry and Daphne could be a real power-couple... if Daphne were a smart, cunning, skilled pureblood who is proudly neutral about Voldemort (as if it were a good thing) all is about Pureblood Culture and Traditions but is not at all prejudiced against Muggleborns.

** I don't think Drarry, Dramione, Snarry etc. can ever work. Either it's a complete crack or one or both party's personality is drastically changed to the extent that they're basically an OC.

Any time the author is writing :why the other ship is bad" instead of writing "why this ship is good".

  Hermione/Snape will sparks fly or just angry words, how can Hermione learn to live with someone who tells her he CAN never love her? Marriage law fic that skips the wedding bit! Give it a go you might be happy you did :
