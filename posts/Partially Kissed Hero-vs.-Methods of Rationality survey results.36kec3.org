[[http://i.imgur.com/JFuhB6K.png][Image 1]]: Includes all absolute probabilities--e.g., "4.21% of respondents /both/ dislike PKH /and/ like MoR."

[[http://i.imgur.com/ef43Ig4.png][Image 2]]: Includes both /absolute/ and /relative/ probabilities--e.g., "27% of respondents who dislike PKH like MoR. This is an /increase/ of 58% over the proportion of /all/ respondents who like MoR." (The point of this part is to raise questions like "Are people who dislike PKH more inclined to like MoR, or vice versa?"; I don't remember enough statistics to do any Ï‡^{2} analyses, though. Obviously, self-selection introduces bias anyway, etc., etc.)

My own response to the survey: I've read both of them, and I love them. :-D


** I wonder if there is a set of fanfics that you could use to group fan fiction readers by their likes and dislikes. People who liked A B and C will also like D, but /not/ E or F...

And then... Fanfiction Pandora.

*** FimFiction.net actually has a built-in recommendation engine that does something like that--"People who liked this story also liked these stories." It's pretty on-point.

***** The downside is that fimfiction.net is a single-fandom site; namely My Little Pony.

****** ... I never even noticed that you typed fim not fan. I've been clicking on all the various buttons on FANfiction.net trying to find this mythic fic recommender

****** Knighty is apparently working on configuring its backend for eventual multifandom support, though. It's not a thing which is going to happen soon, but whenever it does happen, I'm hoping it does a good job at grabbing users from other fandoms; speaking as a reader, it's the best fanfiction site I've seen by a /huge/ margin.

** I will say I was disappointed there wasn't a "never heard of it" option.

*** I was under the impression that /Partially Kissed Hero/, as the third-most-reviewed /Harry Potter/ story on FanFiction.net, was on par with /Methods of Rationality/ (first-most-reviewed) and /Harry Crow/ (second-most-reviewed) as one of the stories that /everyone/ has heard of--especially since FanFiction.net now allows users to sort stories by number of reviews and number of favorites.

**** I just got back into fanfiction a few months ago, reading and writing, since I'm trying to save money by not buying books on my kindle. Can honestly say I've seen recs all over the place for HPMOR and this poll is the first I've heard of Partially Kissed Hero. I'll check it out though.

***** If you're looking for free books, don't forget about [[http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top][Project Gutenberg]]! /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][The Three Musketeers]]/ and its sequels are particularly entertaining.

**** I hadn't heard of Partially Kissed Hero for the longest time, namely because it hadn't been updated in so long, and I don't bother to read dead/abandoned/hiatus stories. Only learned about it due to reading its TV tropes page.
