#+begin_quote
  The Fates of the MCU have written for Harry Potter to die during a failed Obscurial Transformation. A drunken conversation between the heads of the Marvel verse has changed that and Harry has ended up with Gamer powers among other things. Watch Harry go through Hogwarts, Kamar-Taj, and Xavier's institute as he learns to use his powers and level up. Contains a Flerken. Harem by Arc3

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
