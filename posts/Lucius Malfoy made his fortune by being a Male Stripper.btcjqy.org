No slash, but Lucius being a male stripper for rich widows, and rich woman's Hen Nights, under the name Luscious Malfoy (as it's the common misspelling) he ends up absolutely loaded. Extra fun is Harry and or Sirius finding out, and using it to blackmail them to turn double agent on Voldemort.


** How does Sirius find out about Malfoy being a male stripper? Because he himself is one, Dog Star Raw.

** This reminds me of a fic I wrote about one of Remus's short-lived odd jobs. It's too dark to link under this light-hearted prompt, though.
