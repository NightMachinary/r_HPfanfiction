I really want to know how the series could have been different if this happened.

There's a lot of interesting stuff that could be done with the series if harry went to durmstrang. We'd learn more about igor draco might have went their and more aspects of magic can be explored

So is their a story like this preferably long ones? I don't get or see the point in writing one shots or really short stories but that is just me


** Like the OP, I have always been interested in Harry to Durmstrang stories, but even more so I have always been interested in stories where Harry goes to Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts.

So without full on hijacking the thread, if anyone wants to toss a few my way ;)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Linkffn(si vis pacem para bellum) assuming I spelled that right, I found this to be a really interesting fic. It's still work in progress but it really explores the characters of the black family and covers durmstrang as being where the first several years take place. It's not super detailed and get to the triwizard fairly quickly but the durmstrang section is very fleshed out for the time they spend there. It focuses on quidditch, dueling, and character development/relationships. I strongly recommend it even though it's been awhile since the last update, I am confident the story is still going.
