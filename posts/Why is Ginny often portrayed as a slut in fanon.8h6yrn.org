** I'd guess partially because of how blas√© she was about going through her boyfriends at the end of... OotP? I think? I personally have always felt slightly uncomfortable when people talk like that. It's just completely the opposite of how I view relationships. Not to mention how short the relationships were if I'm recalling correctly.

Hermione is probably considered a prude because she's kind of uptight.

** Because Ginny is canonically known to have had several boyfriends before Harry - Dean Thomas, Michael Corner - and some authors take that to its logical extreme. We know she was fairly popular, including with boys.

Hermione on the other hand...we know she had /some/ kind of close relationship with Viktor Krum, but we don't know exactly what that was. Close friendship? First kiss? We can guess, but we don't know. In fact, we don't see her dating or showing much overt interest in boys at all (there's the disastrous date with Cormac McClaggan, but that was more to infuriate Ron than because she genuinely liked Cormac) so some authors assume she mustn't have had any.

** Because Ginny dated two boys before Harry. For some assholes, that's enough to label her a slut - hell, I've had readers call a girl "ruined" for sleeping with her first boyfriend instead of "saving herself" for Harry.

Hermione might be portrayed as a prude because the same assholes think that a "good rules-abiding girl" would never have sex before marriage or what - completely missing the point that she's a British muggleborn, not some religious fundamentalist.
