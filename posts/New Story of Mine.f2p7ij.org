** Alright, while this is interesting, there isn't really an actual conflict in the story yet, so I'm not really sure where you're taking it.

** This isn't written awfully. Compared to the majority of fics it's quite good. You'll probably get a good number of favs/follows. That being said I wouldn't read on past the first chapter. Here is why:

The first bit made me feel like I was drowning with how deep it was before I remembered I was actually in a paddling pool. I find your diction off-putting and generically flowery. It's trying too hard. I'm not in any way hooked, with 800,000 other HP fanfics to read I'm already in position to close the tab. You need to think about what you're trying to achieve. The last bit of the chapter suffers from the same problem. It doesn't fit, the tone feels off and you've fallen afoul of the mysterious/confusing line, you're leaving a trail of honking great giant breadcrumbs but I don't want to follow them.

Ron uses the word 'ruckus,' I knew the characterisation would be questionable with the pairing but I reckon Draco Malfoy would want to spend Christmas with the Dursleys before Ron would use ruckus. The summary says continues from 4th year, if this was an AU I'd accept this and say, maybe this is a different Ron to what I know and I might read on to find out, but the summary suggests this should be canon Ron at this point.

You have a few grammar issues but I'm not going to pick at them. They exist you probably know that. They're off-putting if I'm looking for a reason to dislike the fic but personally they don't bother me too much, at the moment they aren't making the fic hard to read which is when they become a problem.

I skimmed the second chapter because work is dull but normally I would have closed this fic halfway through the first chapter. I don't really see where this is going. I don't care either which is far more damming. You've used 9,000 words. That's quite a lot and so far all I really can tell is you're not a fan of Ron and your Harry wants to bone Hermione out of the blue.

I'm curious - what would you say is more fitting for Ron than 'ruckus', to the point where it seems to be a deal breaker?

**** Noise or fuss. Ron hasn't swallowed the thesaurus, he tears pages out to make paper airplanes. Percy might say ruckus but if Ron was more like Percy then Harry wouldn't be whinging about Ron being a prefect.

***** I guess I can see that, but I don't know if it's that huge a deal - it does strike me as less stuffy than some more thesaurus like ones (commotion, brouhaha, etc). It might be more american than most brits use though (only one in the books to use ruckus is Fudge apparently)

Edit - then again, I am less sensitive about such changes.
