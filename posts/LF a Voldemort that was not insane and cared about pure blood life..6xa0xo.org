Basically a Voldemort that did not torture his followers for the smallest slight but was a good leader. A Voldemort that cared about pure bloods and actively tried not to kill them. Even his enemies.


** I'm not sure you can be called a good leader if you torture your followers for the smallest slight.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) An AU where he won the first war and is a good leader. He is still a psychopath and makes morally questionnable decisions, but otherwise people under him are mostly happy and the society that he built functions pretty well.
