I was introduced to Harry Potter through the movies, so when I began reading the books, I imagined things as I saw them on screen.

Then, I got into a fanfiction story from 2001 where the writing style was so different that the imagery subconsciously changed for me completely. I've been reading fanfics ever since, and all the settings from then on were as I pictured from that first fic I read.

Today, I decided to reread Goblet of Fire (where most fics start to deviate from canon) to refresh my mind on what actually happened. It was then when I suddenly found myself picturing everything in my head as they looked in the movies. It was so shocking how differently I pictured canon Hogwarts and fic Hogwarts.

For example:

Canon Fat Lady: has stairs going down on both sides, surrounded by other moving paintings. Fic Fat Lady: One big empty dark red hallway with a painting as the entrance.

Canon Great Hall: big room with four long table rows for the four houses. beautiful enchanted ceiling. Fic Great Hall: same but no enchanted ceiling. it's like everyone forgot about them.

Canon Diagon Alley: crowded, very diagony and very alleyiyee Fic Diagon Alley: hogsmeade???

Does this happen to anyone else? If so, what are some things you see differently between canon and fic writings?


** I tend to picture Harry much skinnier, being curly haired but not the overly messy hair that he's described with, and the stereotypical “aristocratic face featured” Harry. Dark!Harry is a guilty pleasure of mine, and that's how he's described in literally every single one. So I have to adjust my picture of him for every fic I read that's closer to cannon. I also tend to minimize the appearance of his scar for some reason. If it's funny or a crack-fic, my brain gives Harry the messiest fucking hair you can ever imagine.

*** Oh yeah. And for me, canon Hermione looks like Emma Watson but fic Hermione is short and actually has bushy hair.

** Sometimes I like to imagine the younger characters like they're being played by noticeably old actors that look nothing like the characters are supposed to, like some 90s/early 2000s movie or show.

I'm watching Smallville right now, and Old ass Tom Welling was supposed to be like 15 during the start of the show when he was like fucking 25. He also played it like a bumbling, shy nerd even though he looked like Chad Thundercock from the start. So that's how I've been imagining characters recently, Harry and Ron are big and manly at the age of 11, Hermione is straight out of a modelling agency, etc.

** The arrangement of tables in the Great Hall always bothered me. Not sure if it's canon or fanon, but I always pictured the tables, from left to right facing the head table: Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor. In the movies (or, at least, several of them), Gryffindor and Slytherin are in the middle - Draco sits close enough to Harry to taunt him, rather than having to walk across the great hall to do it.

It's the tiniest damn detail, but it really grinds my gears.

What you describe as a movie set is IMHO certainly wrong. Slytherin and Gryffindor are certainly always by the walls, and I think it is Hufflepuf next to Slytherin and Ravenclaw next to Gryffindor (so that Paravati and Padma can sit just back to back).

**** I have in my head Draco taunting Harry about the dementors, and their tables are adjacent. PoA, I assume. That's the image in my head, at any rate, when I think about the movie arrangement.

** I picture things as they are in canon, i.e. not how they are in the movies.

So for example I picture McGonagall with black hair, not grey.

** Writing style influences how I view things.

Everything from Starfox5 is kind of washed out colorwise, Hermione's taller than she usually is in my head, regardless of how he actually describes their clothes I kind of have everyone in suits (unless it's specifically scenes where they're in camo, I can keep that straight)

I read Sword of Gryffindor, which is smut, but I imagine everyone as kind of chibi versions of themselves, so the sex is purely funny and not titillating at all.

People interpret Luna really differently from each other, and her eyes change in size in proportion to how loony she is. She's basically a lemur in some fics.

** I don't consider movies canon, just adaptation of the canon. When I read, books or fics, I picture only some of the movie settings and none of the actors. What I picture is usually the same for fics and canon, unless the fic specifically changes something.

** I do that a little with characters, but they are basically the same. For example, I read the books after the movie and I saw Hermione as Emma Watson. When I read fanfiction she's a little bit shorter, slightly tanner and with bushier hair. Draco Malfoy in books likes like Tom, but fanfic Draco is taller and has sexier hair.

I also have a bit of a problem ageing them as they go along. I forget that their actually growing up and HBP Hermione ends up looking like PS Hermione. It's actually a bit annoying.
