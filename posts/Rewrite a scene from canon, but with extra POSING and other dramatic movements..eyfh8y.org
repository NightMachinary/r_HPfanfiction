Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking a roll call, one foot up on his desk and a finger pointed towards the ceiling, spinning as he declared the student's names one by one, as though trying to invoke a storm.

Like Flitwick, Snape froze when he got to Harry's name, before spinning around and pointing at the scar-headed boy in the front row.\\
"Ahh, yessssss..." he hissed out, "Harry Potter. Our new-" Snape turned and bent his legs, spreading his arms as though to present Harry to the whole class, ".../celebrity/."

Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle mimed big belly laughs, Draco going a step further and reclining over his desk, sprawling as though he had been killed by the Funniest Joke in the World.\\
Snape finished calling the names, ending at 'Blaise Zabini' before flinging the scroll full of names over his shoulder and crossing his arms.\\
"You are here to learn, the subtle science," Snape began, uncrossing his arms and putting a finger to his forehead, "...and exact art, of potionmaking."\\
His voice was quiet and silky, but the class was silent and caught every word, Hermione Granger leaning forward on her shoulder on her desk with her eyes frozen wide open.\\
"As there is little foolish wand-waving here..." Snape continued, wiggling his finger in a mocking way, "...many of you will hardly believe this is magic."\\
The finger touching Snape's forehead unfolded into a facepalm as Snape leaned ridiculously far backwards, supporting himself against his desk, "I don't expect you will /really/ understand, the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes..."\\
The Potions professor's legs straightened, pushing him up to sit on the edge of his desk, "...that delicate power of liquids, that /creep/ through human veins..." he reclined backwards, lying across the desk with his upside down gaze fixed on the students, "...bewitching the mind...ensnaring the senses..."\\
Snape shut his eyes and sat up again, sliding off the desk and striding to the front of the classroom, facing away from the students with his arms spread wide, as though entreating the heavens.\\
"I can teach you. How to bottle fame. Brew glory." One of his raised hands clenched into a fist, "And even stopper death."

Snape suddenly spun around, his cloak swirling, dropping one arm to cross it in front of his chest, with the other arm remaining outstretched, "/If/...you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I /usually/ have to teach."


** This somehow feels like an anime scene, with snape pushing glasses up his nose and then they glint. I imagine the dramatic posing with the anime style animation. I don't know... Well done haha

** I definitely couldn't read a whole fic, but if it was just one character's schtick, I think I would be behind it 100%.

Like, exposition for most characters is done the a normal way, but Snape ALWAYS is described down to the gesture.

Or, building on that idea, a version of the story where each scene is told from the perspective of the characters involved--together with the wild inaccuracies and flourishes that they would relate.

PS. This is my wife's reasoning behind the ridiculous action sequences in The Hobbit movies (escape from the goblin caves, in particular)--they take place when Bilbo isn't around to witness, so he only was able to record them from the Dwarves' exaggerated retelling.

** Beautiful. 10/10, would read again.

Seriously though, this would work great for a crack fic, as long as the writer doesn't cover /every/ single canon scene--that'd get old and sloggy pretty quick. I'd also recommend diverging from canon at some point or even not sticking to a single cohesive continuity, just to maintain variety and freshness.
