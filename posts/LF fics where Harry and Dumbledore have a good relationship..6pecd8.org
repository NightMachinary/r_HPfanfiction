I'm sick of reading all these fics where Harry and Dumbledore hate each other and Dumbledore has controlled Harry's entire life. What are some well written fics where Harry and Dumbledore have a positive relationship, be that apprentice and teacher, student and grandfather figure, or simply friends.


** Magicks of the Arcane has a pretty nice Teacher/Student relationship, its generally pretty well written linkffn(8303194) Does have an edgy harry towards the beginning but this mellows out soon enough.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) Very nice read.

In linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth), their relationship is a bit complicated, and at points Harry did resent Dumbledore's interfering, but near the latest chapters they've reached an understanding and became co-conspirators of sorts. I think it's an awesome take on them.
