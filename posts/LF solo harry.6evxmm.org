** I think op means either an indy!harry or a fic with no romance. Bit since they clarify no slash, they're probably just talking about indyharry. A rough translation:

Hi there. I am looking for independent Harry fanfiction. I don't want it to deviate too far from Canon aside from Harry being independent. No slash, harem, genderbending, etc. Good day.

It's either that or they're talking about Harry being related to Han Solo.
