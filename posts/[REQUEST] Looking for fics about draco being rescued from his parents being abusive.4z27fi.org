I saw a drabble on tumblr and realized that I haven't seen any fics about it myself.


** I seem to remember that being a minor element early on in the Dangerverse series. linkffn(2109424) It has been a while since I've read it though...

**** It's relatively competently written but it's ridiculously AU in almost all aspects, introduced a few now common clich√©s, and is overall extremely fluffy. There's scenes described in detail that consist of people singing lullabies. Also, Purebloods talk like networking protocols.

**** There are a few complete stories in the Dangerverse series, and some extra side pieces. I remember enjoying the first one or two very thoroughly, but it has been a while so I don't remember much of the details.

** snapegirlkmf's Prince Manor series has that. The first book is linkffn(The Heir to Prince Manor)

It's not /great/, and some of her stuff is pretty wish fulfillmenty, but the good outweighs the bad. I should also mention that it's "severitus".

*** I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the severitus warning - I can stand it if the writing is good, but it is typically a black mark for me.
