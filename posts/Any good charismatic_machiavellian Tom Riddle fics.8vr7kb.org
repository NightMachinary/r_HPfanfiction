Before Voldemort gained the notoriety as the darkest wizard of his times, he was often regarded as extremely charming and intelligent. In the main canon there are such accounts from professors, ghosts and former classmates. However most fics depict Tom Riddle as being the darkest wizard tyrant dictator Hitler from the moment he steps into Hogwarts and everybody seems to want to follow him despite him being an orphan with a shady background (remember that it took him some years to even figure out that his magic came from his mother's side).

I remember there was a pretty good fic (forgot the name), where he seduces a professor who is married to the Muggle-born head of the Law Enforcement Department. He then uses this to blackmail the couple to disappear from the public life. I particularly enjoyed it because it portrayed Tom's lust for power and domination of others and achieving it without him having to resort to violence or extremely dark magic, but by using his wit and charm. This is pretty consistent with how Rowling described him in his early days.

Therefore I was wondering if you knew any similar stories. Thanks in advance.


** Linkffn(Hypocrisy by Sachita) I always recommend this fic whenever someone wants a Tom Riddle story. Definitely a great 'origin story'. He's charismatic, intelligent, studious, and his growth to power and darkness is very realistic. The only downside (which I personally didn't mind) is that there's a Tom/Minerva McGonagall pairing. However, for most of the story it's more of a friendship than romance. And Tom still remains in character throughout. Minerva definitely has a lot of internal battles about him, loving and fearing him at the same time. It's really well done I think.

Oh and it's not complete...but still worth the read.

**** He becomes darker and darker as the story progresses (it goes through years 1-7 at Hogwarts and beyond). Unfortunately the story is incomplete, but the author updated last year after a couple years away from it. So, I wouldn't say it's completely abandoned. But what I love about Tom's depiction is that his beliefs are developed logically. So he's not just some crazy evil guy killing people left and right. He's very rational and very pragmatic. You can almost understand and sympathize with him. That's where the Tom/Minerva pairing really helps. It provides an interesting perspective.

** The ultimate charismatic Tom Riddle:

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): /I/ would follow this Voldemort. And I hate the Death Eaters.

Good runners-up:

linkffn(Patron): Voldemort was more than up to the task of trying to topple Britain. Really the only reason he lost was that the people he was fighting were just that good too. Hell, he got werewolves from Norway to fight for him.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): Tom Riddle the Diary here (so far), his plans actually make a lot of sense, and as Harry says "Riddle has a multi-layered strategy with lots of possible goals to shoot for. And he adapts quickly to changing circumstances."

**** Voldemort really is Machiavellan in here. See the thing is, none of the muggleborns are dead.

When Voldemort took over, he set up a new system regarding muggleborn and muggle-raised kids (its sort of like Lucius's plan in The Dark Lord Never Died): immediately remove them upon identification and mind wipe the family. Voldemort's plan is to force segregation from muggle society, and so he forced the purebloods to accept the new system. Spoiler: Hermione was raised by the /Malfoy family/, and Draco is very protective of her.

Hermione is probably Harry's oldest friend, though several other people are of nearly equal importance. The key to this story is Harry's apprenticeship (of sorts) to Voldemort.

********* Yeah you're right there isn't a lot of Harry-centric Hermione free fic, which is a same. Here's a small list of fic I enjoyed:

Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise: linkffn(10267302) which is very good but has (imo) a rushed ending.

Rise of the Wizards: linkffn(6254783). Easily one of my favourite fic.

Midnight Gold, the rise of the forgotten Lord: linkffn(7694530). Sadly abandonned but still enjoyable.

Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven (plus sequels): linkffn(11496914)

Paid in Blood: linkffn(9474009) has a difficult start but worth reading it till the end.

They Shook Hands: linkffn(7659033), good, long and has sequels.

Saviour of Magic: linkffn(12484195) has a good start, and look a lot like Rise of the Wizards. Didn't read it till the end so I can judge it completely.

Harry Potter and the Homecoming and sequels: linkffn(12867536) is regulary updated and one of the only fic I'm currenctly reading. Harry has a believable descent into Darkness.

Feel free to add some to this list :)

linkffn(By The Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song) she /was/ Harry's girlfriend, but she died before the story started (I think Sirius killed her actually)

linkffn(Realignment) Harry time-traveled back to kill Tom Riddle in 1943

linkffn(The Mind Arts) Harry definitely is not very close to Hermione (who is sort of bashed in here actually)

linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup) Harry meets her like once in this fic, so she's not important at all.

********* Well to be fair, Harry is a pretty powerful wizard. Aside from the circumstantial powers that elevate him to god level, he is actually naturally skilled for his age in the canon as well:

- He masters a corporeal Patronus by thirteen (which is generally accepted as a very complex spell);

- He is able to cast pretty much most defensive/offensive spells only by seeing them once or reading about them including some of the more complex ones such as Sectumsempra or the unforgivable curses (to put things in perspective, just remember that most of the DA members were taught how to cast the disarming and the stunning spells by Harry, even though he had been using them for quite a while);

- He is the only character explicitly mentioned to resist the Imperius curse;

- He is an excellent Quidditch player

I guess the reason he seems mediocre is because the story is told from his perspective. He has a pretty low self esteem after being bullied for most of his childhood by the Dursleys; and he is also constantly compared with other more powerful and experienced wizards (Voldemort, Dumbledore, the Hogwarts professors).

********** I understand your point. I partly agree, Harry is powerful in canon, though I would argue that he gets a big boost of power from the horcrux inside him, but fanfiction writers tend to ignore that completely. As for the patronus: all members of the DA and therefore about 30% of the wizarding population that age managed to learn how to create a corporal patronus within one year without the help of a teacher... I know the patronus is suppossed to be difficult, but I do not think that being able to do something that almost everyone else who has about the same amount of training is able to do as well is not exactly a proof of brilliance.

About Quidditch, well, I would not say that professional athletes (for example) are known to be clever. It is a skill, yes, but a very specific one that has nothing to do with being intelligent.

But that is all not really why I do not like to read Harry centric fanfictions anymore. The older I get, the less I like him as a character and therefore am annoyed with fanfiction that contain too much Harry. How he is written in canon is incredibly one-dimensional. My MAIN problem with him is that he is not curious. Like literally not curious at all. He can talk to snakes and ignores it completely (like WTF?! you can talk to another SPECIES and you do not explore them?! What the fuck is wrong with you??). He gets to know he's a wizard and is just like "yeah cool, Hogwarts is nice, buying sweets is cool, yeah nice, blah". Hermione's reaction (reading EVERYTHING about this new world) does not really show anything about her character, it is just much more realistic IMHO. He never does anything special with magic, never. He does not ask for theories behind it. He does not develop anything at all.

I still read HP fanfictions because I grew up with the world of HP and still kind of love it, but I do not think that canon is actually good.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  [AU!] After society as we know it collapsed, humanity struggled for survival. Slowly a new society begins to establish. Groups led by lords battle for territory. Young Harry Potter has no interest in joining local politics, but when a new lord with unconventional ideas sees the potential in his unique talents, can Harry remain neutral?

** most fanfics ive read featuring riddle or voldemort as a primary character rather than a figurehead for the evil side have him more good charismatic/machiavellian. Imo his fandom personality emphasizes this more than his canon personality. Thats why I love fanon Tom

*** There have been some great suggestions in this thread but honestly, I never was able to find them. Most of the Voldemort centric fics I came across either portray him as the darkest wizard from day 1 (i.e. no character development at all) or they make him act out of character by falling head over heels over someone (typically someone coming from the future).
