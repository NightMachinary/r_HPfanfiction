We have seen several posts about most hated tropes, so let's switch the gear and move on to what we like/love.

I especially enjoy the following:

- Tougher, more ruthless protagonists than in canon.

- Harry and Co overthrow a still corrupt Ministry after Voldemort's fall.

- Fics involving lots of politics, intrigues, strategies, and wars.

- Time travels NOT using time turners.

- Fics that credibly combine magics and technologies.

- More competent Dumbledore, Ministry and Voldemort. I'm highly displeased with canon versions because I firmly believe they were dumbed down so kids could play heroes.


** Unflappable/Pokerface Harry is one of my favorite things, especially when everything is going insane around him.

Eldritch Master of Death Harry is also extremely entertaining when done convincingly.

Fem!Harry is fun, especially when combined with the above. Love me some badass female leads.

Epic magical duels between hyper-competent opponents are always a treat. I really, /really/ want to see a Transfiguration prodigy Harry trained by both McGonagall /and/ Dumbledore take on various opponents, including crossovers, and win just by sheer versatility. I mean, with even simple knowledge of the periodic table of elements, you can fuck people up /massively/. Or if you don't want to do that, how about floating, circular saw blades? Have fun dodging fifty of those!

I want MOAR magical theory! Different types of magic! Put some thought into it, people! I want druids, and White magic, and primordial elementals, and mythology! Stuff like that!

I've always thought that would be too easy. How would one make it for a fair fight, before our Harry turns into a meat grinder for hapless Death Eaters?

** Thank you for the positive post! It's been really negative around here lately.

I like:

- AU stories that /do not/ run the stations of canon.

- Flawed protagonists (Harry, Hermione, and even Ron).

- Detailed, but easy-to-follow action sequences. (Sorry, I don't have much patience for political fics.)

- Chekhov guns and red herrings!

- Antagonists that have understandable and believable motives, not just caricatures of evil.

- Unique settings. As a clever person on here once said, "If you story starts at Hogwarts, takes place at Hogwarts, and ends at Hogwarts... it's going to be extremely boring."

** - Non-famous Harry, whether as a result of time/dimension traveling or he's not the BWL in the first place.

- Realistic, flawed characters, with believable emotional reactions.

- Use of items, places, magic or people from canon that were shown only in passing.

- Adversity rather than tragedy.

** Well done crossovers are my favorite for the sole reason that the plot is often entirely made by the author. They may sometimes fail, but at least you know that time and effort went into it.

I also like Time Travel fics and Adventure fics will always have a chance with me.

In terms of tone I prefer darker fics where magic doesn't have its PG-13 limiter on.

Also, and please don't hate me overly much for it, my guilty pleasure is a dumb and dirty Lord Potter fic with some bashing on top. I love 'em for the fact that I can go brain-afk while reading them.

** - Canonical Harry-Ron-Hermione dynamic.

- A Harry who is depicted as the best version of his canon self. That is to say, while I like a strong and curious Harry, I don't like a Harry who suddenly becomes studious or a genius. But I will love a fic that focuses on and further develops the traits that allowed Harry to learn the Patronus Charm in third year.

- Canonical magic both in specifics and in general tone.

- Fics where romantic partners have their own independent lives, with their own friends, goals, desires, and preferences.

- Fics where romantic partners break up, and said break-up is not caused by infidelity or a miscommunication or any other grand drama. They simply aren't romantically compatible and after the honeymoon period wore off, they realise it and moved on.

- Mystery adventure plot-lines that are reminiscent of the first three books.

- Non-Voldemort antagonists who have some connection to Voldemort.

- Some kind of mentor relationship for Harry.

- Magical history and politics that feel messy enough to be real. Far too many fics give the Ministry a simple constitution, for example. That doesn't feel real. The Ministry's constitution should be a mess, with a historical event behind each element of it.

- Fics that barely mention Muggles, technology, and Muggle social institutions/norms.

**** I'd identify five positive traits about canon Harry I'd like to see a fic emphasise:

- Learning through doing: through practice and experimentation. Harry can master some very advanced, powerful magic when he learns it in this way. One example is the Patronus charm, another is his apparent mastery of occlumency in DH.

- Learning motivated by necessity. Harry learns best when he needs to know how to do something. He's also motivated to a lesser extent by competitiveness (e.g. against Malfoy)

- Determination. Enough said.

- Curiosity. Harry is curious about things, even if it doesn't manifest in the same way as Hermione's curiosity. But he does like to know things, often sticking his nose where it doesn't belong, and will often go to great investigative lengths to satisfy his curiosity once it's been roused.

- Intuitive deduction. Harry is great in canon at solving mysteries by making intuitive deductive leaps. He's like a mini Sherlock Holmes.

So if you want to write a strong Harry, you don't have to make him suddenly have a character change and become a mini-Dumbledore. Far better to put him in situations that bring out these traits.

** - A badass but not necessarily OP harry or any protagonist

- Fics that feature simply use of magical training/enhancements(i don't want to read 5 long chapters on how runes/blood magic/ritual stones changes so many things)

- Action sequences that are well written yet simply(writing every single detail of a 5 minute engagement is utterly boring)

- M or above rated romance fics of nearly adult teenagers(or sometimes adult couples) that features consistence intimate encounters and not just relying on drama/angst to get the job done.

- AU that doesn't detract too much from canon.

** 1. Motherfucking badass Dumbledore. Like, a true titan of power the way he's supposed to be. Examples, Magicks of the Arcane, The wizard of the Kaleidoscope ("Blaze of Merlin, attend me!" - BAMF)\\
2. Harry wielding the elder wand, POST DH. Not ones where he gets them from Ollivander. Perspicacity has a fantastic one-shot about this.\\
   Also, Hallows and Pathos, fuck yeah evil Hermione is badass.\\
3. Dark, but not evil Harry. Think Cadmean Victory but without the "I do not forgive or forget" moments.\\
4. Insane/Crazy but extremely skilled Harry eg. Whiskey Time Travel\\
5. Very well written manipulative characters, like Sesc's Daphne in Unatoned. Holy shiiiit.\\
6. Well written battle scenes, especially if they involved tranfiguration. Transfiguration-based battling necessitates vivd descriptions of the wielder's thought process as well as their generation/use of their surroundings, and you can literally see transfigured sand flying as glass shards.\\

7.Insanely magically OP characters, like Nicky Flamel in The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope, and in [[/u/Newcomb][u/Newcomb]]'s The Lesser Sadness. I don't think I've ever read 3 chapters so many times in my entire life, I love it. I really wish that were higher on his list than WYLB, but hey, I'll take whatever I can get. Brb reading TLS again.\\
On a related note, if I find a story's description awesome, I'll usually love the story.\\
Circular reasoning for eg. "Desperation is the new anthem of violence".\\
TLS - " Crush the world beneath your heel. Destroy everyone who has ever slighted you. Tear down creation just to see if you can. Kill anything beautiful. Take what you want. Desecrate everything".\\
Something about this desc reads chaos and I love it.

1. Mass intrigue, like Shezza's the Resistance of Azkaban. I loved the Linden Avery character.

2. Stories that aren't simple the average romcom rewritten with Harry Potter characters and the Harry Potter world.

3. Stories where Harry is NOT an auror. Auror's aren't OP as fuark, and I love those - so MoD, unspeakable Harry, etc.

Fuckin [[/u/Averant]] stole all my answers I hate you bro but I also think you're my soul mate. Veela bond me bro.

** - Stories where Harry is powerful enough to alter the world beyond just defeating Voldemort.

- Stories where Harry leans more towards the dark side, but is not evil.

- Stories that are more Mature and do not use kiddy gloves for fear of offending people. (perhaps in this case its more about the author) /more about this below/

- Stories where Romance plays an important role but does not overwhelm the other main parts of the story

- Stories that fall on the border of AU, but do not stray too far to one side or the other

- Stories that change up who Harry is as a person, without overly compromising Canon.

I could go on and on, and to be honest, If its well written I will likely enjoy it in some way.

I think the most important thing for me is just that the author not worry about catering to the masses, and be willing to write about the dirtier side or more mature side of things in stories. If you want to write a Everyone or Teen rated story go right ahead, but no one should be afraid to go Mature or Explicit if the story needs it. I always hate reading stories that could of been so much better if the author let the flow continue instead of handling things with kiddy gloves out of fear or whatever other concern pops up.

There is nothing wrong with a harem story if its well done, or a more bloody story if a darker harry needs to take that route, or a sex scene to be fairly graphic if it fits the style. If you really are having issues, do a censored and non censored version at least.

Also, please for the love of god.... if you cant finish a started story, let someone else take on the challenge if they so wish. Nothing saddens me more then epic stories that die off too early because of an Author who cant finish it for whatever reason. I know its "yours", but its also the "readers" in a sense.

** I don't feel like there are many good ones...or if there are, I haven't found them...but I like pre-Hogwarts AUs. I feel like the younger Harry's class is, the more susceptible they are to change, so if you want, say, Ron and Draco to be BFFs, it makes a lot more sense to throw them together as five-year-olds, when their attitudes and understanding aren't solid yet. Likewise, I've always thought mentor Snape made more sense when he and Harry meet when Harry's an adorable toddler. Still doesn't make Snape in-character, but it makes it easier to swallow than 'and in fifth year, they stopped hating each other and decided to be BFFs.'

I also enjoy fics where Harry applies himself after first year and finding out about the danger he's still in. 'Forging the Sword' is the best, of course.
