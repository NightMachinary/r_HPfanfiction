****** It was Fleamont, from the maiden name of his mother, and his father's name before that was Henry, known as Harry. It seems clear that while some pureblood families pick archaic names, many do not, and Fleamont was an outlier who hated his name. The Weasleys, for example, have more traditional names, but certainly not odd, and they are also pureblood. Neville is pureblood, and his family have normal names too.

Rather than pureblood, I'd argue that the point is to make him sound more Slytherin and angst-ridden, which can be easily done without falling into the trope of his name randomly changing.

****** Vincent Crabbe, Greg Goyle, Theodore Nott, Frank Longbottom, Neville Longbottom, James Potter, Ernie Macmillan, the Weasleys (minus Ginerva) all had pretty normal British sounding names to me. The Bones also had normal names (Amelia and Susan) although I'm not sure if they're pureblood or if that's fanon. Names in the Harry Potter world tend to be a mixed bag. Some of the names in previous generations probably reflect naming trends at the time so they sound odd to a modern audience.

I'm including characters who have (or are assumed to have) two magical parents: Marcus Flint, Marcus Belby, Eileen Prince, Isobel Ross, Ariana Dumbledore (I'd argue Albus isn't weird either, but sensibly old-fashioned), Daphne Greengrass, Millicent Bulstrode, Hannah Abbott (the Abbotts lived in Godrics Hollow, although it's entirely possible they were Muggles), Luna Lovegood, Lucius Malfoy (although others might find it to be an abnormal name, I personally know a couple of Luciuses so I don't), Albert Runcorn, Evan Rosier, Augustus Rookwood. I don't actually know if these are normal British names, but they sound normal to me (Canadian). Honestly, besides the Blacks' weirdass names, many wizards seem to have relatively normal albeit old-fashioned names.

******** Oh gosh yes! I seem to have forgotten a few. I think that most people fixtate on the odd names of the Blacks/Malfoys and some of the Hogwarts professors that they forget the majority of the minor characters had fairly ordinary names for the time (born in 1980 or before). Yes some are outdated and you'd find more in your parents or grandparents generation, but that's some of the charm and could be because the wizarding world might lag behind or just ignore Muggle naming trends. Names like Severus, Lucius and Augustus come from Roman senators/emperors, similar to a lot of the names from Roman mythology (Remus, Minerva even some of the more ordinary like Luna or Daphne). So it does seem that Latin based names are a trend in the wizarding world although I wouldn't say they're a pureblood thing since so many don't have them. Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini are probably purebloods too and while I've never meet a Pansy, it's no weirder than Petunia (a VERY ordinary Muggle name if you ask Petunia herself). Blaise isnt common (or at least I don't think it is) but it's a French name that I've heard before.

Looking at the characters in Harry's year I'd argue that Draco and Hermione are the oddest names and Hermione's a muggleborn so she's not an example of naming trends in the wizarding world.

****** It goes both ways, to be honest. All in all, it depends on the parents as people first and foremost, and considering that James had a father who hated his name because of how unusual it was, and how James himself picked on Snape partially because of his unusual name, I don't think it too likely for Harry's name to be a non-common name unless there was an explicit reason for it.

She basically did everything as normal but she didn't speak to him. Occasionally she'd speak to Harry and say things that were meant for James but when she needed him to do something, she'd give him a note.

e.g.: "Your daddy needs to go buy you new diapers, doesn't he, Harry? doesn't he?" she sang to Harry's burbled laughters of delight as she swung him around. James sighed and went to go buy more diapers.

And it was torturous to James. he would do stupid things in hopes of her yelling at him. But she'd ignore his actions though she'd kiss, hug, initiate or allow sex to be initiated, she just refused to speak to him until Harry's first birthday.

I've seen "Jim" and "Jimmy" used and that annoys me to no ends. This is me going off on a tangent but oh well. Sirius and Remus refer to him as James! If he went by Jim/Jimmy, they would call him that when speaking about him. Like Bill's full name is William, but he's not called William in the narrative nor do people refer to him that way when he's around or when talking about him. If James went by Jimmy, people would still refer to him as Jimmy after he died. Professors might refer to him as his legal name if they didn't know him that well, but that's about it.

So basically it's the name evolving too quickly and then the diminutive being left as it is.
