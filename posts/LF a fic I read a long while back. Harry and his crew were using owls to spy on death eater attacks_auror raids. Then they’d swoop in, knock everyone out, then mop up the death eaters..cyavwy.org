** It sounds like Faery Heroes, but it's not.

But I'll link it anyway

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

*** I remember reading this one a while back. I want to say it had the group dressing up in outfits to hide their identity and robbing death eater houses while calling themselves the foxes or something like that.

Not sure about the owls scenes I'm looking for though. I'll give it another read just in case.

Mentioning foxes and robbing them was the bit I needed to make it click.

***** Hmm. Are you giving me something with foxes or something else? I tentatively remember hearing speak of this one with foxes but the Faery Heroes also had something to do with themselves calling them the foxes.

I was just asking if Faery Heroes had specific owl scenes in such case the aurors notice that wherever there are owls then these attacks on death eaters happen.

I think I'll read Larceny Lechery and Luna Lovegood too as Im not sure i ever have.

****** Larceny has the specific mention of foxes. It's been awhile since I read either, so I can't say anything for certain on the owls part for either story
