I just stumbled across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3obdel/if_you_guys_can_make_donald_trump_related_to/][this thread]] over at [[/r/HarryPotter]] and now I can't get this idea out of my head: Donald Trump as the ruler/next dark lord of magical britain.

Now I need to know whether such a crackfic already exists, and if not, why the hell not?

Competent as a businessman, certainly. As a politician? Any one of hundreds of videos would prove such a claim false.

***** Why would he take bribes? He's got millions. Don't get me wrong, I don't think he's going into politics out of any benevolence, but i do think he won't be bribed with something as petty as money. There are better ways to get richer. He might be bribed with something else, but not mere money.

He probably isn't a competent politician, but... i don't know, he falls within most politicians are idiots parameters, and while he is a PR disaster, and not the best at administration, he's not within fudge levels. (Yet, i suppose.)

** Yeah, no.

Given how thin The Donald's skin is and how aggressively he has sued those he deems as harming his "brand," this would be an effective way of getting our favorite fanfiction sites shut down in a hurry.

Let's let this idea die.
