Hey guys,

I have noticed that I always avoided reading Post-War fanfiction for no reason at all and now I want to rectify it.\\
Give me your best fics starting directly after The Deathly Hallows. The fic should be Harry centric.\\
It doesn't have to be canon compliant and no slash pls.

Thank you

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** A pity the author has the sequel done, but unpublished. I remember reading somewhere that the author "didn't think it was good enough", or something to that extent.

A pity, as I'm sure many people are hoping there will be a sequel.

** More good postwar fics (several one shots):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster][A Crime Fitting the Punishment or Dumbledore's Monster]], linkffn(8854828): This story follows a similar premise as "The Sum of Their Parts". But instead of fighting back after only 4 months, this Harry waited for many years until his enemies came after him first. The result was disastrous.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Harry travelled to another dimension postwar and met Tom Riddle, head healer of St Mungos.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4798208/1/An-Interview-with-Justin-FinchFletchley][An Interview with Justin Finch Fletchley]], linkffn(4798208): Pretty good fic about the 7th year and immediate postwar from Justin's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize%5D,%20linkffn(4152700][Cauterize]]: Emotional one-shot

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): Four years later, a Hermione from an alternate dimension appeared and requested help.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days][Grave Days]], linkffn(5486257): It's a prequel to "Strangers at Drakeshaugh", shows what happened immediately following the Battle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913): both Harry and Hermione went insane under the effects of the Hallows.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450): Voldemort remnants in the Wizengamot tried to screw heroes over with a marriage law. Harry organized a mass exodus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Voldemort remnants in the Wizengamot tried to screw heroes over with a marriage law. Hermione organized the infuriated masses, overthrew the Ministry, and executed anyone who supported the law. Foreign pureblood regimes were not happy, and real war began in earnest...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4625848/1/In-Case-of-Emergency][In Case of Emergency]], linkffn(4625848): Nice H/G smut fic with a plot. Slight canon divergence in that Fred survived.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard]], linkffn(9526039): Hilarious one-shot at Burrow

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/The-Last-Enemy][The Last Enemy]], linkffn(11564067): Another Hallows driving Harry insane story

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511): Very cute H/Hr one shot 20 years later

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): This fic has lots of great ideas, but also lots of problems. It's very unique.

linkffn(11697407) and its other part linkffn(12381694)

linkffn(8262940) unatoned is sometimes considered one of the best written fanfics even if its not as fun as some of the others.

linkffn(9444529) Several of TE7s stories might work.

linkffn(7711029) Another post Hogwarts quidditch fic.

Then there is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] which is pretty meh but pleasant enough.

linkffn(11815544) isn't really Harry centric but its great and written by one of HPfanfiction's finest.

That should do for now.

** I enjoyed "A Horizon under Winter." It's a Harry/Hermione pairing, and canon compliant. There is mild bashing of Molly, Ron, and Ginny, yet the author gives Ron a good redemption arc halfway through the story and it's actually very interesting. The story, however, is a slow-burn, yet there's a lot of mystery towards the end of it.

*** whoa, that story has got to have some of the worst dialogue I've ever seen.

Harry: "Hey Hermione, remember how we did that thing?"

Hermione: "Yes Harry, who is the person I'm talking to right now. We indeed did do that thing."

**** I enjoyed it. I appreciated the added mystery and plot, especially towards the end, and had a great time going through it. I think it's important to remember that the author (whom I assume is male, though I could be wrong) doesn't claim to be a writer, nor does he(?) claim to want to write as any type of profession. Like most fanfic authors, he(?) is doing this for personal enjoyment and the satisfaction of being allowed to play with JK's characters.
