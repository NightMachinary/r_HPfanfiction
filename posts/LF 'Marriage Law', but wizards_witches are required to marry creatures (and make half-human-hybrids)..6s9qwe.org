Inspired by a couple of certain someones who wondered if Hagrid's half-giant-ness would make him immune to becoming a werewolf in the event he was bitten.

So yeah, anyone know any stories of this nature? Whether in order to improve the physical/magical fitness of their species or to prevent a prophesied future pandemic of lycanthropy, or just because half-veela/quarter-veela are /hot/, the British Ministry of Magic mandates that all wizards/witches must marry creatures in order to populate Britain with half-breeds?

Bonus points if humans/creatures/existing half-breeds are encouraged to wank to fill up a sperm bank, no bonus points if Mistress Umbridge comes to help those with 'alternative needs' ('filthy creatures need to be punished'), bonus points again if the whole Wizengamot obliviates themselves to get rid of the mental image created by the above.

...And, light-hearted and/or comedy if possible. But serious political stories where the various non-human denizens of the wizarding world object to being treated as breeding stock work too.


** Then you would get a revolution more violent than the one in "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution".

*** Probably. I haven't actually read past the first couple of chapters of that story, Hermione's characterisation irked me something awful.

Aside from luring Aurors to houses and framing them for attacking before killing them, how bad does the war get in that story?

**** Well, that's what you get if you push good people too far and they become radical revolutionaries.

In that story, the Wizengamot and the Ministry deserved their fate.

*** The Revolution would be not like the French Revolution(like in the Marriage Law Revolution), it probably be as nasty and violent as a full scale Civil War.

** Not sure if this would be better as a crackfic or as a serious one.

Pairing Harry with a Nymph. Hermione with a... hmm... a Faun. Ron gets a Veela - an angry one, with more time in her feathery form than in her human one - fiery like his hair.

My brain just conjures up imagery now. Its great.

Heh, Trelawney with Firenze over Divination, maybe? Fred and George with buxom giant twins? Ginny with Dobby over their shared adoration of Harry?

**** Trelawney and Firenze sounds kinky. I could see the Twins thing be funny af, but I'd pair them up with something more up their alley, like leprechauns. Ginny and Dobby is an image I did not need in my life. Thanks for that.
