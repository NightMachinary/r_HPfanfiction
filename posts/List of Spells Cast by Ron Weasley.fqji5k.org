Here is a list of spells that Ron Weasley has cast over the course of 7 Books and 8 Movies in Alphabetical Order. I have not included spells from the games, Cursed Child or anywhere outside of the Books and Movies. I have only included spells we have actually seen him cast and not ones that he should be able to use (spells taught to younger years like Immobulus) or ones he probably knew but was never shown casting (Protego, Evanesco, Nox, etc) or the one that he might have cast off screen (Finite Incantatem, Meteolojinx Recanto, etc)

1.  Accio (The Summoning Charm)
2.  Alohomora (Unlocking Charm)
3.  Avada Kedavra (Killing Curse)/ Unknown Green Curse (used on Nagini in DH pt 2)
4.  Cheering Charm
5.  Colloportus (Locking Spell)
6.  Colovaria (Colour Change Charm; /Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow/)
7.  Confundo (Confundus Charm)
8.  Defodio (Gouging Spell)
9.  Depulso (Banishing Charm)
10. Descendo (Used to lower the ceiling hatch to show the transifigured sick Ron)
11. Diffindo (Severing Charm)
12. Erecto (used to erect tents)
13. Expecto Patronum (Patronus Charm)
14. Expelliarmus (Disarming Charm)
15. Impedimenta (Impediment Jinx; used on a wasp in GoF)
16. Imperio (Imperius Curse; used on Bogrod the goblin; Pointed out by [[https://www.reddit.com/u/ArlyssTolero86/][u/ArlyssTolero86]])
17. Impervius (Impervius Charm; used in OotP to practice in the rain)
18. Leg Sprouting Charm (pointed out by [[/u/Carrot-Bro][u/Carrot-Bro]])
19. Lumos (Wand-Lighting Charm)
20. Petrificus Totalus (Full Body-Bind Curse)
21. Reducto (Reductor Curse)
22. Relashio (Revulsion Jinx; used on Pettigrew in an attempt to stop him from chocking himself)
23. Reparo (Mending Charm)
24. Riddikulus (Boggart Banishing Spell)
25. Shooting Spell
26. Silencio (Silencing Charm)
27. Slugulus Eructo (Slug-vomiting Charm; Ron was able to cast this non verbally with a broken wand)
28. Specialis Revelio (used in HBP)
29. Stupefy (Stunning Spell)
30. Teapot to tortoise (used in PoA)
31. Tergeo (Cleaning Spell)
32. Wingardium Leviosa (Levitation Charm)

This list came as a surprise. I thought it would be a lot longer but Ron was not shown casting a lot of different spells. Even spells that he should know like Nox are never shown. I had to go through the material multiple times to make sure I was not missing something.

Anyway if there was a spell that Ron was shown casting that I missed please let me know and I will add it.

Hope this helps.

**** Upon reviewing [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzQRxPcaRIM][the scene]] I believe it is also. It seems that the circumstance would allow for it. I am curious however to why it failed, if living Horcruxes don't have a protection from AK. (Harry's scene in the woods, for example.) Surely Ron hated Voldemort and by extension Nagini enough to want it erased from existence.

***** Here is where things get murky. In the books it is implied that Harry is a Hocrux but J.K. said in an interview that Harry actually was not a Hocrux. This puts the whole thing about Living Horcrux being vulnerable to AK in question.

******* The prophecy only matters because Voldemort believes in it.

#+begin_quote
  "[. . .] If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”

  “Tell him what?”

  *Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.*

  (Book 7, U.S. p. 686).
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, *his eyes still tight shut*. “Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.

  *Dumbledore opened his eyes*. Snape looked horrified.
#+end_quote

Copied quote from HPRankdown. Odd, isn't it that in a scene with Snape, someone competent at the mind arts, JK Rowling focuses so heavily on the state of Dumbledore's eyes. Of course, Snape could never have truly legilimised Albus Dumbledore to a high degree. But it seems Dumbledore is taking no risks with an important secret. An important secret such as the fact that Harry's shared blood, his mother's sacrificial protection, Voldemort's soul fragment within Harry, and Harry's own true intent to sacrifice himself for his friends lead to a set of circumstances where Harry has a good chance of survival, something completely unlikely any other way. Voldemort is a master of the Dark Arts and impeccable at combat, only Dumbledore could match him.

To the detriment of Indy Harry fans, there is no way a 17 year old, even with the magical affinity and potential of Voldemort or Dumbledore could ever have defeated Voldemort in a straight up fight. Dumbledore, who was both a coward and the bravest man, ensured that Harry, who he loved more than nearly everyone, would have his best chance at survival.

​

On the topic of Ron's KC, it seems like movie inconsistency. I have no doubt the director forgot or overlooked that killing curses bypass magical forms of protection.

******** Oh there were a lot of inconsistencies in the movies. I thought it only fair to include this potential AK in Ron's list when I included so many straight up non canonical spells in Hermione's list if we go by the books.

  'Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?' she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. 'You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain--to enjoy it--righteous anger won't hurt me for long--I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson--'

Bellatriix, from OotP. Sure, Harry had just cast crucio, hence the specific reference to pain, but she says the same applies to all the unforgivables.

***** It looks like he almost said it silently, maybe that's why. I'd bet anything Ron has never used it before and we know from the books that non-verbal casting is extremely difficult for most people. He mouths a little bit, but the only indication that it's AK is the color.
