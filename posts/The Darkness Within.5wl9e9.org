I'm curious about the series, should I read the rewrite or the original to start?


** Depends how high your tolerance is for bad fics. They haven't aged well, if they were even good to begin with.

** The rewrite isn't finished, I think, while the original is. However, I found the quality difference to be big enough that after I finished what had been published of the rewrite and went back to reading the original, I couldn't read it at all.

I remember them reading ages ago, closer to when they first came out, and I enjoyed it, but if you have high standards for things like grammar/story construction you might not like it. (When I was a preteen I definitely didn't care about those things so much, and had a great time reading it.)

** I've tried to read Kuri's stuff a number of times and could never manage it. Years ago I stayed away because H/G and R/Hr frienship, but these days I've shed all my prejudices towards characters (except Malfoy fuck that little bitch).

I gave it one more try recently and before giving up in disgust I gave it some thought as to why they rub in the wrong way so much; and the answer is, author fiat. That is, when shit happens in Kuri's fics, it doesn't happen because of any sort of logical (or even illogical) progression (if there even is progression). Shit happens because Kuri wants it to happen one way and waves her magic wand and makes it that way - and fuck the characters if they would behave in that way, fuck if the plot doesn't make any sense. What matters is Kuri getting a certain scene to be melodramatic enough to tickle her fancy - usually it's Harry having to do something retarded, like going back to Voldemort, because otherwise he's going to kill everyone Harry now loves. And two chapters later a variation of the same thing happens again.

I think Kuri might have been trying to go for the ancient greek theme of humans being powerless before powers far greater than them, like fate, time, pride and such, but fuck me if it comes across as completely contrived and badly manufactured.

The worst thing is as soon as I realised this, it became apparent that her stuff is FULL of it. You get no reprieve of characters doing stupid shit, because, well how else do you get that delicious drama?

I actually finished one of her later stories, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7516156/1/To-Correct-A-Wrong][To Correct A Wrong]]. I'm going to spoil it, because reading it is not worth it.

It's an AU of her main fic, where Harry is returned to his family by a remorseful Peter, when he is 10, instead of escaping at 16. Now this is actually not as bad as her previous stories, it had some heartfelt moments, even if the plot was a bit weak. So I reach the end, curious to find how she's going to tie the whole thing off, and guess what happens: some gypsy bitch that Voldemort hired waves her wand and UNMAKES THE WHOLE PLOT. Meaning that her "main" fic is once again in effect. Congrats, you just read 130k words for no fucking reason, loser.

(There is exactly one piece of fiction where the whole thing being unmade at the end is justified, and that's the Devil's Advocate movie.)

Anyway, thanks for giving me the chance to write up this rant.

** I started with Deepest Reflections because I was really into Time/Dimension Travel at that time, and I really liked it. It got me interested in the whole trilogy, but in the end, I couldn't read the first two parts.
