#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Zeitgeistic on Ao3 is a really excellent author who draws in all sorts of interesting science references and writes well. This, for me, is about as good as fanfic gets: the author writes realistic human interaction, demonstrates real knowledge (I suspect they're a chemist) and has posted something readable and beautifully edited.

"Azoth" focuses on Alchemy and is a Harry/Draco pairing (which might explain why I've never seen this author recommended here, but I really hope that's not the reason,) and I would 100% go to the mat for it.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** There's a lot of it in the different uses and potential for potions in linkffn(Brightest Witch, Darkest house) Not so much as why the potions works per-se, like, why powered bicorn horn would help make polyjuice, but it goes indepth into the potential uses and exploits you could have with a number of seemingly innofensive potions.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Linkffn(unfinished business by Ramos) has the development of a potion as core to the plot. I don't know if it explores that space and goes into the detail you're after, but it's a beautiful story worth reading anyway. (Written pre-OotP though, so it's very AU.)

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
