:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've just had this scene in my head for the past couple days and it's driving me mad. Pretty sure it's a female Harry. She is sorted into Slytherin, and at some point pretty early on, she gets into an argument and he try's to pull his wand on her in the common room. Unfortunately for him, she has been practicing her quick-draw since she got her wand in the summer, having mistakenly expected that everyone would have done that. She has her wand pointed at his nose in sub-0.8 seconds, meanwhile Malfoy's still fumbling in his pockets. Everyone is very impressed.\\
Anyway, I'd really appreciate it if someone could find that fic so I can get it out of my brain. Thnx :)


** That happened in The Prince of Slytherin, down to the .8 bit. I think you've gotten two fics confused.

*** "Ol' Quick-Shot Potter, they called him. All the witches laughed, but any wizard that dared would find themselves short a wand afore they could blink. And I ain't talking about the wooden one. That kid had one hell of a compensation problem going with the /explosivo castrato/s."

*** It's almost kinda suspicious how similar what the OP describes is to what happens in POS, except for, as you noted, the fem!Harry bit.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** I mean you can get down to 0.72 with an TAS, but it's real Finnicky, it's possible to get 0.8, but it's requiring near inhuman luck, they only managed that in optimal conditions, (going into bionics, and investing into the nudist perk for about .35 second saved. Beating 1.1 could be plausible, however getting anywhere below .9 for an unmoded humanoid seems like a stretch.

** Maybe one of these? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5244847/Belial666]]

It's not Fem!Harry though, more like a Slytherin Hermione.
