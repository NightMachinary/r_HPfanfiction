Simple game.

1. One person writes a dialogue.
2. Another person replies and expands it to a scene.

The dialogue can be start, middle or end of the scene. I'll start:

​

*/"You still disgust me, Severus." Dumbledore said calmly./*


** Snape conjures a doe patronus. Dumbledore exclaims, "Even after all this time?" Snape simply replies, "Always" "You still disgust me, Severus" Albus says calmly.
