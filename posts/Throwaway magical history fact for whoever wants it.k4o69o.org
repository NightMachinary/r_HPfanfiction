In the 1500s there was a dancing plague that a lot of scientists are still trying to pin down exactly what the cause was. It could be the origin of the jelly legs jinx or Tarantallegra curse where some dark wizard curses the muggles to dance until they die. The magical governments had to do a lot of cover up to hide it once the statute of secrecy went into effect but they couldn't come up with a good enough cover story due to the absurdity of the event so too many muggles had already heard of it for them to erase it completely.

Edit with a link to the dancing plague if anyone's interested. It's a crazy thing. There were actually several different instances of it in history. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518]]


** I now want a throwaway magical history fact thread just full of things like this. Like, the Defenestrations of Prague? All caused by attempts to create a Levicorpus-like spell that went terribly awry...three times.

**** Or just mysteries in general.

What if Jack the Ripper was a dark wizard harvesting organs/bloods for rituals/spells?

Were the Hanging Gardens of Babylon a magical place? What about the Library of Alexandria? Or was

***** Jack the Ripper was actually the developer of the Severing Charm (i.e. "diffindo"), he wanted test subjects and figured nobody would miss a few low-class muggle prostitutes

****** I actually had a Black ancestor test a spell out on a muggle village in my village (lol, my fic but I'm leaving that typo). Sirius thought it was the coolest thing ever because it sets a sword on cursed fire using the caster's blood until he grew up and realized how fucked up the whole thing was.

******* Is this up publicly somewhere? The character development from "that's metal as fuck, awesome" to "wait, that's really fucked up, how nuts were they that they thought that was a good idea" sounds like it'd make a good story, all else being equal.

******** It's really just mentioned in passing kind of because he has to resort to dark magic to get out of a sticky spot with inferi. (His wand snaps and the sword of Gryffindor comes to him.)

Here's the chapter if you want to read it:

*** There is nothing magical in our national traditions. To quote Jerome K. Jerome (Three Men on Bummel, chapter VIII):

#+begin_quote
  Prague is one of the most interesting towns in Europe. Its stones are saturated with history and romance; its every suburb must have been a battlefield. It is the town that conceived the Reformation and hatched the Thirty Years' War. But half Prague's troubles, one imagines, might have been saved to it, had it possessed windows less large and temptingly convenient. The first of these mighty catastrophes it set rolling by throwing the seven Catholic councillors from the windows of its Rathhaus on to the pikes of the Hussites below. Later, it gave the signal for the second by again throwing the Imperial councillors from the windows of the old Burg in the Hradschin---Prague's second “Fenstersturz.” Since, other fateful questions have been decide in Prague, one assumes from their having been concluded without violence that such must have been discussed in cellars. The window, as an argument, one feels, would always have proved too strong a temptation to any true-born Praguer.

(and Mr Jerome missed one defenestration, most bloody of all three, in 1483)

**** To be fair, magic doesn't always have to be pleasant. It can contribute or start other horrible events too. World war 2 apparently had a whole wizard side to it from the grindelwald war
