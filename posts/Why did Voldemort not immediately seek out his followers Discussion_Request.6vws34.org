** Its far more impressive to return from the dead than it is to beg for help when you're less than a ghost. The strongest, scariest Dark Lord cut down by a baby, that would go down real well with some of the more fair weather supporters. Its different after he proves he can return. If they choose to seek him out however, that's just showing their loyalty and commitment. He'd have to beg for help and that's quite demeaning and humiliating for the biggest bully in the country.

When he first gets blasted we can assume he was in pain and was confused, its not everyday you end up floating around after a backfired killing curse strips you of your body. We can assume that he probably wasn't thinking straight. It might even have taken him a while to form consciousness. I can't remember if a dark spirit left the Potter house or if he somehow reformed somewhere. Either way, his most fanatic followers got themselves arrested soon after his fall so weren't around to help but the time he got his head together.

** I think Voldemort was very /weak/ as a wraith. If he was as stable and visible as a ghost, he wouldn't have bothered with possessing Quirrell. Wraith!Voldemort was, at first, basically a mangled blurry mess that had about as much mental focus as a sleepwalking dodo bird --- "less than the meanest ghost". By the time his crazed flight had taken him to Albania, he had built up a bit more strength but decided it would just be too risky to put more strain on his magic by trying to cross the Channel on his own again. He was more or less dormant for those ten years, lying in wait for some human wizard to come along for him to stow away on. "Too tired to carry on", as Hagrid puts it.

**** Read the whole message! Inability to focus his mind or think properly, to control his movements, to present a non-blurry visual appearance are the weaknesses he endured.

***** He was also most likely dependent on the animals he possessed, none of which could get him safely back to England, until Quirrel showed up.

** I have this theory; a person with multiple horcruxes who has their original body destroyed ends up 're-spawning' at the most-recently-made horcrux, and can't venture far from it. In Voldemort's case, that was the horcrux that he'd left in Albania. Why else would he be stuck there for ten years, trying to possess local wildlife, instead of hanging around Malfoy Manor or Hogwarts or Grimmauld Place looking for an easily-dominated ally to aid in his reconstitution? This theory gets more believable when you consider that he went back to Albania after Harry burned Quirrel to ashes at the end of the first book.

**** Headcanon part 2: Hufflepuff's cup was left behind in Albania, and had been imbued as a horcrux after the Diadem. Voldemort made the mistake of leaving it there when using Quirrel as a carrier for his spirit, possibly because he wasn't certain that he could trust Quirrel. When Wormtail found him, he made several changes in his plans, with the assurance that Wormtail's compliance was ensured via the Dark Mark. He recovered the Cup, used really nasty alchemy to build him a temporary body, and he created a horcrux out of the biggest snake they could find. With Nagini being the latest horcrux, he would respawn in the snake if his temporary baby body fell apart on the journey.

Voldemort had Bellatrix place the Cup in Gringott's after breaking her out of Azkaban, adding the scalding Gemino curse to it in the process.

** When Voldemort came out, Bellatrix was in Azkaban. I seriously doubt that would've wanted reports coming out that he broke her out of Azkaban just when he resurfaced. Fudge's attitude in Order of the Phoenix was completely reasonable in terms of him outright denying the return of Voldemort and discrediting Harry and Dumbledore when they said he came back.

** This is answered by Voldemort actually. When he is resurrected, he chastised his followers for not searching for him. He firmly believed that unless you were useful you were not important. It is this that is key. As a spirit, or wraith, or whatever. He was not useful. He could not be. Thus in his mind, he needed a body to command his useful followers, in order to rule. However how did he get a body without followers? Why if they searched him out, they would be admitting that he is useful, and thus important. It was in short due to his ego and desire to appear strong. Its why he never bothered getting more followers on his side as babymort.

*** I believe only the most rabid or desperate follower would be willing to accept babymort as leader. You have to remember, that his followers are a bunch of self involved purebloods, that only followed him because he shared their allusions of grandeur and was crazy powerful.

**** Look at the two Death Eaters who carried out his resurrection: Peter Pettigrew, a coward who was only useful as a spy and sought him out for protection, and Barty Crouch Jr, who saw Voldemort as the father figure he never had. Hence, the most desperate and rapid followers.

** Hm...he treated them like shit, so he had to fear their retribution against their weakened Lord (he could only possess willing people after all, so if there were all unwilling then he'd have stayed a wraith, hell they might have imprisoned him (we don't really know if there's wards for that after all))
