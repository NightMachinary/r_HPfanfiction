I tend to think that all magical could Influence there appearance with magic it was just no were near as powerful or as fast a actual Metamorphmagus.

were as Tonks could change her appearance in seconds other people magic would take months or years to slowly change there a appearance to the way the wanted to look. with no were near as much control over it.

the reason i think about the weasley twins is because even there mother couldn't tell them apart which should not be possible with out some sort of magic


** Maybe its because they're identical twins? Maybe?

** The idea is amusing, but it hinges on that "everyone can /sort/ of change what they look like" idea, which I don't believe to be canon, though it's certainly interesting. So I don't "believe" they did, to answer the thread title. But again: cool idea.

That said, don't let fanon fool you; Molly usually /could/ tell her children apart in canon, just not when she was under too much stress.

Maybe because the twins had black blood they got it unless Tonks got her Metamorphmagus talent from her fathers line.

i guess it depend on how wide spread you want the it to be

**** My point is, I don't believe there's such a thing as a "minor Metamorphmagus talent". In my headcanon it's as absurd as being "kind of" a wizard or only "slightly" a Parselmouth --- you're either a full Metamorphmagus like Tonks, or you're not and you'd have to use advanced self-transfiguration like Grindelwald if you wanted to change your appearance.

***** I was looking the at Parselmouth page on the harry potter wiki the other day and I am pretty sure that it says that Isolt Sayre can only understand snake but not talk to them. what would you call that?

from the wiki page: Isolt Sayre, a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin, was able to understand a Horned Serpent which she regularly visited but as of known never spoke Parseltongue herself.

****** It just says she understood it but never spoke it. That is not to say she couldn't. I'm choosing to believe the details of Parseltongue had been lost to her branch of the family and she didn't /know/ one could speak back to the snakes.

******* I don't think that it works that way but what ever floats your boat.

I would go with the explanation that people can learn a magical talents like Parseltongue, divination and metamorphmagus, but most people don't even know you can learn them and even if they did know it was possible to learn they wouldn't both to try because it would take years just like learning to be an animagus takes years( the only thing that even hints to this in canon is that Dumbeldore seems to have learnt to understand Parseltongue In Harrys fifth year even if he can't speak it)

So someone that even thinks to try to learn Parseltongue can understand it Easily enough , but learning the spoken part of Parseltongue is a lot harder takeing years so it not worth the effort.

******** Well, I think that Parseltongue is a bit of an exception; because being a Parselmouth is a magical talent that gives you automatic knowledge of the language both ways, but it's wholly possible to just learn how to speak the language, as Dumbledore had, without any magical steps involved. Dumbledore could only understand it but functionally not speak it because it's so hard to pronounce it if you don't have the innate, instinctive knowledge of a Parselmouth (all those slight variations in hisses are hard to pronounce with a human tongue!). In my story, I have showcased Dumbledore /trying/ to speak Parseltongue, and the result was absolutely hilarious to Harry because from his perspective he was speaking with the thickest lisp anyone had ever seen.

*** Given the influence of Roald Dahl on the Harry Potter series, I am will to believe that magic does slightly alter people's appearances.

** The reason their mother couldn't tell them apart because they are identical twins that look almost exactly identical. It's nothing to do with magic

*** Not even identical twins are that identical... They will throughout life acquire differences! If one eats more he becomes bigger/fatter. One will have scars the other doesn't, they will get brthmarks, their hair will be a bit different lenghts, they will talk a bit differently. I have never heard of identical twins who their parents can't tell apart... So either Molly is a bad parent, wasn't paying attention or there was magic involved.
