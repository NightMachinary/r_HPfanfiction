Why almost every fanfiction makes Merlin like a god that can't do no wrong and trained the Founders. I mean in canon he is a Slytherin, and went on to become famous. Why do people make him the 2nd coming of Jesus or whoever is your religious counterpart.


** Because he's portrayed that way in canon? Well, not the training the founder parts.

** mainly bc his name is an exclamation in the same way we say "Dear Lord" or "Oh God!"
