Deciding that it would be prudent to find his new nemesis before he kills him, Voldemort helps a frantic James and Lily look for Harry.


** “You are both utter fools! Nothing will escape Lord Voldemort!” The man hissed vehemently before grunting as he ungracefully got to his knees and looked under the dresser again. Still finding nothing he used the dresser to heave himself back to his feet, cursing the two idiots in the other room for having to stoop to such measures.

“Have you tried /inside/ the dresser?” Came a voice from downstairs accompanied by the sound of something breaking as The parents race to find their son got more and more frantic.

He recognised of course that they were attempting to lead him on and get out with Harry should they find him, had he believed Harry to still be downstairs he would have already killed him, unfortunately his initial sweep had found nothing and the dark lord had been forced to be a little more hands on with his endeavour.

Rolling his eyes at the indignity of this situation he replied with less then eager ‘Lord Voldemort shall try the dresser' and opened the first draw-

-Only to be immediately assaulted by Lily Evans rather ample collection of lacy underwear. Lord Voldemort just stared at the collection before his hands dropped off the handles and hung limply at his sides.

Figure sagging at the injustice of it all he sighed before murmuring a ‘bugger this' and apperating out of there.

** And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet...

And he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and stared over it...

They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man... who was frantically searching the floor?

Voldemort frowned.

The father was crawling around on all fours, without a wand, searching for... something?

His wand?

The dark-red hair of the mother frantically flashed through the other rooms.

What were they doing?

He pushed the gate open, noiselessly moving upwards, white hand around the wand beneath his cloak. He magically amplified the sounds coming in his direction ---

"I can't find him in the kitchen either!" the mother said in agony. "Where did you last leave the invisibility cloak!?"

"I don't know!" the father replied.

"Harry!" the mother yelled throughout the rooms. "Harry!"

They had lost the boy? The tool of his destruction? The inexplicable danger?

Was this part of the prophecy he knew not? Would the boy manage to evade him, somehow?

No... that must not happen.

He had no options left... he had to use his weapon of last resort, the weapon he promised himself he would never use...

He unlocked the door, pushing it slightly open, and sliding his thin form through it like a spindly ghost...

He closed the door... he was in the foyer...

He transformed into his animagus form ... a cute duck.

He ruffled his black feathers.

And padded into the living room with the heady sense of purpose he knew so well...

"Quack. Quack."

The father paused.

"What?" he said, looking at the duck in utter bewilderment.

He did not break eye contact. "Lily? There's a duck in the living room."

He quacked.

"Oh my god," the mother said. "Harry? Is that you?"

He quacked aggressively.

The mother was crying now. Lord Voldemort hated crying. "James, he must have drunk one of my potions."

She went to pick him up, but he flew away. He would not allow her. "Harry, it's me!"

He ran out of the room.

He must find the boy to escape the mother.

"Harry!"

Voldemort searched --- not frantically, no, because Lord Voldemort never did anything frantically, definitely not --- the rooms for his prophesied doom.

"Harry!" the father joined. "It's us --- calm down! You're not in danger!"

He must find the boy... must find the boy...

What did Severus see in this woman?

Must find the boy...

"Harry, please!" the mother yelled.

He jumped underneath the couch... searching...

"Why does this always happen?" the mother said.

And... he hit something... something invisible...

He went underneath the cloak.

There was the boy.

He quacked.

The boy was silent.

They stared at each other.

Lord Voldemort felt that this had a tinge of irony he couldn't quite place.

He quacked.

Finally, they had levitated the couch, and by the sound of his quacking, had found him and the boy...

"Oh, Harry!" the mother said, picking the boy up and hugging him to her chest.

"Thank Merlin," the father said.

The father looked at the duck. "Well --- er --- sorry for the misunderstanding."

Indeed, Voldemort thought.

"Thank you for helping us. How --- er --- how did you get in?"

The mother looked at the duck. "He's so cute," she said.

That was enough.

Voldemort transformed back into himself.

"GARH!" the father said in shock, in probably the most surprised moment of his life.

Voldemort laughed, twirled his wand, and the father was dead.

The mother was screaming. "NO! NO! JAMES!"

The boy was crying.

Voldemort was laughing.

He paused.

He had promised Severus to spare the mother... Severus made his favorite dark curses... Severus, and only Severus, invented the heat-stable medium for Unicorn Blood that allowed him to add it to his coffee every morning...

The mother was trying to run away. He bound her feet to the floor with iron snakes.

"Give me the boy, you silly girl. You will not have to die."

"No! Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead ---”

"Give me the boy, and I will spare you."

“Not Harry! Please ... have mercy... have mercy... Not Harry! Not Harry! Please --- I'll do anything ---”

Wait.

But what if Severus found out his animagus form was a cute duck? Or the other Death Eaters? Dumbledore, even?

No, he could not allow that.

And it was probably prudent to kill them all...

He killed the mother. She dropped the baby.

Oops, he thought.

He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger.

“Avada Kedavra!”

And then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away ... far away...

--------------

Later:

But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving... Harry was falling again through thick white fog, and the duck's voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head --- “Quack. Quack.”

--------------

"Sir," Harry said. "I think... Voldemort might be able to turn into a cute duck?"

Dumbledore sniggered.

--------------

Voldemort's chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. Everybody in the Great Hall looked at them.

“I know your true form. I know it's a cute duck.”

Blank shock showed in Voldemort's face. "No!"

** (This is assuming that the invisibility cloak is spell-proof and that harry is can speak parseltongue)

Lord Voldemort lifted his hand to deliver the blasting curse on the door of the Potter cottage. He felt glee as he finally found them. He longed to eliminate the child who was destined to kill him.

He scoffed. Pathetic, a child? To kill him? The Dark Lord?

It was hilarious.

The door exploded, pieces of it scattered everywhere and Lord Voldemort took his first step inside the house, he walked right in like an invited guest but as soon as he was about to call the blood traitor and his mudblood wife, he was rudely interrupted by a what sounds like a pair of screaming banshees---

“James! He's not here! Is he there?”

“Not here either!”

“I'll go check the bedroom down the hall and you go check the bathroom downstairs!”

Footsteps thundered rapidly down the stairs. James Potter was a disaster, his face was one of pure hysteria as he glanced all around like a madman, looking for every single unnatural movement in the air.

Voldemort laughed. Adorable, the amount of fear he has given them. Truly, he felt quite a loss as he briefly thought about his character. He could've been one of his best soldiers along with his /friends/, maybe he could have even tolerated his mudblood of a wife too as he remembered her intelligence and drive to learn quite nearly similar to his youthful days. Unfortunately for him, Lord Voldemort does not tolerate disobedience.

He caressed the tip of his wand as he smirked at the wizard, ready to deliver the killing curse.

“Ah, James-“

With no warning, James Potter whipped his head at the speed Voldemort has never seen right to him. He ran straight to him and promptly shoved him aside to access the--- bathroom he was blocking before.

Voldemort was ready to see the hysteria run down deeper, or probably for him to stumble back in cold fright. Yet, he did not expect to be shoved like a ragdoll.

He was indignant. Him? The Dark Lord so carelessly ignored and shoved aside. Perhaps he won't kill him off so swiftly then, perhaps a torture curse to insanity would suit his disobedient and disrespectful manners. He stood up with rightful anger, his wand ready to throw the curse.

“How dare-“

“He's not here either! I'll check the kitchen!”

James Potter swiftly turned around and ran straight to the kitchen like a bull running straight to a red flag. Lord Voldemort's eyes widened as he realised that the kitchen was behind him. As he was about to move aside, he was once again shoved so ruthlessly.

A vase broke as his back hit the edge of a coffee table. He grunted in pain as he caressed his back to soothe it.

Lord Voldemort was angry, he was beyond indignation.

“Lily! He's not here either!”

“HARRY, DARLING PLEASE MAKE A SOUND! /HARRY!/”

“JUST KEEP LOOK FOR ANYTHING UNNATURAL IN THE AIR, IT MIGHT BE THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK!”

Voldemort perked up.

It seems that they lost the child under an invisibility cloak. How pathetic.

Voldemort sighed. This was supposed to be an easy task yet, it seems fate has surprised him. He can't kill the blood traitors now since it would make looking after the child much harder.

He considered his options. Calling his death eaters would be an embarrassment. A dark lord needing backup to kill a baby is not a worthy lord. Coming again tomorrow, or maybe waiting for the potters to find the child is just giving them unsupervised leeway to escape.

After a few minutes, he finally has exhausted his knowledge of all spells that could aid him in finding and summoning the child but none of them had yielded the desired outcome.

Lord Voldemort decided to search for the baby room. The child would probably be there.

An hour has passed and the search intensified. Lord Voldemort was now cupping walls, gently swishing his hand on air on every available surface in hopes to find the boy.

“Not in the office either!”

“Nor the shed!”

“James check the backyard and Voldemort check the front!”

It continued throughout the night, it was until the peak of dawn did they find the young child beside the cupboard under the stairs, playing with a snake.

Voldemort could not even be bothered to kill them. He would probably feel even more frustrated if he killed the child after spending nearly all of his energy to find him. Besides, it was quite endearing to see him play with a snake.

“/Pway, Plway,/” Baby Harry giggled in parseltongue.

Voldemort's eyes shot up.

** Lord Voldemort, unbeknownst to many, was actually quite gifted with illusions. It was not very difficult for him to disguise himself as one Sirius Black to gain unsuspected entry into the house of the child that prophecy had foretold would be his doom.

Black himself had been sent on some secret mission for the Order of the Phoenix, involving a few of Voldemort's lesser underlings - people the Dark Lord could frankly do without, especially if they managed to get themselves caught by one man.

What Voldemort hadn't expected, however, was to walk straight into an argument on Halloween.

"For crying out loud, James, it's /your/ cloak! If you don't know how to bypass it, you should at least be helping to look!"

Voldemort watched the scene, amused and - surprising even himself - somewhat worried. Killing the Potters now wouldn't actually help him accomplish his goal, given they'd apparently lost their child under an Invisibility Cloak.

"Prongs? Lils? I've brought food for the week!" Voldemort called out, the glamor disguising his voice. It seemed a good idea to behave the way Black would, and he /was/ their best friend. Voldemort only hoped they didn't expect him to use his Animagus form.

"Sirius? I thought you'd be out until tomorrow... Never mind, we have to find Harry!"

"What do you mean, find Harry? Did you let him play with your Invisibility Cloak again?" Voldemort said - a clever bluff. Black would most likely know about any prior incidents, after all.

An hour and a half later, they heard a faint giggling from underneath Harry's crib, where James had swore they'd checked about a hundred times. Perfect, just reveal the toddler and kill all three in one go...

Reaching under the crib, Voldemort felt around until his hands caught an Invisibility Cloak. Unwrapping the little bundle, Voldemort looked in dismay as the toddler inside scrunched his nose... And with a faint *pop*, went invisible in his arms.

At that moment, James and Lily walked into the room. Seeing Sirius with the cloak, James spoke up "Well, if that's the Cloak, where's Harry?"

"Little tyke had a bout of accidental magic, he's right here..." tossing the Cloak aside, Voldemort reached for his wand. "Revelio!" he shouted, before handing Harry over to his relieved parents. Both of them showed sincere appreciation, hugging Lord Voldemort tightly. It felt... Strange.

"Well, now that that's over... I should be going. I left the food in the kitchen, have to report back to Albus about those Death Eaters."

As James and Lily turned their backs, Voldemort prepared to cast a curse to catch the two parents in the back - before a series of images made their way into his mind, unbidden. The look on the kid's face, the appreciation from his parents...

Something in Voldemort's mind suddenly cleared up, a curse from the very moment of his birth suddenly lifting itself.

If this was what it took to become undefeatable, Voldemort mused... Was it worth it? For the first time, a twinge of something was felt from a long-dead heart. No, Voldemort mused, he wouldn't lower himself to infanticide.

In fact, he'd begun re-thinking a lot of things. If it was Muggles who were so bad, then why were the ones to die mostly Purebloods? Why campaign for deaths at all, if he could have gone for reforms?

In six seemingly-unrelated locations, that twinge of compassion was enough to set off a blast of magical feedback as it started the Dark Lord on a path to remorse. Not two weeks later, Imperius curses were released across the country and several Death Eaters suddenly turned themselves in, their Dark Marks having stopped moving.\\
It was quite confusing when the Dark Lord himself had checked into St. Mungo's mental ward for "styling himself a Dark Lord for so long", even accepting his sentencing when the Aurors took him from there to a courtroom - as his crimes were committed under the effects of what was deemed to be a curse, he and his erstwhile followers were spared Azkaban in favor of mandatory check-ins to a Mental Healer and community service.

--------------

Because no amount of psychopathy can survive the power of playing hide-and-seek with an adorable toddler. Harry "vanquished" the Dark Lord by making him re-think his decision to be a Dark Lord - no backfiring of Killing Curses, camping trip from hell, or year-long second war necessary.

I had to make up an excuse for James and Lily asking Voldemort of all people for help, so I made up the scenario that he'd disguised himself as Sirius Black to frame him as the traitor.\\
I also thought it'd be a good excuse to get another plot-bunny out of the way involving the fanon of "the Love Potion he was conceived under actually affected Tom Riddle, and the Dark Mark spreads his madness".

PS. Bloody hell, this turned out long.
