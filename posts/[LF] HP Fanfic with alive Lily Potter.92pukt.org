I'm looking for a fanfic in which Lily pops up alive at Grimmauld Place (post fifth? sixth year?) and Harry (somewhat understandably) freaks. He incarcerates her until I think Hermione shows up -- not sure about that however. I think she might have been awake/alive for a year or so before but didn't have her memories ... Draco helps him later in the story, they try to sneak into Malfoy Manor where they stumble upon Pansy Parkinson? I thought it was called ‘anything goes' but it seems not ...

Thanks in advance, FSyntax

  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH
