** For me, its a combination of memory and having the vast majority of the fics I've read saved on an app. If I see someone looking for a fic, and it sounds familiar, I can usually just scroll down on the app to see what its called so I can link it. But because I have so many saved, I have to remember at the very least whether it was a shorter fic or longer fic, and when I last downloaded it onto the app. Otherwise, it takes forever to find. Still possible, but not worth it.

** Half the time the search request is for a really popular fic. The second half of the time the request is super generic as to be impossible (unless it happens to fall under the really popular fic part). The third half are the fics that the miracle works who drudge through the worst of the worst and somehow know exactly what the fic is based on a single phrase.

** Sometimes I get lucky and remember, but a lot of times their listed in my favorites or my favorite author's favorites (a bit convoluted, I know)

** Part memory and part guess work. Sometimes I can remember the name of the fic, but most of the time, I just remember enough to find it with FFN story finder.

** I believe a lot of people use the favorites feature or write in down in a word doc (google docs, microsoft word, etc). I personally use a private discord server to keep track of them, but I'm an outlier in that way.

** I have a word doc with all HP fics that I've read + ones I'm going to read. I sort them by pairings/gen and use this template: Title by Author / Complete or WIP -- one-shot or x chapters -- rating / Summary / Tags (like time travel, eight year, nobility, resurrection, x bashing, dark x, etc.).

** I don't generally recommend large numbers of fics, and the ones I do recommend are ones that stand out in my mind for one reason or another. (Recency, quality, or over-exposure being the main three.)

** I have an app with all my FFN fics downloaded, so combining that with my memory lets me search through them pretty quickly. I haven't been reading on Ao3 enough to need more than bookmarks, and Spacebattles fics are all pretty recognizable.

** If I like a fic enough I download it as a EPUB, so I got LOTS of fics just waiting to be pulled up so I can check if it's one somebody is looking for! :) If it's one I haven't downloaded yet I'm pretty much useless though - I gotta rely on random GOOGLE FU to find anything!

** I keep a word doc of my favorite stories with links and little blurbs about why I like them... then I just copy and paste when someone asks for a rec.

** I assume that for less popular works, what happens is that you get that one person who loves the trope or ship and has low standards, meaning they read basically every fic out there with it, who delivers with a link.

For instance, if people are looking for a particular LESS fic, chances are high that I've read it, and can deduce the fic from rather vague statements.

However, I, like you, don't really store read fics anywhere, so I go on memory alone. So it sometimes causes me to be unable to track down a fic, even if I recognize it.

** I download all fics I've ever read to calibre because I prefer to read on my paperwhite instead of my phone (and my eyeballs thank me for it). So... I have oodles of fics that are all labelled and categorized with custom columns, and I can even search the text of each story if I recognize a specific line that the requester quoted.

Really, the only time I read in a browser is if it's a currently-updating fic that I'm excited for and a new chapter was just posted.

Honestly, its a little excessive but there you go.

** I have an excel spreadsheet with details of the story, a short review anywhere from a couple words to a few paragraphs, and a pretty complicated rating system. Not everything is on there - it's mostly long fics (70k+) which I've finished. A lot of tropey guilty pleasures or recently stuff I don't feel like reviewing don't get put on there; I'd estimate only about 60% of what I've read are actually on there, so I do blank on titles quite a lot.

** The best ones honestly just carve themselves into your memory. I read Cassandra Clare's Draco Trilogy when it was new (yes, I'm a million years old) and never forgot it despite the fact I was basically a kid... also you can just favorite on on most sites to look back on!

** Usually I remember the ones that I keep coming back to. The stories that I enjoy reading more than once.

Sometimes I stumble over the same stories and then remember I have already read them after a chapter or two.

If I enjoy a certain writing style I remember the author.

** I go to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/favorites/story.php]] and set the sort to "Sort by Date Added" and to Harry Potter. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/favorites/story.php?sort=added&categoryid=224&userid=0][Cheater Link]]

Then I jump around pages depending on how far back I remember reading it.If I read a fic to the end, and I like it enough to read later? I favorite both the fic and the Author.

I might end up doing an excel sheet in my googledrive eventually.
