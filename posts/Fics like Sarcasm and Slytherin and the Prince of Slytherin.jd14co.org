Question is in title


** I agree with this other person. Outside of Prince of Slytherin, and Sarcasm and Slytherin, Ashes of Chaos is the only other WBWL type fanfic that is pretty great. Unfortunately most of these types of fanfics aren't all that great.

*** Not for nothing, but Harry Potter and the boy who lived by TheSanti, despite being incomplete is pretty damn good.

**** 'Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived' is good, but I wouldn't say its similar to Prince of Slytherin, Ashes of Chaos, and Sarcasm and Slytherin. Pretty much the only thing they have in common is that Harry has a more "light" aligned twin brother.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up abused and alone and unlike his brother, he quickly had to learn to fend for himself. Abuse changes people on both a physical and psychological level, so when Harry Potter showed up at Hogwarts just a little bit different to how people may have expected, they really ought not to have been surprised. They should not have asked themselves what had happened, they should have asked themselves what would possibly happen next. WBWL, Slytherin Harry, Fem Voldemort, Grey Harry.
