** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer), Hermione finds a magical way to free all elves, who immediately turn against their owners and slaughter a substantial fraction of the wizarding population.

All this is a comparatively minor point of the fic's backstory, though.

*** Minor point: The elves who were treated decently just left. It was mostly the abused elves who slaughtered their former owners.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*** You would be wrong. Harry the supreme authority on wizard knowledge teaching Hermione how stupid she was for trying to free elves since they need to be slaves is a staple of many Harmony stories. A whole damn lot of authors simply can't stand the thought of Hermione being right about slaves and/or not being Harry's faithful follower.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Harry and Hermione are 'child prodigies'. Destiny managed to throw them together and they form a bond far stronger than any seen in the wizarding world. They use their intelligence to bring innovations into the world that have not been thought before.
