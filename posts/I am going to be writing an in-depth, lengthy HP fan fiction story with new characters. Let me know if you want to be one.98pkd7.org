** Bruce "The Spruce" McFahan. He's a loose guy: long, curly hair, all bleached, he has really tight jeans (crotch super visible) with holes in them, long leather boots, tight sweaters that accentuate his glamorous bod, he's got too many earrings and piercings and he always wears eye liner.

He would have been /the man/ in the 70s, but sadly for him, it's 2018 and the only people who look like that nowadays are over-the-top hip hop artists. He's the laughing stock of hogwarts, but he's an unapologetic lifer for rock 'n roll, and he will never change.

** Deborah Turning was a peculiar girl, even for a witch.

She'd grown up in a halfblood home, used to the eccentric mesh of wizarding and muggle lifestyles. Her family was quaint, nearly idyllic in their suburbanite style of living. White picket fence, a largely American venture, but idyllic all the same; thoroughly enchanted to repel garden gnomes and other unwanted pests. Their sitting room was host to an affordable, yet quite nearly fancy television set placed within a heavily warded circuit, to prevent the electronics untimely demise. They even owned both a crup and a kneazle, the two animals constantly chasing one another around the house, like some sort thoroughly annoying wizarding childrens show.

But Deborah Turning was peculiar.

There was an issue she'd had since birth, one that affected her in ways that many could not predict, nor could they imagine the consequences of. It was rare, so incredibly rare that there had only been a few cases of the same affliction preceding hers, the most famous in which the wizard that was afflicted by this particular disease ended up living a very short and unhealthy life, having been slaughtered by a mob of furious villagers.

Deborah's problem, was that she could not tell the difference between a biscuit, and a baby.

For as long as she could remember, she'd never been able to discern between the two. In fact, she ended up developing a crippling fear of large biscuits, particularly chocolate coated digestives. Deborah and her family had discovered her condition when she had nearly devoured a baby girl of only six months, as she had been so excited at the prospect of a person sized biscuit that she immediately grabbed the gigantic delicacy and began to gnaw on it.

When confronted, she could only say, "But it looked so /delicious./" Thus terrifying her family so deeply that they considered simply leaving her out to freeze, convinced that their child was a budding sociopath, and would someday move on to larger game. Like dogs, or an escaped zoo animal.

They soon found themselves quite relieved when they realized that she only considered children a year of age and below to be potential meals, yet they still researched her affliction thoroughly. Her mother and father had taken her to a plethora of healers, all of which were left scratching their heads at Deborah's odd conundrum.

One day, an old and wizened man stopped by their door. His beard tickled his knees, well groomed and bound towards the bottom of his chest. He wore garish robes of lavender and turquoise, prancing unicorns dancing across its surface, snorting playfully as they pawed at immaterial ground. The man was Albus Dumbledore. Defeater of Grindelwald, and Devourer of Many a Sweet.

"Quite a serious problem, I do say," he grumbled thoughtfully, running his long and weathered fingers through the sharp white of his beard.

Deborah's mother, a slight woman by the name of Mary, stood there with her eyes wide, fear and worry emanating from her. "But what's wrong with her? Do you know, Dumbledore? Do you know what's wrong with my little girl?" she cried, hands clasped together and her brow crinkled.

Her husband, Gregory, rubbed her shoulder comfortingly, a grim look on his face. "Dear, please. Let the man do his work."

She nodded contritely, directing her tear filled gaze towards the living legend in front of her. "Please," she choked, her voice thick and strained. "Please save my little girl."

Dumbledore smiled, a genial thing, unaffected by the tension in the air. "Fear not," he said, raising his chin proudly. "I have run into this issue once before, why I myself have dealt with the same thing personally."

Mary's eyes widened in shock. "You? /You/ have the same disease?"

Dumbledore nodded, clapping his hands together. "Why, I remember it like it was yesterday," he mentioned with a far away look, all of a sudden flooded by a wave of fond nostalgia. "I was venturing through Godric's Hollow, the town in which I grew up. I and my brother had just played the most delightful game of marbles, and I was to head home and help my mother prepare dinner. On my way, I happened to spot what looked to be the largest lemon drop I'd ever come across in my entire life, simply resting in a stroller." He shakes his head good naturedly, a wry chuckle escaping his lips. "Why, I went up to it and began to lick it. I was quite confused when I didn't taste lemon, but an odd, salty flavour. I was even more confused when the lemon drop began to giggle!"

The Turnings looked between themselves, looks of shock and no small amount of horror passing between their shared gaze.

Dumbledore continued speaking as if they'd never shared a look of abject terror, either choosing to ignore them, or completely unaware of the impending panic attack that he'd induced in the two worried parents, who were now convinced that the man in front of them had not been playing with marbles, but had lost his own entirely.

"So, after turning heel and fleeing from what seemed to be a sentient lemon drop, I arrived home. I regaled my parents and siblings with my tale, describing the peculiar sweet and how it seemed to take great pleasure in being tasted. My parents were understandably worried, and from thereon-out decided to always provide me with a bag of lemon drops, so that I may never make the mistake of confusing an infant with the sweet I so love."

"Yes, but how does this help our daughter?" Gregory interrupted, terribly confused.

The ancient wizard smiled his dazzling smile, one that promised all was well.

The Turning's were unaffected by his display of friendliness, instead shirking away from him in the fear that he may too confuse them for a tasty treat.

"Why, it's simple!" he effused, moustache twitching happily.

"What's so simple?" the two parents replied, a faint glimmer of hope shimmering within them.

Dumbledore's smile grew even wider, if such a thing was even possible. He leaned back on his heels childishly, bouncing back and forth on his feet like he'd been holding it in for a good while and just now realized that he had to use the loo.

"We provide her with a lifetime supply of biscuits!"

** Name: Shelby Larson

Appearance: Short with boyish figure, pale, black hair usually in ponytail, blue eyes

Personality: Rather shy. Intelligent. Very sarcastic, but only with people she likes. Tends to go with the flow, avoids arguments but when she can't, she easily wins them.

Likes: Loves puzzles and riddles. Every now and then sends one to the Quibbler. Favourite subjects are non wanded ones, especially Herbology, Potions and Care of Magical Creatures. She spoils the hell out of the cat, Dahlia.

Dislikes: Stupid people, Transfiguration and to every one's everlasting horror, tea. She is rather sick of people mentioning that and then acting as if she kicked their puppy.

Note. She is one of the school's bigger suppliers of outside goods. She specialises in salty snacks, seeds and nuts (you're laughing, but she's making a mint off of health freaks and Ravenclaws who can't study without eating), although somebody is beginning to move on her territory and she. is. /pissed./

** Anaba Addington: She's tall, skinny, and muscular, with short gray hair and brown eyes. She's a pureblood in Hufflepuff, with a wandmaker father who wanders the world looking for unique parts to test for wands, and an herbalist mother who runs the potion supply shop in Hogsmeade, Addington Aromatics.

She's what could easily be called a model student, with good grades, a prodigy in Charms, she helps to tutor other students with their Charms classwork. She's also quite the athlete, a beater for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and a member of the dueling club.

(Edit: forgot that her worst subject is potions, which she just can't get a grasp on, despite her mother being a gifted herbalist.)

She's always got a smile on her face and a nice word to say to anyone she meets.

Her biggest quirk is her hair - due to a contaminated polyjuice potion from her mother's youth, her mother has had a few traits of a chinchilla her entire life, which got passed onto Anaba - her hair is incredibly dense and soft, and she has to wash it with dust rather than water.

** *Name*: Ulysses Ian Quirke

*Age*: 13

*Gender*: Male

*Appearance*: Short kid with wavy brown hair and squinty dark brown eyes. Very generic clothing. His prized possession is a pair of self-sizing dragonhide hiking boots that he won in an extended 'Risk or Riddle' competition last year.

*Celebrity sim*: Joseph Gordon-Levitt (in his younger days)

*Personality*: He's defensive about his origins and doesn't trust anyone who brings up the magical blood issue. Very focused on his work. Not comfortable with his growing feelings about girls, and embarrassed at how distracting they can be. Defensive about having no money but what his scholarship allows.

Also as a result of his poor background, he's a bit of a pack rat, keeping all sorts of things others might discard as broken or useless, if he can find a value to them. Sometimes, those things end up in his collection before they're actually thrown away by the prior owner.

*Academia*: Ian is good with outdoor stuff, as he treasures the time away from urban Manchester. He has a cheap-ish wand (black walnut and centaur mane), so he doesn't tend to do well with Charms and Transfiguration, preferring to use prepared items, including potions. He's quite excited to be learning Arithmancy and Runes, so that his tinkering can be made more permanent.

*Character/Family History*: Ian (and he'd rather be called that) is the only son of Orla Quirke, a muggleborn witch who was sorted into Ravenclaw the year they hosted the Tri-wizard tournament (canon!). Orla had been a victim in many ways- she was an orphan whose parents were never identified. The orphanage had given her the last name 'Quirke' as a joke.

Orla found herself in the weakest possible position when the war over bloodstatus once again rose to prominence. During her attempts to find a decent situation, she was seduced and knocked up by an unknown wizard. Falling back on what little resources she had, she returned to the orphanage and bore Ian, raising him there for several years before succumbing to the self-destructive depression that her situation had brought on.

Ian was kept by the orphanage matron Mrs. Nettleburn, who knew of the truth about magic through raising Orla. Once accidental magic had manifested, Ian was haphazardly taught to use his growing Talent to help smooth the operation of the orphanage. This began a few years before his letter for Hogwarts arrived, so he has a few wandless tricks up his sleeve.

*Parents*: Mother - Orla Quirke, deceased; Father - "that slimy bastard" (otherwise unnamed) is probably still alive, but who knows?

** Cameo character:

Princeton "Caterpillar" Pimbleton is a well renown (in his field... so not very renown at all) 50y/o near squib Magi-Entomologist who specializes in the study of south-American magical insects. Due to his lackluster magical prowess, he took the habit of traveling the muggle way, and even took part in some muggle scientific expeditions, discretely collecting magical bugs and making sure the muggles would stay safe from dangerous magical species.

He is killed by the death eaters sometime during the second war. No one really cared (jeez I've managed to depress myself in 4 words xD but they make the story more powerful, if the heroes stumble upon it by accident).

** I made a few NPCs for a Harry Potter game I wanted to run a while back but never did anything with them. If you feel like adopting any or all of them go right ahead lol.

*Lore Character*

*Name*: EglÄ—

*Gender*: F

*Age*: Deceased

*Appearance*: Currently, a tree.

*BG*: In the distant past a non-magical girl named EglÄ— was born, said to have gained the love and trust of one of the only known continental Parseltongues, a wizard Lord known as Å½ilvinas the Serpent. EglÄ—'s beauty captivated him and despite their differing backgrounds he went to procure her hand in marriage the traditional way, through asking her family. His attempts failed and at least he took her and apparated her to his warded residence where she may never leave. Many years, sons, and a daughter later, he, at last, gave her permission to return to see her family who were as jubilant to see her as they were furious. Her family decides to use her life as a bargaining chip to lure the Lord in, putting a knife to her throat and telling her to call her husband using a magical instrument she had given him, and when he appeared they ambushed him, striking a mortal blow and in the fray she and her children were also struck and lay bleeding. It is said in his grief that the last of his body turned into magic itself, spelling EglÄ— and her children into trees. The exact details of the story are difficult to follow and the account is regarded as a children's story with the moral being to distrust muggles. However some keen minds may note the similarities between the tale's end and the rumored passing of Merlin, self-transfiguration into a tree surely doesn't seem to be an isolated incident in wizarding culture..?\\
Is it also mere coincidence that, among Wandmakers, there is a rumor of a certain wood that endows wands with a curious property, the gift of Parseltongue passed down not through blood but through craftsmanship?

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Taken largely from an existing folktale. Finding the details of the folktale and how it corresponded to actual wizarding history could make a subplot in and of itself. Or trying to find that tree and dealing with magical creatures who may be protecting it could be a fun little adventure. The end goal I envisioned of gaining a wand that allows a character to have Parseltongue when it's being wielded is also a neat, albeit not particularly useful, power up for a character.

*Adult Characters*

*Name*: Carrie Vixenvys

*Gender*: F

*Age*: 41

*Appearance*: Strawberry blonde hair cut in a messy bob and downturned gray eyes, a pinched and heart-shaped face, a lanky figure. Wears athletic robes even when it's not strictly appropriate.

*BG*: A muggleborn who originally attended Ilvermorny and later immigrated to Wizarding London. As a schoolgirl she could only have been described as a tomboy and assuredly was an avid broom racer. With her love of flying and a proficiency at charms, this witch went on to innovate shortly after graduation intending to bridge the gap between the wizarding world and the muggle world by enchanting cars, motorcycles, scooters, skateboards - anything with wheels, she's had a go at trying to make it faster to great sucess. With the success of her business, named Vix-a-Vis Moto, she intends to further innovate by making a magical superhighway codenamed The Foxhole between Britain and reaching through the entirety mainland Europe, so think of a magical chunnel and U.S. Route 50.

*Quirks*: American accent (in as much as it can be represented in writing, ha), and an adrenaline junkie no matter her age. Very stubborn and can be ruthless about getting her way. To her credit though she doesn't deign to be condescending.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Depending on the content of the story I see her introducing a few conflicts or tools for the characters. Want a new wizarding sport? She could sponsor a tournament for it, or gift the school trial versions of another way to transport that isn't just a broom. Or even something mundane like wizarding driving ed. She could also raise questions about the statute of Secrecy in the plot and there could be a schism about whether to throw support behind it or prove that it shouldn't go through in classic students-besting-the-adults HP fashion.

*Name*: Cher T. Windyfield

*Gender*: F

*Age*: 26

*Appearance*: Auburn hair plaited from her face into a messy bun. An oval face with delicate features, bright blue eyes, and full lips. Tends to wear dragonhide accessories as in, a wand holster, satchels, boots, and gloves, beneath her professor's robes.

*BG*: Hogwarts attended. A pureblood who went on to become an auror, much to the chagrin of her former classmates (and her own family) who pegged her to become a career housewife to some wealthy pureblood because of her good looks. As an auror she proved she was more than just a pretty face and her talents wielding her aspen & dragon heartstring wand ended up making more than a few enemies from using, ahem, excessive force... Which would prove to be her downfall. She was called to disrupt a particularly nasty incident of mugglebaiting by a pair of brothers, and handily defeated them. They were sent St. Mungo's for months because of the spell she used to defeat them, and then off to Azkaban. Seeking revenge, the mother of the brothers and one of their wives devised a Dark Arts ritual to curse Cher, baiting her when she wasn't clocked into the job (amazing what an Imperio on an innocent young wizard can accomplish) and her sense of personal justice ensured she followed alone. While the incident was recorded for the DMLE, the exact details of the confrontation are unknown, though it ended with two witches missing, one ancestral property torched to the ground, and one Miss Windyfield out of commission with a deadly transfiguration curse which turns flesh into wood spreading from her left calf to the rest of her body. Each year it spreads just a little more, her feet already stiffened, and her resignation from being an auror was "encouraged." Now, she finds herself as a Hogwarts Professor (DADA? Transfiguration?), a favorite of the students for her experience and the cause of many a schoolboy crush. In spite of everything that's happened Cher tries to be optimistic and always encourages her students to reach their full potential. Still, between classes, she does try to find a cure...

*Quirks*: One of those people who answers a question with another question, a person could have started a conversation with her starting with "How was your day?" and end up themself revealing all the insecurities eating away at them. Seems to have eyes on the back of her head (it's really just Auror training) and is quick to catch out lies and misdirections.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Depends on the direction you want to take. If presented in a positive light, she could be a role model for witches to live up to their talents, and there could be a minor plot to try and assist her in finding a way to beat the curse. She could also be used as something of a timer, if there's a plot going on involving the Dark Arts perhaps an antagonist figure is trying to speed up the rate of the curse to remove her from the post etc, or play up the trauma to make her a tragic figure or source of angst. I could also see her working with some tweaks as an antagonist, just make her a little more desperate, a little more focused on Pureblood students who might have something in their family heirlooms that could provide the answer she seeks. It's also deliberate that the family who cursed her is nameless, for even more drama you could have the descendants of that family attending Hogwarts as either students or faculty.

*** *Students*

*Name*: Roi Citrinatus

*Gender*: M

*Age*: (Up to the author)

*Appearance*: Honey-brunette hair kept in a trendy fauxhawk, light hazel eyes and a square jaw. Slightly higher than average height, broad-shouldered, tends to dress nicely.

*BG*: A half-blood born to a well-to-do wealthy family (both halves of his heritage are considerably well off), Roi is a young man who is going to "go places," as most of his professors agree. His mother, a Hufflepuff alumni witch, is reportedly trying to discover the components of the prima materia to create her own version of a Philosopher's stone, a Panacea which can reverse any spell effect and cure magical diseases such as lycanthropy. As for Roi himself, he's amiable enough, sure, but he has his own internal balancing act of keeping too many irons in the fire. A well-placed word here, a whisper of a rumor there, it's curious that although no-one would ever say Roi was a gossip he always does tend to know the who/what/when/why of what happens in Hogwarts. And it's so hard to distrust his easy smile...

*Quirks*: He's a preppy Prefect type, fussy over details although not enough to be bossy. Keeps out of trouble, as far as the Professors are concerned. A difficult person to actually be close friends with although he does seem to go out of his way to know just about everybody. Excels in Herbology and Potions.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: A rumor mill and resource character if there ever was one. Depending on the composition of characters he provides an easy "rival" (hey, I heard you started this rumor? and then trying to pin it on him, which presents its own set of difficulties), an information well for gossip, or for small loans and such to get things inside the castle. In other words the easiest ways to develop him are to give him a comeuppance or to get him on the "good" characters' side.

*Name*: Gale Ollivander

*Gender*: F

*Age*: (Up to the author)

*Appearance*: Extremely fluffy neck-length platinum blonde hair, like a dandelion. Short, dark brown-eyed, with a round face, full cheeks, and is missing one of her canine teeth (which may be regrown as the plot demands).

*BG*: A canon character descendent, for once. Born to Garrick Ollivander's son (who is unnamed according to the wiki, but I'll call Garrison), Gale wants to take over the family business but in her own way. She wants to do something different, which in her mind, equates to moving away from the tried and true wand woods and cores that Ollivander's traditionally offers. Dried flobberworm core? Sphinx hair or Werewolf fur? Oh, what about Mandarake wood and Acronite stem? Her own teeth? (* It's a rumor of, ahem, unknown origin that she was mad enough to try it. Although other sources claim her tooth was lost from one of her experimental core-wand matchups blowing up, literally, in her face.) She's not nearly old enough to really know what she's doing, but that isn't stopping her from experimenting in the least.

*Quirks*: Mischievious and playful, she'll do anything once just to try it. A force of chaotic good. Always looking for new experiences and obsessively hoards odds-and-ends.

*Potential Plot Relevance*: Can drag other characters in to trouble, such as going on excursions to the Forbidden forest to collect things. Can be a frequent face in detentions or tip the scales of House points to skew negatively. Maybe a character might actually trust her and want a unique wand, though the success of that is of course left up to you to imagine.
