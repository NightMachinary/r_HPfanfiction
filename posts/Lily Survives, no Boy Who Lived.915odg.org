** Not a real story, but someone wrote a few snippets on Space Battles:

--------------

Claymore mines. The best protection a mother can offer to her child. Shame James was hit as well, but it's not like she didn't warn him about the concussive force.

[Snip 1]

Lily: I am leaving tomorrow.

Petunia: Another one of your "errands"?

Lily: Yes. A new menace is rising in Australia.

Petunia: Is it that important that you can't stay another week?

Lily: Is it one of those discussions?

Petunia: Just tell me why you think you have to do it.

Lily: Because somebody has to. And it may as well be me. I have the means and inclination.

Petunia: At a cost of your son?

Lily: I left him in good hands, didn't I?

Petunia: But you left him.

Lily: ...

Lily: It will be easier when he starts Hogwarts. For you and for him. He'll be away for the most part of the year, among children of his age. He'll make friends. And I'll make sure to visit him on summer.

Petunia: I am still against sending him there. Didn't you tell me that the last war ended too abruptly? Tensions not resolved, merely put on hold? Do you really want to send him into that world?

Lily: I have no choice. He is too famous now. I can't hide him.

Petunia: He is famous because of you, you know? If you didn't disappear, if you didn't let the fools draw their conclusions...

Lily: You know how that happened. I was in a bad place back then. With James' death and everything else I... just... couldn't... The deed is done now.

Petunia: You can rectify it. You can reveal yourself to them, lift the burden from him.

Lily: My death is too important. It allows me to move more freely.

Petunia: You mean it makes life easier for you. What about him?

Lily: ...

Petunia: Just... When will you stop? The boy needs his mother.

Lily: When I find salvation. The end to all conflicts.

Petunia: There isn't one.

Lily: I know.

--------------

[Snip 2]

Lily: ...So I used a memory charm to make that guy believe he's my ally, and he turned against his boss.

Man: A memory charm? In the middle of a combat?

Lily: It was just a few memories. They wouldn't hold under any kind of close examination, but he didn't have time to think about it, he needed to react fast. It was a bit of a gamble, admittedly, but I needed backup badly.

Man: Hmmm... So, how do you feel about it?

Lily: Why does that matter?

Man: Feelings are important. To put them into words is half of my job, really.

Lily: It was a simple calculation. Their deaths would mean saving dozens. How they die wasn't important. If he believed to be my ally in the last moments of his life, well, he doesn't care about it now.

Man: Hmmm... Not a very healthy attitude, if you ask me. Well, I guess I can work on it.

Lily: Sure, you do that. Now, about what we've talked earlier...

Man: You can count on me. I'll watch over Harry the best I can.

Lily: And call me if anything happen. You have the emergency portkey.

Man: Of course. Though... isn't it a bit paranoid?

Lily: ...

Man: ...Well, maybe not for you.

Lily: After what happened last year... Better be cautious. Just in case.

Man: Can't disagree with you. Hogwarts is not what it used to be during our time.

Lily: Things change. Rarely for the better. I'll be leaving now. Busy schedule.

Man: I should be moving as well. Good luck, Lily.

Lily: Same to you, Gilderoy. Send me a copy of your book once you finish to prettify it.

*** [Snip 3] - Part 1

Lily: So, six horcruxes.​

Dumbledore: Two are captured by now. Four remain.​

Lily: For how long did you know about them?​

Dumbledore: I had suspected since the war. I witnessed many interrogations of Death Eaters, you know. Some of them boasted of Voldemort's immortality. It could be empty tales, of course, but it was obvious that Voldemort did something to himself, judging by his appearance. Even if he wasn't immortal, knowing more about him and the powers he had in his disposal could not be useless. And so I was gathering information about him since then. Horcruxes were an obvious conclusion: they are one of the more known and available routes to immortality, and I believe he could learn about them from Hogwarts library.​

Lily: Really? Something like that is available to students?​

Dumbledore: It was a different time back then. Less humane.​

Lily: If you knew for so long, why didn't you act sooner?​

Dumbledore: I didn't know, I suspected. Voldemort is cunning. He made sure to erase all traces of his activities he could. My first solid lead was Horace Slughorn - perhaps as cunning as Voldemort himself, he managed to evade attempts to assassinate him.​

Lily: Really? Professor Slughorn? He always was... slippery, but I thought him relatively harmless.​

Dumbledore: He is, for the most part. But he trades in favors and he trades in knowledge. And if someone wishes to learn of... less pleasant matters, he is content with knowing that it was not his hand that held the wand... After some admittedly heavy-handed persuasion, I confirmed that Voldemort did indeed create horcruxes, and I've learned their number. It was only the beginning of my investigation, of course. It took me years to track a single horcrux hidden in the underground complex in Albania - Nott family owns the land, you see, indirectly of course. It is filled with monsters of all sorts as well as some heavy defensive magic.​

Lily: The ring is from there, I trust?​

Dumbledore: No. I did not dare to make a move before knowing the locations of all horcruxes as well as being sure I could get them all at once. The diary was enchanted to inform Voldemort should they be destroyed. I suspect the rest of them are as well.​

Lily: But not when they are moved?​

Dumbledore: The diary was also enchanted to conceal the traces of dark magic I could've detected it by otherwise. With its destruction, however, that enchantment fades and the alarm activates. Some of them would have enchantments around them to inform Voldemort of their status, I wager. I've managed to activate the alarm on the diary - better to let Voldemort think it was destroyed in the fight than that it is in my possession.​

Lily: You didn't manage to remove the alarm completely? That would be useful.

​ Dumbledore: Unfortunately, no. It was more important to activate the alarm than to experiment with it, and at the time it was the only horcrux I had in my possession. As for the ring... Well, all will be revealed in time... The underground complex was the easiest location to find. Voldemort was careful of not leaving traces, but creation of something that grandiose cannot be concealed completely. He exchanged secrecy in favor of power of its protections.​ ​

Lily: Other horcruxes utilize different strategies, I take it.​

Dumbledore: Yes. The second horcrux, the Cup of Hufflepuff, is hidden simply and elegantly: Voldemort entrusted it to Bellatrix Black who put it into Gringotts.​

Lily: So that's how Quirrell managed to break in.​

Dumbledore: Pieced it together already?​

Lily: I've studied what little is known about the bank's protections. It's nearly impenetrable even for someone like the Adversary. The horcrux must be the answer, obviously, though I wouldn't known the exact mechanism. ​

Dumbledore: The piece of Voldemort's soul contained inside the Cup has corrupted Gringotts security enchantment. To put it simply, it gives Voldemort a backdoor into Gringotts.

Lily: Damn... At this point it would be easier to burn the whole thing to the ground... Underground, I suppose.​

Dumbledore: I was actually hoping you would have less... excessive means of retrieving the horcrux.​

Lily: Fire solves many problems. We'll need a cooperation from goblins to get a better option.​ ​

Dumbledore: I could provide you with more insight in the matter. As you can imagine, goblin security was of a special interest to me for the last decade. But I suppose we should discuss strategies later, once you have the whole picture... The third horcrux was in personal possession of another one of Voldemort's most trusted followers. i knew it was a possibility, of course, but I couldn't be sure of the identity of the keeper. For all his faults, Voldemort knew how to attract faithful people. The captured Death Eaters either didn't know anything or managed to preserve the information even under Alastor's interrogation. Severus, likewise, found nothing. As recent events showed us, however, it was...​

Lily: Lucius Malfoy.​

Dumbledore: Not quite. His father, Abraxas, was the true keeper. Lucius inherited the horcrux not fully aware of its nature. I suspect that Voldemort placed too heavy vows of secrecy on Abraxas for his own good, though it is only a theory. Lucius used the diary in his bid to discredit me and cast a shadow on Weasley family... And you know how that story ended.​

Lily: Sorry for costing you.​

Dumbledore: ...My political position recovered from that hit, thank you, but I think it is not what you should feel sorry about.​

Lily: We've been over it. I have my methods. They get results.​

Dumbledore: Cure can be far worse than disease sometimes.​

Lily: You are the one who invited me here. If you want me to leave...​ ​

Dumbledore: ...Let's continue then. The capture of the diary was a major breakthrough that I needed, in fact. Studying it allowed me to develop new tracking charms and with them to locate the other horcruxes.​

Lily: Just like this?​

Dumbledore: You should know how much work goes into the creation of new spells, especially tailored for such a specific and difficult task. It took me three years to sufficiently refine them. And while it allowed me to easily locate the fourth horcrux - the ring - buried in the middle of nowhere in Siberia-​

Lily: Wait, why Siberia?​

Dumbledore: Dense enough magical fauna that normal tracking charms wouldn't pick the traces of Voldemort's movements and actions, desolate enough that you could lose a village there. In fact, I think that happened on a few occasions, back when there was a schism in Orthodox Church...​

Lily: I am sorry for interrupting.​

Dumbledore: Nobody appreciates history this days... Now, where was I? Oh, yes, while the charms allowed me to locate the fourth horcrux rather easily, complications arose with the final two. You see, the fifth horcrux is constantly moving from place to place.​

Lily: The adversary entrusted it to one of his with orders to stay out of trouble and watch for tails, I take it?​

Dumbledore: No. The fifth horcrux is one of Voldemort's follower. Fenrir Grayback, to be specific.​

Lily: ...Shit. You said horcruxes were indestructible, save for a few specific measures?​

Dumbledore: Yes. I am sure you can see the value of an invincible lieutenant.​

Lily: That does explain why I couldn't kill him. I assumed that he managed to increase the inherent magical resistance by giving in to the beast inside him.​

Dumbledore: As many others did, undoubtedly.​

Lily: Good thing I decided against trying to replicate it.​

Dumbledore: ...I imagine it is.​ ​ Lily: So, the last horcrux?​

Dumbledore: Hogwarts.​

Lily: It is in Hogwarts?​

Dumbledore: No, it is Hogwarts. That's why I had troubles locating them. The charms were confused as I was inside the target.​

Lily: Wait, so the adversary can see inside Hogwarts like in Gringotts? Or affect people there?​

Dumbledore: That was my concern as well once I've found the truth. Still is, to some degree. I can assure you that the horcrux has no effects that I can find. It is not a guarantee, which is why we meet in my home rather then in the castle, but I am reasonably sure of it. If Voldemort could spy on me, the effects would be evident by now. He did not move the ring from its location, as an example.​ ​ Lily: I see... So, that would be all horcruxes... Who else knows about it?​

Dumbledore: I was careful to cover my tracks. People I questioned were Obliviated. So it's just you, me and Severus.​

Lily: Severus?​

Dumbledore: I understand your reservations, but I do trust him.​

Lily: Well, not like I can do much about it now... Though the list seems rather exclusive even for me. If something happened to you...​

Dumbledore: Secrecy was mandatory. Should Voldemort learn that I know his secret, he would move the horcruxes, as I said before, and the information I've gathered on their defenses will become useless. Or worse, he could create a new one.​

Lily: Why didn't he already? He knew that Slughorn knew about the number, and he failed to kill the man. Creating a secret horcrux seems pretty reasonable.​

Dumbledore: Seven is a potent number. Six horcruxes, combined with the last soul fragment inside of Voldemort himself create a stable system keeping him sane and preventing... more profound physical changes than he experienced already. He wouldn't risk upsetting the balance without the need, but once we move...​

Lily: It will become a strong possibility. We'll need to act fast.​

Dumbledore: Preferably providing enough distractions to occupy Voldemort's time with the war. As a small mercy, the ritual for creating a horcrux is rather elaborate. Not something that could be done in one's spare time.​ ​

*** [Snip 3] - Part 2

Lily: So, why did you invite me? You seem to have everything worked out.​

Dumbledore: I am dying, Lily.​

Lily: ...​

Dumbledore: The ring... was more than I anticipated. In my foolishness, I believed I managed to remove the enchantments from it. In retrospect, I see now that the task was easier than tampering with the diary, which should've been my clue. Still, the temptation the ring was offering was too great for me to resist. And so I put it on my finger, activating a curse that was woven deeper into the ring than other enchantments, the second defense of the horcrux after the secrecy.​

Lily: What could possibly caused you to do such a stupid thing?​

Dumbledore: A chance for atonement.​

Lily: What?​

Dumbledore: The ring is a heirloom of the Gaunt family, but in truth it is just an ornament for the true treasure: the Resurrection Stone.​

Lily: Deathly Hallows... It's a myth, a fairy tale.​

Dumbledore: The story of three brothers and the Deathly Hallows is a fairy tale, true. But Deathly Hallows themselves are quite real, I assure you. Didn't you know that the heirloom of Potters, the invisibility cloak that saved your son from so many troubles, is one of them?​

Lily: Always assumed that the sign was engraved by James as an excuse to brag.​

Dumbledore: It is authentic, as far as I can tell. Of course, the importance of the Hallows is greatly exaggerated for the most part. The Cloak was merely the first of its kind, a prototype. The Wand does give you a great power, but it does not replace the skill and control. Someone who tries to use it without being a skilled wizard to begin with is more likely to be hurt than to accomplish anything. The Stone, however... The Stone does exactly what it meant to do. Calls the spirits of the dead from the afterlife - or ghosts, should the dead you wish to speak with be unfortunate enough to be stuck there. The spirits are distant, not fully aware of their surroundings, craving to return to their rightful place... But they are real. You can speak with them, and they would answer.​

Lily: ...I... understand the temptation now.​

Dumbledore: Yes... I am sorry for approaching the matter.​

Lily: It's fine... How long do you have?​

Dumbledore: Two years at best. I will be likely bedridden for the last few months. Severus managed to conceal the curse in my hand, but it will spread, slowly.​

Lily: Amputation?​

Dumbledore: The curse is not anchored to flesh, but to my very being. Flesh merely shows the effects. Without a hand, the curse will simply progress faster.​ ​ Lily: ...What is my role?​

Dumbledore: We disagree on many things, but I cannot deny your skills and dedication to your goals. You are the best candidate for the job I can find. Between my - admittedly waning - power and your ingenuity, we stand the best chance of defeating Voldemort.​

Lily: And if we fail?​

Dumbledore: I left behind my journals and memories. They will find their way in the hands of people who would need them.​

Lily: You aren't speaking of Harry?​

Dumbledore: No. His continuing involvement in those matters is a source of great guilt for me. I would like to leave him out of it, if I can help it. It is, after all, our duty as adults to ensure the safety of children. And there are people willing to do that even if we perish. That is something Voldemort could never understand: even if you have no power, even if you do not strike fear in the hearts of your enemies, there still could be people willing to fight for you.​

Lily: You are rambling.​

Dumbledore: I am old, I can afford it. ...But you are right, we shouldn't waste time on sentiments. I presume you need a more detailed information on horcruxes, their locations and defenses before formulating a strategy.​ ​ Lily: Yes... I have a last question not related to them, though...​

Dumbledore: Yes?​

Lily: The Stone... Is it, in itself, a horcrux?​

Dumbledore: ...No. Given its nature, I suspect it would be a volatile combination. The ring itself is a horcrux. The Stone... I managed to remove. It was a mistake to try and use it, but I've paid for it and... I just needed to know... It is free of the curse now. I presume you want to use it as well?​

Lily: ...Yeah.​

Dumbledore: It would be hypocritical of me to deny you such a request. I warn you, though, you may not find what you seek. The communication with spirits is...​

Lily: What? No, no, you misunderstood. I am not looking to summon the dead. I... don't think I am ready to speak to people I care about.​

Dumbledore: ...What do you seek then?​

Lily: ...Ghosts.​

Dumbledore: Didn't you say you weren't ready?​

Lily: Not ghosts of people I care about. Ghosts of my victims. Do you even know how many dark wizards would decide to spend eternity haunting their murderer?​

Dumbledore: ...​

Lily: It's easy to give them a slip, most of the time, but it's not like they really have anything else to do then tracking me down. I've even learned the ritual that binds them to place and managed to catch a few, but the rest know how to avoid it now. They are coordinating, you see.​

Dumbledore: ...​

Lily: Good thing most of them are not clever enough or too insane to give me real troubles by spying for my enemies. Still, it is bound to happen eventually, and I would very much like to fix the problem sooner rather than later. With the Stone, I can catch them all in one place... Should it be a desert or an ocean?​

Dumbledore: ...Let me show you the Stone. ​

** I remember reading fic with a similar premise. Though, it's a Dimension Travel, where Harry Potter is sent to a world where what you said happened. And Lily hasn't been able to get back to have a normal life.

She lives alone in a flat and is the Order of the Phoenix's Assassin.(They send her to eliminate death eaters). Harry was appalled that his mother(or a version of her) kills people.

There was like 4 or 5 chapters in that fic.

Oh, Possible Warning. I think, I came across that fic while I was combing through Harry/Lily pairings. Don't know why or for what reasons.
