** I believe it's abandoned but Maybe They Did Know What They Were Doing. It's a marriage contract and Lord!Potter set after Sirius dies. An enjoyable 12 or so chapters.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17157173/chapters/40342565]]) Harry Potter, PI. Harry and Pansy are not romantically involved, but they are good friends and detective partners. It /is/ Snape/Harry, which I'm not usually a fan of, but it's done post-Hogwarts so it's not too bad.
