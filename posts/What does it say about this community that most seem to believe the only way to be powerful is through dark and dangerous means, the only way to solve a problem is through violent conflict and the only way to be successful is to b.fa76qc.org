** You seem to write that like you'd want to see something else. If you're looking for Harry to talk the Death Eaters down, I think there's a couple fics around I've seen like that.

I think it really depends on the situation though. If it's a civilized conversation problem, then it'll probably be a civilized conversation solution. As bright as the Pineapple-Pizza debate burns at times, most people would see violent conflict as something of an overreaction. Whereas if someone believes you and yours are animals and worth only death, then tries to kill you, violent conflict is probably a proportionate response. It would be very interesting to see more dialogical and ideological solutions to the Death Eater issue though. Can you teach a genocidal bigot and all that. Probably not, but it'd be interesting to see it explored. :)

I don't know if I think the fandom entirely believe the latter though - I've seen a lot of fics where Harry and others have had to work to make things happen.

** Different reasons for each of these, really.

For the first, it's because it's a shortcut to power, and some people like writing about evil. For others, it's pushback against the idea of intrinsically evil magic. And for others yet, it's because it's interesting to write about morally ambiguous situations.

For solving a problem through violence, well - the main problem in canon, namely Voldemort and the Death Eaters, /does/ have to be solved through violence. There's no non-violent way of stopping them, as others have said. Not every problem is like that, of course, but when the heart of the story is such a conflict...

For the final observation you make, that's due to people thinking in tropes and wanting a fantasy world/escape. Many people have dreamed of being a prince/princess, of getting inherited wealth, etc - so combine that with the classic 'chosen one' trope, and you get a desire for wish fulfillment by making someone destined for greatness from birth (and have one's birth/ancestry be vitally important). This is the one I find most pervasive among the three personally, and one that I find overused, despite coming from canon.
