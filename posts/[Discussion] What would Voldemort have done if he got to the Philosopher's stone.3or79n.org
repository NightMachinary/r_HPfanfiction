After getting trough Snape's Riddle and somehow getting the Stone out of the Mirror, what next? He's stuck in a room somewhere below Hogwarts behind him a curtain of black fire that probably does *BAD THINGS*, below and round him most likely bedrock and above him who (Hermione) knows how many tons of solid stone? How would he have gotten out with the stone?

And /that/ is why Dumbledore's protections for the Stone were brilliant.

*** How? That was what I meant, how does he pass the fire with the potion in the other side?

And why I thought Dumbledore was smart because the potion trap was just before the actual stone distracting anyone from actually /thinking/ and taking the potion with them.

Or am I forgetting something important here?

**** The fire very likely wouldn't have stopped him. It was a protection put up by Snape, and Voldemort is Snape's superior by multiple factors when it comes to arcane knowledge. A bit of black fire doubtfully holds much of an obstacle to him. From what I can tell, the Mirror and it's ensnaring properties (people have wasted away in front of it) were the main obstacle for Voldemort. If he gets past that, then he very well could have gotten out of the castle by the time Dumbledore got back.

** I agree with [[/u/Lord_Anarchy][u/Lord_Anarchy]]. He got in, he can get out.

 

It would be AU, but it would be neat to read a fit where the traps were just the first layer and a distraction, so that when Voldemort grabbed the stone it sets off the big time traps (a la Indiana Jones) like portkeying a nesting Horntail dragon into the room, unshrinking and dispersing a giant container of mustard gas or the classic: poison darts and giants boulders :)

 

Also, what would happen if he actually took the Elixer of Life? Would it react negatively due to the possession or horcruxes?

*** Most likely the stone would be used to create an elixir that could be used in a resurrection ritual, or perhaps a resurrection ritual that sacrificed the stone itself.

I'm not sure about triggering another set of traps, though. That trigger would need to be person-specific, and the only way to do that would be to key it to Voldemort's magic, otherwise it would trigger when Harry gets it. If Dumbledore could do THAT, then he probably would have gotten that sample from an unsuspecting Quirrel, which means he would know it was Voldemort, and would be an asshole for not doing anything to boot him out of the school or capturing him.

***** Agreed. I think the key is limiting his "omniscience". Dude's got a mastery in Transfiguration and is scholarly enough to keep up on a lot of magical theory. That's it.

If you want to keep the idea of another set of traps, maybe make it so a distinction isn't needed. Up the difficulty of the first set, seal off the third floor corridor entirely, make it so harry genuinely /wasn't supposed to be there/ but somehow got in anyway, maybe by tailing Quirrel while he dealt with everything. Then everything hits the fan and only Harry's extreme brand of luck keeps him alive.

** He isn't trapped by the black fire, the fire only springs up when there is someone in the potions room. He would just walk out of the mirror chamber, take the potion and return to the troll, etc.

I think the whole gambit of defenses was to lull him into a sense of security. I think the mirror was the only real defense, and it was intended to trap the person there. 'Wasted away in front of it'

This is my beef with most 'Dumbledore sets Harry up' stories, I'm pretty sure if Harry just goes to bed that night the result is the same. Voldemort can't get the stone from the mirror on his own, and he'll abandon Quirrels weak-ass body.

** All the traps were easy enough for 3 kids to get through, someone of Voldemort's caliber could do it while sleepwalking.

Get the fuck out of the country on the back of Quirrel would be his next step. Once he is safely away from Dumbledore he would take the elixir of life, call his death eaters, and generally begin what happened starting in GoF 3 years early.

** I don't think the fire was meant to stop him.

I think that all the “traps” were meant to be distractions that would have delayed anyone for as long as was possible without killing or even really harming them (which Tom---and thus also Quirinus---managed to bypass in his genius and blah blah how great he is), while also alarming Dumbledore and enabling him to collect the hapless thief. Because that would fit Dumbledore's style and it's the last one that is the true trap (can't get the stone if you came for the stone unless you know what to do) and the rest is just there to give an appearance of an attempt while also possibly stopping adventure seekers from getting too far.

And the stone was probably a fake from the very beginning; after all, none but Albus, Nicholas, and Perenelle have the means to reliably check if it's the real deal without setting up a potions or even alchemy lab, which simply wasn't a possibility for anyone who would try to get the stone.

******* My belief, and I think a common one, is that Dumbledore can make portkeys through Hogwarts protections as the headmaster. He made the Triwizard cup a portkey to take the winner to the stage when they touched it. However not-Moody altered the portkey to add a destination. Since it was still the headmasters portkey it worked, and that is why Harry ended up on the stage when he went back to Hogwarts instead of in the middle of the maze.

This isn't contested by anything we see in canon, and it ruins the horrible horrible horrible 'portkey kidnap' scenarios that people do sometimes. Also it gives a lot of credit to Voldemort, because if he just needed Harry to touch a portkey than the whole 4th contestant thing was a massive waste of time and resources.

*** The stone doesn't make you immortal.

1) You still need to actually brew the "elixir of life", which is not something he was prepared for then and there (since there was no potion lab available)

2) The elixir only prolongs your life long as you keep taking it regularly. Once you stop you once again start dying. This is what happened with the Flamels.

**** But these are the effects the stone would have on a normal wizard. Voldemort was living a half life as a kind of parasite on Quirrell. It wasn't clear but my understanding was that the elixir would have restored voldemort to the power and independence he enjoyed while he was at the height of his powers. If Quirrell was able to help create the elixir as an inside man, voldemort could theoretically be made strong enough to overpower the obstacle course.

- Quirrel wasn't prepared to create the elixir of life inside the last chamber. The stone is just one ingredient of said elixir (albeit a very important one) and has no powers otherwise.
