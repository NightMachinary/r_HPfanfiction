** Voldemort.

He's an overrated villain of too many cliches and not enough substance. I mean even an average Joe knows not to use a password that can be guessed from your publicly available data, so who in his right mind would use places from his troubled childhood or known affiliates to hide their Horcruxes? That too all of them in one country! A smart villain would have hidden those things all over the world with nothing that could link them back to him. A competent villain would have a smarter set of sycophants who knew their jobs well. Death Eaters were pathetic, continuously getting beaten by teenagers or retired senior citizens for F's sake. I honestly cringe every time I read a Voldy who's as smart as a Pink Panther or Austin Powers villain.

*** I assume all of Voldemort's faults stem from the limitations of the genre he is in. He has to be threatening enough to be a threat, but not terrifying enough to traumatize the younger readers. He has to be a challenge for Harry and co., but it also has to be believable enough for three 17 year olds to beat him

**** The series starts with those limitations, yes. But there was no need to keep him as underwhelming as we get to the final confrontation. Rowling could have turned V into a believable villain who does not make so many mistakes and our heroes ultimate victory did not have to rely so completely on pure luck and chance.

Also, we are here focusing on fanfictions, they have no excuse that Rowling had. So, the writers who continue to keep V as handicapped as he's in the canon, don't give him character development and don't make him smarter than average, disappoint me as much as 11-year-old dunderheads disappoint Snape.

Not really, as they generally kicked the Order's butt, especially in first war when they wasted 40% of Order members, while taking only very limited losses (Rosier and Wilkes were their only two notable casualties back then).

However, I agree with you that Voldemort is horribly overrated, both as a literary character and his in-story behaviors. IMO, Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain.

Dumbledore could have easily killed off best of his supporters in the DoM and derailed his plan by who knows how long. But of course, the 'good guys' must not kill or they might sink as low as their enemies!

But even with 'good guys' fighting with both their hands tied behind their backs, this guy barely managed to hang onto power of a medium sized country for 10 months, before being overthrown by mostly teenagers. He got killed while trying to take back a high school!

On the other hand, he was a genocidal maniac without a shred of redeeming qualities. His leadership style was so unsustainable that he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members. He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from compulsive-obsessive disorders and extremely poor decision making skills. In the end, his own foolishness (for example the excessive reliance on Avada Kedavra) got him killed and he was sent to rot in hell forever.

--------------

The pre-Horcrux Tom Riddle, however, could be far more interesting. I often wondered how much more he would have achieved if he had just followed more 'conventional' routes to power. Even the Voldemort during the First War might be a lot more interesting, and perhaps far less crazy. But unfortunately, his behaviors during both eras were not depicted in the Books, and we could only speculate.

*** If Voldemort was true evil genius, the Light side would have lost or received huge losses. In either case the Trio wouldn't have played any significant role in the war. Even when 17 or 18 they are still just out of school children that couldn't match Riddle and the most of his DEs.

**** JKR had her reasons and she made her characters as she wanted, and I don't think I qualify enough to question the choices she made. But on the other hand, I definitely feel fanfic authors who follow the same tone of character flaws are unoriginal and mediocre. Don't make your antagonists weak just so that they can be beaten by your 17-year-old protagonists. Trying to bring equilibrium between good guys and bad guys this way is a disservice to your writing. Make the antagonists smart, strong and unbeatable by us average reader if we were in the protagonists' shoes, and then make the real protagonists that much special and extraordinary and make them struggle to solve that unbeatable scenario. Those are the kinds of stories I would like to read, and I think most people want that too.

Remember: she watched her mother die in front of her at, like, eight, and since then she's only actually interacted with her father, the editor of the conspiracy theory magazine and actually probably clinically insane, and she's probably been living off Plimpie Soup and stuff like that.

She also has a very interesting way of looking at things, one that is untouched by societal expectations and other people. She's basically the only person in Harry Potter that fully /understands/ that magic is /real/. Hermione didn't think Thestrals existed. Hermione didn't think magic existed at age 10.

Hermione: My favorite character, but her worshipping goes too far, especially how Steve Kloves turned her into a boring Mary Sue at cost of Ron.

*** Draco of the first 5 books is a complete asshole, but he's still my favorite character because I love all the stuff that we don't see and what can be canonically inferred from the blank spaces, especially in books 6 and 7. He is absolutely a more important character to the story than just a school rival who delights in being a little bitch. For me, it doesn't have anything to do with being a female and “falling for” him being a little shit. There's way more there for me. But I tend to love villain backstories in general, as I'm not a fan of just unrepentant evil being the reason behind villains' actions. The villain is the hero of their own story. And I love seeing those facets.

Also, totally disagree that Draco ended as a “sniveling coward.” He certainly was up to a point. But by 6th year, he was doing something very difficult to save his parents. By 7th year, he was willing to lie to Death Eaters about Harry's identity. There is definitely more there than just being an asshole coward.

***** I replied below with more substance, but honestly read that whole Room of Requirement scene again. Draco is repeatedly asking Crabbe and Goyle not to kill Harry and not to hide the diadem. Crabbe is throwing Avadas and Crucios and Draco provides the distraction that gets Harry to the diadem. His excuse is that he wants to hand Harry over. Snape says the SAME THING at the end of HBP. What he really wants is for Harry to win. And there's a lot of evidence to support this, including the fact that in canon, Harry testified for him and Draco wasn't ever punished. He was a child and he held his parents' lives in his hands.

The quote you included isn't any proof of his loyalties. If he doesn't continue to pretend to be a Death Eater, BOTH sides are trying to kill him. He's in an impossible situation in that battle. His parents are on the other side. The good side thinks he's a bad guy. He needs Harry to win to save him and his mother from Voldemort. There's ZERO text evidence that he is still loyal to Voldemort in books 6 and 7. Remember that seeing everything through Harry's eyes skews things considerably. But look at his actual words. And look at how in canon (Cursed Child) Draco has clearly avoided prison and avoided Ministry seizure of his estate. He isn't even on probation. Plus, if Harry and Ron didn't have some doubt about Draco's loyalties, why would they both save him? And why was that Death Eater trying to kill him at all?

I'm not a terribly brave person. But I don't see signs of true cowardice in books 6 and 7 from Draco. Really try to think about it from his POV. He's in an impossible position. If he was doing and saying the things CRABBE is doing and saying in the final battle, I might agree with you. But he isn't. Honestly, read it again.

Edit; I would love to understand why I'm being downvoted for literally explaining what happened in the actual book. If you don't think JK redeemed Draco, you're missing what's actually printed in those books.

**** Sorry, but I disagree. Malfoy was a coward and devotee to his Dark Lords until the end of the seventh book when he ordered his cronies Grabbe and Goyle in the skirmish in the Room of Requirement to catch or kill Harry so he could hand him over to his Dark Lord. I don't think he should be pitied for his cowardice and incompetence.

***** Definitely read the Room of Requirement scene again. Draco repeatedly tells Crabbe and Goyle not to kill Harry. He even stopped Crabbe from burying the diadem in the lost things. Which is a weird move for a loyal devotee to do. Making it impossible for Harry to find would have been great for Voldy. That's what Crabbe was doing. That scene very much reads as Draco trying desperately to stop his former minions from killing Harry because Harry is Draco's only hope for ending Voldemort. Crabbe angrily says he doesn't have to listen to Draco anymore. Crabbe is the one who started the fiendfyre and was casting Avadas and Crucios. Not Draco. Draco even provides the distraction that Harry uses to disarm Goyle and get to the diadem. Honestly, read it. It reads differently if you really pay attention to Draco's words. He needs Harry to play the Savior for him too.

Canon Draco isn't an unrepentant Death Eater. Draco isn't motivated by pure evil. He grew up in basically a white supremacist household. He was told to believe certain things his whole life. Lots of children in the real world are in similar situations. If he was a devotee of Voldemort throughout all 7 books, he wouldn't have been so obviously torn about the vanishing cabinet and killing Dumbledore. He wouldn't have tried every hands-off way he could think of to kill Dumbledore. He wouldn't have been crying in that bathroom. He flat-out says that he only was following orders or Voldemort would kill his parents. Dumbledore KNEW the plan and knew Draco couldn't do it. He KNEW Draco was redeemable. He even offered Draco asylum. Which Draco couldn't take because that would sign his parent's death warrant.

If he was a true coward, he would have joined Dumbledore and let his parents die. Instead, he GOES BACK to living in a house with Voldemort, knowing he failed, unsure of the punishment awaiting him. Knowing Voldemort could still kill his parents. Could still kill him. Which is more cowardly: defecting and seeking protection? Or living with Voldemort and facing unimaginable horrors. Even his father is drunk off his ass the whole time.

Then- Book 7. It would have been SO EASY to hand Harry over. And he doesn't do it. He knows that is Harry. Hermione and Ron are right over there. And he doesn't do it.

Think of the conflict he must have felt during the Battle of Hogwarts. His parents are fighting for the other side. He doesn't know who's going to win. His toadies are throwing the killing curse and he has to stop them without tipping them off to his true intentions. And then, no matter what a shit he is, Harry rescues him and that has an impact on him.

And Narcissa Malfoy does one of the bravest things in those books. She looks the world's greatest Legilimens in the eye and lies. She didn't have to. Her question was answered. She could have let Harry be found out and killed for good. She doesn't. Because she and Draco don't want any part of this anymore. Let me step out of canon for a sec- just looking at Draco's face in the movie, you see the devastation that Harry is “dead.” Harry was the final chance to save them all, Draco included, from an insane madman.

Back to canon. As much as I despise Cursed Child, it's canon. And it gives us a lot of insight into what JK wanted us to think of Draco. I mean, first of all, Scorpius is the main character. And he's lovely. It's very clear that not only did Draco not go to Azkaban, he doesn't seem to have been punished in a significant way for his role in the war (like having his fortune seized.) Apparently, Pottermore even says that Harry testified at Draco and Narcissa's trials after the war. Why would he do that if all Draco was was a whining coward who was always loyal to Voldemort? If JK felt the same way as you do about Draco, why wasn't he sent to Azkaban?

There's very little textual evidence in books 6 and 7 that Draco was happy to serve Voldemort and ready to kill for him. In fact, it's the opposite.

***** To your edit: Why didn't Draco identify Harry at Easter at Malfoy Manor? Why didn't he either kill Dumbledore as he was ordered (basically blackmailed into) or defect and save his own skin? Why was he so visibly upset the entire 6th year? Why wasn't he punished with a sentence in Azkaban or Ministry seizure of his estate? How does Harry testify for him if he's so evil? All of the evidence of redemption is there in black and white. Your claim that he was a devotee of the Dark Lord's has no text-based evidence. It actually surprises me when I see that people have missed the last third of his arc. Harry even canonically forgives him. Their kids are best friends. None of this would be possible if he was still working for Voldemort until the end of the war. He wasn't.

You also say he would have been horribly punished for killing Harry. Yet he doesn't identify him when his father says it will get them back in V's good graces. He also fails his task of killing Dumbledore and goes back to face Voldemort, not knowing if he would be killed, but trying to save his parents. The Room Of Requirement scene is a perfect example of him playing both sides. He isn't the slightest bit violent or combative in that scene. Not at all.

****** Why didn't Draco identify Harry at Easter at Malfoy Manor?\\
What advantage would he have had? Someone else would have been rewarded for capturing Harry Potter.

Why didn't he either kill Dumbledore as he was ordered?\\
He would have done it if Dumbledore had turned his back on him. Dumbledore knew Draco was a coward and avoided turning his back on him.

Why do you think Draco has ordered his cronies to capture Harry in the first place? Did he want to bring him to a safe place, did he want to snog him? No, he wanted to hand him over to Voldemort, who was waiting outside the castle, to get back on the dark Lords good side. If you were right, Draco would have just left Harry alone. He wasn't ordered to capture Harry.

Of course, Draco was not combative in this scene, the coward he was he ordered his cronies to capture Harry for him.

Sorry, for me, the books are canon only, CC is fanfiction, even bad fanfiction, it's not even written by JKR. I don't doubt, however, that she earned money with it. The Room Of Requirement scene is the perfect example of where Draco's true loyalty lies.

******* Oh, I hate Cursed Child too. So much. But it shows that Draco isn't rotting in Azkaban. You expect more punishment for a character than the author herself does. He even retains all his wealth.

As to your points, I strongly encourage you to read JK's essay on Pottermore about Draco. She backs up everything I've said about Draco's motivations. Her words contradict yours for the astronomy tower and Malfoy Manor. She does say that the Room scene is a last-ditch way for Draco to do something right in this war (for his “side.”) But again, if you read that scene, you'll see that it's not that cut and dry. Here is EVERY line Draco says in that scene. Notice that he gives no orders. Any suggestion to kill or bring Harry in comes from a different character.

“Hold it, Potter.” “That's my wand you're holding, Potter.” “My mother.” (When H asks who gave him the wand) “I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year. I know how to get in.” “No! If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing.” “Potter came in here to get it so that must mean-“ “Stop! The Dark Lord wants him alive-“ “Don't kill him! DON'T KILL HIM!”

That's his entire dialogue in that scene. I find it interesting where it starts- he wants his wand back. All Unforgivables and all talk of taking him to Voldemort comes from Crabbe.

I get that both of our feelings about this character color our perceptions of these scenes. So let's just go with what the author has stated. He's not a good person (and was never raised to be one), yet he has moments of good.

*** Yes. Lily and James for me. We don't really know them. And they were incredibly young when they died. I really wish JK would have made the whole gang older when the shit went down. There's no wiggle room between graduating and dying- it's hard for me to understand everything that had to happen in those three years. And why were they so powerful in the Order? Sure, Harry was forced to fight from age 11, but he had no choice. Lily and James had no reason to be so passionately invested in the fight against Voldemort. Where were the older wizards?

Tangent- but I don't understand where all of the adults are in general. Wizards live a really long time. And Lily's parents were Muggles, yes. But they couldn't have been older than 50 when they died. But James, Sirius, the Black sisters, Lucius Malfoy, Lupin, Molly, Arthur, Snape, ALL have either dead parents or parents that are so conspicuously absent as to effectively be dead to the plot. For all 4 of Harry's grandparents to have died before he was 1 is an amazing coincidence. I know sometimes that happens in the real world. But we are talking wizards here. There's an entire missing generation in Harry Potter with no explanation. We have assumed it has to do with the first Voldemort war, but that hasn't been confirmed. JK planned so much so well, but this stands out to me as an oversight.

**** Even their movie counterparts are in their thirties in the Mirror of Erised because the film crew thought they were too young! (Though to be fair my own parents are the same age as Lily and James, and they had their first child only two years after when Harry was born.)

In my opinion Rowling wrote the first book and spent nine years trying to justify the choices of Philosophers Stone. I know she had notes and was planning the universe, but I feel like it was a bit looser than she lets on. Harry needed to be at the Dursleys, so there had to be no one else available. But, she also wanted Harry's parents to be popular and accomplished. So, the grand parents had to die in the previous war, or in James's case have Ancient parents who succumb to Dragon Pox and the friends had to all be out of the picture. In my opinion, I think the Marauders might not even have been as big as they were supposed to be until she started writing the Third book. Yes, Sirius is mentioned in Chapter 1 of the First book, but there's so many plot holes. And I take any Pottermore information to be after the fact.

** Harry himself.

Don't get me wrong: he is a prodigious athlete, a pretty clever and talented wizard, and a true hero, if a bit shallow and impulsive. However, the only reason he is important is that the whole story and setting is built around him. Harry only matters---only gets to do anything interesting---because of Voldemort, the Prophecy, and the set of coincidences surrounding his mother's murder.

Yet, I would say that outside the androöphidiophilic^{1} subfandom, most of the rest of the fandom insists that Harry /must/ be the lead protagonist, or they won't read the story. And, there's a huge number of stories where despite the whole Voldemort thread being absent or peripheral, and despite the actual plot calling for a very different protagonist, Harry is shoehorned into the role, often after a complete personality rewrite. In other words, Harry is so overrated, people would rather destroy his character than let someone else be the protagonist.

**** As someone who is self-loathing and has depression, I can understand where Lupin is coming from, but I can stand his weaknesses. I get that he pushes people away because he doesn't want to get hurt, but if he really cared he wouldn't have gotten involved with Tonks in the first place no matter how insistent she was. I know the pro-Snape narrative pushes that in his school days he used his affability to hide behind the actions of other Marauders while being just as complicit in their pranks. That he's all smiles and compassion with no true empathy but I think that's unfair. I think he's so desperate to be liked that he would be afraid to say anything against the others in case they dropped him, even if they stated they cared for him. Of course as Rowling has mentioned, Snape is all grey. He was unpleasant and Lupin would have enjoyed any pranks at his expense because it meant he wasn't a target.
