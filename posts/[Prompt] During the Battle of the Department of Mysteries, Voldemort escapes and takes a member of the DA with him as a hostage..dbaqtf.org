** Voldemort grabbed Harry/Ginny/Ron/Neville/Luna/Hermione at wandpoint, telling Dumbledore "Let me apparate out or I blow their brains out."

Voldemort then kills his hostage and apparates out, with Harry possibly resurrecting, and everyone else being dead.

Ginny: Different love interest 6th year

Ron: Super Emo Harry 6th year

Neville: Oh look an extra bunk

Luna: Harry needs a new date for Slughorn's party

Hermione: A slightly less tense 6th year, a different hunt 7th year.
