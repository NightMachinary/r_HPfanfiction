I'm too lazy to look myself.


** Off the top of my head, there's Sisyphus, by Esama (spelling?), a depressing-but-good oneshot about a Harry who is cursed to loop through his entire life, forever.

Also, there's Wastelands of Time, plus HP & the Temporal Beacon, both of which involve a "groundhog day" like time loop. The former is Harry/Fleur and complete, the latter is H/Hr and abandoned, IIRC.

Sorry I have no links, I'm on mobile atm.

**** Harry is a fool. Why didn't he realise the plan wouldn't work? The time in that fic is obviously a circle, not a d like Harry thought it would be. Sigh, i'm just ranting, thx for the link.

I feel like I'm forgetting at least one. I also feel like there's been a post about this here before, you should search for that.

** The ones already mentioned are the best I know in the HP fandom.

If you don't mind considering the next largest fandom extant, there are a few very good Naruto ones: /Time Braid/ by SharperV, /Reload/ by Case13, and /Do You Remember Love/ by DigiFruit. (Perfect Lionheart also did a Naruto one, but like all of his stories, it sucks.)

*** I'm not a Naruto fanatic, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] is one of the greatest fanfics I've ever read! It is clear that it carders to a very specific audience (those who've read chap 10 to 12 knows what i mean /wink/ /wink/) so i realise not everyone will have the same experience.

***** Yeah that's exactly it. It's just so weird that he totally cut out the scenes rather than just skim past them with no explicit stuff in it. Like 1 or 2 lines would probably do.
