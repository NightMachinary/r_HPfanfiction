Looking for any stories that involve ‘holy' or light magic, for instance exorcisms etc Doesn't have an agenda that being ‘christian' makes you superior or some such No H/Hr No slash

Just one of those ideas that popped into my head, what if Harry was some sort of magical Minister or something, its not much of an idea, so take and run. Maybe slightly crack-y if Harry becomes an actual Wizarding Saint or something, with a ridiculous cult of followers.

No, Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles does not count.


** This story tells about Severus Snape's catholic faith. If you can get past that hurdle, it contains lovely applications of magic to things like the sacrament of confession. (Though I can't say how correct it would all be even if magic was a thing. I don't have inside experience about that.)

*** I'll have a read of it, the summary seems interesting. I more meant that I didn't want something that just turned into sermonising or being overly preachy.

** I have been writing and updating [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/religionless-universe-of-harry-potter.html][my blog post on the religion in HP universe]].

Let me also refer to this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i9h9at/the_character_of_hp_magic/g1flpsp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][discussion of the Dark Magic]] (and read whole thread), which refers to very Light Magic as well.

** I've been writing a story about the biblical apocalypse. It has demons, exorcisms, Hell, and will at one point deal with what kind of magic it takes to kill a demon, as well as what happens when you mix demonic energy with magic. There's definitely going to be some form of “holy” magic, but I can't say what that'll be without spoiling it. It's still a work in progress, and I've only just gotten to the demons and stuff, but I think it's good, though I am biased. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13744090/1/][Bad Moon Rising]]
