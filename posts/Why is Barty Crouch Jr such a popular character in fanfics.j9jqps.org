I've seen Barty Jr in a lot of the fics I've read recently and I'm just curious about your thoughts on this!

Edit: I have never, nor will I ever, watch Doctor Who.


** He doesn't have much detailed info about him in canon so his character is easy to change and make a backstory for, etc.

** he is incredibly smart and cunning. was intensely loyal.

Honestly if he was not serving under voldemort he would be a dangerous dark lord in his own right.

Plus he is compelling, he might have been acting like moody but he was a genuinely good teacher which makes me wonder if as a good he like his master voldemort had teaching ambitions

** I think the actor who plays him also factors in here. He's one of the more popular Doctors people write fics about, I believe, in the DW fandom.

** He's competent, he achieved all his goals. ALso keep in mind every awesome thing he Moody did (ferret!Malfoy) was actually Barty Jr.

He's the goddamn Doctor!

** I'd say since there isn't much known or shown in Canon books, he's a much easier character to flesh out and manipulate around for story purposes without changing another already established character.

** Because of David Tennant, of course. Just like Snape and Malfoy are popular because of Alan Rickman and Tom Felton, respectively.
