I think the most egregious misspell I see lately is skele-gro written as skele-grow. It's everywhere.

*** I understand your pain, but in this case autocorrect is partly to blame. It sees 'definately' (which is a common mis-spelling of 'definitely') and assumes that swapping letters is more likely than the misspelling.

It is my hope that someday a civic-minded hacker will find a way to change all those auto-correct libraries across the globe to handle this particular word-error correctly. I see that as more likely than everyone learning to spell 'definitely' correctly.

** McGonagal, McGonnagall McGonigall, McGanagall probably

Literally every (even vaguely) possible spelling that isn't McGonagall.

Or the authors who have their main characters call her Minnie or something. Probably because they didn't want to try to spell her actual name. Like, one, I highly doubt anyone has ever been allowed to call her that. Unless she used it as a nickname as a kid, and two, you are her fucking student show some respect. No teacher would let you get away with that. Ever. Also, I think just about every character has enough respect for her skills that nobody is going to drop her title without permission.

TL;DR: Spell McGonagall right, she's an important character
