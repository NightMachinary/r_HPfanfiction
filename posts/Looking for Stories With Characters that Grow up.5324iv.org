Hello! This is my first post here after lurking for a few days. Be gentle.

I recognize that I have a very specific list of wants in a story, and I hope that someone can help me find some good fanfiction that meets at least some of them. What I'm basically looking for though is stories where the characters evolve and grow the hell up. It's sort of weird how many authors take every cliche character trait that Harry and Friends display in the books, multiply by 100 and then age them up to their 30s.

--I don't want Auror!Harry because while it does happen, how many people stick with the career choice they made when they were 14? Maybe he gives it a try and figures out it's not what he wants to do. Maybe he never decides he doesn't want to do it right when they come looking for his enthusiastic enrollment.

--I don't want pranksters (Marauders, twins, whoever) who are creeping on middle age and still think turning someone into a canary is the pinnacle of hilarity.

--Don't necessarily want Dumbledore/Molly Weasley/Ron and Hermione bashing, but I would really appreciate someone at least calling these characters out on their BS sometimes. Pretty much everyone is shitty to Harry at some point or another in canon. I want to see that addressed without blowing it out of proportion.

--Harry in the books and movies has a snarky streak. Some of my favorite stories take that feature and develop it into him growing into a somewhat sarcastic adult (but not altogether an asshole.)

--Well thought out crossovers are appreciated and encouraged. If Harry is joining forces with the Toxic Avenger I'm okay with that, but at least attempt to have it make sense.

--I'm not really seeking out romance, but as long as it's not the focus of the story I'm okay with it. (Preferably not H/G or H/Hr)

--No mopey bag full of steaming angst(!)Harry. His life does kind of suck, yeah. Unless he's a psychopath, he should be able to eventually accept and cope with the deaths of his parents/Sirius/Dumbledore/Dobby. He can be sad when he thinks about them, but succumbing to a tearful rage whenever someone so much as mentions them is overdoing it after some time has passed. This seems to be used a lot to play up his victim and martyr status.

--Balancing out the Dursley's abuse. They were horrible to Harry, yes. But if I had a nickle for every time I've seen them turned into Spanish Inquisition-level torturers I'd have a whole lotta nickles.

--No baby-crazed Harry. Authors often ignore the other side of "growing up without a family" and that's the fact that sometimes you don't miss what you don't know. In the books Harry seems to miss the potential more than the reality, or at least that's how I interpreted it. He's envious on an outside-looking-in sort of way, but he never really comes across as the sappy, suburban dream kinda guy.

So any suggestions? It's probably hoping for too much for a story that has all of these things, but maybe a few? I'd list out some of the stories that I've read and liked, but eep, that'd be a long list. Just basically character evolution without making them a whole new character, and not overblowing the angst to ridiculous levels.

Anything at all?


** I think you should like *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185):

- It's extreme AU, even in Muggle world. For example, nuclear weapons were never developed.

- Most of the story took place after 2008, when our characters were all well into adulthood.

- No Dursleys at all, James and Lily raised Harry.

- Harry began his career as an officer in the British military, and quickly gained more power as the world descended into chaos and warfare.

- No bashing, but Dumbledore was depicted as an ineffective pacifist.

- Harry married a Muggle OC.

- No angsty periods, although his wife did often question moralities of their actions.

- Hermione was a minor character. Ginny was more important, but she was definitely NOT Harry's love interest.

- Voldemort was still the main enemy, and he was significantly more cunning and rational in this fic.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** I read the first couple chapters and it's not the sort of thing I'd usually go for, but it's caught my interest so I'll keep going. Thanks!
