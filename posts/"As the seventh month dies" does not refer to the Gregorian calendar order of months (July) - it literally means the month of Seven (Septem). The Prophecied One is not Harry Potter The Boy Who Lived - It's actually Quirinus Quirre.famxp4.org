#+TITLE: "As the seventh month dies" does not refer to the Gregorian calendar order of months (July) - it literally means the month of Seven (Septem). The Prophecied One is not Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived - It's actually Quirinus Quirrel!

Bonus points if the "parents who have thrice defied" refers to petty schoolyard tiffs between Voldie and the parents of Quirrel.


** Wait! The actress for the trolley lady (Margery Mason) was also born in late September. As we know from the Cursed Child, the trolley lady is pretty much immortal, all powerful and she has a power the dark lord knows not (pastry bombs). Who her parents are, we'll never know, but I think time traveling was probably involved (trolley lady is older than Bathilda Bagshot). Maybe she's even the child of Hogwarts??

**** You are not. Really, if it was just a fanfiction it would be ridiculed how bad it is. People who saw it on the theatre say it is really a great spectacle, but the script is just horrible.

***** Writing a play is a very different beast from writing a book, yeah - the dialogue in particular tends to have to be quite different. So something that's coming across as good when watching might end up overwrought, or cheesy, or just falling flat when just read.

****** I don't think the problem was in the general craft of writing dialogues etc., the authors were experienced professional drama writers. The problem was with the general plot and synopsis. The authors apparently never read the books (and just briefly watched films), so all those ‚Äúbook Ron √ó film Ron‚Äù, right, those are all wrong, squared. And not only that, the problems are not just nitpickings of Potterheads (of course, that too ... authors had no clue about how HP magic actually works etc.). Not only the characters of the play don't have much common with the original HP universe characters with same names. And when I say that all characters are all OOC, that doesn't describe the situation enough. You know Harry Potter, man who was constantly rejected by his parental figures? Yeah, that guy. He says to his son, that he didn't want him to be born. Do you remember, how whenever anything happens to any Weasley, all of them fall on Hogwarts like a red tornado? Yeah, those Weasleys. Do you remember Ron Weasley, who is considered by many as semi-Hufflepuff (when Hermione is semi-Ravenclaw and Harry semi-Slytherin)? Yeah, that Ron. So, when Rose Weasley gets lost, Ron Weasley, her father, forgets to come to her, because he finds something good to eat.

Not only all characters are OOC, the plot is a convoluted mess of multiple universes, littered with endless plotholes. After JKR in one of her blogposts (or on Pottermore?) clearly described that she is aware of many problems with complicated time travelling story, the authors fallen in all traps of that trope. Squared, again. Tons of time is spent with unsuccessful attempts to explain the mechanics of time travel, and the result is that any plot (if it made any sense, which it didn't) got lost in it.

‚ÄúDo not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, the people who watched this play.‚Äù

Two huge threads of comments (with tons of spoilers, the protection doesn't seem to work now):

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4nc1hj/spoilers_cursed_child_megathread_part_2/]]

And my personal pet-peeve (for which the authors are not be blamed) is that Petunia is supposed die soon. My main stories are based on the premise that she survives and she tries to deal with her guilt. But that's just my personal problem.

******* Yeah, I don't want to say that that's the only problem with it, by any means! Just that I wouldn't necessarily look at it or judge it by the criteria of a book.

Eg, the passage with the trolley lady that gets brought up a lot, seems to me to be exaggerated for stage purposes. Kinda like how everyone's movements are exaggerated in plays, or stage makeup is much heavier in order to be seen far away, etc.

** It's kind of offtop but when I have read HP series first time in my life I was a child. And for some reason I believed that "as the seventh month dies" does not mean born in July, but instead it means an infant born prematurely. So I thought that Harry and Neville were both premature infants up until ~couple of years ago, when I was reading my hundredth fanfiction and I realized it actually meant July, not an incomplete pregnancy XD

*** I never thought like that but it makes a lot of sense! As the seventh month dies, As the seventh month of pregnancy ends,

So we have a prematurely born most likely weak child protagonist, the classic underdog who will go on to defeat the dark lord. Now I want someone to write it lol

** [SELF_AD] I have just written a Ginny-Harry dialogue on this topic, linkao3(22663204).

Any comments, suggestions, effectively beta-reading (including grammar complaints, I am not a native English speaker) are more than welcome, and they will be considered.

  While writing other Harry-after-DoM-debacle-gets-his-life-together story, I got this piece of conversation, which didn't fit anywhere. So, I am putting it here just as a separate one-shot. In my original story, they found out that Ginny is in fact a daughter of Lily Potter, Harry's sister. This story may very well be canonical (Hinny), but I haven't mentioned anything about their relationship, so it could be either. In the canonical world, it would be just that they were friends before they were more than friends (and Ms Rowling as usual forgot to mention any parts of relationship other than snogging).
