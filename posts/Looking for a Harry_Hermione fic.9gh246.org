Looking for a Harry/Hermione fic where Harry is staying at the grangers house and he and Hermione are having a midnight swim when Draco and Snape attack the house and the hit wizard outside, who was assigned as guard by Amelia Bones (who I think had a cell phone they call) and Draco panics and kills the guard and then Harry and Hermione manage to stun Snape and Draco. That's all I can remember any help is much appreciated.

Edit: looks like it's “No Thanks” by old-crow.


** Sounds like one of Old-Crow's stories - he always used Amelia and her team of aurors in most of his projects, and usually liked the staying with the Grangers trope.

****** I've just started rereading "No thanks" and, damn, that bonding scene between Harry and Hermione's mum, when he is looking at the picture album, is so good.

It's sad how many fics try to include some kind of mother figure for Harry and get it so wrong most of the time.

  What would have happened if Dobby had flinched and taken one step to the left, leaving Hermione behind to fend for herself and thus causing a terribly different outcome of the war.
