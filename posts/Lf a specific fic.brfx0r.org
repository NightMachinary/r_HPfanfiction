:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Bits I can remember:

- Harry is king/lord/leader
- He poisons the everyday wizards with a disease just so they can offer the cure
- Dumbledore is killed at the end by being drawn and quartered
- He has Fred George and Ron as prisoners who have to behave to earn pillows etc

This is driving me mad its stuck in my head but I cant find it


** Hey mate, just so you're aware, the “Request” flair is actually used for general fic requests, e.g. a pairing, or a fandom xover. Instead, what you wanted to use here is the “What's That Fic?” flair, which indicates that you're searching for a specific fic, like Shadows of Angmar.
