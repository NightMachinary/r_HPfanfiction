*THE RESULT*

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3l28lg/the_great_hpfanfiction_debate_round_1a_vote_for/][Here's a link to the now closed vote thread.]]

There were an amazing 106 votes this round!

The winner with 71 votes to 35 is...[[/u/finebalance]]! Congratulations to you!

And commiserations to [[/u/commander678]]!

Both of you did amazingly for being the first two to compete and I think everyone should bare that in mind. This not only went on a lot longer than planned but there were rule changes midway through and [[/u/commander678]] wasn't even arguing for a point they agreed with.

Also I really appreciate everyone massively upvoting all of their comments during the debate, it was lovely and encouraging. :)

*NEWS*

So this weekend i'm planning on carrying out the rest of round one, [[/u/magnive]] was messaging me about this and I think it will not only make things run quicker and more smoothly but means that this won't be needing to be updated every day. Below i'll be tagging the competitors and listing the topics they will be debating. Please PM me if you can't take part over the weekend, likely the post will go up Friday or Saturday and the whole thing will be over and being voted on Sunday/Monday.

Secondly, [[/u/makinporing]] has sadly had to drop out and will be replaced by [[/u/DZCreeper]]. I can't change the bracket because as I mentioned in a previous thread, i'm a bit useless, so if you see makingporing it's really DZcreeper.

Thirdly, I like triplets.


** Okay, arguing /for/ Snapes behavior is going to be the most difficult of these topics.

Theres not much you can say in favor of this man, really. Or am I missing something here?

**** Sure, but its:

  "Snape was justified in his handling of Harry"
#+end_quote

So I'm assuming we're talking about canon Snape. You can't justify canon Snape, merely explain him.

***** I was simply trying to be facetious :P

The only way to defend Snape is to generously (signing-away-a-billion-dollars-to-a-beggar level of generous) interpret him.

****** I'm trying but I can't find an argument for him. Not even his good deeds came from the mere goodness of his heart. Even his best action (bringing Harry the sword) was just fulfilled with the bare minimum of effort /and/ nearly drowning Harry in the process. Was there an explanation as to why he threw the sword into a pond and not, say, in the grass under some tree? I can't remember.

Even with the most generous interpretation he is an asshole who should not go near children if his life depended on it.

Yes, the sword had to be won in an act of selfless bravery.

*** Plenty. Base your argument around him being a spy etc. and his treatment of other pupils. There's a lot on this sub that's quite convincing if you go looking.

**** I am looking forward to it. I'm really curious how this argument is going to be constructed. Especially, how he's going to withstand the counterargument.

Also, I've never even seen a discussion-competition before, really. Its just not a thing where I live. It seems a bit alien to me to defend something you normaly wouldn't.

** I don't really understand...

You gave us the topics we are debating over, but are we going to debate in this thread?

Is this just for future notice?

Also, I cannot really participate during the weekend (at least not Sun/Mon).

Thanks,

*** You are debating the person listed in your comment with you. You will each take a side on the particular topic and debate with one another.

Also no, you will be debating in your own designated thread. This is just to give you time to prep and be ready for your debate.

*** This is just future notice, sorry I should have been more clear. I just wanted to give people more notice so i'm not springing it on them on the day.

There will be an individual thread for each debate created on Friday. I'll tag each of you when I post it.

And yeah no problem, i'll just leave yours open until you're back.
