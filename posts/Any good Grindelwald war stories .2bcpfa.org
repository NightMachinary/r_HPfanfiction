After watching the Fan made "the greater good" on youtube earlier I was wondering if there were any great stories about that war, the relationship between Albus and Grindelwald.

If theres any with Harry in them they would be great too

Thanks :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4150901/1/Balancing-Destinies][Balancing Destinies]], are the only two fics I know of that explore the Grindelwald war.

It's a HP goes back in time to kill Tom Riddle, but ends up saving his life and raising him. The main PoVs are Harry and Tom.

*Edited - corrected his reasoning
