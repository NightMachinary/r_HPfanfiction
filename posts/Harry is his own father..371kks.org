After death, Harry is thrown back in time to become a young James Potter.

He bullies Snape because Snape bullied him for so many years, he single-mindedly pursues Lily because he knows Lily will be his (Harry's) mother.

He is able to become the youngest animagus ever and create a sentient map of Hogwarts because he's seen it all before.

Eventually, he meets his end at the hands of Voldemort, leaving another Harry to begin the cycle anew.

** While the whole cycle thing would be cool, I think I'd prefer it if he actually fights Voldemort and wins this time around.

Basically ending up in an AU where he suffers from an Oedipus situation where he "killed" his dad by replacing him during the transfer and ends up wooing his mother because initially he believes that he was his own dad. After he finds out he's in an AU situation, its already too late and he's already in love so he tries to just live life the best he can.

Anyways, that's a pretty cool setup, but the ending is a bit dark and it would make me sad. I prefer fluffier stories.

** I think that this is a little be biologically impossible - how someone can be their own parent? I mean, unless he made a sort of 'clone' of himself instead of a normal conception (50% of genes from each parent - and that is why I said it would be biologically impossible, btw).

Anyway, I can't see Harry doing a clone and impregnating Lily with it, because its not a very 'noble, nice' thing to do with his own mother...

**** Ok...I see how it could work if Harry give Harry only JP genes, at the precise same egg that was used in order to make him.

But I would only accept this story if magic was envolved on this weird conception process... yeah, I'm a little bit more happier about this weird story now lol

The idea is right, but part of genetic diversity is that [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Chromosomal_Crossover.svg/512px-Chromosomal_Crossover.svg.png][parts of mom and dad chromosomes will/can link up (forming a chiasmata) and then trade]], giving Harry a chromosome that is 90% Lily, but 10% James on the tip. So Harry's chromosomes are still 50% James and 50% Lily, but not necessarily separable and able to be reassigned to each parent as cleanly as one might think.

If that makes sense, sorry if it was a shitty explanation. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover][Wiki probably does it better]] but is more technical.

**** Shouldn't that be 1 in 2^{23} (one in ~84 million)? Assuming the same egg cell is fertilized, he would just need to supply exactly the same chromosomes from each pair as his father did, which would mean there's a 1:2 chance for each pair, there's 23 pairs, so 1:2^{23} for the total.

Handy rule of thumb: 2^{10} ≈ 10^{3} . So 2^{23} = 2^{3} * 2^{20} ≈ 8 * 10^{6} ≈ 8 million.

There's the problem. I was initially assuming this, but then I realized that that wasn't valid and revised my answer.

A human with a functioning set of ovaries will have about a million egg follicles at birth. That's pared down to about 300,000 by the time puberty hits. Each period, a hormone called Follicle Stimulation Hormone is released from the pituitary gland. It stimulates a handful of follicles to mature. The specific follicles that begin to mature presumably depend on the distribution of the hormone throughout the ovaries. One or sometimes two follicles manage to reach full maturity and the rest subside and become dormant.

If the distribution of FSH is sufficiently consistent, then we've got decent odds that the same egg crops up. If the distribution is more or less random, we don't. But in the worst case, we've reduced the odds for the same genes on Lily's side from 2^{23} to about 2^{18} (a factor of 32).

My knowledge of human physiology isn't good enough to give a better answer than this.

****** Can't believe I left out the decimal marker there, oops. I'm a programmer so I know that rule of thumb.

The rest is just assumptions on how time travel works and how Harry deals with it, so discussion would be hard. But he has to be conceived at the same time as he originally was, so I'd the chances of it being the same egg cell are significantly improved.

*** He could simply magically replace James Potter. Like, if he travelled back in time and possessed his own father. IDK maybe some weird blood magic that lets you go back in time and replace a blood member of your family.

who cares, it's Harry Potter universe magic. Do mermaids make biological sense? How did they evolve? From what? Why can humans breed with goblins, veelas and god knows what else? etc

***** It isn't, but you have to understand the difference between "realistic" and "plausible given the internal context of the world". Most of what happens in Harry Potter is wildly unrealistic, but most of it is also internally consistent and plausible.

What about Harry merely replacing James Potter is more outlandish than his adult soul/mind/whatever possessing him? Can humans mate with house-elves? If not, why not when they can mate with goblins and veelas and giants? etc. Why does one thing make less sense than the other, given the context of the Harry Potter universe? I'm not one to say 'it's fantasy, nothing has to make sense' because I don't think that's true.

I'd usually agree with you, except that the Harry Potter universe is a bit of a special case. Its whole point is that it isn't normal, it isn't usual, and that the explanation of 'a wizard did it' is actually considered valid, because that's usually what happens. Other fantasy universes have strict rules for magic and what is and isn't possible. Harry Potter doesn't, really. So much of it has still been left undefined, and the use of magic within the setting canonically is so broad that it's difficult to infer much at all about its rules other than the ones we already know.
