So I've read a ton of fics where Harry is sent to a mirror universe of his fight with Voldemort with whatever the author wants to throw in. I'm looking for something where he's transported into a whole new OC universe and Voldemort and stuff from the Harry Potter universe don't come into play so much. The setting I have in mind for the place he ends up would be in a sort of high-fantasy, but I'm not sure how likely I am to find anything with that criteria.

I know there are scores of stories where Harry goes to the Star Wars universe or Firefly or Middle Earth and that's not what I'm looking for. Sometimes those setting are too well established for me or I need to know too much about the other crossover material and I don't wanna get into that... Though I suppose something like Narnia or LoTR would be okay though if it's decent since the setting is sorta close to what I'm looking for. But as a rule, I'm not really looking for crossovers; I'm thinking they get transported in a way like Digimon, where all the kids get spirited away to a new universe and were dragged into that worlds problems. Anything like this that you've seen?

** You said you aren't really looking for LotR crossovers but... linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) I think fits pretty well. You don't really need to know about LotR... because Harry arrives 1000 years before the book events happen. The author does a good job of explaining everything.

HOWEVER you said "dragged into that worlds problems" and that doesn't start for most of the current story because Harry is still trying to get back to Wizard!Earth. He is starting to do stuff with the history now tho and the story is still updating... Altho not very often :(

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Just look up HP crossovers with fandoms that you have no clue about.

As an example I have no idea what Inheritance Cycle is but it has 124 crossovers with harry potter on ffn.
