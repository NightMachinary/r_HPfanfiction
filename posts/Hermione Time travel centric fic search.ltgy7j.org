:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been several years since I read it but I think I remember it being a one shot that was time travel Hermione centric without romance. The scene that sticks out to me the most is when she is in a tavern with a crowd and she slowly shows Voldemort all the not usable Horcruxes before they kill each other. Peter and Snape try to help but they are too late and they were like her friends or at least "reformed". This was set in the Marauder Era while still at Hogwarts.

Thank you for any help you can give!

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE
