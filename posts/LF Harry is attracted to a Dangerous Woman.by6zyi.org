What i had in Mind is that Its Years after Hogwarts and all of them working on their Profession, whether it is Canon or not. Harry possibly is an Auror or not. It actually doesnt even matter if he is married and with who, but i would like him to be Single....although the Thought about his Wife is impute that he is attracted to this Woman or even got Intim with her, is also good. I couldnt decide what i would prefer.

​

So, Years (decades, if i consider the Epilogue and around that time i would like the Fic to happen) after Voldemorts defeat Harry gets to now a mysterious Woman. She might charm him actively or he is attracted to her appeal.

What he takes time to discover (if that happens at all) is that she is, as the title says, a Dangerous Woman. Whether she kills actively or using her Sex appeal to gain what she wants (including weaving web of intrigues) doesnt matter.

​

I would like her to be an OC and i dont mind if they really get intim with each other, doesnt matter if he cheats or not.


** So, pretty much every Harry Potter/Black Widow fic. I'm not the biggest fan of that pairing so can't really recommend any but you'll find tons of them in Harry Potter+Avengers crossovers in between the heaps of Loki/Harry's.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG
