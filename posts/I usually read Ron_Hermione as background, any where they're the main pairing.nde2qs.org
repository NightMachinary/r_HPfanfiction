Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or Not

For other pairings am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc

No Character Bashing

#+begin_quote
  Hermione has resolved her war is not over until she brings her parents home to England. Ron thinks a summer on the other side of the world is a perfect escape. But transitioning from friends to lovers is not always easy, and some hurts seem impossible to forgive, as Percy Weasley knows all too well. Can the bonds of love and family mend the pieces of their lives torn apart by war?

#+begin_quote
  In the search for Hermione's parents Ron is stricken with an unknown curse. The experts and family all agree that Ron is brain dead, alive only in a shell of himself. But Hermione refuses to believe that her soul mate is gone, fighting to find him and bring him home. Ron, meanwhile, is fighting just as hard to get back, falling more in love with his witch every step of the way.

** Several of the stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] feature Ron/Hermione as the main pairing. Treehouses and Daisies for sure, as well as a prominent story arc in Questions and Answers (which is not completed, but there is SO MUCH of it that it never bothers me.)

  Hermione's anxiety takes a hold of her and threatens to get in the way of her slow and developing relationship with Ron. He is the only one who can pull her out of her own head long enough to finally let go.
