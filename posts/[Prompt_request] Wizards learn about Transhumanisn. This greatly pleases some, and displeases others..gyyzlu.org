Because losing your wand to an /expelliarmus/ stops being a big deal when you have a wand core implanted in your arm.

Tom Riddle does rituals to augment his body with the powers of other magical animals. To me, this is what wizarding transhumanism is, augmenting one's body with additional magical abilities, as opposed to sticking unicorn hair into your wand.

In this chapter and fight, Barty Crouch has a clockwork machine body designed by Voldemort. It has drawbacks though, obviously as Voldemort doesn't use one himself. This might be more along the lines of what you're looking for.
