I've found a bunch, but I'm looking for recommendations.


** Sam Storyteller's [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] is a very good AU one-shot where Tom Riddle chooses not to don the mantle of Voldemort and becomes the Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts professor instead. (Warning: implied Remus/Sirius slash in the background.) While he's not exactly a good guy in the fullest sense of the word, neither is he a mustache-twirling, trope-spewing villain like canon-Voldemort.

*** Reading a drama oneshot is a little offputting in that it ends right when the characters have been developed. Still, I enjoyed it, thanks. The parallels with cannon were well done.

*** Yeah, the first chapter was a little ridiculous, but I just pretended in my head that Voldemort used ancient persuasion magic.

How can you tell the premise changed?

It's a good story! That the author only recently started writing fanfiction is impressive.

***** hahaha, you didn't pull any punches. I've never written a review. It looks like doing so can provide a cool view into the author's thought process if they respond.

That initial plot makes sense in context of this quote from the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/4707801/Two-four-twelve][author page]] (emphasis added).

#+begin_quote
  ...it's legitimate AU protocol to have characters not repeat canonical mistakes. Obviously this isn't an excuse to eliminate all dramatic tension; it needs to be replaced by either weakening the heroes somehow (*viz. having them make other staggeringly bad decisions*) or powering up the villains.

** One of the interesting ones that I've encountered is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/27/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] by Lady Khali, though you don't see much Tom Riddle until part 2 of the story. Part 1 features Harry being mentored by Barty Crouch Jr. It has several interesting ideas that I've not seen done before, casting the Magical world in a much different light than most tales, yet doing so in a manner that's (mostly) consistent with canon†. For plot necessity, some characters (Dumbledore, Ron, James Potter) aren't portrayed sympathetically, though I don't recall overt bashing.

#+begin_quote
  On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs.
#+end_quote

The story hasn't updated since April and the author says it's on hiatus. Still, at 180k+ words, there's a fair bit to read.

† - Up to the GoF divergence point, that is.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/Rectifier][Rectifier]] by Nigel Aquila is definitely my favorite 'good' Tom story :D

** Ah, I was trying to find one, but apparently it is lost for now, maybe someone else knows it:

The story is a oneshot, and it starts with Voldemort telling "his side of the story" to Rita Skeeter (also, its AU, of course).

** There are a few categories these can fall into and some are the Dumbledore is evil others are Voldemort gets redeemed types.

Life Renovations by Windseeker is a long 3 part story with a Harry injured by Dursleys rescued by Snape and Draco and eventual good Voldy and bad Dumbledore. I liked it but it's heavy on AU.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451982/chapters/775208]] this is just one sample of the many Voldemort is reformed by a relationship stories, I personally like him paired with Hermione as in this story. This is post Deathly Hollows (he escapes but doesn't die at end) and he is still kind of a Dexter kind of psycho with a bizarre relationship with Hermione. This author has some fantastic Voldy/Hermione if that's your thing.
