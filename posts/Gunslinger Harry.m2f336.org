We've all seen sword Harry but I was wondering if you guys knew of any fics where Harry uses a gun(s). I'd love to see Harry walking down a corridor at hogwarts with guns. I can also imagine people getting all pissy about it. So it would be preferable if he was a hogwarts student instead of a squib or something. So if you have any recs send them my way.


** I am sure there was on where to goes to Africa for hunting potion ingredients. Got the name Snakebite , the meanest bastard to arrive in the last week,

It was a fun read, but cant remember if it was a fic or a fic-let.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

  Things didn't entirely get swept aside after the conclusion of the TWT. Dumbledore doesn't get his way. Riddle or Fudge won't either. Some OCs have large roles.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** Are you okay with AU? In [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], rather than magic, Hogwarts is a school for super spies. Harry is the son of a man who was 007 for a while, and does occasionally use guns. The story is from Hermione's perspective, and pretty interesting.

** I haven't seen any good ones.

A gun would probably be a great weapon in the Harry Potter universe, especially if used from ambush. But narratively, that doesn't lead to entertaining fights.

Wand fights are a lot like Errol Flyn sword fights, acrobatic dodges, clever feints, last minute counters and probably some banter. Guns don't fit into that kind of fight. Bullets can't be dodged, can't be parried and tend to kill what they hit which doesn't leave much time for feints and chit chat.

Now the writer can change this interaction pretty drastically and given the soft nature of Harry Potter magic they wouldn't even damage verisimilitude but at that point, why use a gun and not a wand?

So for a Harry Potter story to have guns as the main weapon, the fights themselves can't really be a source of extended excitement. They need to be tense but very short. Less Robin Hood, more Yojimbo. Instead all the excitement and entertainment needs to happen in the lead up to the climax the planning and setup before the fight which is itself over very quickly.

Kind of like the narrative flow of the first book really. There's lot's of carefully unpicking the mystery and exciting adventure in getting to where they need to go but the actual fight with Quirrel is over in a flash.

I think it's an under explored area, there are good stories to tell but they haven't been written yet.

My crack fic based on the premise that Harry Potter is Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos. I'm toying with the idea of one of his avatars being Yul Brynner from the OG Westworld.

** Guns. Sigh. Anyway. There are like a million HP fanfics out there, so you're bound to get some recs, but I do believe most people are not into the idea of bringing guns into HP.

Guns aren't a huge thing in the UK. Not like in the US, where they seemingly grow on trees.

*** No. It always makes me laugh when someone, usually Hermione's dad, has a gun at home. Although it's usually because he's been in the Army (often the SAS), or a member of a gun club.

**** Having a shotgun, or a hunting rifle is a fairly common thing in most countries.

I tried reading a few gun fics some time ago, but what I found was that they are almost uniformly awful. And often an excuse for the author to dazzle us mere mortals with their dizzying knowledge of guns, ammo and calibres and other things involving guns...

***** It's still not a common thing in the UK, especially after things were tightened up after a couple of mass shootings in the 90s.

But I know what you mean about the gun freak thing. The Dan Granger story I linked is a bit like that. But not too much.
