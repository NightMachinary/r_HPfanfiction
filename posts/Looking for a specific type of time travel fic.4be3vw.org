** linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) Only 30,000 words and hasn't been updated in a few months, but I'm hopeful that the author will update again soon^{TM}

It has everything you could want. A BAMF!Harry as you can see from the first few paragraphs, but he keeps his charm and sarcastic wit about him so it makes for a fun read.

I /know/ I've read way more time travel fics with the premise you outlined, but I can't for the life of my remember any by name. If I happen to remember anymore I'll be sure to let you know.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

  "What we need," Dumbledore said slowly, "is more time." He looked at his watch, "three turns should do it, Miss Granger. Good luck." Only Lady Luck wasn't on time. Time went back, but not to when it should have. "Well, we came from the future, but apparently it wasn't two hours ago as we first thought and if that really is Remus Lupin, I'd wager we went back twenty years..." AU
