As said above, I'm having a hard time. So, tell me, how do you guys like your Theodore's and Pansy's? Give any fics that you think have good characterizations, and feel free to give some advice of your own!


** I like to write Theo as intelligent but a little bit standoffish. I don't think he makes friends easily.

** I'm currently writing a fic that features Theo Nott travelling back in time with Harry.

The whole background I've got for him in my fic is:

1. he watched his father murder his mother so he can see thestrals
2. his father abuses him and wants him to join the death eaters but he doesn't want to
3. he's quiet and standoffish, doesn't make friends easily
4. he's very intelligent and has an interest in making magical items (I'm taking this from something I heard about in the Cursed Child, mainly the point where he was arrested or something for making a time-turner)
5. he wants to be an unspeakable because he likes playing with magic and enchanting (spelling, charming?) things

Basically, most people write Theo as a quiet and standoffish but intelligent person.

** Pansy was written as the "anti-Hermione" and based all the girls who bullied JKR when she was young. So she comes off as horrible because the author has literally stated that she loathes her. She describes her as resembling a hideous pug.

That said. In reality, were the girls who were bullies in YOUR school ugly? Generally not. Usually they were rich and pretty; otherwise who else would put up with their meanness? Could they be annoying/stupid/shallow? Sure, Pansy can still be both of these things. There are plenty of reasons Draco might not have wanted to marry her. But for her to have her oft-echoed "gang of Slytherin girls" following her around all the time, I tend to prefer her shown as, at the least, well-off and attractive (not necessarily a gorgeous, classic beauty, but at least appealing to some).

Parkinson also makes the Sacred 28. So stories that emphasize her bloodline as being on par with Malfoy/Black could justify her not being that good looking but still popular, but I don't often (if ever) see that.

*** Attractive, with a strong jawline, and an upturned nose. There you go, a popular bully who has traits that would give pug as a description. Also, I like pugs, so come off it Rowling!

*** I do think Pansy was actually pretty but not Harry's taste, so he decsribes her in his POV as "pug-looking"; she's probably model-looking, like not conventionally pretty, but has strong features that models often have.

** Pansy is hateful and cowardly. I'm sad we didn't see more Theo in the books, so you could process of eliminate him as a super bully or overtly evil.

Also something must have happened between Pansy and Draco post books because he goes on to marry a sweet Slytherin girl who actually doesn't care much about blood purity and pretty much gives up her life to have scorpius even though she knows about her family's blood curse.

** Well I guess it depends what kind of story it is.

There is not much in canon but it depends do you want them as villains or to flesh them out/possibly redeem them.

Lovesbitca8 has a series that's Draco/Hermione but we a lot of Pansy, Blaise, Theo as Draco friends. The first is linkao3(The Right Thing To Do) (post book 7) and then there is linkao3(All the Wrong Things) which is that story from Draco POV. Then the AU of this story is linkao3(The Auction) which is an AU where Voldemort won so we see all the same characters and parallels but in another universe if that makes sense. The Auction is the only one I read and even if Draco/Hermione isn't my fav ship it's a good read. I really liked Pansy in it, you see more of her than Theo but he's there as well. Perhaps you see more of him in the Right Thing To Do. There is also a story I have not read but looks good that is set in same universe that is short and it's Pansy/Neville linkao3(A Dress with Pockets)

Also, I only got to chapter 17 of this but linkao3(Isolation) is Draco/Hermione but apparently Theo and Blaise show up later and are characterized well.

I have read linkao3(Breath Mints/Battle Scars) which again Draco/Hermione but you see a lot of Theo and Pansy.

I think both characters have potential depending how you want to work them. Pansy is a lot meaner than Hermione is or at least more of a bully. Pansy and Theo could also been seen as morally grey which can be interesting to write. We know she tries to get with and does date Draco for years but doesn't end up with him and even when she's with him seems insecure in their relationship (asking if he thinks Ginny is pretty), she also must take what happens to him in the later books hard. She seems bigoted but you could redeem her if you wanted. I believe her dad is a Death Eater? I haven't read the later books in ages. She seems insecure. She can also be written to be the type to ruin certain things instead of hoping then being disappointed. We don't know much about her friend group or where she stands among the Slytherins so that's something to play with.

Theo is in the higher level potions and he saw his dad murder his mom (?) when he was young and his dad is a death eater. I mean you can have him really lean into that or you can have him hate the Death Eaters and his dad due to how it tore apart his entire family.

  Hermione felt the pounding in her ears again. She would see him for the first time since the Great Hall, gaunt and stricken at the Slytherin table with his mother clutching his arm. She hadn't meant to look for him. Not in the corridors, not beneath the white sheets of the fallen, not on the way to the Chamber of Secrets with Ron, but she was a stupid girl.
