Okay I read this chapter of Doing Things Differently, and had to share it. I think this is the best description of Snape i've ever seen, and one of the reasons is, because it actually brings real world examples to parallel it. Can anyone else think of a better way to describe him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10508602/9/Doing-Things-Differently]]

Edit: Wow, only 13% upvoted. People must either really hate the story(which shouldn't effect the accurate explanation within, I myself didn't get past chapter 12), explanation, or just really like snape. Curious, which is it.

I mean I can see liking Alan Rickman if your talking about the movie version, but if that is the only reason some of you feel so strongly against it, just think of the book version, and not what you think of Alan.

Thanks, Warryn.


** I dislike Snape, but I disagree with this parallel. If everything in HP was so morally black and white, it would be just boring.

All I see here is an awful “self-righteous Harry” fanfiction trying to be smart.

*** To be fair, the explanation he gave is accurate. What of the explanation do you disagree with, because while it's not black, and white. The way he explains it from his point of view is true. Imagine yourself in his shoes in that situation using the KKK to blood purity explanation. Would you be chummy to such a person who lead indirectly to the death of your parents, was part of such a movement, and shows, even in the books, and movies that Snape, at least in Harry's eyes, doesn't seem to show many redeeming qualities.

** Do we really need to go through this again, there is a whole long thead about him and his motivations that we had here recently already: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7bzkwf/discussion_the_hypocrisy_surrounding_severus_snape/]]

He is a such a polarizing character and he is not a good person but this description just doesn't capture him at all in my opinion. And I am not talking about movie Snape, I love book Snape in all his messed up emotional glory and he is just not black and white like this author makes him out to be. I agree with the other poster that it sounds like a self righteous Harry trying to be smart and failing at making a good, compelling argument.

Snape is very complicated and while the KKK analogy does work a bit, I don't agree with the way the argument is set up at all, it misses all the complexity of the actual situation. I can't say I can make a better argument, but he is my take on it: Snape grew up in bad environment, he got drawn into the wrong crowd. Why? He lived in the same dorms as them, they provided protection from the marauders, something more than being a poor half blood. He wanted acceptance, knowledge, power and somewhere to belong, death eaters provided him all that. He is and was emotionally messed up in many ways due to his home life, being a poor half blood in slytherin and could not see that joining death eaters and dark arts were contradictory to his friendship with Lily. He said the wrong thing in anger (who hasn't done that before, haven't you ever cursed at someone you love in the heat of the argument?) and then lost friendship with his (basically the only true) friend. Then while a member of said organization, he is faced directly with consequences of his actions and is basically responsible for Lily dying. He spends his entire rest of lifetime spying for the other side, continuing even when he has zero support and kills the only person who knows the truth about him, risking his life against Voldemort every day when he could just not do any of that.

Yes, he is a terrible person. Yes, he is absolutely horrible to Harry and his friends, he can't let go of school grudges, he is emotionally unstable at times and really can't stand Harry but still manages to help him in the end. He is a product of his environment and his messed up choices and even though he is unable to get over his hate and anger at everything, he still remains loyal to Dumbledore and does the right thing in the end which is admirable. If I had a friend that went into ISIS or something, I would likely never talk to them again and completely break off any friendship, but it doesn't mean I would be unable to at least recognize the circumstances that lead to it or not feel sorry for them to making such a choice. If this said friend spend the entire rest of his life going against ISIS/KKK to make up their mistake, (even while failing at actually being a good person or even if for the wrong reason), why not forgive them or at least try to understand why?

One of my favorite traits of Harry is that he forgives. I like that he is able to forgive Snape in the end despite all the bad blood between them. It makes him a good person in my mind and I feel like it's justified to at least acknowledge the good things Snape has done (although naming his son after him may have been too much, not sure what the reason for that was.) Maybe he recognizes the similar childhood situations or is able to relate to him on some level, but I feel like its understandable why Harry is able to forgive him. I just can't stand when authors make Harry into the type of character who is written in this fic.

*** Sadly, I can't agree with you there on most points. While he may be a product of his environment, the only reason he went against the death eaters is his friendship(and crush?) with Lily. He didn't do it out of believing what he was doing was wrong, neither did/does he care if Harry as a baby or teenager, and James die. James I can somewhat understand to a degree, but that he only asked for Lily's life, and not James or Harry shows that while he did turn against Voldemort, he didn't do it for the right reasons. He still doesn't care for anyone muggle, or pureblood, he turned Voldemort towards the Potters, and the Longbottoms.

While from outside view it may be easier to forget these little tidbits, not to mention how much of a prick he is to everyone, but seriously put yourself in Harry's shoes. Imagine a friend of yours indirectly caused the death of your parents, leading to a chain reaction of living with the Dursley's. Then this same person loathes you, and makes it known regularly as a teacher(in the real world who the hell thinks it's a good idea to hire a terriost, sorry 'former terriost' as a bloody teacher, he alone probably helped cut down on healers, and aurors by quite a bit just, because of his horrible personality, and was terrible at teaching).

I'm sorry, but Harry must be retarded to forgive him. Tolerate...sure. Forgive no. Even you in that same position would not forgive such a person, and if you think you would, you're either lying to yourself, or must not care if someone indirectly caused the death of your parent's, and lead to you living 10 years as an, at the least, emotionally abused, and starved(by food, and emotion) boy, and that's only what we see.

So sorry that I don't see a terriost who has caused the death of multiple people, broken up family's, even if indirectly somewhat lessoned the amount of aurors, and healers due to how terrible of a personality, and teacher he is, and taunt's said kid's(both Neville, and Harry), and at least insults Harry about his father, and you are truly an idiot if you believe it's alright to forgive such a man.

I may have a somewhat black, and white personality on this, but if said person tries to make up for said mistake only, because of a very good friend dying, but still is a terrible person, then that means, suprise, suprise he's still a terrible person.
