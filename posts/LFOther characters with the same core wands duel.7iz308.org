A bit confusing title, I'm looking for fics where characters other than Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore duel and their wands happen to have the same core and create the priori incantato spell.


** linkffn(A Different Universe) explains why the effect is so rare. It's not just the cores coming from the same creature, the wand woods have to either identical or opposite, and the lengths have to complement.

*** There's a different explanation that I think must be the canon one --- it's not just "cores from the same animal", it's "/the only two cores/ from that same animal". Ollivander does note that Harry and Voldemort's wands' case is interesting because the Phoenix gave "another feather... /just/ one".
