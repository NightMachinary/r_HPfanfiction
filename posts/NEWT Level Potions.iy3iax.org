What sort of potions or topics do you think would be covered in a NEWT Level class? I've looked it up but only sixth year and below is covered. I'm trying to find some inspiration for a fic I'm writing. Thanks!


** 6th year is a N.E.W.T level class, but I think that one of the things they would cover in the 7th year is Veritaserum.

*** Also polyjuice. Slughorn said in their first lession they should be able to brew it by the time of their NEWTs but they didn't brew it in year six.

**** Yeah, Malfoy even had to steal Slughorn's supply. If they were covering it in sixth year, surely it would have been mentioned.

** Likely complex and esotheric potions. Off the top of my head, I'd say three are covered almost definitely, which are Veritaserum, Felix Felicis and Polyjuice. Maybe Skelegrow and Dreamless Sleep (if it's canon, I don't know actually), depending on their difficulty. Amortentia is also covered, as seen in the books.

As a little 'fuck you' to JKR, I usually headcanon a potion that changes a person's sex to align with your gender identity, for use by trans wizards and witches.

I'm not the biggest fan of the "sex change" potion, mainly because of its implications. I feel like, if such a potion existed, it would not be used to align someone with his or her "gender identity", but rather to push the interest of a family, no matter what the child think.

Something like "/Somehow, the 1st child of these Pureblood families is always a son/", or "/Regulus, I know you are 8 and a boy, but the Rosier need to marry their last son and they are a suitable family, so drink think and you name is know Rachel/", followed by "/Sirius was a dissapointment and left the family, good for you you are a boy again/".

I would prefer to ignore the whole situation rather than going into this mess. But then again, I'm not very interested in "gender identity" in the first place, so I understand if some people were more angry about what Rowling said and would want to say "fuck you" to her.

**** You misunderstand. The potion aligns your sex with your gender identity. It can't be used for the opposite purpose. Not a sex-change potion, but one that unifies the two. If a cis person takes it they might feel funny for a while, but nothing happens. It's basically magic ultra-HRT that works based on your mind.

The "aligns your sex with your gender identity" part should be taken literally, it's not just flowery language.

** I have this idea in my head that at NEWT level the potions get very personalised.

For example, I imagine the recipe for Amortentia is different for every person who brews it - Hermionie would need freshly mown grass and new parchment, Harry would need treacle tart and broomstick handles, etc. Essentially the potion bottles some of their own feelings of love and so requires ingredients that symbolise what you love. But then the other ingredients in Amortentia would need to be modified to incorporate these extra ingredients (e.g. if you had freshly mown grass, maybe you want to avoid adding any other chopped up plants and so need to find suitable substitutes).

Or perhaps they just have really weird ingredients - like the key ingredient for veritaserum could be "a truth unwillingly revealed". The brewer would have to have had some secret revealed against her wishes, and then incorporates that into the potion by the addition of symbolic ingredients representing that truth. The better the choice of symbols and the more painful the reveal of the truth, the more veritaserum you get at the end.

(Obviously there is no evidence whatsoever that Harry Potter potions work this way, but I thought it was a cool idea and wanted to share)

** I imagine it'd be more technique and improvisation than specific potions. How to tell when the temperature needs changing, what stirrer material and cauldron material needs to be used, etc.

Basically, covering the foundation topics for any knowledge you'd feasibly need to design your own potion.
