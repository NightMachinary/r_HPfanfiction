#+TITLE: Working at the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad is normally a rather safe and less-than-challenging job. Unless, of course, you were assigned to any cases involving one Harry James Potter.

With a sigh, the elderly man regarded the sheer chaos that had been a regular day in London Zoo just moments ago.

Upon reaching the rhinoceros exhibit, Harry's cousin Dudley had pushed Harry to get a better view of the animals - whereupon Harry had Apparated himself on top of a rhinoceros, before Transfiguring the hopelessly confused and panicked animal into an Erumpent.\\
The newly-minted Erumpent wasted no time in breaking out of the metal fencing surrounding the enclosure, giving young Harry the ride of his life - a ride which, contrary to all good sense and survival instincts, the child seemed to be thoroughly enjoying as he shouted encouragements at the animal, which was currently chasing down the Dursley family with single minded abandon.

This was decidedly /not/ what the Obliviator had signed up for when he joined the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad. It was normally a rather safe job, if never quite boring - normal magical children just Vanished food from their plates, occasionally broke a window or turned someone's teeth green. Rarely were Obliviators even needed, as long as you could propagate an excuse that sounded just plausible enough.\\
Harry was the only child whose accidental magic routinely needed a full squad of Aurors, an Unspeakable or two, and occasionally (as in this case) an expert on magical creatures. The child was clearly going to grow up powerful, given his prospensity for endangering the Statute of Secrecy by accident.

Rudolph reflected on the last time he'd been assigned a "Potter Emergency". That was the only time a professional Quidditch team had to be enlisted to help - it was very difficult to catch up with Number 4, Privet Drive as it tried valiantly to reach Lower Earth Orbit with its inhabitants still inside.\\
Honestly, you'd think after that particular episode cost them their house, the Dursleys had learned their lesson about tickling a sleeping dragon...

--------------

My mind works in weird ways, so have a cracky ficlet where Harry's accidental magic is utterly spectacular. Other anecdotes about Harry's many accidents are not just welcome, they're encouraged.

** *This is my first time writing anything like these so please have a bit of mercy for my english and story building and the like.*

Harry's day was going pretty well so far, he had cooked breakfast, managed to steal away 2 slices of bread more than he was allowed to have and even managed to be in the garden longer than necessary. This day changed directions when his cousin, Dudley, decided Harry needed some 'exercise', this of course did not mean friendly jogging, or even a sparring match of Dudleys favorite sport: Kickboxing. What Dudley had in mind was a bit more fun for Dudley and less so for Harry: Harry Hunting. When Harry saw his cousing walk towards him, cracking his knuckles and smirking all the way, Harry took of like there was no tomorrow. After running past several parked cars and hiding behind a red one, Harry got an idea. /What if I crawl under the car?/ So he acted fast, dropping down to the ground and shoving himself under the stationary vehicle. Dudley of course had missed this and after running past the car looking for Harry he decided it wasn't worth the effort and started looking for another target. Harry however, was still under the car, panting from exhaustion caused by running too fast for too long. Suddenly, Harry felt like he had unlimited energy and immediately got up from the ground, fully ignoring the car that got thrown away by Harry's 'immense' power. Harry started running in the opposite direction of where Dudley went and didn't notice the amount of discord he left behind. Everywhere Harry went, lights burst, cars crumpled, roads cracked, windows shattered and birds got a sudden boost upwards.

Rudolph was relaxing in his usual chair when suddenly he heard his colleague Dennis shout "Sir? There is a massive surge of magical energy detected in surrey again." Mark, Rudolphs boss, replied in a frustrated tone "Potter again? He can't leave us be for even a week can he now?" "Yes sir, it seems like its Potter again, who should we send?" Mark frowned and sent a glance Rudolphs way. "Send Rudolph and the Obliviators, they can ask for further hulp as is needed." Rudolph groaned, hoping he was inconspicuous enough to stay in the comfy office with his paperwork. "Why me boss? I went last week!" "Yeah but Dennis and I went last time so it's your turn again." Rudolph got up with a suffering sigh, took out his wand and pressed it to the first nob on his badge. "Certiorem Obliviator Office" was clearly heard though the room. When Rudolph pushed his wand to the second nob on his badge and said "Portus Surrey Wallden Str" and then "Activate" there was the signature sound of a portkey activating and then Rudolph was gone.

-- not sure how to do line breaks --

Rudolph landed in the middle of the street, altough it looked more like a warzone, and quickly looked around. After a few seconds there was a small flash and there stood a squad of Obliviators, ready for action. After confirming there was nobody that saw them arrive the Obliviators relaxed a bit and their team leader asked "Potter again?" "We think so, but I haven't located him yet." Rudolph slowly took in all the destruction and wondered what happened this time to set the young Harry Potter on this much destruction. It took a few seconds to really take in what happened and then it occured to Rudolph that he would have to call the department of magical construction. They probably wouldn't be happy to be disturbed once again. According to themselves they where the busiest department and they had been called four times by Rudolphs department in the last month already after all. Rudolph pressed the first knob again and incanted "Certiorem Construction Office". With that done, he started looking for the child.

-- not sure how to do line breaks --

Harry had still not noticed what he was doing and was happily sprinting all the way to the playground. While he did find it a bit unusual how much energy he had he did not question it. He was, after all, only 9 years old. After finally reaching the swings on the playground and sitting on one of them he stopped feeling so immensly powerful and just enjoyed swinging for a bit.

​

-- still not sure how to do line breaks --

​

After looking for the better part of half an hour Rudolph finally located young Harry, happily swinging and still not having noticed the havoc he had created. Concluding that young Harry was fine and that Rudolphs time would be better used helping setting everything to rights again. He informed his superiors that Harry was okay and oblivious to what he had done and got to work fixing the street.

"Pro" tip for if you ever want to write seriously: Put down what you wrote for a week or so before re-reading, so you go back in having mostly forgotten what you wrote. That way it's easier to spot what you'd want to change.

** I'd be interested in taking this in a more serious direction where Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys is exposed early on, and we get to follow maybe a OC muggleborn or *insert whatever character* that's in the accidental magic squad as they try to work against the corruption in the government and Dumbledore's influence to get Harry out of the Dursley's home.\\
Edit: It'd be cool if the OC AMSquad member had a kid who was in Harry's school who helped enlighten him as to what's happening to Harry.\\
"Hey Dad, you remember the stories you used to tell me about the war and how it was ended by a baby named Harry Potter? I have a Harry Potter in my class"\\
