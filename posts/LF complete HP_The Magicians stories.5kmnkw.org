I kind of see Brakebills as some sort of "Hogwarts College" and I can't seem to find many fics, let alone completed ones, with Harry and co crossing over with Brakebills crowd. Any help would be appreciated.


** I would love to see this as well, but I can't help but think it would be very very rare.

** theres like one crossover fic on archiveofourown but its very bad. part of the problem is that the magicians fandom is very small and we dont have a lot of fic writers
