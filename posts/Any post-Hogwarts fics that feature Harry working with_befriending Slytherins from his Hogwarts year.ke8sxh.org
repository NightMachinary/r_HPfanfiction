I'd rather not have them be Harry/Draco fics, but it's fine if they are. If there are pairings between them, I'd rather them be Harry/Theo, Harry/Daphne, or Harry/Blaise. Or Harry/Ginny or Harry/Ron/Hermione (the only multiple ship I'll accept). I don't want Dramione, either.

I'm good with genfics, too. I don't really want the fics to be based on the relationship, either, but if it features plot alongside a relationship, then that's fine.

I kind of like the way they did it in linkffn(Novocaine) though it doesn't even have to be like that fic at all. I don't care if they're political or not or even features the Wizengamot. I'm pretty much game for everything.

I don't want Year Eight stuff, either. I'd prefer Harry to be out of Hogwarts and working or something. Auror Potter, Lord Potter, something else Potter. Fine, just no school stuff. If he happens to visit Hogwarts occasionally, fine. I just don't want him to be a teacher either.

Linkffn(Witches of Westfield) kinda did the relationship part well (though I am *not* looking for harem fics)

Thanks!

  After the end of the war, Harry has a meeting in Gringotts that changes his life. Given a unique opportunity to rebuild the world, he takes it upon himself to restore what was once lost to the wizarding world, while falling for a charming witch at the same time.

  The war is over, Voldemort was defeated and the summer draws to a close as the new school term begins. Harry must decide what to do with his life. Will he return to school for his 7th year, be an Auror...or something else? Read along as Harry finally has control of his own life...or does he?

** You'll have to read for a while, but in my fic Harry eventually befriends Draco, Blaise, Theo, Daphne, and Pansy, and there are ongoing interactions with all of them.

*** It would be funny and surprising if your fic ended up as a Harry/Daphne pairing. They've been friendly every time they encountered each other (~4 times through 100 chapters). However, it wouldn't make sense with how the plot has developed to this point.

My favorite female interactions for Harry in your story thus far have been with Helena, Sophie, Gemma, and Lisa.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** The great thing about Harry having a relationship with non-Gryffindor women (or men) is that it significantly opens the number of stories that you can explore. Here are a couple to consider that include Slytherins:

- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]]" features Draco helping Harry recover from his long-term alcohol induced stupor. Harry plays relationship chicken with Daphne. linkffn(6257522)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12898815/1/Wheels-Within-Wheels-Part-1][Wheels Within Wheels]]" features a marriage contract between Harry and Daphne with them becoming a power couple. There are 3 separate fics covering roughly 20 years. The first one is linked here. linkffn(12898815)

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

  Wheels Within Wheels is the story of Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, who were promised to one another by their parents in the dark days of the First Wizarding War. As they explore their new, sometimes overwhelming mutual feelings, they also discover heretofore unknown facts, and facets, about their parents, close associates, and themselves.
