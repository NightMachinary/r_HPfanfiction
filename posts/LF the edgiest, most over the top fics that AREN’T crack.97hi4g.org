Super dark Harry, evil twins, super villain Dumbledore. Fics that are so crazily edgy you can't believe they're not crack.

Slash and crossovers are fine. Please no genderbendjng, pottercest, mpreg, or smut/romance-centric plots. Thank you!

  In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash.

*** I mean, for all that it is perhaps the most over the top evil Dumbledore I've seen written, there is a /lot/ of vast and deep world building within. Enough to, imo, be almost worth handling the Dumbledore if there weren't so many issues with the smut portions (namely age difference and consent issues, and that's on the "good" side, much less the actions attributed to the various villains)

**** Oh, I agree. If you took out most of the smut and all of the rehashing, it would be an okay fic. Most people I've heard talking about it have only gotten to chapters 50-70 for that reason, me included.

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi

** linkffn(6763981), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/2/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][The Dark Lord's Equal]], is definitely edgy and over the top. It basically just throws every trope ever into the story unironically without lampshading them as tropes, with a super grizzled war-veteran Harry. It's like a fanfic written by someone who only reads fanfics.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
