Need help finding stories where a new character goes to hogwarts. I am talking about OC male characters mostly. Crossovers are welcome as long as its one or 2 people not a whole group.

Fanfics like this one [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12221534/1/]]

Thank you


** Just in case you always wanted an OC who is Sirius's daughter but knew that they are all crap, here is a really good one(as far as I can remember). She is not a Mary Sue and somewhat unlikeable at times. Linkffn(7936530)

Linkffn(8096183) has a male oc. I've never read it, but people say it's good.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
