Need to develop curriculum for an Ancient Runes class, so Grey!Indy!Harry can have a deep ‎discussion with Hermione, and earn Ron's ire?‎

Need some actual, real-life ancient runes for a blood magic ritual your Dark!Harry is performing, ‎so that he can increase his strength and/or magical power?‎

Well do I have the websites for you! ‎

‎~~~~‎

First up, Norse Runes, most commonly used in the HP fandom because the only runes ‎mentioned in the seven-book canon [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ehwaz][are Norse]]. [[https://web.archive.org/web/19990501094729/http://www.ragweedforge.com/poems.html][This ‎link]] is a good introduction and discussion to Elder Futhark, Younger Futhark, and Anglo-Saxon ‎runes, using Norse and Anglo-Saxon rune poems (kinda like the alphabet song but more detailed) ‎as a guide. If you want your runes to be at least somewhat linguistically and historically accurate, ‎or just want some ideas for runes to use, this is an absolutely excellent source.‎

Next up, we have the Hebrew Alphabet. Hebrew is used /much/ less than Norse in HP fics, but ‎for any good worldbuilder who doesn't want to postulate that Vikings somehow accidentially ‎stumbled across a fundamental language of magic, when no other society ever did, runes from ‎other civilizations are essential. Hebrew is the second most common because Judaism has a ‎HUGE history of letter and alphabet-based esoterica. Seriously, letters and word transposition ‎forms one of the funamental parts of Kabbalic philosophy. Hebrew letters also are very attractive ‎because they have meanings which can be mapped back onto their Phonecian originators, as ‎Hebrew is one of the "closest" of Phonecian's descendants to the original wiritng system, keeping ‎a lot of its features, and having an almost one-to-one letter correspondence. Phonecian, being the ‎origin of almost every single writing system in Europe, as well as West, South, and Southeast Asia, ‎has HUGE draw as a "mystical language from the cradle of humanity", and aside from Egyptian, ‎and Sumerian, you can't get many writing systems that scream "ancient lost knowledge". ‎

You can find a good, relativley succinct introduction to the Kabbalistic properties of Hebrew ‎letters [[http://www.walkingkabbalah.com/hebrew-alphabet-letter-meanings/][here]], and if you ‎want to go deeper, you can read an individual article on the letter of your choice ‎‎[[http://www.walkingkabbalah.com/hebrew-alphabet-letter-meanings/][here]]. I haven't cross-‎checked all the information, but if you ever find conflicts, I'd go with Chabad.com, it's a pretty ‎well-known resource for Jewish mysticism. ‎

Alternatively, you can use Arabic letters if you prefer their more flowing shape, because Islam has ‎an equally long and important tradition of letter-based mysticism in numerous Sufi practices. Just ‎as you can map the mystical interpretations of Hebrew letters onto their phonecian counterparts, ‎you can do the same with Arabic letters for the same reason. Just remember, arabic letters are ‎‎/ligatures/, they /change form/ when put next to other letters in words. So an arabic letter in ‎isolation looks /very/ different from one in a spell or incantation. ‎

There are less English sources on Islam than Judaism, do to Judaism's close historical ties to ‎Europe, but a good English-language guide I found can be found ‎‎[[https://makashfa.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/sufi-alphabets-and-symbols/][here]]. Alternativley, if ‎you want a more academic and thought-provoking source, you can use [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SE_twSFZ9vSKkKLqIZGcJ7_chO4Jw0y2][this ‎article]] by Venetia ‎Porter, which goes into great depth about the methods through which letters and calligraphy are ‎used to imbue objects with magical properties. Personally, this article was a HUGE help to my ‎writing, even though I'm using Hebrew and Norse runes instead of Arabic (I think that they both ‎look much better standing alone than the more cursive arabic letters do). It really helped me ‎think of ways that runes can be used /on/ an object, instead of just assuming, like msot fics do, ‎that any rune-enhanced object has some ugly-looking portion that's covered in ancient script. It's ‎fascinating to see how magical runes can be woven into the decorations and designs of an object, ‎and not just left to be crammed together on a hidden wardstone. ‎

Finally, if none of these feel appropriate, you can find a different system that feels right for you, or use it as the basis to invent your own. If you want to go down that road, I recommend you use /Ancient Scripts/ to browse what are ‎called "logographic" or "logophonetic" writing systems. ‎Each page has a brief sample platter of symbols and their meanings, so you can find a system that looks right to you, or, if you prefer, mix and match as you please. If you find a single writing system that you want to use, you can just use google to find a shcolarly dictionary that will let you search for any meaning your heart desires.

Hope this helps everyone out there who needs worldbuilding help with Ancient Runes


** Haha, I ended up with similar resources when I was learning about Ancient Runes for my fic.

I went with the Phonecian script instead of the Hebrew script with a ton of Ancient Egyptian thrown in. Arabic will be a feature as well, as most my fic will be taking place in a modern day Ottoman Empire and parts of the Middle East.

In my head canon, Ancient Runes were often used before the wand for complicated bits of magic. Instead of several wand movements and words to activate a spell, you would use characters, ingredients and something to conduct magic (blood, water, etc, etc).

A lot of the older ritual magic was lost after wands made things significantly easier, but they are still used in magic that will last, such as 'wards' or permanent spells on items (warming charms in clothing, keeping a piece of furniture from being damaged, etc, etc)

** "Ancient Runes" refers to Old Norse written in Elder Fuþark anyway. There's no need for looking for specific examples within the text.

/Sidenote: "ehwaz" is actually Proto-Germanic, ca. 1st century, so if you want to be/ */really/* /accurate, "Ancient Runes" should actually refer to Etruscan letters/.

However, I think JKR didn't think any of that though properly. Look at /The Tales of Beedle the Bard/. Beedle was born in the 1400s in Yorkshire... and wrote his /Tales/ in Runes. About 600 years after Runes ceased being used anywhere in England. Even Scandinavia, whence came Runes, had shifted to the Latin alphabet some time before.
