Hi, everyone,

The podcast feed for the audiobook project is up right now on Anchor and Spotify. As some of you probably know, the audiobooks for /Cauterize/ and Chapter One of /Saving Connor/ are done (just search “Harry Potter Fanfiction Audiobook Project” and you'll find them). The problem, however, is that they aren't edited up to a point where I'm happy with them.

I could edit myself (badly), but is there anyone who would willing to help me so they sound a bit more professional? I'll DM you my email address and send you the file if there are.

I'll probably be re-recording /Cauterize/ and Chapter 1 of /Saving Connor/ as well.
