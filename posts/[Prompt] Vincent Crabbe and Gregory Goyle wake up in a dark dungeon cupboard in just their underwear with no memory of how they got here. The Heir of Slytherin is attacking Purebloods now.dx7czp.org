Basically let's logically expand on what might have happened in Slytherin and beyond if the heirs of two Death Eater Pureblood houses were drugged, robbed and humiliated - never mind then impersonated - by person or persons unknown, at a time when the school is already on high alert for attacks on students.

** Didn't one of them, Crabbe or Goyle, attack a muggle in real life? Movie Crabbe or Goyle.

*** Don't see how it's relevant, but Crabbe was arrested once for cannabis possession (which is why he wasn't in the 7th film) and he took part in the 2011 London Riots.

Also, people in real life are just called, y'know, people. Not 'muggle'.

**** Didn't say it was relevant. Just asking a question. I remembered hearing something about one of them. Sorry about the question and the "muggle" thing. Didn't think it would offend the fanfic community, y'know?

***** It's not that we're offended, it's just bizarre that you would make the distinction in real life, where most people assume that all there are is muggles, as well as a "muggle" community on reddit.

Not to menion that the actor is a muggle himself
