I read a fic a while back with Harry/Gabrielle Delacour that basically had him tricked into a soul bond with her by Dumbledore, and Harry taking a job as the flying instructor at Beauxbatons, which led to a new tri-wizard tourney style event at Hogwarts, which is essentially run by Snape and Draco despite Harry winning the war.

Pretty sure it was on FF.net but can't find it now. Much thanks for the help!


** I think the one you're looking for is Hope by Jeconais. It's an old story. If you can't find it on FFN, try his portal. It'll show up when you Google his name. Linkffn (Hope by Jeconais)

*** Remember, you can't have a space in between "linkffn" and your parentheses. [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/blob/master/README.md][*Read the usage guide here.*]] Regardless, Jeconais doesn't have any stories on fanfiction.net.

**** First time use. Didn't remember the syntax correctly. Also he used to have a profile on FFN. He must have removed it.

***** Yeah. Something about ffnet changing their guidelines, IIRC.

** If you're going to read Hope then you NEED to read this to linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate]]).
