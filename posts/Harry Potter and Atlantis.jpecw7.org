Is there any Fanfictions with Harry involved with the City or People of Atlantis in some way?

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** linkffn(Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad by nonjon). More involved with the remnant technology/magic of Atlantis, though. I quite liked this one.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]] by esama. I haven't gotten around to reading this yet.

There's also a story (whose name I can't come up with right now) in which Harry does something (triggers an artifact or performs a ritual or something) and lives an entire lifetime in Atlantis in a dream.

  COMPLETE. One-Shot. Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.

*** I have read some of those and it's not really that interesting. I'd like it to be non crossover, cause thay feels more original.
