When I first read the series I thought that Ron and his father Arthur as well the rest of the Weasleys were in fact related to Arthur Wellesley, The Duke of Wellington famous general in the Napoleonic wars and twice Prime minister, sadly I had misread.

Has anyone ever written a fic about Posh and noble Weasleys?


** Yes, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] exactly has that. But it's also set in a non magical sci-fi AU:

- The Weasleys are the Wellesleys. This Ron's grandpa is the Duke of Wellington, Arthur is the Marquis of Duro, and Molly is the Princess of Prussia, most likely modeled after [[https://royalwatcherblog.com/2020/04/28/princess-antonia-duchess-of-wellington/][Princess Antonia of Prussia]] from our world.
- As a result, the Purebloods in this fic are British/European nobilities. Tom Riddle is the Lord Gaunt and bent on destroying the British democracy. He's also a genius mad scientist who has invented many cool weapons.
- Hogwarts is a spy school for the British elites and commoners with special talents. The kids undergo extreme training right from day one and are all very dangerous.
- Dumbledore is a former top spymaster and utterly manipulative and ruthless. However, he and his Order face overwhelming odds as Riddle has widespread support within the Ministry and among the aristocracy.
- James Potter was the 007 at the time of his death. Riddle targeted him not because of some prophecy, but because he obtained key intel about Riddle. Dumbledore tried to groom Harry into becoming the next 007.
- This fic is complete, goes through all 7 years, and loosely mirrors canon events. But the last year is very very different, and the body count by the Trio is astronomical.
