Dumbledore is great but I love the insane versions of him - not the Evil!Manipulative!Dark!Butterbeans!Wizard!Dumbledore but legit insane. I just read chapter 17 of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality By: Less Wrong) and it's portrayal of him was just amazing. Extremely different from cannon yet amazing.

Does anyone else prefer insane Dumblybore? He's just so entertaining to read.


** Linkffn(11634921) has an excellent insane/apathetic Dumbledore.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

The quality of a story - how "good" it is, should /never/ be dependent on whether it is finished or not. Is it fulfilling to have an ending - to have that sense of closure? Absolutely. I believe the moniker of "good" is solely dependent on the author's grammar, plot, and writing ability. Not on their ability or willingness to finish it.

#+begin_quote
  that's pretty much the basic requirement for a professional author.
#+end_quote

Professional authors write because it's their /job/, not because it is their hobby, as in the case of fanfiction writers. FF writers stop posting because they lose inspiration, encounter writer's block, or personal issues. Does your father having a heart attack and becoming disabled make one author whose stories I enjoy a bad writer? In this case, it's implying that it is /their fault/ for having that happen to them. And even in less traumatic cases, as in loss of inspiration, they aren't obligated to finish their stories if they are unable to, or no longer desire to do so. Some authors just cease enjoying it.

#+begin_quote
  A captivating stoy that leaves you hanging without a resolution is worse. Dozens of Fanfics have taught me that.
#+end_quote

But I can wholeheartedly agree with this. An unfinished story lacks a sense of closure - the knowledge of what exactly happened at the ending. Unfinished stories left abandoned on cliffhangers are so much worse.

I don't expect authors to finish their stories in a few days or weeks, or even months, depending on the length of their stories. I don't even expect them to finish all their stories - sometimes, a story simply has to be dropped. But if that happens more often than not, and the updates slow down, or the author keeps starting new stories without ever finishing them... well, they're not a good author in that case. Sometimes you simply have to keep working, and push through.

And yes, I know that real life takes precedence, especially for hobby authors - but if you're not writing any more, you're not exactly doing what authors do.

Well, he *is* an acclaimed author and his main work is - as of yet - unfinished. So reality seems to disagree with your notion that you can't be a good author if your stories are unfinished. I think GRRM was already a good author after the first book, I really didn't need to read the rest to know that.

Him - probably - being unable to finish his epic story is completely irrelevant in that regard for me. He's just a bad planner and a little delusional.

If you now complain "Hey, that's not good enough" then I think we both agree that you don't really care about having an end for the sake of having an end.

I think there's often a good reason why stories are unfinished and if the author has no good ideas for a satisfying ending I vastly prefer nothing over a half-arsed ending that tries to wrap everything up in 1 chapter (seen a few of those, didn't appreciate them at all and would have rather left stuff up for my own imagination... even 10 years later I'm still trying hard to forget that stupid epilogue with little success)

Oh dude, that's extremely radical. I personally prefer your approach as well, but there is a whole category of authors who don't work like that.

Coming full circle to GRRM:

#+begin_quote
  “I think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows. And I'm much more a gardener than an architect.”

**** It's a series of CYOA. The character embarks on a journey into the multiverse, going from one fiction setting to another (each of these iterations being called a jump), and is granted some powers and items at the beginning of each one, basically.

Description from [[/r/jumpchain][r/jumpchain]]:

#+begin_quote
  What is JumpChain?\\
  The Jumpchain series of CYOAs was begun by an Anon named Quicksilver from /tg/. It has grown enormously over time now with hundreds of separate cyoa's all designed to link together.\\
  Here's the set up: You are contacted by an omnipotent entity. a dangerously bored omnipotent entity. It sends you across the multiverse you go on adventures to keep it entertained. Every world you arrive in you must survive for 10 years by whatever means you see fit. From there you can go home, stay in your current world or move on to a new one.\\
  You can keep your new abilities, gear, powers, friends, etc. from one adventure to the next. If you die, however, you are sent home immediately. You keep what you have so far, but your multiversal adventuring days are over.\\
  The Goal? well the original goal was to reach a sufficient power level to survive in the most dangerous of universes (like dragon ball z, Warhammer 40k, etc). At that point the entity would grant you the 'Planeswalker spark' to let you freely travel the universe at your leisure... but to some, the journey itself is it's own reward.
