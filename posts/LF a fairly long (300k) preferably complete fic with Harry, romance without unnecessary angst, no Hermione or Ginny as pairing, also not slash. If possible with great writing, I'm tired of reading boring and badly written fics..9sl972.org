#+TITLE: LF a fairly long (300k+) preferably complete fic with Harry, romance without unnecessary angst, no Hermione or Ginny as pairing, also not slash. If possible with great writing, I'm tired of reading boring and badly written fics.

I've read so many fics that aren't H/Hr or H/G that are romance( Don't enjoy fanon's typical view on them as a general rule, though there are a few that are great) that I rarely get interested in something new (or new to me at least) so if anyone have low-radar fic, I'd be really happy. I don't mind the setting much, as long as it isn't a DE Harry or with a stupid GG "Dumbles". I dislike bashing(hating is cool if there's reason though) because for me, if an author resorts to bashing for bashing's sake, it usually means that they either are lazy or immature, at least to my eyes.

As an example, a few of my favourite fics are Grow Young with Me, Stages of Hope, Black Bond (I loved Sirius in this, its imo, the best canon-like Sirius), HP and the PoS, Hogwarts Battle School, and The Legacy. I usually prefer OC pairings, but my favorite are Daphne (Though I'm pretty sure I've read every H/D fic over 200k that is in FFN, except that "Bella's second chance" because the english was so so horrible, even if its a translation).

If there are pearls in Ao3, I'd love it, because I don't usualy browse through it, unless its for smut.

*** Yeah, a cadmean victory was nice, the only other fic I've read and found superb was harry potter and the boy who lived, oc pairing and i like how most of canon was left to his twin and the author explored other aspects of the magical world that we haven't seen before, it was a good read, sadly dropped though.

** Sadily, the only two 'megalong' fics I have on my fav list are h/hr (The Wise One and The Cupboard series).

I recall getting a rec for a long Harry/Cho 'Harry Potter and the flying squad' but I never got into it. I think the first fic was over 500k and there were like 8 of them o.o [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/horst_pollmann/HPATFS.html]]

In the slightly smaller catagory, you have grains of Sand (HarryxTonks, 200k) linkffn(12188150) my opinion is best of Honks there.

Other pairings that are not bashfests are hard to find. My best Dalphe is sadily Ron/Dalphe, I only had one Harry/Katie that showed promise and it got abandoned. Recently I tried the DC crossover land, where apparently Harry/Kara is s thing... They were not well done ._.

I don't think any of the Harry/Female Harry are good enough to rec unless you are explicitly looking for that pairing

Ron gets reborn. He goes into Slytherin and outsnakes Malfloy. Information is pretty slow to reveal (they just explained how he was reborn in the latest chapter).

Sadily the authors muse is apparently vacationing in RWBY-land, but it is not abandoned

The author seems to be going for 'alien blood causes you to grow up fast' with Dalphe, but it has all the creepynees of the 'ww kid picks their mate at 12' going on.

Given the final few chapters, I don't know if Ron/Violet is still possible. Ron/Hermione has certainly been for closed on barring a memory wipe / reset

*** Haven't read a single fic of Harry/Cho, simply because I find this pairing a bit unhealthy, if its after the cemetery. I might be surprised, sure, but because of it, I've strayed away from any.

I liked Sand, and even if it would eventually turn into a H/Hr/Tonks, we don't have a sequel.

I disliked Red Knight because of a stupid reason that I'm not going go into it.

I don't really like xovers with the exception of PJO, Inheritance Cycle or Twilight. Call me stupid, but that's how it is for me.

AFAIK, the only Harry/femHarry that are good are from Amerision and HP and GWL. Which I read too.

What was the Harry/Katie that was abandoned?

*** Depends on exactly what you want. As a general rule of thumb, the 3 best fics imo are linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw; The Mind Arts; Novocaine) but are several that are really good.

If you haven't read it already, check linkffn(Contract Invalidation; The Other Champion; An Unexpected Friend; Paid in Blood; Honor Thy Blood; Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin; Trapped in a Broom Closet; Days to Come; The Pureblood Princess; The Lies that Bind; Porcelain Doll; Fratterculus; A Fateful Walk; A Champion's new Hope; A different sort of bond; The Lion Tamer)

All of those are mixed in my opinion from a rating of 5-8 from 10 overall. Some are better, some not so. I loved Defiance, but not many people did, as well as Paid in Blood, which is by far, the most emotional I've got from a fic.

There are some Harem fics that I didn't suggest, but rarely they are good.
