Right so my memories are a bit shaky on this but been trying to find a fanfiction called order of the phoenix which i believe was published 2001-2002.

I dont remember a huge amount from it but it did have a sequel whose title i cant remember covering the 6th year but had the school visiting the pyramids, a dance bigger than the yuleball and dumbledore turning out to be voldemorts master.

The person writing it had been planning on writing one covering the 7th year but I dont remember it be released.

Pretty sure it didnt have a huge amount of R rated content (i was 13 when i read it and would probably remember the smut) and I seem to recall it was published on itss own dedicated site.

I've tried to find this a few times over the years but never had any succss and am turning to the experts. Any help is greatly appreciated.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/826742/1/][*/The Order of the Phoenix/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/226550/Ruskbyte][/Ruskbyte/]]

#+begin_quote
  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.

*** I'm reading the start of order of Phoenix by rsukbyte now. Not sure if it is the one I was thinking of however, after searching in both this and the sequel it doesn't look like dumbledore turns evil and no real mention of pyramids.

However the name seems really familiar so still not sure if it's the one I'm thinking of and my memory is just really bad. Either way I'm enjoying the read so far so thanks!

I think I might know a reason for that...
