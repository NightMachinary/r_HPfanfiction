Hello. I've been searching for the past few days but my Google-fu is apparently not up to the task.

Basic time-travel fic as far as I can remember. Hermione for whatever reason ends up in the past with the Marauders. Don't recall any ships. The one specific scene I remember was that Hermione was completing an obstacle course or maze for DADA where she disabled a number of aurors and had to deal with some sort of dangerous creature. Think there was a mention that it was an African predator, so I'm thinking Nundu or Sphinx? To deal with it I think she tore the ground open and had it suck the animal in before closing it back up.

Any help finding the fic and the specific chapter would be greatly appreciated.


** I've read this, but I can't remember the name. I remember it was complete and that it was a Sirius/Hermione or Remus/Hermione, but I'm 90% sure it's Sirius. Hope that helps. If you find it could you let me know which one it is? Thanks.

*** Unfortunately a good 85% of all Marauder-era Hermione fic ships her with one of the Marauders, and chiefly those two. That it may be complete could help. I'll update this if I ever find it.
