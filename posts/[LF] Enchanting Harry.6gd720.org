I would like seeing Harry with the power of ENCHANTMENTS!!! Seriously, I always thought they were underused, si I'd like some please. Thanks!


** enchanting as in gilderoy "ive put a spell on you" lockhart

or enchanting profession ?

also if profession, what type of enchanting you want ?

long lasting charm work, Elder Futhark, anglo saxon,Egyptian hieroglyphs.

thats is many options depend on what you want.

lets not forget type of enchantment, do you want items enchanted, creatures, body, soul ?
