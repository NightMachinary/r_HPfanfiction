For clarification: the snake that escaped from the zoo in Philosopher's Stone.

I want a fic detailing his journey from England to Brazil. Traversing the atlantic and crossing continents, difficulties sneaking around the humans and stuff like that.Something tells me this has the potential to be one of the best stories from the wizarding world.

Have no idea if such a fic exists, but I really want to read it.


** I'd love to read that story.

I also recall one where that snake was quickly recaptured, and still in the zoo some years later when Harry and Daphne, I believe, brought their kids to the same zoo. He remembered Harry and everything - quite a moment.

**** Aha, found it! If all you want is some hot snake on snake action, enjoy the tail end of the epilogue of this classic. (The rest of the story is good too, though.)

***** It's probably good, but I probably won't read it. I'm too much of slut for canon-compliant fics. (Unless it's just a minor change, or something so over the top that it's ridiculus and funny)

I know I probably miss out on a lot of good stuff because of this, but I mostly use fanfiction as an expansion of canon, so... Yeah, that's me.
