** I don't think there's been enough time or development of the Fantastic Beasts plot to really have many good FB fanfics. I've only read a few, and even less are good.

I'd definitely like to read a story with that plotline though.

** You'll have to wait for the film, or at least some Pottermore material from JK before fanfics pop up for this ship. I don't think one cast photo is enough of an incentive.
