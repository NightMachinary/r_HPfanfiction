Only for him to still betray the Potters in the end.

I think if his friend group had picked on him/they hadn't been close/he was always a sketchy bastard from day 1, then it really would have been an idiot moment to pick him as Secret-Keeper. It's easy to bash Peter in Marauder-fics because we know what he does later in his life, but in my opinion it makes the tragedy of what he did to his friends much cheaper. I'd like to see what sort of arc it takes for a loyal friend to turn into a betrayer without something like “He was never loyal to begin with” or “They treated him badly in school so he became a Death Eater”.

** I mean, to be fair, they didn't treat him as an equal from what we know. In PoA, he's described as "that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts" by Rosmerta, and McGonagall said that he "hero-worshipped Black and Potter". It is also revealed in that book that Sirius, Lily, and James decided on their own that Pettigrew would be the Secret-Keeper, with no input from him. In OotP, while Remus, Sirius, and James were chatting about how easy it is, he dmitted that he didn't know a few answers and was mocked for it. Sirius also tells James to stop playing with the Snitch "before Wormtail wets himself from excitement". Pottermore tells us that Remus befriended Peter out of pity, so when James and Sirius befriended Remus, he persuaded them to accept Peter into the group too. It seems that Peter was the Marauders' yes-man, and not an actual friend from what we see.

*** Sometimes you can't validate an adult's opinion about adolescents and their environment because many times they don't understand them. I mean, maybe from McGonagall you can understand, she saw them 24/7 at school, come on if she was the head of Gryffindor and one of her teachers, it was logical that she could distinguish them better than anyone else, but from Madame Rosmerta, well, she didn't see them often except a few times a week. Similarly, we could be misinterpreting McGonagall's words, perhaps "idolize" in this case is synonymous with "appreciate" or "admire", that is how many adults tend to interpret friendship between young people, children who idolize each other or who admire certain attributes, sometimes in the wrong way. I also believe that, except perhaps for Sirius, James and Remus if they saw him as their equal, the name Guardian of the Secret was not a wild card on the part of James or Sirius, if he wanted it to be so it was because they really saw him as their equal and someone they could trust with their life (at least until that moment). About Remus I don't know what to say the truth, maybe in the beginning it was like that, but I want to think that they really formed a friendship bond afterwards, both had certain things in common in my opinion, Remus was not exactly popular among the Marauders, I mean, he was the brain of the group and whatever they wanted, like Hermione in the Golden Trio, but he was not on the same level as James or Sirius either, and Peter maybe had more connection with him in that sense, of his life we really know little.

**** I think the adults were right in this case though. Peter was gasping and cheering when James was playing with the Snitch, while Remus was reading and Sirius was looking around at other students. When Harry viewed the memory, he wondered why nobody told Peter to get a grip on himself. In an interview, JK Rowling said this about their relationship:

#+begin_quote
  Pettigrew, who they, in a slightly patronizing way, James and Sirius at least, who they allowed to hang round with them, it turned out that he was a better wizard than they knew. Turned out he was better at hiding secrets than they knew.
#+end_quote

The language she used indicates that Peter was a hanger-on. Most people wouldn't say that they "allowed" their friend to hang with them.

***** i mean, when you are in school, it can be pretty ordinary to mock your friends after tests, it is friendly banter.

Peter was there the entire time, he participated in making Lupins full moons better, he was a part creator of the map.

Peter could also just be a sports fanatic with zero ability to play the game so he sees himself as James in the scenario
