That just happened to me. I was browsing through adult fanfiction and came across what claimed to be a HarryXHermione affair fic. The main thing that caught my eye about that was apparently no bashing would take place. So I started reading and actually got pretty damn invested. The build up was kind of believable enough and everyone was kind of, sort of in character.

Then I got halfway through chapter 2, where Hermione walks in on Harry boning Narcissa, while giving the most over the top dirty talk I've evar seen in my life. And I've read cuckolding at shell cottage.

I shouldn't be too surprised, really. I mean, Harry was already calling Hermione "'Mione", and ending the occasional sentence with "luv". Also, Harry gained a lot of goofy grins in this fic, so I can only assume it was actually Ron in Harry's body. I get that impression a lot when reading Harmony fics.

Anyway, do you have any fics that started off serious and good, then quickly turned crap?


** I still cannot for the life of me remember the name of the fic, but there was this one gem that I started reading because it was a standard, run-of-the-mill evil!Dumbles bashing fic. Y'know, sometimes that's what I want, and for the first 40 chapters it was fine.

And then in chapter 41 or so, Dumbledore randomly went around and impregnated every female in the Order.

yeah, I have no idea what happened after that in the fic because I just noped out of there.

** I don't want to sound bitter (because I'm not), but I'd found that in most cases when the author has to claim ‚Äúno bashing‚Äù it means ‚ÄúI will bash a character by making them completely silly and out of place and claiming that it's how they are but no sir no bashing here‚Äù.

The author's (of the story you mentioned) incapability to get that ‚ÄúMione‚Äù is basically Hagrid-speak of Ron's that happened because he was speaking with his mouth full and it's easy to make ‚Äúher‚Äù silent, is also something. But then again, many authors make that mistake for whatever reason.

As for stories, yeah, were a few. The last one I remember trying to read was a story where Harry got turned into a girl as a result of someone messing with Voldemort's ritual at the end of the fourth year, and it seemed to have promise but from there it devolved into gratuitous angst and it was clear that the author has neither the foggiest of ideas how to write women nor the foggiest how to write trans people (and Harry had to be either of the two), thus resulting in frequent ‚Äúfor fuck's sake‚Äù exclamations and subsequent abandonment of any attempt to read it.

** For a person who doesn't like Harry/Hermione, you sure do seem to read the pairing a lot. Is it some sort of test of fortitude? To see how much you can withstand?

Anyways.

Wow, that fic sounds terrible. Mione is always a bit annoying, and I can only assume Harry says 'luv' constantly because he was spontaneously possessed by the ghost of Freddie Mercury. And where, how, and why does Narcissa come in?

Either way, good ideas turning into bad fics is an exceedingly common issue: a lot of fics have great first chapters because the author has this awesome idea, but they don't flesh it out at all, choosing instead to write a great first chapter in a fit of inspiration. Then, when they post it, they realise they've no idea where to go from there, and the fic devolves into shit.

Maybe it's cos I'm eager to see if a writer can make me enjoy something I wouldn't normally enjoy. Besides, I don't hate Harry/Hermione quite as much as I imply, but dumb fans have made me somewhat bitter.

Near the end of chapter 2, because Ginny thinks it'll make her sex sessions with Harry better. I don't get it either. Why Narcissa? Who knows, but literally anyone would have been a more logical choice.

That's why I always have an insanely long list of notes when I plan out fics, because I have to know every detail of every chapter. The problem with that is I spend so much time planning them, that I never actually get to write them.

The problem is that some elements of the H/Hr fandom think that they're "meant to be" and there's a lot of subtextual evidence of their attraction to each other (which, frankly, there isn't), and don't put in the work to make them compatible that you might see in other fics with less common pairings, because those authors know they have to develop the characters to make them compatible.

I wouldn't advise obsessively detailing the plot from start to finish, but it's probably a good idea to at least have a skeleton of the plot before getting to work on it, so you at least know where you're going.

I don't think that they're "meant to be", but I think that H/Hr makes /more sense/ than R/Hr. R/Hr has /nothing/ in common, except their friendship with Harry. Without Harry gluing them together, they would never even have become friends. Hell, Hermione/Colin Creevey makes more sense than R/Hr, though she could have been perfectly believably paired with just about any male Ravenclaw.

The problem is that JKR threw Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny together. How do you pair off these four without freaking out your readers? H/R and G/Hr? H/Hr and /R/G?/ I think JKR wrote herself into a corner.

JKR should have involved Neville and Luna sooner. In the story, they come across as afterthoughts. The "Golden Trio" was focused on too much to the exclusion of other characters.

I don't really care about specific ships, except I just can't suspend my disbelief when it comes to R/Hr, not to mention Draco or Snape with Harry or Hermione. And don't let me get started on MPREG. Sure, it's fan/fiction/, but /suspension of disbelief/, people.

** I had a similar-ish experience with "Backwards with Purpose". The first chapter was great, gripping, well-written, everything you would want. Also, it's the first time I've seen Harry, Ron and Ginny all travel back in time, where usually it's just Harry or Harry and Hermione. These are all good things.

Then it turns into a "oh we have to wait for Sirius to break free, we can't do anything with Peter right now", and Ron starts grooming Hermione to be his wife, even though she doesn't know about their time-travelling, and Harry and Ginny are kissing and acting like a couple even though they're both in pre-teen bodies.

**** I don't think any trope is shit, I just think the story handled them really poorly. What actual reason do the main characters have to go to Hogwarts with all the knowledge they have? They should just get to work on Voldemort right from the start, and also get the Ministry on their side.

That's not really the part I take issue with, though; sticking close to canon is understandable for an author to want to do, even if it's maybe not the most logical thing. What does bother me, and what made me quit out of the story, is the approach to relationships.

Not once is it suggested that it might be a bit odd. Not once does a character say, "hey, this is a bit weird isn't it, being back in a kid's body..."

Not once does any character question the morality in Ron's manipulations and his efforts to groom Hermione into his future wife. Not once does any character find a single problem with these things.

It's not even about Harry and Ginny being in love and their attraction continuing despite the fact they de-aged about twenty years, because Ron is equally attracted to Hermione, who has no idea of their time traveling, and is nothing more than an eleven year old bookworm. That just tells me that the main characters of Backwards with Purpose are pedophiles, or that the author has thoroughly failed to think the psychological effects of such a situation through.

***** Actually, it is mentioned- repeatedly- that they are very young. Hell, one of the first dialogues after coming back are jokes that they've become very "perverted" and there are multiple scenes- hell, it's an entire /plot point/ that obviously Harry and Ginny can't become physical, and(SPOILERS) very awful things happen when they eventually do way too early.

In any case, I don't really see this as that pedophilic, honestly if only because lolTrueLove. I also don't think that Ron grooms Hermione to be his wife in any way, it's not like he brainwashes her or any bullshit like that, he simply pays a little more attention to her.

You've got to remember, at its heart this is a very idealistic story, and love will beat everything. If it helps you to know, then (spoilers) nothing happens between Ron and Hermione until she knows very well what's going on.

Also, the main characters need to go to Hogwarts because...what excuse do they have for not doing so? Are they doing to announce to the entire world that hey, we've time-travelled, Voldemort is coming back, yada yada? They'd either be locked up in the Department of Mysteries or they'd be utterly ridiculed like after GOF by the Ministry, on top of losing all advantage with Voldemort.

Again, I honestly don't find the approach to relationships too horrible. Especially because obviously Harry and Ginny are both adults mentally, and I didn't find Ron to be in any way overly creepy with Hermione, and even if he was, she is his "previous" wife.

  Raditz finds himself outmatched when he comes to earth, due to a change in Goku's final battle against Piccolo five years earlier.
