Fics where Harry has a high powerlevel that rivals Merlin or Dumbledore and Voldemort. Sometimes it's a number called "Hammerstein Index". Just looking for really op Harry rn.


** Well. there is something similar in The Pureblood Pretense, but it was introduced in later books.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** I can think of two fics that have a Harry with a very high magic stat, but neither might be exactly what you're looking for. (They're both Hinny if you don't like that ship.)

The first is the fic I recommend quite literally every chance I get, [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]] Meaning Of One by Sovran, which I love to death. However the reason he's at least eight times more powerful than Dumbledore is because of a Soul-Bond with Ginny, and you specified just Harry so I'm not sure. There's whole scenes about analysing their magical power, and they both have to be careful to not accidentally burn things to Ash with Bluebell Flames, which don't burn things, or blow people's noses clean off with the Bat-Bogey Hex with the giant mucus bats that appear.

Second is this goddamn cryfest by The Seeker, Saving Harry. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] The problem you may have with this is that the magical power does not have much of a focus. The premise is Harry going through and mentally healing from the abuse he received in Canon, and it's as sad as you think. Harry in this is able to cast wandless and non-verbal spells just as easily as he could wander and verbally. So he's summoning levitating and banishing things like a goddamn Jedi. We never get any scenes quantifying his power though.

** The Refiner's Fire by Abraxan has this- the whole premise is that Harry is going through one of those amazing magical maturity periods which only happens to wizards like Albus. linkffn(2163835)
