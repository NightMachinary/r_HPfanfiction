I don't know if it is cannon or not but in fanfiction it is usally the case that fiendfyre, the killing curse, basilisk venom, and goblin silver weapons impregnated with basilisk venom can destroy horcruxes. I know that some fanfictions describe fiendfyre as a cursed flame that consumes magic and or destroys it. What is your opinion? Is it the heat or the nature of the flames themselves that destroy horcruxes?


** Fiendfyre is cursed fire. The dark magic in the flames is what makes the spell so volatile because it adds on the sentience and nastiness of normal fire, which is why it is so complicated to control it. It is not the heat per se of the flames that destroy Horcruxes.

** Probably cursed fire. The diadem was completely incinerated in the ROR. A flame capable of completely vaporizing metal and gemstones would probably be hotter than the surface of the sun. Just standing within a few meters of it would be enough to kill you out right and they escaped with minimal injuries.

If you went the none cursed route it would make the spell infinity more deadly than just some pissed off fire.

*** Hotter than the surface of the sun. Really. If it was hotter than the surface of the sun than a few square miles from where it was conjured would become a wastland

**** A flame that hot would only be about 5800K (or about 5500°C or 9950°F). An arc welder can reach that temperature. Normal fire itself peaks at around 1400°C. Something that is only about four times hotter than that wouldn't have that effect.

** I agree. Cursed flames that are incredibly hot with contact but dont radiate heat so you can control it safely without bursting into flames

** It's cursed, that's what matters, much like how no healer can fix a cursed wound (such as an ear lost to sectumsempra) there's no undoing the harm it deals, and naturally you need a specific (and apparently not taught in 6th year or under DADA judging by how noone knew it DH) counter curse to end it, you can't just put it out like mundane fire.
