"Before Rome was a twinkle in the eyes of the ancients" I should have said.


** It is, at least canon that Wizards were flying as early as 962, when the first records of broomsticks were there. Not quite as far back as you might want, but we did go from controlled flight to the moon in less than a century, so it wouldn't be inconceivable for wizards to do so.

** Definitely has to be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). A world where wizards after separation, continued to grow, and number in the millions in Britain alone. Wizards have their own answer to technology, and Hogwarts is for children of the elite.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

**** Now there's an interesting idea for a fic. What if the roles were reversed? The sprawling Wizarding society would consist of several billion people, while there is only a small community of people born without magic. This community bands together to protect themselves from the wizards who are dismissive towards them. Maybe they've managed to build advanced technology or something in secret?

***** Going through the top of the month posts and I just stumbled across this - you should check out the plot of Final Fantasy 14. A race without magic in the magical world of Hydaelyn developed insane magitech gear in revenge for what the mages were doing and spawned an empire that function as the primary antagonists.

*** off the top of my head:

Earth was/is a colony for an star spanning empire very much like the Federation but based on Magic. An anti-magic weapon was activated by an enemy race at some point. It simultaneously wiped all permanent enchantments in the galaxy and the long term memories of everyone belonging to that race.

Very few escaped the memory wipe but it was enough for their species to endure on the planet and to propagate their culture which included hiding from natives. The result is the modern wizarding world ignorant of their origins.

I figure if I can whip that up spontaneously there has to be a number of ways to explain it.

**** So kind of like Gurren Lagann where humans are forced to live underground and the Spiral Race got wiped out, the wizards are living in secret and the Magic Empire got wiped out.

Harry & Co. could be like Simon and the rest and conquer Earth and then discover the ruins of the Magic Empire after travelling to the moon.

Story ends with them recreating Magic Empire and traveling world to world eventually creating something like the Gurren Lagann, Star Wars, Stargate, Mass Effect, or Star Trek universes.

***** If you /can/ teleport. Not all wizards can, and of those who can not all are comfortable with doing it even when not in a stressful situation where the probability of splinching goes up. Other spells appear in canon to have limited range and repeat rate, so slingshots, thrown spears and knives, and bows and arrows are a serious risk.

In real-world history mere technological advantage has a nasty habit of losing to well-motivated numbers.

** Well, since there are pegasi and other flying creatures in canon that can be ridden (or pull chariots), I am pretty much certain that wizards flew before Rome was founded.

With regards to a magical world more advanced than the muggles, I've written "Patron", where the wizards developed independently since the SoS, and created a far more magical society. Magic is used much, much more in everyday life than in canon. People summon stuff all the time, everything is enchanted for greater convenience, "robes" means clothes, which can range from traditional school robes (but enchanted with various spells for greater comfort and safety; the more spells the higher your prestige) to fantastic things like clothes made of magical smoke or illusionary fire. The society is far more progressive than British muggle society in some aspects (they consider muggles prudes), but more archaic in others, but there are few areas where the muggles have something that the wizards don't have. Magical concerts are vastly more impressive, for example.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
