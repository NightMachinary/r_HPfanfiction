I was wondering if there were any fics out there that were OC-centric and set in a time period not covered by canon. I'd love a story set at Hogwarts during in the 80s or 00s!!


** linkffn(3964606) barely mention anything about Wizarding Britain, set in the 00s Wizarding America. It's really dark by the way, and while they use some spells in canon, ultimately the way magic works differ from canon.

linkffn(8596476) set in 1590 Britain, some name dropping of Muggle historical figure and Wizarding Britain prominent family. Too flowery dialogue for my taste.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** Highly recommend Inverarity. Alexandra Quick, which someone else has linked here, and *Hogwarts Houses Divided* are both extremely high quality and enjoyable.

Slide is another of my favorite fanfic authors, her canon-compliant *Anguis series* (a prologue +trilogy) starts at Hogwarts during the war, but follows four OC Slytherin characters. Her canon-compliant, next-gen *Stygian Trilogy* features Albus, Rose, and Scorpius as three of the main characters, but also a lot of well-developed OCs.

These are long series - AQ is currently sitting at around 1,300,000 words with books 6 and 7 still to come, and Anguis and Stygian are both around 800,000 words each. The writing is efficient, though - these are really stellar fanfics. There are definitely more stories that I thought of for this, but these two authors are really the best I've been able to find.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower is OC heavy. Particularly the books set in history like during the Founders era or Grindelwald's war...

Very very high reccommend. Just incredible writing. But it is like 11 books long 😂
