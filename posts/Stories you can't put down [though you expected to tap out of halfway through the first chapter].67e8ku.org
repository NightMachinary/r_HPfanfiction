  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus). I don't know if it is because I enjoy everything by Carnivorous Muffin regarding writing style and philosophy, but I maintain to this day, that it is one of the only Fem!Harry story's which I actually count as good and enjoyable.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** To my eternal surprise, I was initially fascinated by *Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens*.

I went into it expecting a fic that was poorly written and infantile. I was pleasantly surprised when it surpassed my expectations (although it's still a crack fic) by making me laugh more than any fic I can remember. The later sequels aren't as good (deviation from the idea of a crackfic), but I think that the first two are comedic gold, if only for the absurdity of the story.

** for me, linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) was that fic. I got really weird vibes off of the description, but at the time I was reading through every single fic in the Slytherin!Hermione tag, so I figured I'd give it a shot. It's one of the best fics I've read. The plot is good, and the writing style is unique and fabulously executed.
