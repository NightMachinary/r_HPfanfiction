Having never taught Defence against the Dark Arts in Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort's magic does not recognize him as a DADA professor and he stays on next year much to the chagrin of the staff and the male students, while Hermione is proud of the fact that her role model has defied the curse. Ginny Weasley, on the other hand is disillusioned for she actually learnt Defence from Tom and she was saved from certain death by a 12 year old.

*** Yeah, if he somehow merged with Ginny Weasley, it would be quite awkward for Death Eaters ( assuming he overpowers his elder self and takes his memories) to take orders from an eleven year old girl who is also at the same time the high and mighty, the Dark Lord Voldemort.

** Huh? Why would him not having taught there before matter?
