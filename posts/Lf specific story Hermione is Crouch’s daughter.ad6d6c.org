After the war it's discovered that a ton of pure bloods had illegitimate children - Hermione and Harry start a new school at the crouch mansion, Harry stupidly allows Malfoy to become his mentor and Snape eventually comes back to life with the help of an OC teacher (who went to school with and disliked the mauraders)

I'm 99% sure it was recommended on here previously but none of my searches came up with anything - thanks!


** It's called The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville.
