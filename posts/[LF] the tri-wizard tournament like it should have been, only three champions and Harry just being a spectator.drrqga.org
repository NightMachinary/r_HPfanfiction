Title says the main point and I really only care that it isn't slash and is over 70k words

Thank you to those that answer in a civil manner


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097): Voldemort has other plans and doesn't need to get Harry involved.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Three champions, but 'Harry' wanted in and organized House-Elves to make paper airplanes with his name on them. He launched several hundreds at the Goblet and thus got in as the only Hogwarts champion. He went on to thoroughly wreck the event.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** linkffn(Magical Relations) It starts at book one. Alternate take of the series where Dudley was also a wizard. The author wrote all the way up to the summer before 6th year so all the Triwizard stuff is complete.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
