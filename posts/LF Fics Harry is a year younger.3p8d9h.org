So his classmates are ginny, luna, Colin etc. Has this ever been done well? I feel like there could be some mileage in it, especially if dumbledore delays his philosophers stone trap a year as well, which in conjunction with the diary could potentially mean two riddles running around hogwarts at the same time!


** Can't think of any but in linkffn(Luna's Hubby by Meteoricshipyards), he's held back a year as part of the Lovegood subterfuge in hiding Harry.

******** May be, this one: "Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon"

Fanfic starts in third year, so Harry assumed not different from canon up to third year, but after that Harry become (under Hermione influence) much more "scholarly". Takes all OWL's early and design his own broomstick, and attempted to make 'power buster' to wands, AKA Death Stick. At the same time, he never outclass Hermione in theory and ideas.

Very good one: "An Unfound Door". Harry outclass Hermione, but do not act like this.

Good: "Unsung Hero" by MeghanReviews is good, Harry is number one student (but nobody see it), Hermione is number two.

You can also consider "One Wizard Too Many", "With Strength of Steel Wings", "Hogwarts Battle School", "My Friend Tom", "Harry Potter and the Witch Queen", "Faery Heroes". All of them with not-lazy not-rejecting-education Harry.

This one might work, though academics are pretty incidental in that fic, since the protagonists are cheating.

I haven't read it, but I don't think it counts if Harry was jobbing. :-)

Yes, that's one of the ones that fits the pattern of Harry being more scholarly and therefore easily surpassing Hermione academically.

HBS fits, though Harry isn't that scholarly: he doesn't seek knowledge for its own sake, read for fun, etc., and in HP:WQ he's a 25-year-old time-traveler. The rest, I don't know, but how many of them /do/ have the newly scholarly Harry surpassing Hermione academically?

I guess there's linkffn(Rule of Two: Dreams Come True by Darklooshkin), but they hadn't even gotten to Hogwarts yet, and similarly with linkffn(Perils of Innocence by avidbear).

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  Here's an interesting fact that I just made up. In a strange universe slightly disconnected from this one, Harry Potter was born premature on the 31st of July 1980. In this story, he wasn't. Born 27th of September 1980 this is a Harry Potter with no scar, new classmates, a sinister looking wand, and somehow he's got a strange diary belonging to T. M. Riddle.
