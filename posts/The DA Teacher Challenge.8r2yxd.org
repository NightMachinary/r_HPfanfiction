Alright people. I've seen a lot of fics/redditors/authors rag on about some character using this spell and not that spell in both the books and in fics (which is somewhat merited depending on the situation). And some have suggested Harry did not teach enough during the DA or better spells.

So I have an idea for a challenge: you are the head of the DA now (whether you're Harry or not doesn't matter here). And now you are given the opportunity to decide what spells to teach the "rebels."

Here are the rules:

1. You only get five spells here to teach the students.
2. You are only allowed/able to teach spells that are either mentioned in canon or fit with the style of canon spells (stunning spell, summoning charm, etc.) used for defense/dueling/fighting/etc.
3. No teaching overpowering spells that would never fly in the DA (that means no throwing around Fiendfyre or teaching the Imperius Curse), including major Dark Arts spells (no casting cannibalism curses or the like).
4. A small justification at the end of the list for why you chose/invented these five spells/charms/jinxes/hexes/curses.

Okay, I'll start us off then:

- Blasting Curse (Confringo)
- Vanishing Spell (Evanesco)
- Summoning or Banishing Charms (Accio and possibly Depulso)
- Disillusionment Charm (Unknown, lets say Absconitus Occulo or something)
- Shield Charm (Protego)

Reasoning:

The blasting curse has a lot of potential for direct attack and indirect attack. It gives casters several options without learning a new spell. The vanishing spell is possibly the most versatile single spell in transfiguration, and is useful for removing obstacles or quickly dealing with indirect attacks from your opponent. Summoning or Banishing charms are possibly the most useful charms in the whole series, depending on how you think they work. The disillusionment charm can give someone an advantage both in fight or flight, especially if your opponent is better in some manner than you are. And the shield charm is pretty obvious, as its fairly adaptable in its use.

What are your choices?


** Protego - because the first imperative when in a fight is to survive it

Confundus - fast, quiet, can affect even very experienced wizards and has a multitude of uses

Animatus - independently-driven allies without limit

Apparation - Mobility is essential

Sectumsempra (or Diffindo if not allowed) - because slicing things apart has served mankind well since the discovery of sharp edges; even better if you can do it from far away

** Expeliarmus\\
Protego\\
Accio wandlessly (because being disarmed is a huge weakness)\\
A very strong stunning spell\\
Silencing spell (will render many opponents virtually wandless and can be used to sneak away)

And also lots and lots of dodging practice. If I got two more spells I'd teach them a disillusion spell and Humano revelio so they could tell if someone was sneaking up on them and hide better. Basic knowledge on how to leave the country too although the idea they would have to would be unpopular.

** Confringo - damage spell, also creates distractions and can manipulate environment

Expelliarmus - easy to cast, excitement useful if it lands, most importantly it forces the opponent to block or dodge

Finite Incantatum - usage is obvious. Included because being hindered during a fight is more dangerous than having a bad arsenal

Disillusionment- obvious reasons

Protego - obvious reasons

At the end of the day, with a five spell arsenal your tactic should be evade, avoid and escape, which is what these spells do

** 1. Protego
2. Stupefy
3. Expecto Patronum
4. Wingardium Leviosa
5. Reducto

Protego and Stupefy are kind of obvious -- everybody needs a shield and a sword when fighting, and Stupefy is basically a sword that doesn't injure you. Expecto Patronum would be very helpful against Dementors, but it's also very helpful at sending messages or a call for help.

I know Wingardium Leviosa was taught first year in Charms, but here's my reasoning on reteaching it: you levitate something towards your enemy and blast it with a Reducto, then your enemy is going to be more concerned about shrapnel hitting and possibly killing them, giving you time to escape or Stupefy them.

** Something that is lethal. Canon clings to the misguided notion that you can win a war without killing your enemy.

If you want to have a successful Defense Association you cannot follow the rules you gave.

#+end_quote

never does canon imply let alone say that, Mcgonagal explicitly says at the battle of Hogwarts that they fight to kill, and many are implied to have done so. The order of phoenix also calls Harry out for using expeliarmus on a civillan under the imperius instead of killing him, even though both Harry and Ron didn't hesitate to kill death eaters during the battle of the seven Potters(Harry and Ron both shot death eaters off their brooms knowing it would kill them).

**** I would disagree. Against his most formidable enemy Harry using a disarming spell rather than a lethal one. Throughout the books never once is their the /intent to kill your enemy./ Every death that occurs is a result of necessity. You cannot win a war that way.

To rebut your point on the broomsticks: Yet again non lethal spells were used. If I levitate someone off a cliff did the fall kill them or the spell? The spell only hoists them in the air, it's the fall that kills them. Harry did not /intend to kill them./

*** To be fair, it's possible at least three of the spells can kill (depending on whether you can vanish a person)

**** But they aren't /good at it/. When I think of killing my enemy I won't throw a vanishing spell at them. The only spell you list that has any real merit to a combat situation is disillusionment.

The shield charm is far from useful against enemies that throw spells that ignore shields. Protego is fine against stunners but won't do anything against the killing curse and its ilk. Those sorts of things are what you will see thrown at you.

The summoning charm has some use, mainly summoning an item to block a killing curse but is better served by conjuring something like a rock in the way of the spell.

A blasting curse isn't bad per se, it's just that if you are able to land a spell you don't want it to throw them off their feet but take off their head.

They are not fighting duels they are fighting a war. You don't give soldiers a water gun and send them out of the trench.

My five spells would be:

Disillusionment: Escape and live to fight another day. Flank the enemy.

Killing Curse: Ignores shields, and a dead enemy can't fight back.

Fiendfyre: A tool to use against insurmountable odds, more of a desperation tactic. POS describes it very well. /A spell to be used when you want to destroy your enemy no matter the cost./

Apparition: Escape to live and fight another day.

Legilimency: If you are in their mind you know what spell they are going to cast. Very easy to defend against.

Are these in the tone of canon? No. Because you can't fight that way and expect not to get slaughtered. Are these illegal? Yes. When your life is being threatened no one gives a damn whether it is legal or not you just need to survive.

***** Ok but I'd argue the spells you gave specifically go against the idea of a defence association, I mean the DA was basically originally formed because Umbridge was a shit teacher, half the students who originally joined were basically interested in an applied study group which could double as a self-defence class, pulling out the fucking killing curse would likely be rather too far a step for them. It's intended to be a class which will help them stay alive until the relevant authorities can come to their aid, not a child militant group. If this was something taught to Hogwarts graduates perhaps it could make sense, but teaching children the Dark Arts, be it for their defence or not, is in the immediate scenario, completely illegal.

Also just a side note on two of the spells you'd teach, legilimency and fiedfyre. I'm interested in how effective they could actually be in a combat scenario. Fiendfyre as you said would be more of a desperation tactic, but how would you propose teaching it, it's basically uncontrollable when someone first casts it, so you can't just have a bunch of teenagers say the incantation. As for legilimency, it's pretty cannon that it's way easier to do while maintaining eye contact and while using a wand, meaning in a battle with more than one opponent you'd leave yourself completely vulnerable unless you become a mater of the art, which again seems unlikely for the age group learning the spell

****** The relevant authorities, the same ones that hired a teacher that tortured students. If there was any reason to have faith in the reason the DA and subsequently the war against Voldemort would never have occured.

I would argue that the DA is not a group meant to supplement instruction for their owls, *but rather to survive* in the war against Lord Voldemort. That being the case anything goes.
