I've been searching for well over a week and can't seem to find it. The premise of the fic was that Voldemort won the first war and I think he was headmaster. Harry and his mom are alive but they live under alias's. I know that his mom worked at Madam Malkin's and that Harry created a spell that could I guess hold another spell that was incoming (It was able to hold the cruciatus fired from Voldemort). I also remember Harry starting as a first year.


** I think its called hidden in plain sight. Don't know how to link tho, sorry.

#+begin_quote
  Lily Potter receives a warning not to let Voldemort find out about her child; Voldemort goes to kill Neville Longbottom on Halloween, but he did not realise how unstable his soul was, which lead to a complication that weighs on his mind even as he succeeds in taking over Wizarding Britain. Follow the highly intelligent Harry as he makes his way through a Voldemort-ruled Hogwarts.
