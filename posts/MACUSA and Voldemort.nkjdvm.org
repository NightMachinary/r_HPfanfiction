No offense to Americans here, it's just an idea.

The United States of America has a long history of interfering in other countries, for good or ill. So, what if the magical side of the country were the same?

A few years after the second war, the British ministry of magic finds evidence that MACUSA had been covertly supporting Voldemort since the beginning of his rise to power.

MACUSA's fear of muggles isn't limited to their own country, and they resent countries that have a somewhat relaxed attitude toward muggles and try to sabotage them. When they saw that Britain is starting to become more accepting of muggles and muggleborns, MACUSA felt threatened by it, and when Tom Riddle, a young, powerful and intelligent wizard with a strong dislike of muggles found his way to MACUSA in his travels, the secret services established contact and trained him to help him succeed in his dream of purging muggleborns from the British wizarding world and separating it completely from the muggle one.

This realization could cause only some international drama, or maybe war between Magical Britain and MACUSA.


** I don't see magical USA being strong enough to influence magical UK.

As much as some american fanfiction writers love to shit on UK (you know, it's "cool" in USA to hate on brits), at least in Rowling's universe, UK is above most. Merlin, Morgana, Slytherin, Dumbeldore, Voldemort are wizards/witches without equal - and they are all from England.

It's not just UK. Generally, Europe itself is seen as the centre of magic. The immortal Flamels, Gregorovich (the best wand maker alongside Ollivander), Grindelwald, the Peverells, the deathly hallows, the first wand, the first quidditch world cup - everything revolves around Europe. Northern Africa is traditionally included too when people talk about Europe.

With that said, it's fanfiction so I guess people could be tryhard patriots for their countries but, as a new land, America doesn't have enough history and foundation to contest with the old world. We're talking in the context of a wizarding world where people still live like a century or two ago and where living to be 150 y old is nothing out of common for people.

** I'm American and I love this idea. Totally sounds like the f'ed up stuff our CIA used to do back in the 60s or so, I could absolutely see that being a thing for the magical government to do, off the books of course. Especially as they'd feel threatened by British wizarding superiority in general it would kill two birds with one stone. Tearing down the muggles and destabilizing magical Britain to give America time to catch up. I'd read the hell out of that

*** Ditto on my nation's f-ed up history of f-ing over others to hinder progress and boost our own national image. I can easily see 60-70s magical CIA funneling money and training to Voldemort and using him do destabilize European magical society and even promicing him recognition if he can take over or force a split in the nation. Hell i bet they are terrified of muggles at that point and see the cold war and space race as insane and deeply threatening to them and the world.

** The muggle USA finds out about this, and decides they would fund the other side and aid their NATO ally Britain. So, it's now the Order and some American muggles verses Voldemort's Army and some American wizards. Is dark magic enough to stand up to the power of the M1A1 Abrams tank, the M4 rifle, and air support? Or will Voldemort see death in the shape of a Panzer Battalion?

*** Maybe your average wizard would be pulverised, but skilled aurors and hit wizards, they will stomp any muggle army, transfiguration , dark magic like fiendfire, hell impero the shit out of army commanders , muggles won't be able to stop that. Now add to it powerhouses like Dumbledore and Voldemort.......

** Yes, America has a story of interference... since the end of the 19th century. Even then, it was only within its perceived sphere of influence until 1900 came along. Just a reminder that MACUSA was formed in the 1660s. With almost no connection to Muggles. So /why/ would magical America be an interventionist state? They know that purging the wizarding world from Muggle-borns is useless since there'll just be more that'll come.

*** Agree and considering the wizarding world is practically behind by a century in social and technological advancements it would make far more sense for the MACUSA to be isolationists.
