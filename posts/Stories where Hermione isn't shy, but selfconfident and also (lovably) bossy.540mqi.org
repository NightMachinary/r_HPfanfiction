I like stories where Hermione almost reads like a domina (not necessarily in the sexual sense) and simply takes whatever she wants.

She doesn't have a partner for the yule ball? Instead of waiting to be asked she instead takes the initiative. Draco calls her a mudblood? An amused snort as answer, instead of becomming a sobbing mess. She wants a boyfriend (or girlfriend)? She simply asks. Dumbledore forbids her to send mail to Harry over the holiday? She does it anyway, or maybe simply kidnaps Harry.

Suggestions?


** Hi! This may not be what you had in mind, because it's an all muggle AU--but instead of going to wizarding school everyone's at school to become super spies. It's incredibly detailed, exciting, and well-planned from chapter one and shows just how clever and wonderful Hermione is. It starts a little slow, but picks up midway through first year.

It's technically a part of a massive crossover series, but I read and enjoyed this story without any knowledge of that since it's rather stand alone.

** linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk): Getting sorted into Slytherin forces Hermione to develop her domineering and vicious side, rather than curb it.

linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) and its sequel have Hermione evolve in that direction.

linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) has Hermione leading the other "mudbloods" at Hogwarts, in an AU where Salazar Slytherin won.

linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa): A slightly OOC Hermione sends herself a care package back in time.

linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen): A Riddle-like Hermione arrives at Hogwarts with Harry in tow.

Generally, stuff by [[/u/Starfox5]] ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][FF.net]]) is pretty good in that respect.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Two other things:

#+begin_quote
  (lovably) bossy
#+end_quote

Hermione's bossiness (whatever that means --- since it's a bit of a sexist slur at this point) isn't and doesn't have to be lovable. A trait doesn't have to be sympathetic or pleasant to make a character interesting; in fact, flaws and rough edges even of sympathetic characters are arguably more important than those of the unsympathetic ones. And, for all, that I disagree with [[/u/Archeleone]], he (I think it's a "he".) has a point: when you take away the negative social and other consequences of an uncompromising, domineering attitude (by either gender) by declaring them "lovable", you do actually end up with a Mary Sue / Gary Stu.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore forbids her to send mail to Harry over the holiday?
#+end_quote

I know that you were only referring to a hypothetical scenario in a fic that arises all too often, but can we /please/ not perpetuate this fanon? Dumbledore did no such thing. Rather, he asked her and Ron and Sirius and others to not send sensitive information (like anything about the Order) via an easily-intercepted medium, to someone with a mental link of unknown nature with the greatest Legilimens alive. Naturally, this frustrated Harry to no end. One can debate the merits of Dumbledore's decision, but can we please at least get his decision right?

** Sounds like every boring story written by someone like Robst.

Basically, Hermione is a perfect little goddess who is always right and Harry follows her every command like a lost puppy.

It's extremely unrealistic and boring. Hermione basically becomes a Mary Sue. Harry is only the protagonist because of the prophecy, but he'd /totally/ completely fail if Hermione didn't hold his hand every second of the way.

Honestly, I feel a majority of Harry/Hermione stories are like this. She's either this broken little darling that Harry needs to mother, or she's his handler and directs most of his life because she's "the smartest witch of her age and is never wrong". You'll find a lot of what you're looking for.

I've even come across an edgy story where Hermione pseudo-kidnaps Harry, flushes his body of love potion, and they run off together because of the typical "Dumbledore is a manipulative asshole and Molly/Ginny/Ron/all of the above are terrible people more or less getting Hermione love-potion-raped by Ron and are looking to take Harry's money through marriage" plot line.

The whole "lovably" bossy thing just isn't lovable at all in my eyes, so I can't really find the patience for these stories anymore, as I've long since outgrown my crush on Emma Watson/Hermione. It's just rude and domineering. It's not a sign of a well-adjusted person or a healthy relationship.

Still though, good luck finding what you're looking for. Give Robst a look and if he isn't to your preference, check his favorites. He has the biggest crush on her I've ever seen, so there's a lot of that sort of thing to find on his account.

******* Your first post insulted the OP. You took what the OP requested, tore it apart, criticised every aspect of it, and implied that the only reason Hermione/Emma Watson has fans is because these fans have a crush on her. That's just disrespectful to the character and the fans. I love Hermione. Not because I have, as you would probably say, 'the biggest hard-on' for her, but because she's strong and intelligent and flawed.

You later go on to further insult Hermione fans as 'the most obnoxious people in the fandom'. I hate to break this to you, but right now, you're the most obnoxious person in this thread. Not to mention, you're on a subreddit with a bunch of fanfiction lovers and you 'don't care enough to try and justify a recommendation for a fan fiction of all things'.

This is a fanfiction subreddit. People discuss fanfiction here. People discuss everything and anything fanfiction here.

The point is, the way you go about expressing your opinion is the real issue here. You wouldn't get downvoted if you didn't insult the OP, insult Hermione as a character, insult her fans, insult fanfiction. Your comments are very abrasive, in general, and frankly, not necessary. If you wanted to rant about Hermione fans and Hermione in general, you would have been better off making a discussion post of your own.

Hermione is a terrible character. I love HP fan fiction, but even I can't defend her. I love strong female role models, because it was very inspiring when I was younger when I was going through some tough times, but she's just a bit too much on the side of controlling.

As you said, this is a fan fiction subreddit, but the three of you seem to be taking it way too seriously. It might be something we enjoy, but let's not pretend it's something sacred.

Maybe instead of jumping down each other's throats, maybe you should all agree to disagree, and find something to read.

********* I'll not say she's perfect, because she definitely isn't. I won't defend her controlling attitude in canon, because I dislike that as well. Hermione has a whole slew of flaws, just as she has a whole slew of good attributes. She makes for a controversial character, I guess, and that's part of what fascinates me about her. That being said, I do love a Hermione-bashing fic once in a while.

As for the argument, I'll admit I probably shouldn't have joined in. It just grated on me, and at the time, I went for it. After calming down, I realised I was kind of ganging up on Archeleone, and for that I am sorry. I do, however, still stand by what I said, and I don't believe I was taking it too seriously.

Either way, Archeleone has said he/she isn't interested in continuing the argument further, and I'll at least respect that.

I agree, actually, but I think that that's actually a good thing: if she didn't have her flaws and rough edges, she wouldn't be interesting to read about. That's why I question the "lovably" part before the "bossy". Let her mess up and antagonize people, suffer setbacks, and solve problems in not-very-nice ways, often creating bigger problems down the line. It makes for interesting stories about an interesting character --- far more so than those where she is an inoffensive helper and helpmeet.

Yes, that must be it. The Harmonian sheeple are oppressing you because they disagree with your highly original and well-thought-out opinions.

It can't possibly be because you'd posted an off-topic rant whose contents show that you weren't actually paying attention to what the OP was asking (which, by the way, only dealt with Harry as an example of Hermione being proactive, and not in a 'shipping context) and also that you weren't paying attention to Hermione's characterization in fic you were recommending. And it certainly can't be because your follow-up post confirmed that second impression, since it seems like you were defining Hermione's character by how Harry treats her, rather than by her actual character in that fic.

You poor martyr, you!

There are literally thousands of authors on FF.net who like Hermione. A small, but non-negligible, fraction of them write her as the OP asked, and their fics are recommended on this subreddit all the time. /You/ chose to bring up the one who is known to be mediocre at best, very unpopular on this subreddit, and whose "hard on" is for a characterization of Hermione that is nothing like what OP was asking.

Don't try to walk back your insulting OP's request by pretending that they were just an example.
