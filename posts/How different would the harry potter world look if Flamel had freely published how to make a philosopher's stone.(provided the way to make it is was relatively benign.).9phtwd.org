what do you think the harry potter world would look like?


** If it's early on than it's before the Ministry of Magic, or the Statute of Secrecy. We can pretty safely assume those things will come to be in any case. Gold will obviously no longer be currency, so something else will be instead. A few centuries of immortals means a higher population than canon, though probably not to a significant degree. We can assume there will have been some advancements in magic that didn't exist in canon. Basically we're just looking at the HP world except tack on the tropes for an immortal species except only given a few centuries to mature.

The whole story as we know it can't exist. Even in Tom Riddle existed his fear of death would never drive him the same way as canon. If he still tried to wage war for personal power he'd be stricken down by the gifted and experienced that came before.

I... think you're thinking of Fullmetal Alchemist?

In Harry Potter, the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's stone lets you turn base metals into gold, and lets you create the Elixir of Life.

Nothing to do with creation of human bodies.

******* Yeah, but that's my point- the Stone doesn't create "wholesale human bodies," it creates the Elixir of Life.

The safest assumption is that Voldemort is able to channel the energy of the Elixir towards his own purposes- drinking it wouldn't make Quirrel immortal, it would either let Voldemort completely take over and restore his body, or he'd be able to channel the energy into a new body, or some other thing.

** I always imagined that how to make a philosopher's stone is open knowledge. Take... Colonel Sanders' chicken with secret herbs and spices.

Anyone on the world can make fried chicken, it's up to you to find out exactly how to make the perfect KFC chicken.

Flamel was never dead in my mind, he could always make a new stone, his "death" and the destruction of the stone felt more like a "Hey Brian, go ahead and destroy the stone so he can't use it. Once he is dead I'll just make a new one, I have enough elixir of life in my fridge for a century or so. So just tell everyone I'm dead, I'll come back once he is gone."

Anyway back to my fried chicken metaphor, anyone could make chicken that could prevent death, perhaps even give them a few years, but the inferior chicken not being cooked correctly would eventually kill you itself with its imperfections.

Also, unlike friend chicken I also imagine the stone creation process being quite difficult. As well as volatile at many stages, people have been trying. They just make an inert stone at best, and blow up more likely than not.

Those who sort of succeed eventually turn into gold I imagine, as the stone's abilities are not distilled properly.

Perhaps this is where the Hand of Midas came from?

Essentially I think it would be the same, with perhaps a few Wizards pushing 500 but still looking around mid 50's perhaps with gold eyes from the gold in their bodies.

I figured Dumbledore made a fake after Hagrid gives the real one to him. Gives him time to make a convincing fake, since Dumbledore may not have ever seen the stone.

Just because Nick is immortal doesn't mean he is all powerful, just perhaps all knowledgeable. Better to keep the stone out of Tom's hands and just keep spare elixir for himself than risk the stone falling into his hands and become a horcrux.

***** Yes.

But no, I wouldn't do it because I don't really have a need for Aspirin, I haven't ever used it. But if I was dying (which we all are) and there was a medicine for my condition (the Elixir of Life) and I was at least somewhat above averagely talented in the disciplines required to make it, then yes I would definitely try. And I am fairly certain that I wouldn't be the only one, and that I could work together with others to make success more likely. And maybe not all people who try will be successful, but possibly quite a few. Flamel was the only one who made a Philosophers Stone (that we know of, if I made one all on my own I wouldn't go around telling people about it...), but was he perhaps also the only one or one of only a few who even tried in the last millennium? Considering that the Trio didn't even know who Flamel was (how is that possible? I'm a muggle and I knew about him at that age), perhaps people in general just don't know or care much about the Stone and the Elixir and thus don't even consider finding out the "recipe".

** I did a bunch of research on alchemy (as in the actual field of alchemy that was practiced by actual people for hundreds of years before ‘Science' really became a thing), and discovered some fascinating things.

First and foremost, the directions for making a Philosopher's Stone were, in fact, detailed in several places. Step-by-step instructions existed for it, but the key part to this whole thing is in the name - /Philosopher./ Alchemy is way more ‘new-age, spiritual, greater-understanding-of-the-universe, mind-altering substances' than it was ‘lets mix potions and transfiguration together'.

The conclusion I came to with my research for how this could apply to the HPverse was that the instructions for the Philosopher's Stone are out there, but you basically have to attain a state of enlightenment to actually succeed in creating one.

The instructions are out there, but not everyone is in the right place, mentally and spiritually, to succeed at using them.

The higher purpose of alchemy was “to banish the darkness of ignorance and to attain enlightenment through knowledge.”

This is a quote from a book I found on it -

#+begin_quote
  “Alchemy was a sacred science, blending mystical religion and philosophy with medicine and chemistry. The alchemists believed in the alchemy of matter as well as the alchemy of spirit: If an alchemist was not spiritually pure, he would never achieve success in his experiments.”

  “To discover the Philosopher's Stone was therefore an outward sign of inner enlightenment, the two aspects were inextricable. The alchemists' aim was to attain personal harmony which mirrored the ultimate harmony of the universe. Moreover, they sought not only the transmutation of metals but the moral and spiritual transformation of humankind.”
#+end_quote

Excerpt From: Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, Dennis William Hauck & Christian Bernard. “Alchemy.”

I think its worth noting that there are a number of well renowned alchemists who claimed to have successfully created a philosopher's stone, and provided enough evidence that they got people to believe them.

Something I also found fascinating, though not necessarily relavent, is that Issac Newton (The apple-to-the-head gravity, father of natural sciences, and creator of Calculus guy) considered himself an Alchemist first and foremost. He dedicated years to his attempts to create a Philosopher's Stone.

** If this happened, I guess some sanctions would be put into place so that gold would not lose its value OR gold wouldn't be the world's standard of determining wealth anymore. But I'm not really interested in this aspect of the Philosopher's Stone.

Due to the near-immortality, I guess that at first, most, if not all, of the witches and wizards of the 1500s would brew the Elixir of Life for themselves and their families and enjoy the benefits of long life depending on what they're interested in (ex. researchers would continue to research, farmers continue to farm, politicians continue politicking etc.) But eventually there would be some that would get tired of living and choose to stop taking it.

I imagine that there would be a group of magicals who would take it into their heads to rule over the planet. This can be very bad if they were Hitler like and started experimenting on Muggles. A resistance would rise to fight them but the leaders of the Resistance wouldn't be able to agree if when they win, would all knowledge of the Philosopher's stone be erased from human history or not? And so we come to the current situation of the Harry Potter world. A centuries old war between the immortals who have been oppressing muggles and the pro-muggle immortals. Maybe Voldemort would belong to the faction that wants to topple the current rulers in order to replace them while Dumbledore would belong to the faction that wants to erase all knowledge about the Stone.

******** Well, we're talking of two different things here, totally different. Alcohol, you can make in abundance with regular general-purpose stuff you can buy dirty cheap - not to mention foraging for things. For example, I make wines and meads, using sugar and honey and yeast from a local supermarket, and picking fruit that grows in hedgerows. Fermentation is so simple it occurs in nature. For example, mead is just honey+water+yeast+time. Distilling hard liquor from anything you make is just a case of heating it up to the right temperature and catching the vapour in a flask. Not really that hard at all.

So even with prohibition, there's no way to stop people getting hold of or making alcohol.

Likewise, making explosives at home is very easy - and illegal. For example, I could make gunpowder at home and it would take me a matter of an hour or two. Buy saltpetre, sulphur flowers, and charcoal, mix them in a 75:10:15 ratio, /et voila/, scheißpulver. High explosives' ingredients aren't all that much more difficult to get hold of, though of course things like nitroglycerin are rather more dangerous to make.

Making Philosophers' Stone is vastly different, though. If it's anywhere near its real-world counterpart in complexity and how hard its ingredients are to find, all one would need would be to ban distribution or production of the rarer of those components: even if those bans can be circumvented, production of stuff of a high enough quality to use in making PS would likely be prohibitively expensive, and thus practically impossible.

Yes, international accord could be a problem. However, we're talking about something that's more dangerous than nuclear weapons, given the impact it could have on the world, /and/ the fact that it could be made by anyone who had access to the ingredients (unline nukes, which also need precision engineering and manufacturing processes). This means that there most likely /would/ be an international treaty banning its production, sale, and use. Something with that big an impact could even carry the death penalty for infractions.

We have to consider this, though: in PS, it's said that Flamel was the /only known maker/ of it. /Not that only he knows how to do it/. He may have published his translation of /The Book of Abraham the Jew/ - or a ready-to-work-from, fully-parsed recipe - for all we know. Canon doesn't say. Assuming for a moment that he did, and yet nobody else tried to make it - not even Voldemort, who counted potionmaking as one of his many talents - it follows that it's an /incredibly/ long and laborious process that can't be replicated very easily or reliably at all. Also, remember that at the end of PS, Flamel destroyed his stone to prevent Voldemort from getting at it... and he didn't make another, not even secretly. We know that he died some time before HBP. This means that, even to the one person who can make it, it's clearly an incredibly difficult or costly (or both) process to undertake.

Conversely, we /could/ take it as being comparable to the development of any technology or recipe. Usually, when something like this is developed or discovered, even clean-room reimplementations are available in a short enough time. Think about Coke, or CPU instruction sets, or a myriad other still-"secret" recipes and processes. Once it's been done, it /can be/ done, and people eventually start doing it themselves. This didn't happen with the Philosophers' Stone, even /centuries/ after Flamel went public with it but didn't share the recipe. This means even the knowledge of it isn't replicable by /anybody else/. Bear in mind that /The Book of Abraham the Jew/, which is a real-world work that can be found easily enough online, is probably similarly easy to find in the Wizarding World (for all we know, Hogwarts may have a copy in the restricted section of the library), because if /Magick Moste Evile/ and /Secrets of the Darkest Art/ are something that is (or has historically been) in a school library, why woudn't that?

Now, on top of all that, you're proposing additions to the process/recipe (or to that of the Elixir of Life) which make it into this perfect silver bullet, which will grant permanent immortality. This is many orders of magnitude above "mere" Philosophers' Stone - along the lines of a meal that will permanently remove your need to eat. Practically, this means that the process is likely to be comparably more complex, and thus would be /even more/ unlikely to be replicable in a home lab using homemade ingredients (should key ingredients be outlawed).

So it just wouldn't happen.

** Muggleborn and Halfbloods would be banned from using the method as it is exclusive to Purebloods of a "proper pedigree". Anyone found using unregistered PS to enhance their lifespan will be prosecuted. The usage of PS to create gold from lead will either be banned or lead to another war with the Goblins.

Please downvote me if my opinion does not fit your fanfiction-induced trauma.It is proof that this subreddit is flooded with people who circle-jerk to romance fics but are not open to anything that does not fit their "head-canon".

*** Honestly I just downvoted you because not only are you not backing up your stuff with facts, you're kind of an ass about it.

And again, your position isn't well-supported. Pureblood supremacism is MUCH less of a thing in canon, much less any talk of "pedigree." Only in books 6 and 7 were things as draconian as that.

As for goblins... shrug. Goblins wars are mostly hearsay in canon. But wizards have the magic, wizards have the wands. If PS gold is the same as "real" gold, there isn't much the goblins can do about it. Makes much more sense that something else would end up being used as currency.

*** what are the Goblins going to do when Literally every every Magical being that can read knows how to make a Stone? its a bit hard to put the cat back in the bag once its out.

and I think it would be almost Impossible for The Ministry to Ban Muggleborns and Half-bloods from Making and Using Philosopher's Stone.

**** Your disbelief is neither measurement nor validation or invalidation of what may happen.

What are the Goblins going to do?Kill.

The Ministry has been known to act without just cause and in any event - how would Muggleborns learn of the creation of the PS if the Ministry has banned the reading materials after they were released, making it exclusive to Purebloods?
