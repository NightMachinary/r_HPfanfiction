:END:
I think it was like in the 2010 era, maybe earlier or a bit later?

Harry, Draco, Snape, and the Malfoys were in it.

Harry had been hit by a curse? (I think, I might be thinking of two different stories). Harry's personality changes after the war, and forces Draco to become a slave.

Someone (I think Hermione?) realized he was under a spell and brought him back to normal. Harry ended up going to Grimmauld's place and finding Draco chained up... I don't remember much more after that.

And I might be thinking of more then one story but mixing them up? Maybe?

Anything that might sound similar please let me know.
