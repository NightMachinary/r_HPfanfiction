** Yes, it's just a one shot. No, I don't know why I wrote it either. If anything, this is easily the most cracky concept I have ever written.

*** Strange, I didn't find it to be cracky at all.

If you want a fic to be crack, I'd suggest...hmm, start by turning the Great Hall into a tropical aquarium, and have the suits of armor around the castle perform riverdance.

*** I want to see Luna being a pirate captain next. Feel free to take that idea if you want to, or just leave it alone if you want to, but I think it sounds awesome.

*EDIT:* OH MY GOD it already exists! Sixteen glorious chapters' worth!

  It's a commonly known fact that there is nothing quite as sexy as a female pirate. There's just something about the way she looks at you that makes you grab your bits while wondering what she's like in bed. Currently Hogwarts hosted three female pirates.

** Very fun read lol, but isn't Sue Li's name Su Li? Are you implying she's a Sue? :O (Or more like outright saying it lol)

also you missed an 'e' in legume

also "We'd all be so suspicious that he's a spy for the British Government we'd never even suspect him of being a British spy!" is a bit too nonsensical, even for Luna :P

*** I originally thought it was Su Li as well, but I can never find a single canon source where the name is listed as Su Li. Instead, on the wiki and Pottermore, it's always spelled Sue. So I went with that spelling as it seems to be the official one.

**** It's "Sue" on Pottermore, but in the "Original Forty" list that was her early pre-draft notebook, it's clearly "Su Li." So really, either is fine.

***** I honestly didn't look at that picture, which disappoints me. I think "Su Li" makes more sense, but not enough to actually go back and change it in the entire story.

WAIT NO

I FOUND IT! [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/File:Pagenotes.jpg]]

edit: I mean IDK if this is legit canon or not it might just be fake but according to [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Sue_Li][this random guy on the wiki]] its a picture of the original list of students.

**** I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5lqz4m/su_li_or_sue_li/][asked about this]] a while ago. It seems fans prefer "Su Li" although either is technically correct. Wikia editors probably decided to Anglicize the name for whatever reason.
