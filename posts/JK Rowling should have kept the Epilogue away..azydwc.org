I am going to post this here because I don't like [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]

In my opinion, the books should have ended after the battle of Hogwarts and we shouldn't have known about the 19 years later thing.

It would have been way better, if the new generation and how they were named were something for the fan's imagination.

Additionally, it kind of makes the ships prominent and there are enough of them that I am not really happy about in the long run.

What's your take on it?


** I agree. Thats the reason I like non canon compliant post war fics best

  On his way home a man whose name can hardly be called a mystery around these parts encounters three people at three very different stages in their lives, his own in many ways connected to each of them. All the paths he treads, however, always and without exception lead him back to one fixed point: the place where he belongs, the place he calls home.

  After the war, Harry Potter is desperate to make sure that not a single life more is ruined by Voldemort's legacy. Aided by the ever loyal Hermione Granger, he makes a decision which will forever change more than one life. An epilogue disregarding, Cursed Child inspired, Harmony romance.

  I have been working on this for over 10 years! A labor of love. My best version of what I think should have happened after the war, and how Harry and Hermione realize how they truly feel, little by little. Ignores epilogue. H/Hr, R/L, G/N pairings. Please read and enjoy! Originally posted on Portkey. Rating likely to increase.

Not even that.

"Dudley swallowed hard. His face was grayer than Harry had ever seen it.

'At least...at least he'll have you for a teacher, right? A familiar face to show him the ropes?'

Harry grinned. 'Sorry Duddykins,' he replied, 'I'm just doing this as a favor to a friend.'

** I like Epilogues personally. That said, Harry Potters was fairly poorly done. Not enough information to feel substantive, just "confirmation" of certain things. And in some cases, those things were somewhat unpopular. An epilogue should either be a very in-depth one, or the exact opposite. As in something that is "connected" to the world, yet very separated from the story flow that has "ended" with the main story. So, for example, a peek into "something different" like a Wizarding history professor telling the story of Harry Potter, Dumbledore, and Lord Voldemort to a new generation, years onward.

Your ships comment is the most telling because from my experience, for a large majority of people I have talked to about this, what irritates them more than anything else is how prominent it makes the ships. And let's not forget that some of those ships are fairly unpopular.

Honestly, I don't get why people are so hung up about it. Being upset in theory at the idea of Harry choosing his son's middle name for Snape, I understand, though I don't agree. But the name never stuck out to me as particularly ugly-sounding.

I think a lot of people fail to realize that it's not a hyphenated first-name. He's not going around on a daily basis calling himself "Albus Severus", any more than Ron goes around calling himself "Ronald Bilius", or Harry "Harry James". Take out the "Severus", and you're left with the perfectly-reasonable-sounding Albus Potter.

None of the things Dumbledore and Snape did for Harry was every purely for his benefit. Snape did what he did to honour Harry's dead mother, whose death he helped cause. Yet Snape's actions for good were always half-measures, constantly taking the time to attack, belittle and berate Harry and his allies.

And Dumbledore, who basically choreographed Harry's life into one big performance with a murder/suicide climax. He did it for the good of the world, to ensure that Voldemort was permanently defeated, sure sure. But it certainly was never for Harry's benefit. Harry lost his family, his childhood, and quite a lot of himself and his friends for the greater good.

I actually had more problems with "James Sirius," because that one just sounds awkward, aesthetically-speaking. It doesn't roll off the tongue at all. Never mind Harry's beloved godfather being relegated to middle-name oblivion.

** I fully understand people's dislike of the epilogue and I too have several issues with it. But overall I support it as it shows that Harry wound up with a good life. Because the ending of the book right before the epilogue doesn't really tell us if Harry won. Sure, we know he defeated Voldemort and the wizarding world was saved. But Harry had been through so much pain and trauma that simply defeating Voldemort isn't winning for him personally. It was growing up and having a good life.

Maybe the epilogue was too abrupt. Maybe it should've covered a different moment in the future. Maybe Harry shouldn't have married Ginny and Ron and Hermione shouldn't have married either (for the record, I'm quite glad for H/G and R /HR). But the epilogue as it existed showed Harry actually won, and that he had a good life after defeating Voldemort. So for that, I am fully supportive of it.

British Muggle-borns are by no stretch of the imagination a people in their own right separate from British Wizarding folks in general, and they aren't a coherent ethnicity either.

** I think it is what it is and as the author, it was her choice. It was also a neat way to not be pressured by her publisher into writing 'Harry Potter Book 8' as no doubt she was potentially under pressure to do, given the speedy turnaround of books 4 through 7.

The joy of fanfiction imo - as I've before heard it described, as creative criticism of literature, rather than technical or essay-formed criticism - is that we can go on to disregard this if we wish and imagine a world where Harry's children are not named after his parents and Dumbledore and Severus, and Ron and Hermione didn't end up together still happily married. We can each come to the books and take our own perceptions and reading of the characters and their interactions and take that on to imagine our own endings and turning points.

But ultimately the world begun as JK Rowling's child and sandbox, and this was the ending - we know, from her own mouth - that she envisaged from the very beginning, before there even was seven previous books and a Deathly Hallows. In my view, we should be able to accept and respect that as the author's vision and decision. Personally, as a wish fulfilment both for herself and her characters as she imagined them, I don't have anything against it - although I also have great enjoyment for much darker endings and reimaginings where nothing of the like takes place. From a Wastonian and Doylist perspective I understand why it's there, and, I don't know if this makes me old-fashioned, but I respect JKR for sticking to her own vision and not leaving it open-ended - which I feel she may have actually gained criticism for at the time. There were worse endings she could have gone for which wouldn't, imo, have been true to the themes and spirit that Harry Potter first carried with it in the 90s.

** It took a story about adventure, mystery, and being free and turned it into a standard man and a woman, two kids, a middle class life, yadda yadda yadda. She took the magic out of the story that made everyone love it by trying to tell the audience of teenagers what they should try to be like when they get older.

*** I agree with this. A better epilogue would be slice-of-life snippets of the characters while living a life in the magical world. It can also give the reader hints on how the world is doing. JK could even use these to start spin-offs from the series.

Harry in auror school, Ron interacting with his family (magical family life) post-war, Ginny's quidditch try out , Hermione going back to hogwarts for her newts, Neville as Sprout's teaching assistant, McGonagall rebuilding hogwarts, etc.

** I disagree. The happy ending of the epilogue shows that Harry's efforts to defeat Voldemort, including all the sacrifice and heartache, were worth it, because it did result in a better world. Furthermore, Harry's desire for a stable family was a core part of series, and any happy ending was going to have to show Harry finally achieving that. (If you have an issue with the happy ending in general, then I would advise reading something other than a children's series.)

Even the hated name - Albus Severus - makes sense. Harry is repeatedly shown to be capable of great mercy - he doesn't let Sirius and Remus kill Peter, he wouldn't stun Stan Shunpike, he went back to rescue Malfoy in the RoR, and even at the very end he tells Voldemort to try for some remorse - so his forgiveness of Dumbledore and Snape is totally in-character. And although this is just an interpretation, I think that forgiveness also implies that Harry has learned to forgive himself for the choices he made in the war.

**** I thought he didn't want to be in Slytherin, not because of the prejudice, but rather because he didn't want to be in a house in which both his father and mother were not.

And I thought it was written just to parallel his story to Harry's, how he was also afraid of getting sorted into Slytherin, and because he had no one to comfort him, he chose not to go into that house. Unlike Albus, who had Harry to comfort him.

** I like the idea behind the epilogue, but I wish it had been closer to the final battle - maybe somewhere between 2-5 years out. It could have given us just enough detail to sort of symbolize that Harry's life post-Voldemort is going to be calmer and happier, confirm that Harry and Ginny get married, etc.

This would give us more room to speculate on what happens further down the road, while also letting us know that the world doesn't fall apart after the battle.

** You say that in hindsight, but if Rowling ended the book after the battle of hogwarts, with all the side characters dropping like flies, it would have soured most people on the series. You have to land the ending, and the epilogue was a necessary sort of catharsis from the bloodbath

** My thoughts were similar when I first read the book. I had A LOT of ships in HP, but not only that, I felt like it was unnecessary. So much happened in the war and for it to just cut 19 years later didn't feel right to me, I would've enjoyed imagining- that would also leave a possibility for J.K to write more books!

Thanks for sharing! I thought I was the only one who thought this! <3

** Generally I don't like open-ended endings. However, the presence of the Epilogue goes too far in the other direction -- setting up things in canon that it really doesn't need to and takes out a lot of the possible futures people can imagine without ending up AU.

This is basically why practically all fanfiction ignores it (EWE?) unless set in the Next-Gen era (which is rare in first place).

** The epilogue was a good idea, but it should have shown changes to Britain compared to Harry's time at Hogwarts. Harry reflecting on how much changed - for the better - would have been a nice touch. Seeing Draco, remembering how the git served his time, how the Death Eaters were judged, etc. Seeign Hermione, asking how the work as Minister goes, hearing about some new laws... lots of possibilities to show changes that matter. Make the "all was well" mean something.

** I think the epilogue would've been better if Harry had married an unnamed women (or a new character that wasn't introduced prior to the epilogue) rather than Ginny. The story was about his magical life, not the love life of a teenager so it would've been better if his romantic life was left open for audience imagination, and their relationship simply doesn't work.
