:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry's class and the Slytherin goes back in time one by one (to diffrent times) because Ron said something mean in history class to Mr Binns amd he threw time turner sand on them. I think Neville and or Hermione are the first to go. Then at diffrent times they all disappear for diffrent amounts for time to diffrent times and comes back. Harry goes back to the seventies when his parents went to school and first when he gets there he just plops up next to Sirius who thinks he's james. Anyway if anyone know this fic I'd appreciate the help a lot!


** It's "Timely Errors."
