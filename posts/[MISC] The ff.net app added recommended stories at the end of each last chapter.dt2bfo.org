** If something --- anything --- is suggesting fics that haven't had much attention, then long may it continue. We need more things like that.

*** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fanfic-recommendation-engine-for-ffn.663016/]] you already have things like that. checking "random fics" after creating a recommendation list will bring up a lot of stuff that's been gathering dust for ages. set a "Reclist Matches" to something other than 0 for quality of those to be better

[[https://imgur.com/9tSXHCN]] Basically set filters like these and keep pressing search (after creating recommendation list). Slash filter is optional, it's just something that I am using, you can turn it off.

** See, ffn needs a tag system imo

*** Yes, because that would help. Then authors would simply put every single thing they can think of on every story, ever. AO3 is a perfect example of why tags are a bad idea. There are literally irrelevant tags on things. There are stories with 'humor' that are filled with grimdark bloodbaths that would make George R R Martin call plagiarism. Stories marked with slash warnigns that have one minor gay couple as supporting characters who get 3 lines all story in a 500k word novel and aren't relevant at all (yes, surprisingly, some stories marked with slash aren't slash.), and then random nonsense things like 'all the tags on this beach'. I can honestly say I've read stories on ffn that if I'd seen their tags in other locations, I would've walked away from entirely. This would likely make the problem worse.

And this is to say nothing of things like TAGS THAT ARE SPOILERS. Hey, one of your characters dies? Thanks! You just ruined the story by spoiling the plot twist! Never reading that now, already know what happens. Hell, even FFN has this problem with romance stories that give away how the romantic conflict ends by tagging it with a pairing. Tags, are horrible.

**** I think it would work if there were a set of tags that could be used (authors can't make up new tags) and there was a limit to the number of tags used (like there's a 4 character limit for each story right now)

***** Agreed. Standard tags are key. No spoilers then. Also a guide to what those tags are meant to imply so that both author and reader can know what to expect from it.

**** AO3 is a perfect example that these people have no business creating search systems. Tags can be done well, it's just these particular ppl failed rather miserably

*** I love tags; I think they're hilarious. There's a whole set of Meta on AO3 based on the tag system. People write fic using tags exclusively. I recommend checking it out!

** They seem to match the genres at least. For Romance/Humor I got other Romance/Humor stories, most with the same pairing.

** I'm definitely not a fan of this new feature. Then again, I haven't been a fan of any of the ffn app updates since they first created the story info page as a chapter design and consolidated all the comments to it.

So far for me the only thing that matches is genre.. and not even always that! My most recent story went from an Adventure/Romance Harry/Daphne story to 25 consecutive Hermione/Draco Hurt/Comfort/Romance recs.. these are some seriously shitty recs lol

I mean I've come to realize these last couple years that the HP fandom has become overrun with Dramione and Snape fics, but when I search for stories and specifically exclude characters, why am I getting new story recommendations that have them as the main characters?!

** I've checked them. For a "pre legendary sannin vs paperwork" (a short ship-less humor story) it suggested me a whole truckload of slash and a bunch of stories from the same author as the original story. If it's consistently doing stuff like that - they need to do better.
