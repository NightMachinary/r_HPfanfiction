As the title says, what are the flaws in your fanfiction writing, what do you dislike about it, what do you want to improve? Personally, in terms of HP fanfiction, I think I'm not very good at mixing dialogue and action. I like to think I'm quite good at a character's inner thoughts and at descriptions, but I find these will often break the flow of speech, so I'm just not very practised in describing things going on while characters talk and that either makes my conversations too empty or constantly jarringly interrupted by actions and description. Basically no seamless mixing of an epic duel and monologue is going to be happening in my writing. In terms of a minor problem, I have an international school english education, so I often mix American and British english which makes it hard to stick to one in particular. For example I'll describe the front of the car as the hood, but the back as the boot. So, I can't fully stick to the cannonical writing in the books, but I also don't completely distance myself from it.


** I don't really differentiate between my fanfiction writing and any other writing. I struggle to balance description and dialogue. I can't write action scenes to save my life. My first multi-chapter story used some indulgent cliches I wouldn't use now. And I did once write a very short one-shot in first-person, present-tense (winces). Thankfully that's long-gone now.

** To be honest, I'm a much better reader than writer. I enjoy analyzing texts and like to think I'm good at it, but my own writing is pretty mediocre. I avoid all the obviously horrible flaws, but I feel like there's still lacking a lot in my writing. It feels kinda... soulless. I think my dialogues don't feel quite natural yet, and my characters don't feel as alive as they should. As a result, I'm very reluctant to publish anything.

Also, English isn't my first language, so I think I'm lacking a lot of colloquialisms. That might be one factor in dialogue not feeling right.

*** One tip for that is to read your dialogue aloud or to put it through a text-to-voice tool. It may feel a little silly at first, but actually HEARING the dialogue can help you pinpoint where exactly it feels strange or unnatural.

Yeah, and if you actually do "play" the characters a bit it helps giving them a unique voice - because what they say must kind of match their tone - at least that works for me.

** Dialogue with more than two persons. If you have two you can tell who is speaking by knowing who spoke first. Then you can reduce all the "he/she said" sentences (couldn't find the English term for them) to convey emotions. But with more than two you are using these sentences quite a lot just to keep track who is saying what and therefore you repeat your verbs and descriptions much faster.

Also describing clothes, especially female fashion. I barely know what half of them are called in German (my native tongue) and can't even use a dictionary for the other half. Colours are fine but I will call that thing a dress and not whatever term a British woman would use for that particular outfit.

I sometimes go to a (british) online-shop, look for the cloths I want and use the terms there. But yeah, it's really annoying, and I have the exact same problem.

My real solution is just to not describe the stuff or to at least keep it short :)

** A lot, to be honest.

I think my main PAST flaw - something that I'm cognizant of in stuff I need to rewrite - is just being scared to come away from canon and sticking too much to rehashing plots 'cause I was worried about too much canon divergence. I know now when I do my Slytherin!Harry rewrite that I'll kill Quirrell off in the first five chapters and just go away from the canon immediately.

In the meantime, I think my main issue is that I'll get excited about certain plot points and rush toward them, whereas I think I could stand to slow my pace a bit and make things subtler? Dialogue and the technical aspects of writing are less my worry so much as the way in which I spread out and present the content.

As a reader, thank you for that. I love it when authors deviate from canon fast, for the sole fact that it lets me know "this won't be canon" and to expect at least some story- instead of character-driven parts.

I haven't read much of your stuff, but maybe the solution to this is to simply go in after the fact and slightly change the pacing after the first draft is finished? This kind of stuff is really hard to do from "up close".

*** Yes, I totally second [[/u/fflai]] here, I hate when writers make like a Slytherin!Harry AU or something, but it's literally the same thing, point by point, except you replace Ron with Draco or something. I get really frustrated by stories like that, so anything that strays from canon is great.

**** I mean I understand that some things weren't going to change just because Harry was in Slytherin, for instance the CoS was always going to open, Sirius was always going to get out of Azkaban, the Triwizard Tournament was always gonna happen, etc, but the way Harry is influenced by each of those events should change. Slytherin Harry shouldn't really care, for instance, about the CoS being open.

*** Pacing is subjective. A lot of people love the standard pacing of romance stories where the they get together at the end of the plot, following a static chain of "stations" along the road, usually something along the lines of first date, first kiss, French kissing, some completely avoidable misunderstanding that gets blown out of proportion, reconciliation, confessing love, first time sex.

I absolutely detest that kind of plot. I'd much rather read a story where the pairing gets together relatively early and then has to face a threat together, be it unexpected pregnancy, civil war, prejudice against lesbian relationships, backstabbing friends, murder plots, assassination attempts or really anything besides angst.

If you can tell how it's going to end by page and age 5 the story is rather boring. I mean, Harry Potter would be boring if seven books went by before the trio became friends. People read it for their shared adventures, not how they became friends.

So if you want to diverge from common pacing then do it. There are plenty of situations where people have sex after the first date or rush things. It may not follow expectations but that happens in real life, so why wouldn't it fly in fiction?

**** I find that I most enjoy romance stories that portray the day-to-day aspects of a relationship, and not the initial obstacles that predate the start of that relationship. In fact, this is one of the main reasons why I enjoy fanfiction, because seemingly every romance novel or side-plot in popular media involves the latter and not the former. Personally, I couldn't care less about the cliche "will they or won't they" plot. It's neither realistic or interesting, the real drama starts with actually keeping the relationship going.

** I find myself having to write every single interaction between my key characters, which means my pace is so slow because it's practically playing out in real time.

I just can't seem to jump ahead a month (or even a week!) because character relationships are my main focus and so I want to play out every detail of conversation (or lack of conversation) so that the reader can see exactly the type of relationship it is.

But I also hate rushing in to things (like becoming friends / something more or falling out and fighting) because I feel like those things should take time to build up to so basically I end up with 20+ chapters of 'getting to know you' before any sort of action come in to play.

** For me, and particularly with fanfiction, it's inconsistency in tone. I can only really fix that on a third or more editing pass.

Also, it's most natural for me to write in third person present tense, which annoys many readers. (I studied creative writing in university under an author who passed on this preference.)

** Spelling and grammar have always been struggles for me, and even with help I tend to infuriate some readers with my bad english skills.

That aside, I personally feel like my writing can run a bit dry. I tend not to include a lot of descriptions of characters actions or where they are, but instead rely heavily on dialogue that ends up taking place largely in a blank void. That's one reason I've been practicing on writing in the first person as it tends to force you to provide more details for the environment as you imagine yourself in that person's shoes.

I have trouble with action scenes.

Keeping the characters in character can at times be difficult for me as well. Is Harry too passive or moody or not sarcastic enough or too sarcastic? What about Hermione is she okay? Ron is he written believably? It can be rather difficult despite the fact that we spend the most time with them.

** Description is one of my strengths until it suddenly goes off the deep end and gunks up the works - which also means I screw up the pacing sometimes, because I'll dwell too long on whatever I find most interesting vs. getting on with what the story needs.

I've finally managed to wrestle my dialogue to a serviceable level, but it lacks pith and wit, and I still don't know how to compress and distill. Also, I speak US English, so I'm never entirely easy with my grasp of British English, especially regional dialects and class markers.

Possibly my most irritating flaw: I have a bad habit of trying to weave in clues about the ultimate meaning of some plot point or character choice, and make allusions to canon events without drawing a straight line between hint and source material. But there's a difference between being subtle and being downright invisible, and I often end up simply baffling my readers.

Lastly, I'm not strong on long-form plots. This is kicking my butt with my original writing, because I have a cast of characters and a bunch of events and some corresponding symbols and unearthly goings-on, but the plot itself meanders and doesn't have a gripping forward momentum.
