A parody of Lord Potter fics where one day Harry gets kidnapped/rescued away from the Dursleys by Yondu, until somehow an owl knocks on the ship's windows in the middle of deep space. Harry returns to Earth with tech gadgets, Ego powers and a wildly different personality.


** Can the owl have a cute astronaut helmet? Just the helmet?

** At this point, Yondy would be with Perer actually as Peter was taken in 1988 if I remeber correctly. So depending on when it takes it place then yh!

Older brother Peter would bang tho ngl.

** Nice idea but why does he have Ego Powers at age 11? Quill gets them...I don't remember his age but it certainly wasn't 11.

*** Quill always had Ego powers, he only learns to use them when he meets Ego. No reason to believe that if he had met Ego as a kid he wouldn't have been able to use them then.

***** Only reason why Quill didn't meet Ego was because Yondu knew what was going on and wanted to spare Quill from that. Maybe for the sake of this story Yondu wasn't aware and took Harry straight to Ego after abducting him, but got him away shortly after Harry learned how to control his Celestial abilities. Hell I dunno, there are multiple ways to swing it.

****** Or why not just have Harry's natural magic react to Ego's? Say he's been able to semi control it for years already while on the ship with Yondu. That way Ego could be seen as a antagonist for him when he gets older, much like Quill.

***** Ego would make a fine professor of Defense against the Dark Arts, and arguably better than some of the ones they had.
