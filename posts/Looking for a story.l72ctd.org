A couple of years back I read a story but now I can't seem to find it. The story has Rita Skeeter writing a nice peace about Harry because Sirius and Remus have adopted him(And I think dumbledore is being bashed but I'm not sure). And later on Umbridge enters the story and actualy seems to like harry after she sees him reading her book while she is checking how Sirius is treating harry after he gains custity.
