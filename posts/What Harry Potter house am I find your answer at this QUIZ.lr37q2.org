** It just puts you in whichever house you say you want at the end of the quiz... I did it four times with the same answers for the first 22 questions, only choosing a different preferred house at the end and every time went to the chosen house. I wasted my time so you don't have to.

** I got Ravenclaw. That's what I asked for on the question where it promises to take your preferences into account, and I'm left wondering whether all the other questions are red herrings. If I were really being sorted, I'd try to avoid expressing a preference, since the Hat has more experience doing this than I do.

*** perfect!!! Ravenclaw House prizes learning, *wisdom, wit, and intellect* in its members. Thus, many Ravenclaws tend to be academically motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods.

Did you find yourself with those characteristics?
