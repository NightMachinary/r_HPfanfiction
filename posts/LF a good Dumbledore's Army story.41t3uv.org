** There's Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness (DAYD). Lots of army references (characters get ranks like sergeants), but well-written and funny.

*** *Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness* is a terrible story. It claims to be canon, but its characters couldn't be more OOC, and its plots couldn't be more implausible. [[/spoiler][Demelza almost strangled Neville to death because Ginny went to discuss DA with him in the middle of the night?! Snape tried to feed Neville/Ginny/Luna to werewolves in the Forbidden Forest?! Hagrid abandoned the three to die there because Snape ordered him to?! Victor Krum rescued Neville from the ministry execution chamber?!]]

** How about Dumbledore's Army? I'm sure it's recommended often, since I've seen this author mentioned here plenty. linkffn(Dumbledore's Army by bobmin356)

I liked it, the take on Muggle fighting, the original characters... It was a bit tropey but forgiveable since it's over a decade old. Overall though it was fun.

** There is one year 7 Hogwarts story I'd like to recommend. It's still in progress so the story could still improve or deteriorate, but what I'm seeing so far looks good. Snape's characterization is about right, and the story has a nice balance between light-hearted moments and heart-breaking darkness:

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.

** How about linkffn(a call to arms by mydearprofessormcgonagall)! That's probably my favorite story out there. It follows Ginny, then McGonagall, then does snippets of pretty much every side character and is amazingly well written with great characterizations!

*** This is another bad story with lots of OOC situation and unnecessary plot devices. For example, if Snape really shoved Ginny to a 2 week long torture course with the Carrows, there was no way they would name their kid 'Albus Severus'. Also during the same time, Harry was stalking Ginny on the Marauder's Map for hours every night, and Hermione was interrogating Phineas Nigellus' portrait at least twice a week. If Ginny suffered such atrocities, they would know it in an instant. Harry was already itching to get back to Hogwarts to join the rebellion. Now if he found that Ginny was tortured every night by the Carrows, he would freak out immediately and be back at Hogwarts in no time.

***** LOL.

I can't stand stories that are masquerading as canon and then ignore source materials, do a bunch of OOC situations, and introduce unnecessary plot devices.

If you start out as AU, then all the power to you.
