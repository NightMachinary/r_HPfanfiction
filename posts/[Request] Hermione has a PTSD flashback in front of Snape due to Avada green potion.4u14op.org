So yeah, can't really remember much other than what is in the title, but it is set after the war when I think Hermione has either come back for an eighth year or is being tutored etc. She is triggered by a potion the same colour of the killing curse - I'm about 90% sure she remembers something about Colin Creevey dying but don't quote me. Snape tries to shake her out of it and when she does, he says something along the lines of "You couldn't hear me?" and sends her to Madam Pomfrey or some such remedy.

I have no idea how the story goes from there or if it's Hermione/Snape.

Thanks for any help!
