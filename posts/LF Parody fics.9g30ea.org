I'm looking for over the top parodies of established tropes in HP fanfiction. Something utterly ridiculous and hilarious.


** Linkffn(A Mother In Law's Love by Perspicacity) is a pretty hilarious parody of the soul bond trope.

#+begin_quote
  I took the documents and concluded our meeting with the customary Goblin platitude, "Thank you, Skullrutter. May thy coffers fill with thine enemies' fingerbones and daughters' dowries."

  Skullrutter grinned, exposing rows of dark, serrated teeth, his face lit up at finding a client apprised of Goblin custom. "And you, Harry Potter, may thine heir's dagger blood itself first not in thy back, but in thine enemy's."

  I made a fist with my right hand and pounded it heavily upon his desk. "And may thine enemies tremble before thee. And may their wives break their hips from thine own powerful pelvic thrusts!"

  Skullrutter stood, eyes wide, and leered at me. "And may the life blood of thine enemies flow in champagne fountains at thine exclusive Country Club during the wedding reception of thy first born daughter!"

  I leaped upon the desk and roared, "And may thy chiropractor learn his weirding ways from a gentle and at least moderately competent instructor! And may he keep his fingernails trimmed!" I kicked the Goblin hard in the face, splitting his lip.

  He staggered to his feet, spit blood upon the floor, and flourished a blackened scimitar. "And may thy love interest keep an open mind in the bedroom!" He swatted me hard on the left shin with the flat of the blade. "And may he or she swallow when called upon!" He struck the other shin.

  I withstood his blows with quiet stoicism-Goblin etiquette is not so much about the words exchanged as one's composure; to make a sound would be the gravest of insults. We glared at one another in silence for several seconds, then relaxed.

  "Good day then." I stepped down.

  "Good day to you, Mr. Potter. And Happy Birthday."

  Distraught over Ginny's death in the final battle, Harry gambles desperately and travels back in time to set things right. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned. A twist on the classic Soul Bond tale.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
