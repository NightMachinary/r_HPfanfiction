There was this on fic which I read long ago but can't find it anymore. It would be a great help if anyone of you can find it. Basically it was a post war story where different people were paired and had to live in a city made inside the room of requirement. It was to teach them of the coming life and had different pairings, jobs and babies. If i remember correctly harry and hannah were paired together while draco and hermione were other. but i am not very sure of that part


** I've read erodoujins like that. Also, I'm pretty sure that someone was already looking for it either here or on DLP, you can try to find something with search.

  COMPLETELY REWRITTEN: No longer starts as canon, it is completely non-canon. AND I AM NOW CONTINUING THE STORY - The trio return for an 8th year at Hogwarts. House unity is promoted, new relationships and friendships blossom and because Harry Potter is involved, it is definitely not a quiet year! M for sexual themes, violence and swearing!
