Give me some of the best HP crossovers you read or an HP crossover that you wish existed. Would love to have HP crew in a different story setting, but also very open for HP and/or characters transported to different world/universe. (For me I would love to see a HP x Ghost in the Shell were HP character specialize in something and Harry leads them in missions). Thanks!!! Thanks for all the replies!!!

**** No, Harry uses the trees as weapons against the Others, but that's it. And that's sort of a specific example, but what I meant more generally was Harry who uses earth based spells so that people think he is Garth Greenhand reborn, like an incarcerous spell made of vines, trees that shoot leaves like arrows, something like that which gives the impression that he has control over the plants and earth. And like Garth Greenhand he has a bunch of super powerful children by a bunch of different mothers who shape the future of Westeros.

Seriously, that's a great premise that isn't too limiting, and saying Mary Poppins is actually a HP-style witch doesn't conflict with either canon (that carpetbag is just like Hermione's beaded bag).

** A Mass Effect Crossover where Jane Shepard and Tali are thrown through time and crash into the garden of Privet drive just after Dumbledore dropped Harry off. Jane finds Harry (suffering from slight hypothermia) and takes him along because of the letter Dumbledore included (which does not fit their understanding of the world at all).

Jane and Tali use future knowledge to revolutionise technology (with Jane being the figurehead like Elon Musk) and completely shit over the timeline because they know that their future just brings doom and destruction. Possibly even initiate an early first contact with the Quarians. They also unsuccessfully try to figure out what magic is after witnessing some accidental one which cannot be explained with Mass Effect lore.

Meanwhile, once he gets to Hogwarts, Harry tells everyone that his adoptive mother is an alien who has to live in an environmental suit and everyone is like "sounds like something Harry Potter would do". Not sure about the exact details, but I think it would end in the Death Eaters being introduced to mass-accelerated Sniper rounds and Voldemort suffering the same fate should the graveyard repeat itself in a similar fashion. And because Jane grew to love Harry, that would even satisfy the Prophecy.

**** Garrus and Liara are the most popular character of the fandom, and at some point, they are simply overused. I call it the "Neville Effect". And Grunt would cause some hilarity, but he would not blend into the shadows. Tali could hack her way around any security and provide technical know-how, Grunt can headbutt stuff and kick arse.

I feel that he would be better suited if you dropped the squad into the Battle of Hogwarts, slugging it out with Acromantulas and Giants than in a story about technological advancement.

*** legit, you should try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643565/1/Blue-Magic][Blue Magic]] by Tellur !linkffn(8643565) the plot is somewhat similar to what you have described except swap Shepard for Liara, and Tali for Tali's great grandmother

it also happens to be competently written, with great dialogue and is pretty witty at times. Unfortunately it is unfinished, and I have doubts the author will continue. :( still, they are pretty active with their PM's, so they might respond if you ask them about it

** Some random ideas from my wish list.

Unspeakable Harry is thrown back in time, to prevent a paradox he travels to country he's never learned about to avoid paradox (can't change what you don't know). There he hears rumors of a strangely dressed priestess... Inuyasha crossover.

A HP/Monster Musume crossover that deals semi-seriously with the fall of the Statue of Secrecy, and still has some monster girl shenanigans.

A D&D/Elder Scrolls/etc. crossover where the actual lore is explored rather regaling the reader with munchkinry. Bonus points for actually having to learn rather than receiving some blessing or luck to 'move the plot along'.

Competitive empire building like how I like to imagine [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12523587/1/Goblet-of-Vegas][Goblet of Vegas]] turning out.

A semi-serious Highschool DxD crossover where a devil wants to experiment with resurrection is collecting parts of Voldemort and people possessed by his horcruxes into their peerage. (Quirrell, Ginny, Harry, Nagi, and others).

The Ministry Six find themselves scattered throughout the Old World of Warhammer Fantasy. Fate might bring them back together, but they would all be changed by their experiences.

** A A Song of Ice and Fire Crossover where Harry and Hermione end up in Westeros shortly after the Rebellion. And AFTER Hermione has read the first book (which came out in 1996), so she knows about the Lannister duplicity, Littlefinger, Dany and Jon's parentage as well as the White Walkers (although not as much as they should know).

Given that neither feels like shitting into buckets and watching everyone die by age 40, a quick industrialisation and enlightenment would be in order (magic makes that ridiculously easy), as well as a deliverance of Slavers' Bay (most likely through gunboat diplomacy) and the utter destruction of the Unsullied and their masters.

Given that they are both British, I don't see a democratic crusade happening, but definitely the introduction of parliamentarism and a constitution as well as the abolition of serfdom.

Starfox might argue that mind-control would be the best way, but that makes for a boring story and would still take years to set up because they could not use apparation and portkeys without having visited the places first.

**** Yes, and no. I am sure that Harry would oppose real slavery as well if he ever visited Meereen or Yunkai. He fights for what is right, and the Hogwarts House Elves are not mistreated. Unlike the slaves in Westeros. Hermione would be the driving force, but Harry would follow out of conviction and not because he doesn't want to hurt a friend.

And Hermione, at least in the scenario I have in mind, would be hardened by the war. She would be more akin to "We need to build a Navy to stop the Ironborn and later free the slaves. So we need guns, steel, coal, scientists and engineers, factories..." and less "let's make some token hats which don't actually free the House Elves".

Less idealism, more Realpolitik so to speak.

** So many crossovers I wish for...

A Star Wars/Harry Potter fusion where Harry is a Jedi who is on the run after the Jedi Purge starts and ends up being taken in and hidden by the Weasley famiy. The Weasley kids are all force sensitive, but Molly and Arthur refused to give them up to the Jedi at such a young age.

A Skins crossover with Harry/Effy. Lots of drugs in the form of potions and lots of firewhiskey. (I'd also take Ginny/Cook or Emily/Hermione.)

A Hannibal (NBC) crossover with teenage Harry ending up in the position of Abigail in the Will/Hannibal relationship - while staying as in-character as possible.)

A Buffy crossover where Dawn gets sent to Harry for protection instead. He suddenly has this 14-year-old daughter he supposedly conceived right after the war and he finds out it's all fake memories when Glory comes after her.

A Stargate crossover where Bill becomes host to a Goa'uld while working in Egypt. Or Bill finds alien tech in Egypt. Or a Goa'uld is what 'attaches' itself to Ron in the DoM.

A Song of Ice and Fire crossover with slow-burn Harry/Robb. Harry is not OP, but he's useful enough to make a difference in the war, and Robb takes the Iron Throne.

A Krypton (Syfy) crossover/AU where the Justice League tracks Voldemort from Romania to Britain and Superman rescues Harry in the graveyard. Years later, Trelawney prophecizes that an enemy is going back in time to destroy Superman. Harry, who never really found a purpose after Voldemort's capture, steals a device from the DoM that takes him to Krypton 200 years before it exploded. Oh, and Dumbledore tells Superman/Batman that Harry is horcrux and that Voldemort can't die with him alive. As a result, Voldemort gets thrown into the Phantom Zone.

** One of my favorites is linkffn(The Traveler in Black Meets Harry Potter), which is a cross with John Brunner's 'The Traveler in Black.'

Another favorite is linkffn(Plantagenet by HiBob), which crosses Harry Potter with Randall Garrett's 'Lord Darcy' universe.

  A crossover between John Brunner's The Traveler in Black and Harry Potter. What happens when a being with many names, but only one nature, encounters the chaos that is the Wizarding world? For some, tragedy, for others....

  Harry found the boy by falling on him. He remembers the blood. Professor McGonagall recognized the boy, even with Harry next to him. His presence would change the future more than anyone could imagine. A completed story.

** I'd like to see a fic post Hogwarts where Harry decides to protect the non magicals from monsters etc. like the Hunters from supernatural.

He would still use wizard world resources etc as hes smart, but doesnt agree with the way the Wizard world ignores and doesnt help the non magicals. Could even leave that universe and just do that in the Supernatural universe.

** I suggest looking at "The Bunny Pool" by Genuka and others. There are many bunnies that have amazing crossover ideas you might like. And there are some of them that have been claimed, I think.

** Oh how I wish for an ASOIAF crossover, with old/experienced Harry getting stuck there and somewhat getting mixed up in local conflicts but NOT the game of thrones or on Westeros (a completely different timeline would be even better). Westeros for me is hands down the most boring setting imaginable in the world of ASOIAF. (Sth approximately similar was A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My Fault, but that's gone off the rails after a while and it's a cross with Dresden not HP.)

Now that I think about it I basically want the Shadow of Angmar in Martin's world :)).

Or basically any crossovers along these lines, where the point of the work is *not* how Harry could make all conflict pointless by existing, or how he could be stuffed into a plot-line which was much-much better off without his inclusion.

Worlds I like are Dresden, The Dark Tower, LoTR, ASOIAF, Star Wars even, SG on occasion, nBSG... but in my experience there are very few of these kinds of crossovers which are even slightly above trash. (And most of those have already been listed in this thread, or other similar ones.)

Some which I liked, not necessarily in line with my above-outlined-wishes, and weren't listed in this thread are:

linkffn(8712160)

linkao3(3236603)

  Carried to the far end of the Galaxy by the veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter becomes a veritable stranger in a strange land. But all the obstacles he has faced pale in comparison to the Cylon menace. Starts in the middle of Harry's fifth year and roughly eleven years before the fall of the Twelve Colonies.
