[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror][Fridge Horror]] comes from thinking too deeply about an issue and realizing that there are horrible implications if you do. These are usually fun to play with in fanfiction, so =). It is best summed up as using Fridge Logic (things that are superficially acceptable but break down when you are thinking it over later staring into your fridge) that turns a situation into Nightmare fuel.

*Love Potions* The most common one you see tackled a lot in fanfic is the whole Love Potion issue. Love Potions are treated casually (they are not considered unforgivable or even a major crime, by how canon treats them), but are essentially hyjacking someones mental state, potentially over a long period of time. It also has unsettling parallels to some real-world date-rape situations.

*Oblivion & Mental Spells* The casual rewriting of memories in canon is downright terrifying if you think about it. It is played off as funny the mental damage taken by the groundskeeper at the World Cup. I don't know if canon ever shows such spells being considered acceptable for use on Wizards, but it certainly doesn't call it out as an uncrossable line. For that matter, most mental spells (Confudus) would also fall under this category, although non-long term ones maybe not so much.

*Statute of Secrecy: Minister* The view of canon seems to be that the muggle minister knows about magic, but not much of his own government. Which seems downright silly, with such an unknown power there would be a massive government effort to understand and have contingency plans for it. Thus, if that is not the case, you would think there is some magical enforcement on it. Imagine, every time the minister tries to tell a general or spymaster about his meeting with the magicals, their eyes gloss over. He knows about what has to be the singular greatest potential threat to peace in our time, and /can't do anything about it/. It is probably a relief to dump the issue on the next minister (and of course then being mind wiped), for at least then he can have a few hour conversation about his issues.

*Statute of Secrecy: Muggleborn Parents* Family of muggleborn's have knowledge of the magical world, and they are shown to be relatively common (at least a few per year). The concept that such a massive secret could be maintained with so many potential leakers implies a pretty nasty magical or authoritarian solution. After all, all it takes is one scientist parent who decides this needs to be published or one oppertunist who decides to take advantage of it for their own reasons to blow the whole thing wide open. Everything shown in canon was for fixing accidental revelations, not counter deliberate intent to bypass the laws. One of the best fringe logic's on this I've seen was the concept that the parents were basically bespelled to forget about their kids while they are at school. So any concerns they might have fade away quickly and they tend not to think about them while they are not around. Thus, parents and children will grow further and further apart, because the relationship can only be maintained as much as the child forces interactions with their parents.... and I think I've pretty much defined parental horror here.

*Callousness of the Magicals* With how magical power is portrayed in canon, it would pretty easily solve many of the worlds most pressing issues. You can get away with a lot blaming separation of the cultures and brainwashing of any incoming muggleborn, but its hard to imagine anyone who grew up in the muggle world (Late comer wizard or a muggleborn parent) being ok with having magical cures for diseases that are ravishing the country or to fend off starvation and doing nothing about it. Which just reinforces some of the above horrors for how the level of compliance to the SoS is enforced.

Thoughts? Other Fridge Horrors that you see? :)

Edit: The [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fridge/HarryPotter][Harry Potter Fridge Horror]] page on TV Tropes has a lot of good examples. Some of my favorites: * Using Polyjuice potion as a tool for stalking/perving on a target * Transfiguration being able to create life. And then teaching 11 year olds how to do it * Cat-owner Hermione vanishing a kitten without any qualms


** You forgot: Slavery: Hermione's the only one who has issues with the wizards keeping an entire species enslaved. Everyone else doesn't care, even though everyone, including Dumbledore, calls it slavery and we're shown prominent examples of how evil it is in the books. That says a whole damn lot about the morality of the vast Majority of wizards.

Like how goblin wars are mentioned in Canon & with how house elves are treated makes you wonder what exactly the wizards goals were for those wars and who the villians were.

Or, while werewolf treatment is called out in Canon, there are a bunch of thinking/talking animals, clearly sentient, yet treated like animals.

**** ... The first thing I think of from this was a quote that I don't quite recall exactly but it was about how negro's were proper to make slaves because unlike whites they were unfit for other work and were happiest when they were provided with labor :| :| :| [[/u/colorandtimbre][u/colorandtimbre]] posted a quote that was pretty close, but not exact.

The house-elf slavery described in the book is simply despicable. The notion that house-elfs might benefit from work non-withstanding, its described as magically forced servitude, with manditory self-punishment should an order be disobeyed. This isn't just self-deprecation, it is shown as a compulsion to do self-harm. Further, house-elves are shown to be the kind of 'its my property I can do anything I want with it' straight out of Django Unchained.

​

In lieu of that, I'll give you this other quote:

"My gift to industry is the genetically engineered worker, or Genejack. Specially designed for labor, the Genejack's muscles and nerves are ideal for his task, and the cerebral cortex has been atrophied so that he can desire nothing except to perform his duties. Tyranny, you say? How can you tyrannize someone who cannot feel pain?" -Chairman Sheng-ji Yang, "Essays on Mind and Matter"

​

Let us assume you have a situation where House Elves are dependent on doing labor to survive. Maybe they have some sort of symbiotic bond with wizards, leeching off their magic. Maybe they magically gain sustenance from labor. whatever.

​

How would this come about? Well there are two options:

1. Magically engineered creatures: They are created like golums. This opens a pandoras box. The concept of engineering a 'laborer' isn't a new one and has quite a storied history. In all likelihood, it'll be possible to do that with genetic engineering in our lifetime, and we'll have to decide how we navigate this minefield.\\
   Thing is? Even if you assume the magical world has tackled this issue and decided this is a good way to go, the fact it isn't explained or mentioned undermines this argument. How can you suggest that the engineering of labor-addicted life has been undertaken in an ethically and thought out manner and not have it be a well-documented undertaking?\\
   And if it was well documented, our resident bookworm certainly would have found something in her crusade against house elf slavery.
2. It was bred in / added on: For this, you imagine your traditional fae workers, who might be defined as showing up and helping around the house because it is their nature. Now you have to imagine wizards using magic to enslave that power for their benefit, or perhaps capturing and breeding them into modern house-elfs. This is almost as troublesome as the notion of a engineered creature.

In addition, even if you get past the 'what is right for the house elves', you have the other side of 'what should society tolerate'? After all, we do not allow dog fights even though there are dogs specifically bred for that purpose. We have simply decided that that is not the kind of behavior we will tolerate in our society.

3. Much as your number two, elves lived near humans and helped each other on occasion. Those who did found that /something something/ magic /blah blah thaumobabble/ positive feedback loop and they became far more successful than those elves who stayed away.

Regardless, my point there was it didn't matter what situation was designed/historic for: the type of slavery depicted in the books is really appauling by modern standards. You can easily imagine a mutually beneficial relationship that doesn't involve coercion or cruelty.

I think people (especially those who haven't read the books in a long time) forget that the Muggles of the HP universe are clearly shown to have natural instincts which blind them to the existence of magic. In PoA, an inhabited farm house literally jumps tens of meters from one place to another. No obliviation is required. The Muggles just dismiss it. There are repeated references to this psychological mechanism, where Muggles go to extreme lengths to dismiss magic even when they see it.

Now, the above could lead you to say that it is a misconception that the Muggle world in the HP universe is the same world as the one we live in: HP Muggles are different to "real life Muggles". They're more stupid, more delusional, etc.

But I think that position would miss the point. The whole purpose of having Muggles so blind to magic, even magic which occurs right in front of their eyes, is meant as commentary on the close-minded nature of people in real life.

The Muggle world in Harry Potter /is/ intended to be our world. The Muggles in Harry Potter have just as much evidence of the existence of magic as we do in real life. Do /you/ believe in magic? I certainly don't.

The Muggleborn's parents are detained and interrogated. Since their answers aren't satisfactory, they are tortured. The first few might be dismissed as lunatics, but at some point it becomes a pattern. The Muggleborn are coerced into collaborating or their parents will be shot. Some might even volunteer to spy for the state since they have been brainwashed. From there on, Secrecy cannot be maintained.

***** This seems to have become your topic of the week. I think it misses a few points made above.

Firstly, it misses the point that the HP world is our world. In real life, did the Stasi come to believe in a wizarding conspiracy and set up a task force to counteract it? No. Then they didn't in the HP world either.

Secondly, it significantly underestimates the extent to which Muggles are close minded. The Stasi are not going to believe that magic exists, no matter how many Muggleborns they torture. Other explanations would be found - that it was an elaborate American infiltration, that there was some kind of mentally destabilising disease, etc.

Thirdly, it pretends that wizards are just going to sit by and let all of this happen. As we see in HBP, wizards monitor Muggle government quite closely, can infiltrate it with casual ease (Kingsley inserting himself into the Prime Minister's office), and manipulate it to their own ends at will. The wizarding governments of the areas behind the Muggle iron curtain are not going to permit any kind of anti-wizard task force to be set up.

It's fine if you want to use this idea for an AU fanfic but it's rather implausible as an approach to canon.

***** There was a one-shot fic where GreaterGood!Dumbledore's machinations were foiled because Harry reported his uncle for tax evasion and obliviations don't cover an automated computer escalating an incident when no response came from the obliviated agents. I bring this up because all it takes is one bit of physical evidence in exactly the wrong location and the whole thing starts to unwind.

Mind you, if you consider the Fantastic Beasts movies canon, then there is enough of a belief in magic that a random muggle woman speaking on the street can hold a sizeable interest in magic. Add in the random Jacob Kowalski's of the world, muggles that just happened to slip through the cracks without oblivion, and the idea that wizards are a secret at the government level is just laughable.

My theory is that governments just pretend like they don't remember in order to pacefy the wizards. Because in an all-out war, five wizards who could cast feindfyre could speed around a country burning down entire cities. The economic and humanitarian damage such a small group could do is downright /staggering./

So, how is it they can exist along side of us without our portable tech (smart phones, tablets, etc) acting weird or stop functioning? Diagon Alley would be discovered in flash the moment someone with a phone walks past the Leaky Cauldron, and so would the Ministry.

Fridge Horror: Every time someone with a pacemaker walks by, they fall over dead.

I never thought that the technology thing was canon. Particularly since 'technology' covers way too many things: The wheel is technology, as is a pen, or a gear. Plus I thought it was always "A few muggleborn tried to bring things that didn't work at Hogwarts so obviously no technology works at hogwarts", eg more myth than reality.

My headcanon is that magic releases a whole range of eletromagnetic radiation. That means, in addition to light bursts when spells are cast, you are releasing mini EMP's, which could fry nearby electronics. (We'll ignore the whole "magic gives you cancer" side effect of that for now). 'course, early electronics would have been MUCH more susceptible to even light EMP's than modern electronics, and it would be relatively easy to create items protected against such radiation. (And figuring this out would be a good thing for any science-minded fanfic character to do ._. )

** I disagree with most of the above but that just starts a discussion that goes nowhere. Instead I will just offer a couple of small factual corrections.

*Obliviation and mental damage:*

It's a fanon misconception that obliviation/repeated obliviation results in some kind of mental damage. It's been brought about by a misreading of GoF:

#+begin_quote
  Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague “Merry Christmas.”

  *“He'll be all right,”* said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. “Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated *for a while*... and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.”
#+end_quote

The only long term effect of obliviation is that you don't remember that which was obliviated.

*Anyone in Muggle government other than the Prime Minister knowing about magic:*

#+begin_quote
  “But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn't a former Prime Minister warned me ---?”

  At this, Fudge had actually laughed.

  “My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?”

  Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?
#+end_quote

Given that we have insight into the Prime Minister's inner thoughts, we know for a fact that there is no secret government project or agency to maintain knowledge of wizards.

No Prime Minister (except for one) has ever told anyone about magic. If the Prime Minister starts raving about wizards, the result is not some Manhattan Project against wizards. The result is that the Prime Minister is ejected from office because they've clearly gone insane. This is what happened to Lord North:

#+begin_quote
  Porteus Knatchbull

  1781 - 1789

  Was called in confidentially in 1782 by the Muggle Prime Minister of the day, Lord North, to see whether he could help with King George III's emerging mental instability. Word leaked out that Lord North believed in wizards, and he was forced to resign after a motion of no confidence.
#+end_quote

Not only was Lord North forced to resign because he told people about wizards, but Muggle history has been rewritten. Muggles believe that Lord North was forced to resign due to the British defeat at Yorktown. In fact it was because he started telling people about wizards. While clearly no one believed him, apparently the Ministry decided to tie off the loose end and adjust history (presumably including the Parliamentary record).

*** Depends on how primal you consider memories to be to ones sense of self. Is alzheimer's a mind horror of the 1st degree or simply a state of being one goes through?

There is a school of thought that you are simply your memories + the chemical processes of your brain. And identical twins only differ in environmental factors and memory.

Sure, the books canonize the concept of soul and afterlife, which kind of gets away from that. Still, the notion of ones mind being private & if removing ones memories is the equivalent of mental murder is a pretty common one for sci-fi lit. Hell, that is Alfred Bester's wheelhouse.

In any event, I did already admit that the spell makes you lose memories - which is its intended effect. My point is that it's incorrect to say that the spell has other side effects other than short term confusion.

Somehow, I cannot imagine the Iron Lady just sitting around and watching her citizens be killed. The Argentinians tried, and look how that turned out.

And that's a democratic leader. What do people think Stalin, the KGB, Gestapo, Stasi or other secret police would have done? Do children keep disappearing? Torture the information out of their parents, force the children to be agents under the threat of executing their parents.

The magical world would be impossible to hide after ~1937 (Great Purge), at least from certain governments. And from there on, the knowledge would spread. Either Gestapo -> Western Allies or Stasi -> West Germany -> Nato. Possibly even faster if you have defections.

That is different to how canon depicts it. And again, in the Eastern block, you'd have muggleborns and half bloods cooperating with the state, either out of their patriotic mindset or due to threats to their families. And HM's government would also have their share of muggleborns.

Say that 99% of Muggles bitten by a lycanthrope just die. That leaves 1% of people who can spread it, and 99% of those who are dead.

Assuming werewolves targetted the Wizarding World first in order to bolster their numbers, and assuming those werewolves collectively decided it was their imperative to spread the disease and otherwise take over the planet, you're pushing the deadline back a few more months (but not significantly - exponential growth is a motherfucker), while only increasing the mortality rate by a hefty margin.
