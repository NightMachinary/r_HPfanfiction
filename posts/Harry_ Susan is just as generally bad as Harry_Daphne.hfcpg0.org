I know I give Haphne a lot of grief on here because I find those fanfics tedious and generally insufferable. That said, I do not think that is a phenomenon of only Haphne.

I have found there is often a tendency in fanfictions that create a personality of a canon character that barely exists, is that they tend to make characters that aren't particularly unique or interesting. One of the things that canon HP has going for it is that all the major characters have strong interesting personalities and even some of the minor characters.

While Haphne is often one of my main examples of this it is not alone. Susan Bones is often just as bland a character whose main character traits is " use my Aunt( who has also been turned into an annoying character by fanon) to free Sirius " and " I respect the law and I'm a pUrEbLoOd"

The same thing is even done to Fleur on fanfictions. Fleur in canon has a strong personality that is polarizing. Just like the others, although more dramatically and objectional as she does have a personality, by being paired with Indy! Harry she just becomes an arm piece for Harry to list after,show off, and fuck without having anything near an opinion of their own or God forbid a hobby other than being rich and pureblooded.


** I think you're reading some pretty bad stories, but I see from where you're coming.

I don't have read too many Hary/Susan, but the two I have enjoyed had her being a regular teenager with a preference for combat because of her aunt(think of it like a good cop daughter), but that helped Harry because she had experience in leaving the "work" outside the door, thus giving a sense of normalcy he couldn't find elsewhere at the moment. Others had her personality vary, but always with more dimensions than those you've described.

As for Haphne, well, as with any pairing or even premise, your mileage may vary, yes, there are the absurd Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell ones, but I've seen many good ones that went against that notion, in one the Greengrass were farmers, and instead of a politician she was basically a farmer girl who used magic, another had her being a lawyer and another a very closed off girl that was just as introverted as Harry, so it depends on the writer.

As for Fleur, well, again, you're painting all of them with the same brush, you can find some pretty good interpretations, some of them have her being the one who teaches Harry stuff, another as his ticket out of England and to a larger world, and one of my favorites has both of them complementing each other and has Fleur's relationship with Harry making both characters develop quite a bit.

Just to be clear, I don't think it's fair to place the blame on the pairing, the blame is with the writer, you can write good stories with almost any pairing, Harry/Fleur offers quite a few opportunities for worldbuilding even, same to a lesser degree with Daphne and Susan, who can both be characterized as the writer needs it, and even keeping with the fandom perception can be interesting.

The same way as any pairing can be pretty bad too, I tire to see the Harry/Hermione ones where he's devolved to the trophy boyfriend for MarySue!Hermione who needs no one and solves everything by herself, or vice versa for Hermione being reduced to a bullied/lonely girl to be rescued by Knight!Harry, same thing for the often bland and boring Harry/Ginny.

So, yeah, stop blaming the pairing, because of their popularity(because they are different from canon) there are tons of stories made, and as the fanfiction rules state 90% of it is trash.

  Harry is just this eleven-year-old trying to cope when Hagrid shows up. Daphne Greengrass is smart, plain, hardworking and a pureblood witch from a family of very modest means. They aren't rich or prominent among the wizarding social set, but they are full of guile and learn fast. Of course they're underestimated, until it is too late.

That said I can only discuss what I've seen and it seems rather common what I've criticized. I definitely think all of these pairings can be done well.

**** I have a few rules when reading fics to try and avoid the bad ones.

-If Harry gets more than two last names, I am out(and that's just because I can tolerate Potter-Black due to acquired immunity)

-If the goblin powerup gets going for too long(/billions and billions/ of galleons that are never going to be used, more rings than the ones made by Sauron and Celembrimbor, more titles than Queen Victoria), I am out.

-TARDIS trunk? Out.

-Scarcrux removal with a commercially available ritual? Out.

-Super!Wand with three kinds of wood and seven cores? Out.

-Girls start blushing and falling head over heels at a mere glance from Harry? Out very fast.

This keeps me from getting the worse ones, because writers who use these do them right at the beginning to start their total makeover of Harry into their Edgelord SI.

** There is nothing wrong with OC's, whether fully made up or using a underdeveloped name/face from the series.

Now doing so fails differently then fics that use established characters. When established characters are miswritten, they usually seem ooc or off. When OC's are miswritten, they feel misplaced in the greater lore.

** I mean, there's three basic parts to a story - the plot, the setting, and the characters. I would argue that writing characters is by far the most difficult of the three. So, anytime someone in fandom tries to create their own full-OC characters, or even their own interpretations/versions of any character, that's often going to turn out not as well because it's so difficult to do and so difficult for that to show in writing - there's two points of failure, the creation and the demonstration, and both are really, really hard to get right.

I've read some Daphnes and Susans that are really, really interesting characters, but equally I've read some that are dull, cardboard cutout armcandy, like you said. It's not that you can't do great things with them, it's just harder to do, so more people are going to fall short of the relatively high standards that seem prevalent in this fandom these days.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent linkffn(13133746) treats both Ron and Hermione fine.

I Wouldn't Change A Thing: linkffn(12983365) Neither of them get bashed in this, though Hermione is against him Dating Daphne early on.

Butterbeer, Bollocks and Ball linkffn(12673854) treat's Ron with respect as well.

If not for Umbridge linkffn(13566959) Ron and Hermione are friends with her and Tracey in this

To Touch the Stars linkffn(12912621): Daphne is tall, Harry is into it.

Ice Princess linkffn(5864749): Daphne asks Harry for tutoring builds up from there.

for Harry/Susan you have
