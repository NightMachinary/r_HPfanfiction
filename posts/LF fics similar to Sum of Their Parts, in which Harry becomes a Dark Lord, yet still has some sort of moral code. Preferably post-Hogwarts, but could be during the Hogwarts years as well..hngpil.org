#+TITLE: LF fics similar to Sum of Their Parts, in which Harry becomes a Dark Lord, yet still has some sort of moral code. Preferably post-Hogwarts, but could be during the Hogwarts years as well.

** linkffn(Made of Common Clay)

He isn't exactly a dark lord in this one but is very close to one in his methodology. He is quite diabolical, and has a master plan and all that jazz.

This is a genuinely good fic. Definitely give it a try.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth. COMPLETE.

**** I do admit initially it comes out as quite clichéd but trust me once it really gets going, you will have a ton of fun.

It's fucking amazing to watch Harry be this diabolical mastermind who has got a huge plan and is cunning.

It's definitely worth a read, although maybe not a re-read.

  HPDM, mostly preslash. Harry really doesn't like the way things are going in the wizarding world right now. But who's going to do something about it? Him, that's who! Or, how Harry became a Benevolently Snarky Dark Lord. COMPLETE.
