Consider the "Send current mind to past body" trope.

Suppose that as Harry (and possibly & Company) send their minds back in time to avert the Bad Future... Naruto (and possibly & Company) (or other of one's choice) send their minds back in time to avert their Bad Future in the next universe over...

And their rituals, which by sheer chance occured at the same exact point of untime, intersect.

A wiser Naruto, fresh from a losing battle against Kaguya, wakes up in the cupboard the day after Diagon Alley with all of 11-year-old Harry's memories, and Harry, fresh from a Voldemort-run dystopia, wakes up the day after the Mizuki incident with all of Naruto's memories up to that point.

Naruto-in-Harry does not have Kurama (and thus, many of his techniques and strategies are beyond his grasp, but he otherwise (in theory) has access to everything he could do (subject to physical training for some of them)).

Harry-in-Naruto has to learn everything all over again (he has the past-Naruto's memories, but only in the "I remember doing X" sense - he overwrote all the instinctual training-stuff with his own, so he has to relearn ninja-skills from scratch). He has the advantage of having Kurama, and he will be able to scrape together materials for a wand, eventually. He does have the Cloak (but recall that it does not conceal sound or scent), and the ability to see and communicate with ghosts.
