All Magic comes at a cost - for there is Balance in all things. Harry knew this, felt and understood it like any other witch or wizard. But no magics came at a higher cost than those which grant immortality. The Elixir of Life granted the Flamels their immortality, but did nothing to halt the decline of their bodies. The horcruxes prolonged Riddles life, but cost him his sanity. And now, at the age of 17, standing in the Great Hall of Hogwarts - Holly in his right hand, Elder in his left - Harry could not help but ponder at what the cost may be for his own survival...


** Harry's bleary eyes scanned the crowd. The seedy bar's dim lights concealed far more than they revealed. Young faces - so many of them, so open and guileless and happy. When did they all get so /young/?

The energy in the room was surprisingly upbeat for a group of day-drinkers on a Wednesday.

His gaze flicked over to a small calendar set in the corner of the bar, heavily marked with the barman's inscrutable scrawl, tracking whatever it was that barkeeps tracked. He noted the month and day.

Oh.

Right.

/That/ day. /His/ day. Harry-fucking-Potter day.

May 2nd.

Small consolation that he'd gotten the Wizengamot to declare Halloween Lily Evans Potter day and officially change the unofficial "Harry Potter Day" from Halloween to a national holiday on the day he'd actually beaten Voldemort.

That'd explain the crowd in a bar on a Wednesday. That'd explain the endless back-slapping and three-cheers-ing and free-rounds-ing that'd been happening for near on two hours now.

God they were so young. None of this crowd could even have been alive when he'd defeated Voldemort. What they fuck did they care for. They weren't there. They didn't suffer for this. They didn't watch friends tortured. Killed.

They didn't sacrifice anything... they didn't sacrifice /everything/.

Fuck them. Fuck Voldemort.

Fuck Wizarding Britain and how all it does is take and take and take until you've got nothing left and then it reaches down into your chest and rips out your goddamn heart and sure, sure, you came back from the dead. Sure. Sure you did. But immortality has its price doesn't it?

Herpo and Riddle chose the path of insanity and the Flamels chose the path of unending senescence but Harry didn't /get/ to choose did he? Fucking no. The Wizarding world just /took/. Ripped his heart right out of his chest and laughed and cavorted and did a little sing-song to itself in a high child's voice, "the power he knows not! la-la-laaa-de-daa! The power he knows not! Love-de-dum-deee-dum! The power he knows not! Love gone forever....." and the song turned to a flat soulless little girl's voice, "you'll never love again, Harry Potter..." the sweet tinkling tones of the daughter he'd never have, the future he'd never know.

He'd rather face Voldemort a hundred times over than have to re-live that first handful of years after the war. Living with Ginny. Pretending. Going through the motions. Feeling happy and sad and angry and warm safety and everything under the sun but love. Never love. Its close cousins lust and affection may have survived, but they took near-fatal wounds. Sex was flat and lifeless. Quiet cuddling was an irritating chore. But Harry kept on and Ginny tried to love enough for the both of them.

Three years later, and without a single word ever really spoken on the matter, they simply ended things. She swished and flicked her way through packing and shrinking charms and said, "I'm leaving, Harry. I know you won't try, but I have to say this anyway: don't follow me," and all Harry could think now was that those were the first words she'd said to him in over a month.

Why work? Money wasn't a problem, work was boring, and if you literally /couldn't/ love what you did, why bother? Why fly? Wind and movement were as exhilarating as they ever were, but if you couldn't love the sensations, love the escape, then what was the point of any of it?

Ginny's departure ushered in a few dark years. Harry indulged himself in a variety of... pursuits. If he were being totally honest, he did things that made him an even worse monster than Riddle. But he had the decency to do those things out of public view and to avoid recruiting followers into his madness. And so he got away with it. When he finally regained his senses, some time in his late 20's... or was it his late 30's... Harry found there was nothing left.

No friends, no ambitions, no goals. And certainly no loves.

He fell into the path of so many like him. Drinking to try and remember the good times and then drinking some more to forget that there weren't all that many good times and they weren't really all that good anyway.

Wizarding fortitude kept his liver chugging along far longer than he'd expected.

And once a year they slapped his back and bought him drinks and cheered even if they didn't... /couldn't/... really know why.
