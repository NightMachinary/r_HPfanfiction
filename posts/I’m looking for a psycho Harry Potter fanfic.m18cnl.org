** Linkao3(The Good War by inwardtransience) Abused Fem!Harry unlocks her leglimency powers possibly turning her into a sociopath. She has major problems with empathy and communication despite being a literal mind reader. Normal readers will probably find this disturbing/fascinating. In fact just about every one of the author's works have protagonists who would be considered functionally insane by normal standards.

  Despite her best efforts, Elizabeth Potter is repeatedly drawn into situations she wants absolutely nothing to do with. People just refuse to leave her the hell alone.

** linkao3(The Sum Of Their Parts)

Harry becomes a Dark Lord. It's /implied/ that he, Ron and Hermione have something more than friendship but it's never explicitly shown or stated iirc

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
