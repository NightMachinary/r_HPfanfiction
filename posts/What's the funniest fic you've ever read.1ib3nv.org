Be sure to state the pairing (if there is one), and whether its a crackfic or a parody or just funny. :) I'd love to read more humorous stories.

**** From the story description:

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.
#+end_quote

It's nonjon's masterwork: 240k+ words, complete, an adult Harry falls through the Veil, meets up with Sirius in an alternative dimension, and the Lords Black embark on an extended adventure of hilarious debauchery and larceny.

Probably not the funniest, but fairly amusing all the same. Harry goes on holiday and bumbles around.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/1/The-Original-Naked-Quidditch-Match][The Naked Quidditch Match (NSFW?)]] is a classic.

#+begin_quote
  When a Magical game of Truth & Dare goes wrong, the Gryffindor Quidditch team must 'bare' up and face the consequences. And as the news spreads like wildfire in mmail things get quite out of control.

** There is an entire series (by different authors at times if I remember correctly) which falls under the category of "Mr Black".

Harry goes on vacation and uses the name Black to hide. Things happen around him and get attributed to him, lending to the mysterious legend and intrigue of "Mr Black".

He obviously knew we were following him and lured us into the path of that train just as it was crossing the road. We've taken 90% casualties! Regroup! Retreat! Damn you mister black!

What really happened was Harry tripped onto some train tracks, got his shoe stuck, and got unstuck just in time to get out of the way. The death eaters are so intent on killing him that they jump right in front of the train.

I do not remember if this happened exactly, but it is very much that type of story, and incredibly funny/entertaining. Sirius may or may not be along for the ride.... not sure of links other than go check the file section of caerazkaban group on yahoo

** Perhaps not the absolute funniest I've ever read (I've read a lot of fics, it's hard to remember them all), but the first ones that came to mind are:

[[http://mahaliem.livejournal.com/131281.html][Make your penis Huge! by mahaliem]], in which Harry and Draco (aurors) are assigned to a case of a penis cream being marketed to muggles that actually works, and:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][Lessons with Hagrid by NothingPretentious]], in which Harry learns Occlumency from Hagrid (because obviously he's good at it, or Quirrel never would have bothered trying to get him drunk to get Fluffy's weakness out of him).
