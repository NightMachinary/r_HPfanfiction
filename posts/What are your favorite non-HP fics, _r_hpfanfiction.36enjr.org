#+end_quote

Don't forget that there's fanfiction for worm! I've been binging on wormfic for a month and a half, now, so it's /literally/ the only thing that comes to mind when I think of my favorite fanfiction.

Here are my favorites; YMMV:

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/queen-of-the-swarm-worm.323254/][Queen of the Swarm]] (WIP)

In addition to her insect controlling abilities, Taylor also slowly gains the power to create and control Zerg. No knowledge of the crossover needed, although it helps.

[[http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/silencio-a-worm-au.8465/][Silencio]] (Hiatus/Dead?)

Taylor loses her voice due to infection and triggers with OP mime powers.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/copacetic-worm-thread-4.310722/][Copacetic]] (WIP)

Post-canon, Taylor tries to start fresh and become a normal-as-possible college student. It doesn't go as planned.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nursing-a-grudge-worm-au.303236/][Nursing a Grudge]] (WIP)

Things go very differently in the aftermath of Leviathan's attack on Brockton Bay. Features a non-undersider Taylor and a repentant Madison.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/atonement-worm-au.312449/][Atonement]] (WIP)

Taylor dies in the locker; Madison triggers with spiderman-like-powers out of guilt and becomes a hero.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]] (Complete w/ a [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2417525/chapters/5347754][Sequel]]; the sequel is also Complete)

A for-want-of-a-nail fic where Taylor briefly considers joining the Wards. Things Get Worse.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander-thread-four.310497/][A Cloudy Path]] (WIP)

Taylor triggers with access to Aeon technology from the /Supreme Commander/ video games. No knowledge of the crossover needed, although it helps. The best Tinker!Taylor I've ever read.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/reconciliation-worm-au.332729/][Reconciliation]] (WIP)

Danny and Taylor are visiting Kyushu when Leviathan attacks. Danny dies, but Taylor survives and ends up getting adopted by Lung.

--------------

And finally, to go meta,

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/yer-a-witch-taylor-worm-hp.340965/][Yer a Witch, Taylor!]] (WIP)

Taylor triggers as a magic-user, a la Harry Potter. Wand and all.

** Ooh, I mentioned this one recently---[[http://rosa-acicularis.livejournal.com/30916.html][The Anatomist]] (BBC Sherlock). Probably my all-time favorite fic out of any fandom. Better than canon.

#+begin_quote
  James Joseph Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976. His birth certificate no longer exists.

  If it did, it would list his father's name (Dr. Joseph Arthur), his mother's (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne), and his birth weight (2.7kg). It would not tell you that his eyes were blue, or that he entered this world as he will leave it -- howling.

  It would not tell you that five minutes later his mother (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne) gave birth to a daughter, his sister. His twin. The records of her birth burned with his, but if they hadn't, you would know her name.

  Mary Elizabeth Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976.

  They will call her Molly.

*** Since you're the only one ITT who mentioned a Buffy fanfic, I'll post mine as a child-comment to yours.

*[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-3980/Speakertocustomers.htm][Tabula Avatar]]* (~640,000 words; abandoned/slow WiP) is a Buffy / Baldur's Gate crossover, which makes it also into a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse][RPG Mechanics Verse]] story.

I found it after finishing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & the Natural 20]] but still wanting more RPG stories --- and it turned out to be rather good too!

To be fair, the thought of recommending it here crossed my mind several times, but since this was a HPFF-dedicated sub, I didn't.

It does a good job at emulating the original characters from Buffy, and even though I never had any experience with D&D books or games, it managed to describe the D&D universe rather well also.

The story arcs and plot developments were interesting as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8477325/1/Fate-Zero-Requiem][Fate: Zero Requiem]] by Kyugan. Fate/Zero and Code Geass crossover. Lelouch is summoned as the assassin-class servant by Kotomine Kirei in the Fourth Holy Grail War. I don't generally like crossover fics, this is the only one on my favorites list.

** [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]] takes the basic world from Twilight and turns it into something worth reading without an "abuse is romance" moral and without the confusing bits about immortality being wrong or undesirable.

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]] is a self-insert into the DC comics universe wherein the protagonist obtains an orange power ring (attuned to avarice).

Definitely one of the better Twilight fanfictions, that's for certain. That fandom is a difficult one to even find a story that is tolerable, let alone worthy of recommendation (although, I suppose it has potentially improved since my last venture into it, 5 years ago).

#+begin_quote
  Astrid and Hiccup's "romantic flight" comes to an abrupt end when the Red Death follows them out of the nest. Following an unexpected and desperate fight, Astrid finds herself stranded on an island, injured, with a crippled and comatose Hooligan heir and his overprotective Night Fury. She's going to get them home---all three of them---or die trying.

Two other notable stories in the fandom follow the "Hiccup leaves, Astrid assumes the role of his intended, Hiccup returns" storyline, which has become a trope in the fandom:

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10049374/1/Becoming-L%C3%ADf%C3%BErasir][Becoming Lífþrasir]] series by Midoriko-sama. North of half a million words total, two completed novels, a third set of one-shots is WIP.

#+begin_quote
  People often wondered what kept Hiccup going during those early years. When that single, most-treasured thing is taken from him, there is little left to keep him on Berk. The day Stoick returns, and the day before the best recruit is finally chosen, Hiccup leaves Berk; little knowing that he would one day return under ... strange circumstances.
#+end_quote

Another is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10699391/1/Prodigal-Son][Prodigal Son]] by commandocucumber, 150k words, WIP, updated a few days ago.

#+begin_quote
  Eight years after Berk's heir vanished, the Viking town is slowly crumbling. Dragon attacks are more devastating than ever. To save her village Astrid must piece together exactly what happened before the dragons wipe them all out for good. Meanwhile, half a world away and eight years wiser, Hiccup decides it might just be time to go home.
#+end_quote

If you don't mind crossovers (HTTYD/Frozen), R-dude's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10171267/1/A-Chance-Encounter][A Chance Encounter]] is definitely worth checking out, 160k words, WIP, updated a few days ago, written by a DLP author.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9362868/1/And-Light-be-the-Path-to-Home][And Light be the Path to Home]] is a bloody amazing League of Legends fanfiction. Ez/Lux all the way, yo!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614734/1/In-Good-Company][In Good Company]] is a A Song of Ice and Fire I enjoyed a lot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8971041/1/Steal-My-Thunder-God][Steal My Thunder God]] updates very slowly, but its a ridiculously enjoyable Naruto fanfiction where timetraveling Naruto takes Minato's place post the Kyuubi attack.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9948266/1/Team-7-s-Ascension-Blood-Wings][Team 7's Ascension: Blood Wings]] is quite possibly the fic with the best Team 7 dynamics I've ever read. Great read.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/20678][The Ashes of District Twelve Series]], set in the Hunger Games universe. It's three separate stories:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/428730/chapters/722861][The List]] is told from the perspective of Peeta and how he and Katniss grew back together directly after the war. They both are dealing with their mental trauma and I think it does a very good job of keeping Peeta and Katniss in character. Both are reeling from their experiences, but deal with them in different ways. You feel both frustrated with and sympathetic towards the two. The author really explores how dysfunctional their relationship can be, while still reminding you that they do actually care about each other. They try to grow up. It also gives a voice to Peeta, whom previously you've only got to know through Katniss's eyes. Here, the author develops Peeta's story and makes his "epic love," which was sometimes eye-roll worthy in HG, seem realistic and based in rational decision-making.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/428749/chapters/722924][The Good Wife]] shifts back to Katniss's point of view. It jumps firmly into its explicit rating and stays there throughout the progression of the story. What you do get to see, other than rather scandalous scenes of intimacy, is Katniss figuring out how not to have a stick up her butt. She struggles through her depression by giving herself something to live for: her marriage. Lengthy appearances from Gale and Johanna help drive the plot and we see how Peeta and Katniss went from two hurt, unhappy teenagers that were clinging to each other to a married team that lived through some truly happy experiences, such as the birth and growing up of their kids, keeping their haunting past in the past.

Finally, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/428778/chapters/722992][The Grandmentor]], shifts backwards in the timeline to when Katniss and Peeta have their first children, but it is written from Haymitch's point of view. It is an excellent character study of HG's favorite drunk. The author spins a believable and entirely upsetting back story for Haymitch, and makes you truly sympathetic to why he is the way he is. Throughout the story, Haymitch does his best to act as an uncle/friend/caregiver/godfather/grandmentor to the children of Katniss and Peeta and develops a close relationship with the precious and loving little girl. Fearful of exposing her to his many troubles, he struggles to be a role model that he is woefully unqualified to be. Through it all, though, the broken group of war heroes of Haymitch, Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Johanna, and even Effie, are able to achieve what they fought for each day in HG, the freedom to live.

This List is rated T(for teen) and is 32,458 words. The Good Wife is rated E (for explicit) and clocks in at 57,623 words. The Grandmentor is rated M (for mature) and rounds out the series at 57,502 words.

The series is complete, penned by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/silvercistern/pseuds/silvercistern][silvercistern]], and was finished in October of 2012.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6555315/1/Leaves-of-Grass][Leaves of Grass]] is a Twilight fanfiction, but bear with me because it's worth reading. Essentially, Bella second-guesses getting back together with Edward at the end of New Moon because he is so controlling and, in a nap, ends up being taken to 1862 Texas where she meets Jasper as a human, and essentially she learns how relationships ought to be, as opposed to her abusive relationship with Edward.

It's one of my favorite fanfictions in any fandom because of how skillfully the author fixes the Twilight series while keeping the interesting character backstories in place. It also has a very well-researched depiction of the US Civil War.

** Let me take a minute to gush over how amazing lorata's District 2 verse is. It takes everything you know about the hunger games and twist and tilts it till it make since. In particular I absolutely love [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940767/chapters/1833804][Sugar and Spice and Everything Nice]] which has amazing character development and flawed people and it's amazing. Sumary: She dreams about the Centre. In her dreams it's a big white building, huge and shiny, and everyone inside is beautiful but sharp around the edges and there are no dresses anywhere and nobody tells Madeline she's not behaving like a good little girl.

Before she was Lyme, she was Madeline, an angry little girl who needed to learn to fight.

Part of my exploration of victors before they were victors, and how the Centre works to make its killers.

If the themes aren't your cup of tea then the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/728148/chapters/1351986][The Devil You Know]] is also absolutely fantastic. Summary: It's a question that the other districts cannot even begin to fathom -- a question that simmered in the hearts of the citizens of Two as the fire crept across the nation, and boils even now as a new country struggles to rise from the ashes and bones of the fallen -- a question they don't consider because they're too busy not-asking why District Two never took a stand with the rebels --

The question is:

Why should they have?

Why District 2 stood alone against the Rebellion.

** Let me take another minute to tell you how much I remember loving reading Stargate: Atlantis fanfic.

Stand out favorites that I loved loved loved after being in the fandom for over 3+ years are:

[[http://www.icarus.slashcity.net/stories/outofbounds.html][Out of Bounds]] awesome figure staking AU that requires no fandom context except that Rodney is brilliant and brash and John is lanky and laconic.

[[http://synecdochic.dreamwidth.org/59305.html][Freedom's Just Another Word For Nothing Left To Lose]] by synecdochic. Ugh, this might just be my favorite fic I have ever read. It is endlessly re-readable and I can't say anything about it without spoiling it.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/748491][Crimes Against Humanity]] by seperis. Summary: Atlantis was a neutral colony before it became a prison camp. Even Alcatraz is escapable.

Read this during the daytime. I'm serious this fic is the grusome 4-car pileup that you just can't look away from. Talk about taking a fandom and exploring one little twist which just makes everything explode.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/330115][A Beautiful Lifetime Event]] by astolat. Summary: Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.

Mpreg without the mpreg, and it totally works.

[[http://rheanna27.livejournal.com/68371.html][Theory of Everything]] by rheanna27. SUmmary: "Maybe it's just regular, good old fashioned burnout," John suggested, although he knew in his heart he was clutching at straws. "Maybe all you need is a vacation."
