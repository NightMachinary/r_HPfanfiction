I'm looking for a fic where Harry, who doesn't know anything about magic before the letter, doesn't want to go to Hogwarts at first. Preferably he isn't raised by the Dursleys either, but I don't care much there.

EDIT: I do want Harry to end up going to Hogwarts, though. I just want him to be a bit opposed to the idea of magic at first.

** I did come up with an idea a bit like this once; the idea that with loving doting Dursleys, Harry grows up quite a bit more sheltered, and is too nervous about leaving them to go to Hogwarts. He ends up being tutored in magic at home for his first year, before going to Hogwarts proper for his second.

I never did get around to writing it, though. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5qr66a/lf_fics_where_harry_doesnt_start_hogwarts_at_11/dd1px5i/?context=3][I voiced it here.]]

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** In linkffn(Harry Potter: Kidnapped by kb0) he runs away from the Dursleys when he is quite young and lives with some college students until he is found by Dumbledore (I think he is about 16 at that point). After that he still manages to escape Dumbledore for two or three times

  Harry decided growing up “on the street” was better than at the Dursleys and ran away as a child, becoming lost to the Wizarding world. He was very happy with his life until accidentally found by Albus Dumbledore... No real pairing
