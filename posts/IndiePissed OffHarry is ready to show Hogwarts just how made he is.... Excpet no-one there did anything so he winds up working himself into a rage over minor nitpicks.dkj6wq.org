** Okay so I'd have Harry just being resentful at all that magic cost him. A power hungry dark wizard took his parents from him since there's that. Another powerful wizard dropped him off with family members who despise all things magic and he just so happens to be magical so he resents Dumbledore and thinks he probably would've been treated better by his family if he never had magic. I'd also have him be resentful at the magical community for putting him on such a high pedestal and celebrating the defeat of Voldemort on the same day that's he thinks is a day of mourning as his parents died on that same day.

** There is this Indy Harry fic where Harry starts screaming at Dumbledore. He listens politely (and we read his funny thoughts) and secretly he summons Minerva who gives Harry the scolding of his life and than he is send to bed.
