Mostly because of the crazy quantities involved. You can wave your wand and vanish the CO2 from an entire hall, but that's just 0.000000000001% of the problem. Or you could conjure a massive iceberg to cool down the oceans, but again that's only 0.1 seconds worth of climate change. (Yes, I calculated that.)


** Dedalus Diggle conjures shooting stars for fun. I think you may be underestimating the scale HP magic is capable of working at.

But ultimately I think looking at it from the angle of scale of the physical quantities involved is the wrong approach. If wizards decided to tackle climate change, it's unlikely that they would choose a solution which works by tipping the balance of the physical mechanisms in play. That's Muggle thinking, not wizarding thinking.

Much more likely is that they would devise a form of magic which directly brings the end result they desire into being. This is generally how HP magic works. Spells are defined teleologically (i.e. by the end result they create), not mechanistically (i.e. by the means they use to create that result). It's the Killing Curse, not the [Insert Means of Death Here] Curse. It's the Summoning Charm, not the Directional Thrust Charm. Etc.

So I can see wizards just getting together to create a global enchantment, or a set of national enchantments, which give wizards direct control over the weather/climate such that they can set the temperature. Like a global/national thermostat. You turn the dial, and the temperature just changes, completely ignoring whatever the temperature "should" be according to physical law.

We know that it's possible to create enchantments at the national scale (e.g. Taboo) and we know that it's possible to manipulate the climate with magic (e.g. Drought Charm), so it's just going to be a matter of combining the two. Unlikely to be easy, but if the global wizarding population are working to achieve it, it doesn't seem outside the realm of their capabilities.

*** Good point. I do wonder if the direct way of doing it is always better or if there's situations where the indirect "muggle" approach might be preferable.

For example, if you're enchanting a broom and the enchantment is supposed to create velocity, then you'd probably have a top speed proportional to how good the quality of the enchantment is, like 150 mph for a firebolt and significantly less for most other brooms.

If an enchantment was added that created acceleration, then that broom might have significant handling problems and other downsides but it may be possible to reach practically arbitrarily high speed. Like 10%c after a few months on an unmanned remotely controlled one. That'd also have kinetic energy similar to a nuke so a creative wizard could have almost untraceable, fallout-free city killers.

A combination of both might be the best.

On the topic of climate, it depends on how difficult the weather modification magic is times the size of the earth (very large!) compared to how difficult it'd be to remove CO2 large scale times human CO2 emissions (a lot!). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, the direct one offers more control but also requires a lot of micromanagement especially if your goal is to ensure that muggle weather scientists don't notice anything.

Removing CO2 requires less management and might be more easily explainable as "I guess forests are just better at soaking up carbon than expected, but it might not last, so hurry up with the Teslas" but it also doesn't allow wizards to control their weather however they want.

As you note in your final paragraph, if wizards want to maintain secrecy they need to avoid using magic in a way that would make it obvious to Muggles that something unnatural is occurring. So I think an enchantment of the type described by my post would be very much a last resort type thing - wizards are only going to abandon the statute under very extreme circumstances.

And even then, I can see there being a significant faction of wizards arguing that wizards should just enchant wizarding spaces to be safe, leave the Muggles to their own fate, and then fix the world /after/ Muggle civilisation has collapsed by their own hands. Wizards could probably even restore extinct species using transfiguration.

Probably the best way to do it subtly would be to create some kind of magical algae that reproduces rapidly and eats tons of CO2.

***** Magic algae sound great. Probably the best approach to get the massive scale necessary with the very limited manpower of the quite small wizarding world. Although unless you cover a significant part of the oceans in muggle repelling charms it's practically guaranteed that some of these algae will end up under a biologists microscope, so they shouldn't be too blatantly modified. Maybe normal algae treated with growth potions?

***** Not really? I just love the story and like to link it whenever it is relevant. Really, we need more like this to off-set the ridiculous number of muggle-wank we see around.

Edit: I thought you were the one to send the original comment and didn't think much of it, just took the time to look at the complete post to see what you were talking about and saw the original comment again... this is kind of awkward, but I stand by what I said, the story is great and I really love it, so thanks.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

*** Would still require filtering absolutely insane amounts. Maybe if somehow part of the diamonds were used in sacrificial rituals to enhance the power of the enchantment, creating an exponential loop, that might work. Would still require hundreds of thousands of units which means figuring out how to make the depolluters on an assembly line but perhaps doable.

** This really depends on the exact mechanics of enchantments and such. If it is possible to permanently enchant objects, then it would be possible, over the course of many years to create many thousands of enchanted co2 conversion nodes.

If enchantments require a source of magical energy in order to last, such as leylines, then it would be far more difficult.

** Pollution and trash is talked about in Mischief's Heir, and the final solution is... understandable.

Standard warnings for this fic are: this starts off as over the top crack, complete with over the top bashing. It does settle down by part two of the series, and ends up being a really fun romp for the rest. The tone in part one is not what you'll see in the rest of the series.

It's technically a crossover with the MCU and comics, but whatever you learned via osmosis is good enough if you never watched them. Very minor crossover. linkao3(4629198)
