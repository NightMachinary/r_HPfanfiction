Are there ANY fics where Canon Harry meets an alternate dimension Harry and they just compare their lives and experiences. No character bashing. No Hadrians. No super special abilities. Just different backgrounds, different friends, different decisions, etc.

World in Pieces came closest except that Harry was very dead and it was more of an Outsider POV of comparisons but still similar to what I've been looking for.

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

** He runs into various versions of himself while dimension hopping in [[http://slashcity.org/rushlight/hp/pendulum.htm][The Pendulum of Choice]] by Rushlight. Note that several of the Harrys are in slash relationships. Strictly speaking, none of the Harrys are fully canon, as the story was written before the series was complete.

*** That story was a wild ride from start to finish. Had a lot of early 2000's slash style but holy shit. The world building goddamn. I would read a whole story of a Dark Lord Harry and Canon Harry squaring off. The world building and ideas were so fascinating. I had visceral flashbacks to me reading slash in middle school though. I actually couldn't put it down even with that.

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know.\\
  Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group... WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
