** It's Lavender! Lavender doesn't get enough love. She's crying in the bathroom because she got into a fight with Parvati (that's the gryffindor twin, right?) or something. She's alright at magic and at school in general, and has lived a decent upper-middle class lifestyle as a pureblood, though not a pureblood from any famous family. Let's say her family's not blood traitors like Ron's, but are socially liberal about muggleborns in a rich person way. She fills Hermione's place pretty well because whereas in the first book Hermione was a voice of caution/reason because she followed rules and had book smarts, Lavender is a voice of caution/reason because she's rightly afraid of three-headed dogs and has a pureblood education and social smarts.

About social smarts-- Lavender, the way I picture her in this AU, isn't like a fanon Slytherin character where she was raised for politicking and "makes alliances" and "networks" with intention. I figure she's more like a real-life sociable teenager/tween. She talks to a lot of people and has a lot of friends but not very many close ones except for Ron and Harry. Maybe she finds out about Nicholas Flamel because an older student is doing a research project on him for their Potions or History of Magic class or something. I can't imagine he's a very obscure historical figure. Hermione and Harry didn't know about him because they were raised Muggle, and Ron didn't know because he's not very academic, and is also eleven.

I think having Lavender as a member of the Trio would be really interesting for interpersonal conflicts and to help us get to know the rest of the student body a little better. I can imagine her being in conflict with Harry and Ron for similar reasons to Hermione-- they're improper/slobs/boyish/unsociable in her eyes-- but also can see her getting into conflict with Harry because she loves fame and attention and he doesn't. She might be confused as to why he's rejecting the spotlight (much like Lockhart in book two), and might bond with Ron over envy towards Harry. She might grow to realize that not everyone loves attention and could later help Harry by drawing the attention to herself whenever he's uncomfortable with so many eyes on him. She might also give him some of the physical affection he never got with the Dursleys, just hugs and stuff that girls are more casual with than guys. This would be part of her reason for being in Gryffindor: she's unafraid of the spotlight. She might have a character arc about learning not to put so much stock in societal expectations, but she would still keep her femininity, her love of makeup, clothes, and gossip, and so on. That's just who she is!

I think it would be a good idea to keep the subplot where she dates Ron. It would be a lot bigger of a thing since they would be close friends already, and it would hurt them both a lot more when it broke up, but I like the idea in canon of it being an immature relationship that eventually fails. It could make their friendships with Harry and each other pretty awkward, but learning to get past that and still be friends would be an interesting development in their relationships. It might happen earlier, in fourth or fifth year, as they both discover their sexuality and so on. I don't know, I just like Lavender and the more I think about it the more I feel like she would be really good friends with Harry and Ron!

*** Lavender would be a good option for an author who is comfortable using divination more, someone who is superstitious but with folklore to back them up.

Lavender might also help bolster Harry, getting him to open up more and brood less, we could see a friendlier and more sociable Harry. Lavander seems like someone who is optimistic, and that can work well with Harry and Ron's dark humor, to help brighten the mood instead of just letting them be snitty and sarcastic.

I think Ron and Lavender could have either still dated, or having known Ron for longer, and more intimately maybe Lavender would realize that he's not really the kind of guy who would like her over exuberance in the end, but can tolerate it from a friend.

**** Yeah, I like the idea of divination working somewhat reliably, at least on a small scale, but it seems like it could get overpowered really quickly. Maybe a small talent in divination from Lavender would help her fill Hermione's role of 'the knowledgeable one' better, though! Divination really does fit with her personality, so I'd hate to see it go from the story entirely. And though I can't really imagine exactly how it would go, I do think her effect on Harry's and Ron's personalities (and theirs on hers) would be cool to see.

  It's pretty interesting, and would also change the Gryffindor house as a whole.

  For example, canon Lavender is best friend with Parvati, what happens if she is with Ron and Harry? Parvati becomes closer to Hermione? And maybe her sister for the whole studious thing?

  For the relation sub plot, could be interesting but the begining may need to change. Canon Ron kissed Lavender in a moment of glory, but also because of what Ginny said about never kissing a girl. I can see him do it to a "random" girl, but not to his best friend/ member of the trio. If it was the case, the break up (if it happens) would be way harder, putting the whole friendship in danger.

**** Yeah, maybe the fight with Parvati that got Lavender crying in the bathroom during the troll attack was because Lavender was bullying/excluding Hermione and Parvati wasn't having it? I think Parvati and Hermione as friends could be really interesting! They have some things in common. I kind of saw Lavender as being still friends with Parvati and others but only casually, but I can see them being hostile/distant towards each other, too.

For the romance, maybe it's Lavender who kisses Ron? I see one of her flaws being recklessness-- she's a Gryffindor, after all, and she's not really afraid of social risks. Since Lavender's partially a blank slate, I think she could be characterized to believably do something like that, especially if there's a buildup of them awkwardly flirting with each other and having romantic tension.

Alternatively, the "random" girl Ron kisses and temporarily dates could be Hermione (he doesn't know her so well in this AU). I don't know if she'd be up for it, though, and she might already be with Viktor Krum at that point!

***** In that case, maybe Parvati? She doesn't have the "history" Ron would have with Hermione or a rival like Krum. Also, in this scenario Harry would probably not have gone with Parvati to the Christmas Ball, Ron taking Padma so probably a plus (and even if he did, probably a better date without the jalousy brooding he did in Canon).

****** That might work! They never had chemistry in canon, but you could write it so that they do. I mean, there's such a small cast of characters to choose from (there are only three mentioned Gryffindor girls in Ron's year, right?). There's not a lot of freedom to stray from canon. But this is fanfic! You could really pick anyone as his date, older, younger, or from another house, as long as it's not too unfeasible. Heh, maybe Romilda Vane! He could have the fling with Dean, Seamus, or a guy from another house/year, too, if you feel like making him bi. And OCs are always an option.

** Not an easy question. People tend to overestimate Hermione, as is already happening in this thread. A lot of the fanon view on her character is shaped by the last two books, which took away a lot of Harry's initiative leaving him only to act of other's(often Hermione's) direction.

This question really requires not just discussing the characters but also their place within the narrative. Hermione is the one who knows things and reads things. This is who she is as a character but also how she's used by the author. Which means without her other things would have to happen. Harry and Ron would have to do some of the leg work, which isn't interesting story telling. "Ron and Harry spent the afternoon reading quietly." doesn't make for a good book. Much better to have someone to drop the knowledge bomb so Harry can get to work.

So if I were replacing Hermione I'd definitely pick someone older, 2-3 years. None of the characters we know fit the bill so it'd be an OC. I wouldn't make them the 'trio' like in canon, rather just good friends but that don't spend all their time as a group.

Having someone older and more learned, but still in their confidence would fulfill the Hermione shaped plot device, but still give the stage to Harry and Ron to get shit done. The change to canon would be that Harry is never diminished from the plucky hero role.

** An interesting idea but pretty hard to put in place.

First of all, you need Ron and Harry to save this person, Hermione had to be saved because she was crying alone (because of something Ron said), and they went to save here because of remorse and chivalry.

​

As for what it would change, well they would struggle a lot. Hermione does have a big role in the serie, mainly to explain the plot.Like I really like Neville and would love to see him having a bigger role, but while a Neville can help to identify and pass the Devil Snare in the 1st book, or even identify the philosophal Stone (maybe by asking his grandma), I don't see him (or Harry), passing Snape test.I also like the potential implications in the book 2. Like was Hermione attacked just because she was a Muggleborn, or was a part of the attack due the the fact she found the monster was a basilisk. If it's the case, a Pureblood friend (or at least a non Muggleborn one) attacked would make the situation even scarier, the pureblood understanding even them are not safe.

​

PS: Really improbable without making both very OOC. But I would love to see a friend! Draco attacked because he found the monster and Lucius losing his shit after learning about it.

** I don't like this idea (I am usually roughly pro-canon), but I would really like to see something better for Lavender. As much as everybody raves how pro-feminist Hermione is, most Rowling's girls are the most stereotypical ones possible, sometimes really hard to swallow. Ginny is one glorious example (whose only purpose of being is to be a future wife for Harry), but Lavender and Paravati are other. Given they girls, of course they are stupid, of course they fall for Divination, and of course, they don't talk about anything else than boys and clothes. Yes, she was in DA (even in the second DA under Carrows), and yes she was the only girl aside from Hermione who fought Blast-Ended Skrewts in the December of their fourth year, but nothing serious.

​

I very much prefer [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Search&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreators%5D=northumbrian&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=Lavender+Brown&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=_score&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=desc][Lavender from the fanfictions of Northumbrian]], where is very girlish girl, but also smart, courageous, and yes, she is also a werewolf (not because of The Battle, but read linkao3(1857084)). Gossip is almost the same as espionage, if you think about it. (And yes Northumbrian's Ginny is also a way better than in canon).

** I like this idea as a good clean way to diverge from canon, if that's your desire.

For me, to do thia right, you'd have to go one step back and give a reason for why someone other than Hermione was caught out alone that night. Like, instead of levitating his feather did Ron shoot it across the room and jab someone in the eye, thus a needed trip to the hospital wing. Or did Harry set someone's robes alight, necessitating a last minute change of clothes?

Then you could literally sub anyone in. A Ravenclaw NPC if you want to keep a pseudo-genius thing going for the third member. But maybe twist it to a cold emotionless logic so the group are more calculating. Maybe leads to them seeing through the Sirius at the Ministry ploy and keeping him alive...

Or use it as an easy transition to promote your favourite Harry love interest and give our boy some sugar.

I think whatever is done, it needs to chamge the way the group thinks and responds to all the challenges put in front of them for the remainder of the series though. A strong personality to guide the pair in a completely new direction could be great fun.

*** [[/u/target03][u/target03]] has it absulutely nailed. Work out what your PP is like (canon doesn't say that much so you got leeway). Then see how her strengths contriute to the trio and how her weakness cause problems as the three navigate your plot.

Though because she's in a different house, the interaction between the three is much more lmited. A twist would be that she wants to keep in with Malfoy, so her friendship with H & R is kept secret. Trouble is, that limits their interaction even more so it turns into a duo-plus-one, rather than a trio.
