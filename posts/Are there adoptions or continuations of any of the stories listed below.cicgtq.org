I tried looking but i'm horrible at navigating/finding stuff on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] or AO3

Or anything similar to any of these fics?

- Harry Potter and the Veela - Z-bond
- I'm Still Here - Kathryn518
- Knowledge is Power - Defenstratable
- Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived - The Santi
- Sacrificial Second Chance - NaruAndHarrHaremFan
- Deprived - The Crimson Lord
- Rogue's Bet - Hufflepunk

Thanks in advance!!!!


** One thing I know for sure is that "I'm still here" isn't abandoned, they(its a duo, ish) just take a while to write the chapters, and they update all of their stories roughly the same time, and they're usually massive. There's a pretty similar story, if you wanna scratch that itch, called From Ruin by GraeFoxx, both on Ao3 and FFN. It diverges quickly, but pretty much the same premise.

I also know that HP and the BWL from Santi has more chapters that weren't published on FFN, and they are on DLP forums, though uneditted. Never read them myself, because I don't know how to navigate in that forum.

Everything else I only know its abandoned, and no idea if someone adopted. Sorry.

  Mercenary, bounty hunter, assassin, and now apparently a bodyguard. That means having to go back to a place and deal with things I don't want to. WBWL story. Pairings as of yet are undecided, might not be any written. It's kind of a slow burn.
