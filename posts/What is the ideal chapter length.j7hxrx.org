I'm personally a 3.5k kind of author with the occasional long chapter based on story breaks. I never climb above 6k.

Thoughts?

** Personally, I look for a minimum of 2k words per chapter. More is fine, but less tends to create pacing problems, I think, where there's just not enough that's happened to make the chapter feel worthwhile.

**** There's one author on AO3 (not in the HP fandom) who writes insanely prolifically, sometimes several chapters per day, but each chapter is in the neighborhood of 1k words and it's just unsatisfying IMO for them to be so...bite-sized. It's like, here's a brief setup. Now a conversation. Next steps and foreshadowing. End chapter. I need more than that.

** There's no real answer to this, but most people have a lower limit of 2k and an upper limit of 20k. I prefer reading chapters between 3k-10k. 15k is pushing it for me unless the author updates sporadically. There's no bigger turnoff than seeing a 50 chapter fic with something like 40k words, or a 10 chapter fic with 250k words.

For writing it's usually 3.5k<x<8k.

** I do think it's something that depends on the type of story, how much information happens per scene, how descriptive the writing, how dense the writing, whether there's a lot of dialogue, and pacing.

admittedly I never count words, I just break it up in the best way I can so that it's not too much or not enough

*** I write prolifically so I tend to break things up strangely if I don't have a general guideline for words. But I do agree that pacing plays a big role. Nothing worse than ending a chapter in a middle of a fight scene.

***** The good cliffhangers are the sort of one where the protagonist suddenly realises an issue/allusion is made to the fact that all is not well/right at the beginning of a fight scene (ex. “the final battle had begun”). This provides some sense of completion to the chapter (you're not finishing it in the middle of a conflict) but still leaves the reader with plenty of unanswered questions.

** I don't bother reading fics with an average of under 2k, but I prefer at least 4-5k. I'm more lenient with completed fics, but it's always a bit disappointing to see that a fic you like has updated, but then the update turns out to be one short 1k word scene where nothing much happens.

It's always a pleasant surprise to see a 15k word chapter drop, but that can also be a bit much to handle at once. I think I'd generally prefer shorter chapters more frequently.

So I think the ideal chapter length for me as a reader is somewhere around 4-8k words.

** I don't think that there is a word count that is ideal. It depends on the chapter and the story it tells. A chapter has, in the best case, his own little story to tell. Sometimes that needs only 1.5k words, sometimes it needs 5k.

But there is such a thing as too long or too short. For example - I don't read stories that have only chapters with 1k or less words each and I hesitate to read stories with chapters over 15k per chapter. Both have nearly always problems with pacing.

** It does depend on how often you update. Shorter word counts are manageable if you're updating weekly or close to. But if you're updating one a month or every other month, then I'd say upwards of 10k would be more suitable, as it gives your readers more substance to think about while they wait. I'd also never want to dictate how someone writes their story, but I do think writers who try and get out 20k+ chapters but only update once a year (or even longer than that), need to narrow their scope a bit. I feel like you are likely to get writers block that way, by trying to have such massive chapter updates.

** I think you're right in the sweet spot. Fewer than a couple thousand can work when it's a series of drabbles i.e. Fair Lady. On the other hand, if I have to plan my whole day around reading your chapter, you've gone too far.

** The most important thing is that each chapter should have its own narrative arc, which usually rules out anything under 2-3k at the minimum for novel-length fiction (what I'm assuming you're writing). 4-5k is fairly average for this sort of writing, in general the genre wants to keep a pretty fast pace and stay engaging which encourages shorter chapters.

If you're trying to work on pacing I'd recommend trying to find a published story which has the style you're aiming for and then getting the word count of each chapter (if you have an ebook file you can use that, otherwise you can estimate with page count) and using that as a rough guide. For reference, most of Rowling's chapters in the HP series are between 4-7k, with a smallest count of 2k and greatest of 9k.

** It just have to be consistent. Not necessarily on a timeframe although that is really nice. But if an author I'm following suddenly delivers a extremely short chapter, then I feel like something is wrong.

We have all experienced that one writer putting out a chapter a week, that you can easily read while commuting to work by public transportation... or that person who write novel quality chapters every 1-2 months, that requires you to sit down and spend more than a half hour to read.

The type of story do play a big role, but too short chapters is still really annoying. You just start to get pulled in by the story, and then it ends without any real action or storytelling.

** Oh, I've averaged at least 4k-5k recently but my minimum is 3.5k. My longest chapter was 7k if I recall correctly. I don't like chapters that are below 2k words because they seem short but I don't mind them if they're sandwiched between chapters that are at least 3k-4k words on average. I've also read fics with chapters that have a minimum of 10k words and half the time I find it tedious if I'm reading a complete fic in a 5-10 hour timespan and half the time I prefer them if the author is sporadic in their posting. It gives me something to spend a little time on with some plot development before I move onto something else.
