What are your favorite post-Deathly Hallows and/or Next Generation fics? I tend to gravitate towards canon-compliant (or mostly canon-compliant), but I'm open to anything.


** Chaptered fics:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/252249][War Is Over]] linkao3(252249) and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/369727][Inter Arma...]] linkao3(369727) - gen with background canon pairings, the first is set right after the war, the second 20 years after that
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] linkffn(11317075) and it sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12787674/1/Some-Cuts-Leave-Scars][Some Cuts Leave Scars]] linkffn(12787674) - Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, more focused on emotional healing than the other fics
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] linkao3(6701647) - gen with background canon pairings, set when the trio is in their 60s
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344421][The Theia Higglesworth Trilogy]], starting with linkao3(13215861) - Harry/Ginny, murder mystery, has a prominent OC
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] linkao3(1623053) - Harry/Ginny, from the POV of an OC
- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time]] series, starting with linkao3(538465) - Albus/Scorpius, /Cursed Child/ compliant

Oneshots:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/245007][Lost among Our Winnings]] linkao3(245007) - Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3366683][the war is over and we are beginning.]] linkao3(3366683) - Andromeda-centric, gen with background canon pairings
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/431269][Saturdays are for Football (The Rest of the Week is for Everything Else)]] linkao3(431269) - focused on Blaise and Dean, gen
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]] linkao3(15275916) - trio-centric, gen, involves de-aging

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

  How do Harry and his friends cope after the Battle of Hogwarts? What becomes of Teddy Lupin, the orphaned godson of Harry Potter? This is my version of what could have happened after the final chapter of Deathly Hallows, covering the 19-year gap that there is between then and the epilogue. There will be love, hurt, weddings, angst, and drama. I hope you enjoy my story.
