*** It's incredibly different. A spoiler: I negated the entirety of the last 20 or so chapters because I was so incredibly disappointed with the ending, and this is going to turn into a Massively Multiplayer Crossover fic where we end up traipsing through the multiverse and going to different "worlds" from other books and videogames and such.

Also, people love to hate things. It's only about 11 pages long, why not take a look and explain to me why it's terrible? I /really/ want this thing torn to shreds.

Also also, I /love/ HPMOR and I think Eliezer Yudkowsky is a brilliant man who has many correct thoughts, but I still think the story has some major flaws, and that Yudkowsky is noticeably arrogant, and I have problems with certain aspects of his personal philosophy, and this fic will reflect that.

For the record, I glanced over your work and saw loads of purple prose, awkward dialogue with over-use of names, soppy shipping and above all, the very thing that people were trying to point out to you - the concept itself is not going to appeal to people here. You already accept that it's not a popular fix in this community, so why would we want to read this?

And yeah, that was kinda deliberate. Your usage disagrees with TV Tropes' definition (using descriptive words and talking about emotions doesn't automatically make something "purple prose"), but if that's what you call "purple prose" then chapter 122 of HPMOR ends with a bit of it.

Also, near the end of HPMOR, Voldemort murdered Hermione and because of complicated reasons was forced to bring her back to life and he also imbued her with the essence of a troll and of a unicorn and then made a horcrux for her. Her "aura" is a legitimate physical thing resulting from being imbued with the essence of a unicorn, it's not flowery description.

Harry already knows about the Robber's Cave experiment and the Milgram experiment, it's bad literary form for him to think to himself about things he's already aware of.

**** The author for a time would ask for donations to a non profit in order to post more chapters/faster. He also happened to work at this non profit. In effect, he was asking for direct money in order to release his fanfiction.

The HP fanfiction world only exists at the pleasure of JKR and companies like Warner Bros that own certain rights to it. Sure it would exist if the owners of the source material tried to crack down, but certainly not as it does now. It would be far smaller and not on popular websites like FFN.

If rights holders got wind of someone actively charging people to write his fanfiction, that he was in effect seeking a profit, they could very well come down hard upon the whole fandom.

JKR has specifically said she approves of fanfiction as long as it's not for profit for example, if she got pissed about that sort of thing, she could personally destroy the mainstream HPFF community.

If you think I'm being over dramatic. You can remember Anne Mccaffrey, who single handedly kept FF of her works off mainstream sites like FF.net for /years/, and have only allowed it recently. You think JKR or some head at Warner Bros couldn't do that?

I suppose, then, that Warner Bros. certainly has the resources for it. The, err, most likely scenario would be that fic being made a public example of - the authors real name was there, after all. I would think that there are too many HPFF fans to ruin the thing completely and, even if JK got it in her head to do so, I'm fairly certain that would remove a large part of the community from her dominion - even if only during the intermittent period where a site was set up via owl post and enchanted paper spelled for certain individuals to read.

It is arrogant to say that your writing is technically perfect. It is highly unlikely that this is the case unless you have been professionally edited.

It is immature and the sign of an inexperienced writer to argue when people give you feedback, even if you disagree. This is something I myself have struggled with in the past (some people here will remember my Great Veritaserum Debate) but it's something that you must learn and stick with even when it hurts, especially if you have requested harsh critique.

It is unreasonable to say that you want line by line deconstruction of your fic when you have not accepted any criticism given to you. You can't say that you want it torn to shreds and then aggressively demand evidence/deny criticism given to you.

The one example I can see of you accepting critique, you give an excuse about being tired and it not being a final draft, then say obviously that nonsense won't be in the final draft. This is rude and unreasonable. We don't know that it is a draft, you have published it. You asked for a line by line deconstruction, we don't want to hear all your excuses and condescending "well OBVIOUSLY" responses. Just say thank you for the feedback and make the changes or move on.

It is completely rude to call people stupid when you are also asking them to put a lot of time and effort into helping you. It is childish to come up with cringey little nicknames, to accuse people of psychological abuse, and to accuse people of lying or being trolls when you disagree with their opinion.

It is bizarre and unreasonable to expect people who hate a work to have read all 122 chapters and then read a sequel, even if you do insist it's different (which I saw no evidence of).

Edit: ooh, almost forgot, it is completely fucking HILARIOUS that you got into an argument about who was the oldest. I shouldn't have to explain why that is childish.

It's really not that difficult. I read through /The Moon and the Sea/ and a bit of /The Colour of Everything./ Whether you're aware of the technical name for "the pattern" or not, your writing still conforms to "the pattern."

We've had this argument several times. When someone says "I'm not going to bother looking at your work, but that's not going to stop me from explaining to you why it probably sucks," that might /technically/ be a form of feedback, but it /certainly/ isn't worthy of the word "critique."

That wasn't an excuse, it was an explanation. In retrospect, I should've left the chapter as it was until I could finish it, but I added more than 500 words in that session and I wasn't sure at that point what was published and what wasn't and I erred on the side of making sure the plot was clear.

** Didn't like the switch to "H:" and "Q:" at the end. I felt like I didn't understand where (or perhaps when) the characters were. Quirrell saying things like "utility function" casually seemed out of character without some explanation or gloating about why he knows that.

#+begin_quote
  You're trying to ape Yudkowsky...
#+end_quote

Yes, I'm purposefully bending my own style for the first few chapters in an attempt to emulate his style so it flows naturally from the end of his story into the beginning of mine.

#+begin_quote
  complete with the ham-fisted attempts to write "intelligent" characters
#+end_quote

Where?

#+begin_quote
  the intentional (and unnecessary) verbosity
#+end_quote

Yep. That's a characteristic of the dialogue and the prose from HPMOR, and I'm retaining it in both for the first few chapters (though I'm abandoning it in the prose for the remainder of the book).

#+begin_quote
  the namedropping of "complex" ideas

I have access to a stats page on FF dot net, and neither my "visitors" nor my "views" increased at any time remotely close to when you posted your comment, so I really don't think you actually read it in the first place.

*********** Hmm... I don't know about that. It doesn't really make sense for you to come back a full hour later to comment. Giving you the benefit of the doubt, even though the view counter hasn't lagged in my own personal experience, your "criticism" sounds a lot like cold-reading, like you made a bunch of assumptions about what the fic would be like based on your opinions of HPMOR.

#+begin_quote
  "Just like that?" he said. "Thirty seconds ago you

  "Do you truly think it wise to [X], boy?"

  Duly noted.
#+end_quote

Shouldn't the first sentence have a proper ending? If I didn't misunderstand and this is indeed an error, maybe it's best to edit the story some more (e.g. also getting rid of the H:, Q: style at the end) and try again when you find the story absolutely perfect.

** I'm not one of those who hates HPMOR with every fibre of my being, probably cause I read it early on, and reread parts as well. What I enjoyed most about it was the humour, and it is too early to tell whether or not your fic will draw me in with humour.

The good part: You've got your eye on the endgame, unlike Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence.

The bad: The final part is a bit chaotic, and Voldemort destroying reality? Couldn't help but roll my eyes. This is a common problem with looping back, so I hope the rest of your fic leads up to it in a coherent and believable manner.

Most importantly, I'd love a rational fic, not a rationalist fic. I'm sure a lot of others here would agree. If you've read the Naruto fanfic The Waves Arisen, that is the upper limit of exposition that I can tolerate.
