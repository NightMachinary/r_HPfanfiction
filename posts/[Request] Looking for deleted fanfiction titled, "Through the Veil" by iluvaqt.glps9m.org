So, I've been on a HP/LOTR crossover fanfiction kick lately, wanting to read past favorites that I've bookmarked, only to find that many of them have been sadly taken down. One of the fics I'm searching for is a crossover with the main pairing being Hermione/Legolas. I just can't seem to find it anywhere.

Here's the original link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8716570/1/Through-the-Veil]]

Any help would be much appreciated!


** Try FictionHunt. It's one of the mirror sites for FFN and you can often find deleted fics there so you can save them.
