It sort of had a decent stopping point, but I thought the author had plans to continue it. If it's dead I'll find a way to move on, but the not knowing is killing me. Been following this story for literally years at this point and I'd love to see it eventually finish some day.

** It's been 9 months, but the previous two update intervals were 10 months each (2017-06, 2018-04, and 2019-02). I'd say it's too early to give up.

** Generally speaking, better quality fics have much longer intervals between chapters (see Victoria Potter for example), both due to real life issues and laying down the story in an appropriate manner. Just powering through is usually a sure sign of canon repetition. Besides which, the real issue with SoA is the writer wants to appropriately create the tone of the Tolkeinverse, which in and of itself is much more difficult compared to say Harry Potter or other more common fandoms.

But is it dead? Its impossible to know really. It does follow the pattern, ironically exemplified by Harry Potter and the Chrysalis update in the last 12 hours (spoiler: its abandoned). But thats not a guarantee. Lots of fics are picked up after long hiatuses, and have taken over a decade to finish.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I suppose it is dead the best we can do is hope and wait, maybe try adopt but I'm not confident enough to try that myself.
