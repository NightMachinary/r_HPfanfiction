I can't remember the title but Harry could turn into a very rare breed of dragon called the Black and he used this form to save Narcissa Malfoy from being raped by Death Eaters, he also might have defeated Voldemort by using the form but I am not 100% sure about that. I don't know why it was classified as a Request when I tried to use Fic Search as a flair.
