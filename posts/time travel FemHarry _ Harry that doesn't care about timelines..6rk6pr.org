There fics out there where Harry gets send to the past, and then whines about keeping everything ''canon'' so that he/she knows what will happen or wants nothing to change. Well I say fuck that shit, I want a Fem!Harry / Harry that doesn't care if she/he changes the timelines.

Be it either romancing / plotting / killing, just change something in her/his benefit.


** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches comes to mind.

***** You're right. This one is way better than the other WBWL stories that I've had the 'pleasure' to read.

Still, I can't stand stories where children aren't acting like children. Harry obviously isn't a child, but Daphne and Hermione, aside from their introduction scenes, don't act anything like what I expect from an eight years old. At least they're naive and easily impressed by Harry's 'tricks'.

Honestly, I wish authors who can't write children properly just move the setting up a few years...

Fate fixed Harry with a hard sapphire stare. "And I will not subordinate my will to a pathetic excuse of an old man who gets off on lemon drops and playing the puppet master, especially when he's so utterly crap at it."

This is just one of very many examples.\\
I will read at least 3 or so chapters, but if they are as terrible as the first one than I will demand a triple refund!

***** I think it comes don to what you expect from the stories you read. If you approach Wind Shear expecting deep and moving plot, amazing characters that grow and evolve? You're gonna be disappointed.

But if you go into the story expecting cool fight scenes and quick paced action Wind Shear is your story.

It's like comparing The Shawshank Redemption to Pacific Rim. The Shawshank Redemption might be the better movie by far but if you're in the mood for Giant Monsters vs. Giant Robots Pacific Rim will be the better choice. In this comparison Wind Shear would be Pacific Rim, if not quite as good.
