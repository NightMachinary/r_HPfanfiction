I've been doing a lot of these alternate titles recently and have decided instead of making some alternate title based on another franchise, why don't we play a game. Make an alternate title to the books based on...anything really. Have fun! Whether its serious or funny, just have fun with it. Here, if I could change any of the titles, I'd change book 4 to /Harry Potter and the Triwizard Tournament/.


** Harry Potter and the well played game of Chess

Harry Potter and the big death noodle

Harry Potter and the Nightmare sheets

Harry Potter and the convenient outside help

Harry Potter and the conspiracy theory

Harry Potter and the obsession with Draco Malfoy

Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina

Harry Potter and the cursed canon child filled with plot holes.

* 4 is the most accurate. 1st task, summons broom; 2nd task, is given gillyweed; 3rd task, Barty takes out some of his competitors; Voldemort task, shades of Voldemort's victims cause a distraction long enough for Harry to escape.

*** I really like these. So much so that I kind of wished they were the real titles. They just have something about them that make me want to read the work attached to them.
