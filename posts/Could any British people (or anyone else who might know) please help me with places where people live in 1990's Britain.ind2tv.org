I know jack all about British geography/socio-political stuff, especially what it's like in the 1990's. I'm looking for a few things, but appreciate any help;

1) I plan on moving where Harry lives, but don't want to make a huge mistake just picking a random location. Where would it be realistic for him to move to if in 1983 the Dursleys for whatever reason became somewhat richer and decided to move somewhere to mach their "class".

2) It would be simplest to just have everyone go to London to catch the train, but supposing the Hogwarts express magically travels through already established stations, I would need to know where they are. So does anyone have a resource of train station locations in 1991? If not, what station would someone living in 'location up there' /\ go to?

3) Are there any resource for places the characters live?

Thanks!


** Depends how rich, but you'd be good with most major cities; a lot will have areas within them that are considered lower/midlde/upper class, though personally I can't see the Dursleys moving very far north. We've a bit of a rivalry between southerners and northerners over here; Petunia hails from the Midlands but she and Vernon have got a certain snobbery that comes from the south, especially the south-east. If they're going to leave Surrey, I'd place them in Kent, Hampshire, or Sussex.

If you do want to go further, Oxford and Cambridge have a certain prestige, but I'd go for Oxford over Cambridge when it comes to poshness. East Anglia has a bit of a rep for being hick country; I certainly wouldn't put them in Norfolk, Suffolk, or Essex (not strictly part of EA, but does have a certain reputation; in the 80s and 90s especially the term 'Essex girl' was used for promiscuous, rowdy women). London is usually a safe option, but you'd have to look up the various areas; I'm not familiar with them myself.

For stops between London and Hogsmeade, look up routes for normal trains; most of the major stops these days will be the same as they were in the 90s. From King's Cross, you're looking at Cambridge -- Peterborough -- Sheffield -- Leeds and onwards (that's just a rough estimate though, I'm not very familiar with train routes).

As for resources, [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/places/]] is great.

*** Ah, thanks! This is perfect. There's just something you get from living in a place, and it's remarkably hard to find people talking about it on the internet.

Thank you very much. :)

** The Burrow is in/on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole, according to George in Chamber of Secrets Chapter 3 'The Burrow'. While Ottery St Catchpole doesn't appear to actually exist, the closest real-world location is [[https://www.otterystmary.info/][Ottery St Mary]].

According to [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/place/great-britain-united-kingdom/england/west-country/cornwall/tinworth/shell-cottage/][this]] page from the HP Lexicon, Shell Cottage is on the outskirts of Tinworth, Cornwall. Annoyingly, Tinworth also doesn't appear to actually exist.

Malfoy Manor, according to Hermione's copy of the Daily Prophet in Chapter 15 of Order of the Phoenix, is in [[https://www.visitwiltshire.co.uk/][Wiltshire]], which is in southwestern England.

** Posh places within Surrey associated with wealthier people include Reigate, Dorking, Chiddingfold, Mickleham, Westhumble, Oxted, etc.

However, your problem here is that the Dursleys are unlikely to like those places. They are full of liberal metropolitan elite types - Guardian-reading champagne socialists and Times-reading traditional liberals. In short, the type of people who would look down on the Daily Mail-reading Dursleys, and who in turn the Dursleys would look upon as namby-pamby, this-country-is-going-to-the-dogs, out-of-touch elites.

The Dursleys are "somewheres", not "anywheres", and therefore even if they become richer I doubt they would look to move to a place which is out of keeping with their values. I'd therefore recommend places that are not quite as "bucolic middle class" as the above list, but still considered above average in terms of wealth. Somewhere like Ashford (Surrey, not Kent) or Guildford.

As for trains, I suggest you just go to nationalrail.co.uk and check the routes from London to (say) St Andrews.

*** Thanks mate!

The Dursleys moving was supposed to be a simplified version of this weird plot idea I have going on in my head, and not exactly what is actually happening. I don't quite get your “somewhere” vs “anywhere” distinction, if you don't mind could you elaborate a little on that?

Other than that the website will hopefully be useful. For some reason I honestly hadn't considered that the train lines would be mostly the same today as they were back then.

Cheers. :)

** Regarding trains, if you want to go with established train routes, you can choose between East Coast and West Coast Main Line. The WCML covers more population I think (Birmingham, the Liverpool-Manchester area, better connections from Wales) and ends in Glasgow, the ECML is via York and Newcastle to Edinburgh and is the faster route. The WCML does not operate out of King's Cross though, but out of London Euston.

Train stations didn't change much between 1990 and now, at least on the major lines. Truth be told, you could use a map from the 1900s and, unless you go with very small stations and branch lines (which were closed in the 60s-80s), not much would have changed. If you want a realistic time table for a steam train, you can simply use time tables from the 1950s. LNER in particular for King's Cross - Scotland.

**** One thing I've noticed while looking trains up for my own writing is that the Hogwarts Express has to be roughly as fast as a modern express train. London Inverness (somewhererremote in Scotland would probably take longer) is 8 hours 39 minutes, which would mean an arrival at 19:39 if you depart at 11. Add an hour to get everyone to the castle and two hours for the sorting + feast and it's nearly 11 pm. And that's before unpacking and while potentially having classes at 9 (so wake up at 7) the next day.

** I imagine the Dursley's would move to East Hampshire if they moved anywhere. There are some very, very posh villages down there. Haselmere is only an hour from London.
