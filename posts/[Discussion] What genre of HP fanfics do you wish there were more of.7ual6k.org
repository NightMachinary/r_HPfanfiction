Personally, I wish there were more worldbuilding/political fics, a la Prince of Slytherin, and more fics that deal with espionage during the second Voldemort war.


** Postwar revolutions.

That fucking piece of shit aka British Ministry of Magic deserved some serious purges.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** This is my take on postwar:

After the Battle, the Ministry's own force was basically decimated. Voldemort pretty much drafted everyone from the Ministry for the final battle, even including then Minister Thickness. In the 2nd part of the Battle, Voldemort bought Narcissa's lie, became overconfident, and led his entire army into a death trap. Caught in a pincer movement by the original defenders, Slughorn's reinforcement, Centaurs, House-Elves, and Thestrals, everyone Death Eater, Snatcher, Ministry minion, and Giant was either killed or captured.

The Ministry's own reputation was also in tatters, after falling to two coups/revolutions within 10 months. It would become a laughing stock, a joke in any country/society. It NEEDED someone like Harry Potter to lend its credibility and rebuild its military, because after the Battle, the DA and the Order were magical Britain's ONLY credible and organized armed forces, and they ANSWERED to Harry. So, a major conclusion here is that the center of power in immediate aftermath of the Battle had shifted to them.

Apart from Kingsley and McGonagall, the Order by this time was pretty much the Weasleys. There was also the DA to consider, in which Neville and Ginny held very significant influence.

I don't think there would be mercy for the Death Eaters after the Battle. McGonagall had no problem with Harry crucioing Amycus Carrow, and she was willing to kill Slughorn even before the Battle.

Weasleys were a hot tempered and bloodthirsty bunch to begin with, and would be downright pissed after losing Fred and learning what had happened to Ginny at Hogwarts.

That left Kingsley, whom we knew actually little other than he was a capable fighter and administrator. Many fics had him giving Voldemort's Ministry collaborators a free pass, but I honestly doubted this considering how much he was promoting the DA.

I expect the DA to be the most bloodthirsty and vindictive group after being tortured all year and then losing so many friends. Kingsley inviting this group to take over Magical Britain's security forces led me to believe that Kingsley himself was also taking a hardline approach. However, offering leniency to the Malfoys showed they were still sensible enough to take a divide and conquer strategy against Voldemort remnants.

Harry should be truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, would organize themselves and demand a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers.

They certainly knew that despite the enormous cost, they had scored a major victory over the evil. However, significant amount of baddies remained out there, and their own hold on power was tenuous at best. They knew they COULDN'T AFFORD to brood over loses or drown themselves in self-guilt, but would honor the fallen with effective actions of their own.

That's why I think their decision to send Harry and Ron into auror force, and Hermione and Ginny back to Hogwarts was a highly rational one. It meant they placed political necessities above their own emotional demands. One of their goals was certainly to have the boys taking an active role in the government, while having the girls widen their influences at Hogwarts.

After so much trauma and suffering, it should be very clear that their generation would adopt a mindset of "NEVER AGAIN"! Given Ministry's abysmal record in protecting them, they were NOT going to give its corrupt and cowardly bureaucrats any more free reigns. This generation would be taking things into THEIR OWN HANDS.

***** Not to mention that I really don't think any of the four would have put up with a curfew, or being limited to Hogwarts. I expect Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione to basically come and go as they please at Hogwarts following Voldemort's defeat, and not even McGonagall saying anything.

*** Shameless self promotion, but the new fic I'm writing is in part about Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley (and Ron) 13 years after the war ended, and a theme is that they've worked together to purge the old guard out and remove the blood-purity and cruel traditions from the institution. I think I read a thread here a while back where people talked about Kingsley and Harry working together to be this new progressive political force, and I was intrigued. It's an interesting and not too unrealistic concept.

**** Is it online already?

I think they should have mostly weeded out those miscreants within 2 years after the Battle. Harry became the youngest Head Auror at age 27 (2007), so that would indicate an extremely successful career up to that point.

I would expand [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-final-live-report][Rita Skeeter attacking the DA at Quidditch World Cup]] into a full blown conspiracy, which resulted in a second wave of purges:

- Why did Rita Skeeter suddenly find the courage to attack them? She was obviously bribed by some still influential members of the 'Old Families' and hostile foreign interests. Their goal was to exploit Ginny Potter's volatile temper and provoke her into attacking Rita Skeeter publicly. They thought they could discredit the Potters and weaken their positions.
- But they miscalculated. They first underestimated Ginny's popularity: resistance leader, war hero, star athlete, popular reporter, and sex symbol, whose popularity far outshone that of Rita Skeeter, who was really only popular with the old crowd such as Muriel Prewett.
- Next, they never anticipated the ruthless counterattacks by the Ministry and the DA alumni. Instead of staying on the defensive, the Kingsley administration brought out their own supporters en masse to denounce that 'slanderous Rita'. It dug out Rita's old dirt in promoting Voldemort propaganda; it brought forth Rita's past victims to go after her publicly; it riled up past Voldemort victims to recall horrors of 'The Year of Darkness'.
- Prompted by an agitated populace, DMLE, under Hermione and Harry, arrested Rita Skeeter and chief editor of the Daily Prophet Barnabus Cuffe, and began investigations into potential collusions between Daily Prophet and Voldemort. Veritaserum interrogations yielded that Cuffe was a closet Blood Purist who extensively supported Voldemort's agenda. He was charged and convicted of high treason and sentenced to life in Azkaban. Rita Skeeter admitted under interrogation that she was bribed and supported by certain subversive forces.
- What followed next could be called the 2nd Great Purge, in which dozens more Voldemort sympathizers were arrested, convicted, heavily fined, and sentenced to long prison terms. Lee Jordan took over as the chief editor of the Daily Prophet.

Finally, I want to point out that Harry and Co never paid much attention to laws and rules when they interfered with their goals/objectives. Hermione especially, only used laws to reign in others while routinely pissing on them herself.

If they were to make it to the top of that cesspool known as the British Ministry of Magic (according to JKR), they would no longer be your adorable innocent children or naive teenagers, but battle hardened warriors and brilliant politicians.

I agree with you, though, that the Harry, Hermione and Ron you read about in the books wouldn't have gotten to the top of the Ministry the way they did according to JKR.

** I suppose I like political stories, but really, I think, what I like is seeing something broken down into its parts and made more efficient.

Stories that involve Harry Potter becoming headmaster, for instance, and increasing the productivity and atmosphere in the school. Or stories where the government is cleaned up of corruption and wasteful spending.

I think this is why I so much enjoy stories that involve someone going back in time. Typically (or, rather, ideally) they handle things much more efficiently, since they have an idea of how things are going to happen.

I have read more than enough proclamations of undying love from 15-year-old teens, give me a fic that shows how they spent a day out with the kids or how Harry is actually a stay at home dad (I remember an awesome one-shot with that premise).

** I honestly feel like there aren't enough mystery fics (original or left unresolved in Canon). It's especially weird since the series is all about mysteries. And on a side note, I haven't really seen many Ron time travel fics which I would be interested in reading.

Another area I feel is lacking are fics with competent adults who take threats dangers very seriously and do investigations and. The best fic I've seen handle that is Petrification Proliferation. The last area I feel is lacking are students of different religions at Hogwarts.

Almost every fic I've seen dealing with religion became some mouthpiece for the author to promote it. Is it so much to ask for a good take on Muslim/ Jewish/ Hindu students in the magic world and see what their life is like?

** Adventures in the magical world fics.

A type of fic where Harry doesnt aspire to be an auror after Hogwarts, but to go on full blown D&D magical adventures.

I want to see some fics where combat is a strong focus, where finding magically hidden lands and battling powerful creatures to save villages are the norm. I want high fantasy hidden from the modern muggle world (until it eventually comes smashing together).

I would also love more general !badass Harry action movie/ anime style fics.

I cant get enough martial artist Harry fics. Give me even more fics where lost and hidden battlemagics and combat techniques are discovered and scenes are filled with high octane world shaking spells and devestating physical strikes.

I like fanfiction, including the stuff that goes really far off the rails from canon. I love crossovers because they usually feature much more direct non spell slinging combat. Pretty much i live off of high octane magic. I know it used to be more popular and you used to find more decently written examples. I kind of want a revival of that time. I dont find much interesting in politcal or world building fics, i just want action, action, Harry/Luna love, and more action.

Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return.

** Master of Death Harry.

This concept is criminally underutilised. It's a fascinating subject to explore and I'm frankly baffled that not many writers do so.

It can be anything you want, whether from simple immortality all the way to Harry becoming the literal Grim Reaper.

In my headcanon being MoD means you are immortal but not in the sense that your physical body cannot die, like Voldemort wanted but that your soul is immortal and will never move on.

Instead the soul gets reborn into a new host every time the previous host dies, retains its memories as well as the ability to call on the Hallows when needed.

A fantastic gateway for all sorts of crossover shenanigans.

I also want to see better written stories exploring this theme.

But it is to easy to make it uninteresting, because immortality removes many ways to create a decent flow in stories involving action or suspense.

It makes all interactions that can lead to Physical conflict lesser and makes it much more important to create better dialogue, since you can't 'kill' an immortal.

You have to solve *all* conflicts with this character through dialogue or ways that are not explained as simply "A Wizard did it using never before seen magic that seals the entity it hits in a different dimension".

I've seen fics where this is assumed to be a backstory, but not where the potential of OotP is developed into a broader plot--at least, not completed fics. While books 6 and 7 are interesting, I felt they narrowed the scope too much, and that branching out from there gives authors more scope.

** I had a suggestion from my beta recently of having interludes of events and happenings 17 years ago. I make mention of a ton of history of the world in my fic, and while its great to mention it, sometimes its great to show it too.

** So this is really specific, but there was this one fic that focused a lot on Harry learning latin and it was just so cool. It hasn't updated since like 2015 though, of course. Basically fics that focus on very specific aspects of something, I might call them aesthetic fics, that pic one thing eg. latin, and sort of write the entire story around it.

Basically I'll go for anything super specific, it doesn't have to include any of the main characters. Give me the life of a recently graduated Hogwarts student opening a cafe in Diagon. Give me a pureblood wife with a passion for magical history. give me the techie Ravenclaw who spends his years working on trying to recreate technological advancements with magic.

Stories that pick one thing and focus their entire story about it.
