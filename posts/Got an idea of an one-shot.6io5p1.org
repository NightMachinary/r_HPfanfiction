Let's say, in 1981, Dumbledore didn't place Harry to Petunia's and ensure every death eaters got their due. Harry grew up into magical world, perhaps trained by Dumbledore himself but things went wrong as Voldemort came back and killed Harry. Say Harry lost her mother's protection because he never stayed with Petunia. And Dumbledore only then realized Voldemort could only be defeated by self sacrificial magic which he is unable to perform due to his past. And also he never knew about the horcrux as he ensured every death eaters got punishment. So no diary on loose from Malfoy.

So Dumbledore performed a ritual and time travelled back to 1981 and let the canon events happened as it is.

The idea is based on this story where [[/spoiler][Pettigrew was the one travelled back]] and let the canon events happened as it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7411050/1/The-Traitor][The Traitor]]

English isn't my mother tongue nor I am good at writing. Perhaps someone among you can write a story based on the idea.
