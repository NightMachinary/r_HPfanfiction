How far can you go? How much power does it require? How many times can you do it in a certain period? Can it be reasonably used during battle or does it require too much concentration and power?


** - Apparition is a skill that 99% of the British population (Hogwarts graduates) can perform.
- It is to complex for children but does not require 'of age' wizards to master.
- Wizards seem not to enjoy using apparition if another option is available.
- The flu system exists
- The knight Bus exists
- Harry potentially Apperates onto the school roof in a fit of accidental magic under stress
- Twicross the Apparition instructor seems unnaturally skinny/waifish to Harry
- Voldemort cannot Apperate from Nurmengard in Bulgaria/Germany(speculation) to Malfoy manor in one jump and chooses to fly a great distance.
- Voldemort perhaps chooses not to apperate multiple times in a row from Nurmengard to England.
- In OotP it is implied that Dumbledore can stop multiple other wizards with a spell from a wand.
- Houses are warded as a matter of course from apparition.
- Apparition potentially takes the immediate area around you, either that or Dobby apperated with a knife in his heart. OR didn't apperate and used a house elf alternative that operates on different rules.
- Apparition does not preserve momentum, explained in my other comment in this thread.
- you can piggyback with someone else even if you do not know how to apperate.
- While "you" apperate, your things (clothes, what you're holding etc.) travel with you.
- Apparition is written in a way that implies that it is faster than a portkey. Harry knocks against the other Weasley's on the way to the world cup.
- Apparition disrupts the air around you generating a sonic boom although it is never refered to as such and must be taken as speculation.
- No one uses Apparition in combat, though it is heavily implied in the duel between Albus and Tom at the Ministy, book 5.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

*** So why does Voldemort not go from Nurmengard to Malfoy Manor in one jump? If not one jump, then why not multiple? If it's too taxing, is that directly related to the distance travelled? If you apparate multiple times in a short amount of time, does it tax an increasing amount of power?

If apparition does disrupt the air, why is it only described as a crack, rather than a sonic boom? Or am I misguided in thinking a sonic boom is supposed to be much louder than a crack?

Only Albus and Tom and use it canon, do you have speculation as to why that is? Could Harry realistically be able to do it as well?

**** A Whip cracking is an (admittedly small) example of a sonic boom. A 'sonic boom' is just the shockwave produced by something going (or /changing/) at a supersonic speed. In the case of apparition, I would assume this to be the space left behind collapsing when you disappear, and the air being rapidly shoved out of the way when you arrive.

If it were instantaneous, this would be very loud and potentially destructive.

I'm more inclined to believe (this is mostly just headcanon from here) that, with the whole 'squeezed through a tube' description, departure and arrival are not instantaneous. An alternative would be apparition teleporting some amount of air the other way, but not quite exactly the same amount as would replace the wizard (unless they are a master of apparition).

****** I'd assume a particularly bad case of splinching, which is why apparating into crowds or popular places is a bad idea (or regulated). The main transport to the Quidditch World Cup was portkeys even within Britain, after all.

Then again, I'm no expert and I can't remember how much of that is canon and how much is fanon.

**** I think its implied the reason Voldemort didn't go from Nurmengard to the Malfoy Manor straight away was due to some anti-apparition charms surrounding Nurmengard which had a long range (e.g. similarly to protections around Hogwarts, Azkaban, etc). So Voldemort would have to fly out of the range of the anti-apparition charm before he could apparate back to the Manor.

We know that apparating across countries is possible, so theoretically it would be possible for Voldemort to apparate from England to western Europe if there was no enchantments preventing apparition. He's definitely skilled enough to where he could just apparate from one country to another casually, and I assume Dumbledore was just as capable, if not more so. Besides, Voldemort might have took longer getting back if he wanted to make sure that nobody knew that he personally went to kill Grindelwald since that would make every foreign ministry wonder if Voldemort would invade them next.

I forget if the books ever mentioned this, but was it even common knowledge in-universe that Voldemort killed Grindelwald? I know Harry knows it, but as far as the wizarding world at large is concerned, they probably think Grindelwald died naturally due to his old age and the toll Nurmengard would take on him. Even if they knew he was murdered, I don't think they knew Voldemort or even any other Death Eater did it.

*TL;DR: If it weren't for the anti-apparition charms on Nurmengard, Voldemort would be able to just apparate to Nurmengard, kill Grindelwald, then apparate right into Malfoy Manor effortlessly.*

****** Harry seemed to think that's what Voldemort was doing.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out."
#+end_quote

So perhaps the range is much bigger than imagined, hence why Voldemort still had to fly a decent distance before apparating, or Voldemort was too busy doing irrelevant things off-page. Either that or Voldemort never needed cross-country apparition before, therefore he's never done it (I doubt this given how many years he's lived), so he decided to fly all the way back to England before apparating.

Then again, Voldemort is the same guy who orchestrated the absurd, overly situation plot in GoF regarding the portkey (rather than getting Harry via less convoluted means) and also the same guy who made all his Horcruxes significant items in significant rather than using less obvious items as Horcruxes in less obvious locations. So Voldemort's intelligence and/or common sense are very, very questionable.

Though Deathly Hallows is also the same book where Bellatrix had the perfect opportunity to kill Hermione but didn't take it (aside from enjoying torture, what benefit did Hermione not being killed have for Bellatrix>), didn't kill Harry and Ron the moment they were brought to the Manor (even if she didn't know it was Harry, wouldn't it make sense to kill the prisoners anyway). At the very least, she had all the time in the world to kill Hermione, Ron, Luna, Dean and Ollivander, yet never did so. She had the power to kill those five, leave Harry alive so that someone can confirm if its Harry or not, then just call Voldemort anyway.

*TL;DR: Voldemort flew out of range and then apparated to Malfoy Manor. Any other outcome can be attributed to Voldemort's usual plot-induced stupidity.*

** I wrote up my thoughts about apparition in one of my fics.

#+begin_quote
  Despite what a great many wizards believe, apparition is not as easy as we were taught in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. The three D's cover how to actually force your body to perform an apparition, but in practice that only covers the skill required to travel a few steps to a hoop on the floor. The further you travel, the more things you need to compensate for.

  Anyone who is not prepared for the difference in air pressure when apparating to a different altitude could end up with lungs crushed to the size of plums or inflated to the size of watermelons.

  Apparating without compensation to a place more than a few tenths of a degree longitude or latitude away from your point of origin means you'd better lean on arrival, and arrive jogging if you travel any meaningful distance along a longitude line. Intercontinental apparition is impossible for all but the most powerful wizards, if only because the ability to adjust to arriving at a forty-five degree angle and compensate for the Coriolis effect is not included in the curriculum of magical schools. Apparating from London to Auckland involves having to turn yourself upside down, adjust your body's trajectory by several hundred miles an hour and protect your lungs from swelling. And that's without how you go about avoiding appearing in the middle of a muggle street. Most people just don't bother, not when international portkeys are made by people trained specifically to do those sorts of calculations.

  Aerial apparition adds another layer of complexity to an already difficult discipline. When you're pulling a couple of G's and rotating at different rates in all three dimensions, calculating how to even those out and apparate to an unmoving spot on the ground takes the sort of mental arithmetic that most people with a sub-200 IQ find a little overwhelming. I've never really had a major problem with it, though that comes from my instinctive knack for flight rather than any affinity for mathematics. Still, it's much, much easier to just come to a halt before apparating, as it reduces the chance of splinching by a couple of orders of magnitude.

*** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4qh2gm/discussion_a_question_regarding_apparition_and/][*Taken from a previous discussion thread:*]]

Apparition does not conserve momentum.

In HBP, we see Harry and Dumbledore Apparate between the south of England and Hogwarts (somewhere in Scotland). If momentum was conserved, the difference in rotational velocity of the Earth's surface would have been deadly.

To be specific, you'd be thrown at a speed of roughly forty meters per second, or ninety miles an hour, if you Apparated between Aberdeen and London.

If your orientation doesn't change, then you'll be tossed to the east when you travel north, or west when you travel south. So we know that the spell is doing something about your momentum that's more intelligent than preserving it relative to the Earth as a whole.

** I have a fanon theory that bodies of water and tectonic plates are magical limitations on apparition. Acting rather like natural barriers, a ward if you will.

Shorter distances require less effort than longer ones. You could do it endlessly in battle but it takes too long when dodging spells.

*** I like the idea that oceans are magical limitations; not sure about tectonic plates. A basic map of the plates suggests this could probably work out to the same effect of making intercontinental travel harder, as aside from India and the Middle East, all the continents are on different plates.

** Like most things with magic, it's limited by the user. Focus, concentration, skill. All things that vary amongst people. Some can't apparate. Others can, but it takes more conscious focus. Some could probably apparate across vast expanses of land as easily as we can take a step. Some could probably use it in a fight if an anti-disapparition jinx isn't used. A rare handful probably don't give two shits about the limitations others put on it, or, to say more accurately, what others try to put on apparition.
