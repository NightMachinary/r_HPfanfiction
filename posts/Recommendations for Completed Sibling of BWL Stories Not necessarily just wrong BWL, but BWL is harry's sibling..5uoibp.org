Hi all!

Back looking for some more recommendations and this time I'm hoping to find some stories where Harry isn't the BWL, but he's the sibling to the BWL, meaning he'll probably be older than canon events. I unfortunately can't remember the few stories I read that led to this interest but I do know that they were either a work in progress or abandoned after like 4 years.

Wrong-BWLs are fine as well, but I want to stay away from the wrong-twin-BWL trope because I read plenty of those already. As long as someone is the BWL and Harry is their older sibling. I would prefer for them to be completed and non-slash just because it's getting frustrating to read about this cool twist in the story but no resolutions.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
