** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): he still had his horcruxes, but not nearly as insane as in canon and much more cunning. [[/spoiler][As the story stands right now, Voldemort had control over Russia, with thousands of magicals and millions of muggle soldiers at his command. Harry controlled the rest of Europe with even more resources, and the two were going to duke it out in a titanic struggle.]]

*Patron*, linkffn(11080542): Horcruxes are implemented differently in this AU, but its Voldemort is more far scarier as a result. Not only didn't this Voldemort have its canon insanity, but was a brilliant and cunning strategist.

*Yes, I am Harry's Brother*, linkffn(8192853): this Voldemort was forced to reintegrate his horcruxes, and became far more dangerous and successful. [[/spoiler][He finally succeeded in eradicating the muggles and brought all magicals on board with him, including Harry, Hermione, and all the supposedly 'good guys'.]]

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Here's a pair of fics for you. Linkffn(the book of Morgan le fey) is an old Ron centric fic that was written before HBP, so no Horcruxes. Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) is a fem!harry story with two points of divergence--the aforementioned fem!harry and Tom riddle not making any Horcruxes.

** At the risk of being redundant, linkffn(Renegade Cause) has what you want and it's long, nice to sink your teeth into if it's to your liking. Also, because why not, here comes a self-plug: linkffn(Lesser Evils). This one is largely inspired by Renegade Cause.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

  There is a reason why everyone wants a piece of Harry Potter; the twelve-year-old is considered a prodigy by the Wizarding World, after all. But Harry has chosen his side. The Headmaster and Minister of Magic can try as they might - Harry is a dark wizard. Now...if only he could get in touch with the elusive, recently resurrected Voldemort. Sequel to Enveloped in the Darkness.
