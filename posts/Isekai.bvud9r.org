Looking for fic where the character gets transported to the harry potter world but he/she doesn't have prior knowledge of the books or movies.


** linkffn(8096183) Its a crossover with dungeons and dragons where a 11 year old wizard from a world that follows the rules of the game with him as a PC , ends up at Hogwarts. He is very into munchkining rules, and notices things that happen around him as part of a narrative. He doesn't get Harry Potter magic though.
