I'm looking for a fic where the Grey Lady, angry at Tom's betrayal, decides to use Harry to get her revenge. It can have any other thing like WBWL or his parents being alive, I don't mind.


** I don't have exactly what you are looking for, but it does heavily involve the Grey Lady....

  The powers of the immortals combine in the one receiving the Prize. In the film, upon defeating the Kurgan, Connor MacLeod receives the gift of telepathy. What if he were also gifted with magic? HP/Highlander first film crossover. Not slash.
