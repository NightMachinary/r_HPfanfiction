Like in the title, I'm looking for lesser known fics that feature those different types of magic. I've already read Arithmancer series, Runestone Path and all that jazz, I need more.


** In C'est la vie Harry is very talented at runes and they appear quite a bit in the fic but it's not the main plot, also the fic is not completed and haven't been updated in a few years

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14695419/chapters/33957573][The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles]] goes SO deep into runes and Arithmancy. The author even quotes bits from the Runes book in her fic. It's crazy because it's a book in a book but it goes really deep into magical theory. The MC is fem!Harry but there's an actual plot reason for the gender swapping- Petunia teaches her to sew so she starts getting into thread magic (like hedge witch rune stuff). One warning is that it's Harry/Voldemort but honestly the world building is so good that that can be looked over. The author is a librarian or something and goes really deep into the research of topics.

** Harry Potter and the Artificer Legacy by Kairomaru

linkffn(13435630)

Harry is great at runes, and a few branches of magic are fleshed out very well (runes, alchemy, enchanting, wandless magic, an alternate Occlumency, etc.)

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!
