Hrm, it works I guess but dead things isn't the one I meant to link. Will edit once I find it.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

  Post-DH AU: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying. “Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me." “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”

** There are a number of stories in which Harry stops aging. Most of the ones I'm aware of are Marvel crosses.

Apart from them, there's linkffn(On a Pale Horse by Hyllian) and linkffn(The Adumbration of Cordelia by Temporal Knight), in which the effects are a bit more eldritch. The second one is a fem!Harry, if that makes a difference for you.

** Resurrect The Living by fascinationex is a good one. Though I will say as a warning -it is tagged as a supposed eventual Harry/Tom Riddle pairing. I wouldn't let that deter you though, as it's 32 chapters and almost 90,000 words in and Tom Riddle hasn't even been introduced as a character yet. So I'm not sure if the author is still going to pursue that route anymore. It's a really good read though!
