** Not a rec, but does anybody else think fem!Harry having â€˜James' as a middle name is weird? Or am I the only one?

*** It is. To me Lily, Dorea, and even Euphemia are FemHarry middle names

*** I'm actually a big fan of masculine middle names on girls, especially with a feminine first name. This maybe be affected by me being both southern and Hispanic admittedly.

Names like Bobbie Jo, Hadley Blake, and Maria Jose sound normal to me, and now I'm in love with the idea of fem!Harry keeping James as a middle name. Holly James Potter is now my favorite fem!Harry name.
