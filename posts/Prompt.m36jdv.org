*Minerva:* Ah, what a great Saturday it is! Peaceful, quiet, no ruckus- I've barely seen one of my lions today, nevertheless see them cause trouble.

*Minerva:* *walks into the common room* Now all I need to do is check in on the Gryffindors, and I'll be free to...

*Harry, at the top of the stairs with the rest of the Gryffindors in a circle around the base of it, all of them wearing red robes:* TO PLEASE THE GREAT ONE, SHE DEMANDS A SACRIFICE!

*The Gryffindors, pushing a blindfolded Slytherin up the stairs:* SACRIFICE, SACRIFICE, SACRIFICE!

*Minerva:* . . . *leaves the common room*

​

​

I actually really want to see this play out lmao. Rights for that go to genz-harrypotter on tumblr!


** but which slytherin though...

like any is good....

but what if they kidnapped fucking Snape for this....

like, they are pushing an actual TEACHER up the stairs and sacrificing him...

or, maybe Malfoy....

"Mah fathah will hear about this"

"but u'll be to ded to tell him tho"

"fok u"

or maybe, they went to another dimension and got harry had he been sorted into slytherin.

"I'm da great HORRY POTTOR, yo cant sacrifice meh"

just some thoughts..

*** I'll post a one-shot about this some time in the future, and when I do I'll let you know.

One question tho- how dark do you want it to be? Do you want them to go ahead with the actual sacrifice and everything or not?
