I'm looking for the most over the top Slytherin/dark harry fics, I want Machiavellian eleven year olds, I want harry to casually murder a classmate because he doesn't like the way they looked at him. I could go on but I think you get my point. I don't care how badly written it is, I just need shit to read and this seems a good bet for an extensive category of fics.

Edit: The fics don't have to fit all criteria, if it fits of them even a little it's good enough for me, as I stated above the fics do not need to be masterpieces. I'm actually expecting most of the fics to be shit in written form. I'm mainly going for quantity over quality here :)

I look forward to reading your recommendations. Thanks in advance!

(Sorry for any spelling mistakes, I'm on mobile right now)

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

*** I remember reading both of these but I can't for the life of me remember what “Rise of the wizards” was like, I liked “for love of magic” even though the author mixed “plot” (and I use the term loosely here) into the smut so you can't skip it without taking the chance of missing some info and the rest not making sense. Overall a decent fic though, I recommend giving it a read if you don't mind the smut.

Thank you for the recs!

**** Rise of the Wizards is an extremely poorly attempt to justify wizards slaughtering muggles on a level that makes Hitler and Mao look like amateurs and then blame the muggles for causing it.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
