I love creature inheritance fics or fics where Harry is changed by the basilisk/phoenix/etc. to make him into a creature. But, I really want a gen fic. No romance, sex, or anything of the sort. I don't mind background relationships, but I really DON'T want Harry in a relationship. If you have a really good fic similar to my two requests that has a relationship I might be okay with it (especially if I can skip over it), but it needs to be good.

​

Thanks!!!


** You could say Harry had a Kreacher inheritance in canon hohoho.

I feel like these were popular in the wait between GoF and OotP. In fact, a creature inheritance fic during those years was my intro to fanfiction. Have you come across any you'd recommend?

** linkffn(10709411) Really good fic I've been reading recently. Covers what you want, but it takes a bit of time to find out.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6953581/1/Continuing_the_Cycle][Continuing the Cycle by Phantom Feline]] is a crazy HP/Naruto cross where Harry transforms into a snake creature and is stranded in the Elemental Countries. Completely not canon compliant for either fandom. I totally loved it, but it isn't for everyone. Harry is a total creep and watching him freak out the shinobi is fabulous. At the time I first read it, I didn't know anything about Naruto so you don't really need knowledge of that universe. linkffn(6953581)

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10570242/1/The-Sanctuary][The Sanctuary by HuskyWalker]] is gen with a hint towards slash with Greyback, but never actually gets that far. Harry and Teddy escape to a parallel universe due to werewolf discrimination. Harry is snake/fire elemental. linkffn(10570242)

  POLL RESULT; PROFILE Harry thought he would die; had anticipated it, even. So now what will he do in this new world, one without magic? Not to say that there isn't power lurking here... With snakes calling him 'Lord', and everyone else saying 'Abomination', is it any surprise that he's not going to have an easy time settling down? HP AU. Eventual Naruto AU. Slow paced. Dark Themes.

  After losing everything and on the run, Harry will do anything to keep Teddy safe, even if it means to travel back in time. He hadn't counted on their family growing, but Dark Lords, noisy old wizards, werewolves and much more keep uprooting his peace. Slash. EWE.

*** I started reading Continuing the Cycle then got super creeped out and had to stop. :/ I think I read too far for my “delicate constitution”.
