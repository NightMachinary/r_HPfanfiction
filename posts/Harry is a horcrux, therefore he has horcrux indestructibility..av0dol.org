Just as the title says. I want to read about a Harry that is completely immune to harm from things that aren't capable of destroying horcruxes.

Are there any fics like this?

***** That certainly is a relevant story, but after reading six chapters of it, I warn those who are considering following the link and reading it: it's not a well-written one.

The story is full of bashing, mainly of Dumbledore. That wouldn't be a problem, except that the bashed characters are very OOC. Harry and Hermione accuse Dumbledore of various things, and every time Dumbledore is portrayed as being unable to give a single argument in his defense, even when there are obvious such arguments he could give.

Also, suddenly every single Hogwarts student not in Slytherin believes Harry about everything and is willing to follow him in his political plays.

The result is that in /Souls Abound/, there is no challenge -- just Harry knocking down dummies in the shape of familiar characters, and everyone praising him for it.

#+begin_quote
  "Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard."

  "I still don't understand," said Harry.

  "Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work --- in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again."

  "Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted," said Harry. "He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time."

  "Quite correct," said Dumbledore, nodding. "But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it --- as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made --- or had been planning to make --- more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.' That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I don't believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . ."

** linkffn(11042519) is one. I should point out that this is not a canonical representation of horcruxes. Horcrux items are as equally destructible as non-horcrux items--it is the enchantments placed on the horcruxes that make them so tough to destroy, and the reason why basilisk venom works so well is because its antidote is phoenix tears, which are extremely hard to obtain.

Basilisk venom doesn't have inate anti-horcrux properties, it's just a very powerful venom that is difficult to guard against. It worked on Voldemort's horcruxes, because he lacked the only counter-measure to the venom: pheonix tears. If he'd ever been in a room with Fawkes while carrying some onions, then he would've been able to venom-proof his horcruxes using the tears.

****** Gonna copy paste from Taure here:

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes there are plot holes. And sometimes people just haven't read the books properly.

  Horcruxes 101:

  You can't directly affect a horcrux. That's the point of a horcrux. You can't kill a horcrux with a killing curse, a Dementor can't suck a horcrux out of its receptacle, and certainly there aren't any medical procedures that can extract it. Even when you do something to destroy the horcrux, like stabbing one of Voldemort's horcruxes with a basilisk fang, you're not directly affecting the soul piece. The basilisk venom doesn't kill the soul, it destroys the physical object, after which the soul must move on. The only way to destroy a horcrux is to physically destroy the receptacle. This is such a basic point that so many people fail to understand.

  Horcruxes don't have default invulnerability. Something being a horcrux does not in itself grant that object any special invulnerability to damage. The Dark wizard creating the horcrux must enchant the receptacle to resist damage separately from the process of making it a horcrux.

  There isn't a default set of horcrux-protecting enchantments that all horcruxes possess. The wizard creating the horcrux puts the protections on the receptacle, and what things that wizard chooses to protect against depends on the wizard's choices and capabilities. Different horcruxes will therefore be protected against different things. This is what it means to put a horcrux beyond magical repair (and thus destroy it): you put the horcrux beyond that horcrux's specific ability to magically repair, not beyond some abstract concept of magical repair in general. Basilisk venom for example, does not necessarily put something beyond magical repair: if you have phoenix tears, you can repair the damage of basilisk venom. So the horcrux in Harry wasn't destroyed by basilisk venom, because he wasn't put beyond magical repair by it, but it does destroy the others because Voldemort didn't protect them against basilisk venom. It's specifically stated, however, that had Voldemort had access to phoenix tears, he would have been able to protect his horcruxes against basilisk venom. Basilisk venom is not some set-in-stone horcrux-destroyer, it destroys horcruxes simply because the ingredient necessary to resist it is so rare.

  All of this was explained explicitly in Deathly Hallows chapter 6.

  Horcrux being tied innately to its physical container:

  “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”

  “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.”

  ”Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,” said Ron. Harry laughed.

  “It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.”

  Protections on a horcrux are put there separately by the Dark wizard making it:

  “No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them.

  Efficacy of basilisk fangs in destroying horcruxes depends on horcruxes not being protected against it, due to the rarity of its single counteracting force:

  "From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”

  “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.

  “Oh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”

  “It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare --“

  “-- phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.

  “Exactly,” said Hermione.

The important part is that a horcrux is simply an object that houses (part of) a soul. Destroying it causes the soul (fragment) to move on, but does not destroy the soul itself (as seen in with the Volde-baby in King's Cross at the end of DH).

******* This is a really good breakdown, but I have to disagree with the last bit about the soul fragments from horcruxes moving on. To point out a quote you already used:

#+begin_quote
  “It should be, actually! But my point is that *whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched*,” said Hermione. “*But it's the other way round with a Horcrux.* The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. *It can't exist without it.*”
#+end_quote

This doesn't mean the piece of soul can't exist in a physical form, it means /it can't exist at all./ Otherwise it would be exactly the same as a human body. Destroying a horcrux destroys the piece of soul inside it. The mutilated baby-sized Voldemort at King's Cross is what's left of his original, formerly whole soul - it's why it's so small and disfigured. Voldemort himself was not a horcrux, he still had a portion of his own soul left to him (the portion that escaped Godric's Hollow and was reborn into its own body), and as such is the only one capable of moving on.

You can effectively repair a soul that's been mutilated like this, if the owner can manage to feel enough remorse and has a real desire to become whole again. But this process seems more to be like a lizard regrowing its tail - you can repair it, but you're not getting that original piece back. Harry makes a last ditch effort to get Voldemort to do this during their final confrontation, though he knows it's a lost cause, because:

#+begin_quote
  "I've seen what you'll be, otherwise."
#+end_quote

Confirming that the Voldemort he saw when he 'died' (and when Voldemort collapsed at the same moment) was the true form of his remaining self.

And I know I saw one where Harry survives a car crash and the death of the Dursleys, and discovers that he's utterly invincible. He jumps off buildings and throws himself in the way of killing curses later, but I think it might be a one-shot in a collection.

** There's a great newer fic(actively updating, about 1/3 of the way in!) called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain][Beyond the Curtain]] that has this as a plot point. However, it's not something that just happens, Voldemort has to do extra work to give Harry the protection, which is the divergent point from cannon. It's also not fully explored yet, as the story is told from Neville's POV well after the events of cannon, but its still Harry's story. This might not be exactly what you're expecting, as the reader, like Neville, has very incomplete information, but the “Harry as a horcrux” angle is definitely going to be explored more as the story progresses into its second and third act.
