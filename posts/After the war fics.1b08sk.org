Anyone know any good after the war fics with the cannon pairings? Preferably directly following the battle?


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] picks up pretty much the second Book 7 ends (before the epilogue), and the author just keeps on going. They've pretty much just kept telling the story of everyone after the war, and as far as I can tell they've kept pretty much within cannon, including the epilogue. All the stories taken together, it's actually my favorite take on the post war situation and shows how everyone continues to grow, and I do mean everyone. The author's page on ffn gives you the suggested order to read the stories, and most are novel length. I really enjoy this author, and recommend taking a look at all of them. They'll keep you busy for a while.

*** Oh thank you do this! I read "There'll be bluebirds" by this author and it's fantastic. I'm interested to see their take on direct canon post war. Bluebirds is Teddy/Remus centric.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5980337/1/New-Leaf-to-Turn]] - canon pairings, but main focus in on non-douchey Dudley (starts years after the battle).

** Learning to Live Again and Thirty-One Bottles by seeker68 are wonderful. Thirty-One Bottle is a sequel that is mostly Ginny an Harry. It is 1 year after their wedding and they are watching people's memories of them throughout their loves. It's a neat way of displaying other character perspectives on events. Learning to Live Again is post-battle/pre epilogue and is mostly Weasely family and Harry. Both are canon, with plausible assumptions and addition.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]] - It is continuation, fully compatible with canon (including epilogue) - but it takes canon and mercilessly extrapolates it to its logical conclusions.
