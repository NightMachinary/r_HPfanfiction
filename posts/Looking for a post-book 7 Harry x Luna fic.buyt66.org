Hello first post here btw. Always been a sucker for Harry and Luna and I think it would have been very interesting to explore the possibility of them being romantically together. So my question is two fold.

Firstly, would appreciate any good recommended fics of the pairing, doesn't have to be post book 7. Secondly, I'm looking for a particular fic of the pairing that I read a while ago. It was a WIP and I read it in AOU3, and the last thing I remember happening was Harry and Luna going to a dance. EDIT: More details I remember are that Harry lives in Sirius's family home in the beginning, the relationship is built gradually, and it deals a bit with Harry having PTSD.

Thanks!

  A/U after DH, EWE. Luna Lovegood is the Ministry's newest Unspeakable, and Harry's work as an Auror brings them into close quarters. What will happen when The Boy Who Lived Twice can't stop thinking about The Girl Who Lives In Her Own Universe? HP/LL

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.
