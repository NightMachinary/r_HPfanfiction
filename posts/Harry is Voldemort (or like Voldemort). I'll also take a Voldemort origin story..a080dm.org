Hey there,

like the title says, I'm looking for fics in which Harry either is Voldemort, or is akin to him in personality.\\
I also remember there being something close to a Voldy origin story, but I cannot for the life of me remember the name.

It would be awesome if you could exclude abandoned fics as well as fics with a main male slash pairing. While I do enjoy femslash, I usually don't really care about the other one (especially mpreg creeps me the fuck out).

Many, many thanks in advance!


** The Sarcasm and Slytherin series, starting with linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) has a Harry that unwittingly parallels Voldemort's development, in a way that Dumbledore sees but no one else seems to (which actually makes the manipulative, untrustworthy Dumbledore make sense for once).

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) has a Harry that's like Voldemort in many ways, because the Horcrux in his head is actively shaping his development, but different in some fundamental ways.

**** Talent and ability to gather loyal friends/followers.

He's not a total clone of Voldemort, he's more compassionate, has respect for light magic, and doesn't subscribe to pureblood ideology.

The story is currently positioning the war as a three-way fight between Voldemort, the Order/Ministry, and Harry's faction, which falls somewhere between the two

*** On a side note, the author of /Sarcasm/ has another Slytherin!Harry series planned with the premise that Dumbledore successfully removed the horcrux from Harry when he was a baby, but it left an imprint on his mind, thus causing him to act more like Riddle.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][Souls Touch, and the Future Changes]] linkao3(13893606)

Nine chapters in it's looking to be a great fic, but it probably won't see any progress until after /Sarcasm and Slytherin/ is complete.

  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** If by "akin to him in personality" you mean bigoted, cruel or downright evil, muggle-hating etc. then there is the Downward Spiral Saga. It has 6 separate "books" and the writing gets better with time. Part 1: linkffn(12867536)
