I don't mean ship wise but like more than 1 harry bonus points if he's summoned by the goblet


** They exist, but I don't know of any of the top of my head.

Im actually making one myself (currently just outlining it, figuring out the plot and character motivations) although instead of 2 Harry's I'm planning for 10/11 of them.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
