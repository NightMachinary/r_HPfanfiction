Really no bashing of anyone would be nice.


** *struggling computer noises* DOES NOT COMPUTE *clang*

In all seriousness though, I don't think I've ever seen an Indy Harry story without bashing. It's really quite the shame too, it could be quite the good thing to read.

I wish you luck in your search (and if anyone else finds one, I'll be right there in line to read it!)

*** I think that's cause of two things:

1. Would Canon Dumbledore let Harry be independent? Obviously not. All other debates about him aside, Dumbledore is clearly extremely opposed to allowing Harry the sort of independence Indy!Harry usually wants (freedom from the Dursleys for example)

2. Would Canon Harry be independent from Dumbledore? Again, probably not. Even as an angsty 15/16 year old, he still retains a hero worship and unwavering trust in Dumbledore, believing he will fix everything.

As a result, you need to create a break between the characters. A reason for Harry to be free of Dumbledore's protection/smothering and/or for Harry to refuse it. You could achieve this just by doing an AU where Dumbledore dies in 1st year or something, but most Indy!Harry stories are usually close to canon, with the AU centring around where he's sorted or (if it's not a 1st year onwards fic) some event that dramatically changes him (the Chamber, the Graveyard etc).

Add to that Dumbledore's flaws and a hefty dose of semi-realistic teen angst, and "Harry realises Dumbledore is manipulating him/is old and senile and makes shit decisions/is a secret dark lord" practically writes itself.

But I share your wish to see Indy!Harry with a different divergence point, like Dumbledore's death or something.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** The Denarian trilogy by Shezza has a pretty awesome Indy Harry with zero bashing of Dumbledore (he's really badass) and one of my favorite Voldemorts (he feels like a legit villain in this).

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
