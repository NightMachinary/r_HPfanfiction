Have anything interesting to recommend that I read while sitting at jury duty for the day? I read almost anything, including slash/femslash, sexual content, etc. I have reading fanfiction for a really long time now, and so have read most of the Big Stories^{TM}.

The only things I don't much have a taste for are Tom or Bellatrix romances and any involving animals or the castle (it feels weird that I need to say that...). Otherwise just give me anything --- long or short, buddy fics, time travel dramas, angsty romances, sweet slices of life, missing moments, and of course any epic adventures. I'll take the lot!

Thanks in advance!


** Letters by Morning Lilies is some post war fluff/angst that is rather well done.

Teddy finds a bunch of letters in the attic that Harry intended his loved ones to find in case he didn't make it. He reads them and there is some fallout.

Solid read.

Despite being a fic that's largely about various characters texting each other about the size of Harry's you-know-what, it's really good.

** I've seen others doing it, so here's some shameless self-promotion before I head off to the hairdresser's. I have 10 minutes to get changed and leave, so I'm gonna copy the synopsis. SS/HG/LM, Romance, smut, cool stuff, lots of thinking on my part, not too much on yours. Here's the synopsis:

When Hermione's magic pulls her away from her friends and Hogsmeade village to the top of a hill, the decision she makes will open her eyes, shining a new light on the world around her - a very hot light. With a lot of learning and some extra homework, she will learn that some people are FAR more than they seem. She may even find love in an unexpected place.

*Slow-ish Updates*

Set in Hermione's 6th year, beginning the weekend after her birthday. As she was already a year older than the boys to begin with and assuming she gained a year with the use of the time-turner, she is 18 at the commencement of this story. Just as you should be if you're reading it ðŸ˜‘ SS/HG/LM - Probably low/no slash in the main triad, but there is a gay couple. BDSM - Fairly light, but may become more intense. (Don't try any of this stuff at home unless you and/or your partner(s) are experienced and know what they're doing.)

5 minutes.. please read. If anyone can recommend some decent SS/HG or LM/HG that'd be great because my hair will take around 3 hours.

Summary:

After the Dark Lord's fall in 1981, more than one child was lost in the spoils of war. Six-year-old Calista, the daughter of the Dark Lord's most infamous and fanatical follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, has been left in an orphanage by her mother's cousin Sirius Black, following her rescue from a mother that only wanted to twist her to the Dark Lord's purpose. The staff at the orphanage consider her both a lost cause and a Squib, but it may take a forgotten, rejected man to save a forgotten, rejected child.

For his part, Severus Snape has enough to regret without dwelling on his brief, haunting affair with the Dark Lord's most quixotic servant; but he decides to see, in the aftermath of her arrest, if he can locate her missing daughter. Instead of answers, he finds a haunted, irrevocably damaged child with his eyes and his ghosts, and he knows at once that he cannot leave her where she is.

Above all, a realistic Snape's daughter story, as well as an honest depiction of recovery and PTSD, and an in-depth exploration of the mental arts of Legilimency and Occlumency.

***** Haha! I never get around to writing reviews since I generally avoid WIPs like the plague, but your story really is excellent. Calista is a lovely oc that actually has flaws and is at the same time likeable. If there was a section on the sub's wiki for oc stories, I'd definitely recommend this one. Thank you for sharing your work :)

Summary: Snape is a fry cook at a dinner, Harry goes to him for help.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/96429/chapters/131926][Everybody's Fool]]

Summary: Harry Potter: Bruised veteran of too many heartbreaks; cynical, jaded drunkard; Wardwright, war hero, recluse, and part time matchmaker. Next target -- Severus Snape, who has a lot to learn about love.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/93653][Can't Take the Sky]]

Summary: One thing Dumbledore never told Harry about horcruxes, is that they are harder to destroy than to

[[https://kibatsu.livejournal.com/51211.html][Anachronism]]

Summary: Upon waking up, Severus finds himself not recovering from Nagini's bite, but healing after a long-term mysterious illness. Not only must he uncover the mystery of the cause of his affliction, but also deal with his lover, who is the very last person he wanted to ever see again: Harry Potter.

I rec'd almost all Snarrys I'm afraid but they're all great stories. If you need more StarcrossesKayla has two other fics on her site (she wrote Anachronism) called Invictus and Nights of Gethsemane, they're parallel fics that I also think are pretty good.
