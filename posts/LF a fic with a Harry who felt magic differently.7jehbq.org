I read this a while back so I can't really remember it. In the fic Harry saw the world differently and was slightly insane. I remember at a certain point he destroyed civilization turning it into some sort of test? The two main characters were Harry and Daphne if I remember correctly but they weren't paired together. Thanks!


** worthy of magic. the writer removed it from the internet
