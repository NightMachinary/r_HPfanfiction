It is typically believed in the magical world that muggle problems such as are no big deal for us as we can just magic any trouble away. But this may no longer be the case.

Take the number of adult witches and wizards in the world. Already a surprisingly small number, especially compared to the muggle population.

Multiply by the fraction of wizards and witches that are highly skilled and can learn highly advanced and powerful magic.

Multiply that by the fraction of those who have learned and are proficient at large scale weather magic.

Multiply by the area that one typical weather spell can cover, and the duration it stays active.

Divide by the time it takes to cast one.

Multiply by the number of reasonable work hours per week and divide by 24*7.

Divide by the total global area that will face serious damage from climate change.

Calculate that fraction yourself, and see if you agree with my assessment that we're so screwed.


** You do not need weather magic. You just go and mind control muggle leaders to do the right thing to stop climate change.

** If this is written from the role of wizards, then why are they (you) writing an estimation focusing on land that won't affect them?

Wizards can just focus on their properties and areas. Plenty of charms should deal with the effects of climate change. Local weather charms, protection spells, defensive enchantments, other spells for dwindling natural resources, and medical spells that would be the dream of any doctor. And worst comes to worst, wizards living in homes in areas so harmed by climate change that even the best charms can't help can just move.
