All I remember about it is Harry sitting somewhere(a cafe maybe), contemplating his existence, experiences and loved ones when someone comes up to him and tells him he looks a lot like Harry Potter(or Daniel radcliffe. I can't remember). That's it really. I know it's a crossover with some other fandom, though I can't remember what. Sorry for the lack of details, but it's all I've got. If I knew anything more I'd probably have found it by now.

  The dictionary defined fiction as thus: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story. The act of feigning, inventing, or imagining. Yes, Harry thought, this defined him nicely. Harry Potter & Fate/Stay Night Crossover.
