Preferably stories which focus more on the logistical, administrative or political side of a civil war and not just tits and explosions.

No slash, no Snape/Hermione or Draco/Hermione and preferably no Ron/Hermione.


** In Emperor he starts as a frontline fighter but becomes a general a little later.

*** Definitely not my cup of tea. And I was looking more for stories where Harry is a cog in the greater machinery of the conflict, not taking over everything.
