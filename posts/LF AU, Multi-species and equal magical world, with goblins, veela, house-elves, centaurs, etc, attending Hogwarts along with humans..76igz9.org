Are there any alternate-universe fics which include the above as part of their premise? Members of different species just...going to magic school?


** I do not want to self PROMOTE but I am writing a fic exactly like this!!! :) With harpies and centaurs and golems and house-elves and goblins and everyone at Hogwarts with human magicians because I made the first war with Voldemort end differently where magical beings saved human lives so the Ministry changed and gave them equal rights and stuff!

This one time, though I never finished it, I came up with a concept once for a goblin-raised Harry that wasn't Harry Crow; nothing like goblin-made daggers or secret goblin magic or anti-horcrux secrets, no, just a fairly regular Harry who's, perhaps, a bit better at understanding equivalent exchange and balance in magical theory.

The basic idea that was instead of the Fidelius Charm, Lily and James took refuge with baby Harry in the tunnels of Gringotts, and the two of them sacrifice their lives to protect some goblins when Voldemort attacks; in turn, a handful of the goblins saved by that sacrifice decide to repay it by caring for and raising Harry.

Well...hmm...your grammar and spelling doesn't have any major mistakes at least. I'm a little concerned about the dialogue, it seems just a tad too artificial a lot of the time, like the characters are making speeches rather than talking normally. You've done a great job of avoiding 'he said, she said, he said', with describing how they say things and what they do while they talk.

The second half could probably stand to be more concise, too; perhaps rather than describing the magical world's differences and history in broad strokes, maybe have Leslie notice a handful of fascinating characters on the platform, like a wizard who seems to be wearing robes made of water, a couple of boys shamelessly snogging, a garishly-dressed centaur (a clothes-horse?), an elf and goblin chatting to each other...and perhaps later, have Hermione (welcome or not) interject with a comment about how elves used to be slaves 10 years ago, or how centaurs used to live in forests, et-cetera.

I wonder, though, with such a liberal society, what kind of threat is Voldemort now? Does a pureblood, human-supremacist movement still exist that he can exploit, or does he rely more on 'mindless dark creatures' and the Imperius?

** What about Harry in a non Hogwarts school?

There was one story where Harry went to another school in Canada and they had all kinds of creatures going there. Harry transfered there 5th year I believe?

There was another where Harry somehow made his way to Mexico as a small child and went to a school there. I know chupacabra (in story basically animal drinking vampires) were also students.

Wish I could recall their names. Hopefully someone else remembers then.

***** Well, from my personal experience of robst, his ideas are interesting, but I find his writing to be below average. Characters feel one-dimensional, dialogue sounds awkward and wooden, story pacing is subpar, etc. Of course, you find plenty of fics of this standard (or worse) in fanfic, but from what I understand, another reason why robst is hated so much is for all of these reasons plus the fact that his ideas start off interesting, but eventually all go down the same road. I think a fellow redditor put it this way: 'Once you've read one robst fic, you've read them all'.

Robst fics tend to be fics newcomers to the fandom start off with, given how high it is on the Favourites liston ffn.net. If you're new to the fandom, you'll probably soon realise that many other fanfics use the same tropes used in robst, but have better execution, more interesting exploration of those tropes and overall, are simply of better quality. If you're not, and you haven't read any of the better fics, well, just go through the request threads on the subreddit, you'll find some pretty amazing fics. If you just like robst regardless, then that's fine, just be aware robst will get you downvotes here, as you can see above.

Tl;dr, robst may seem interesting to newcomers, but read enough of fanfic, robst stories start to feel very stale and definitely undeserving of its rank on the Favourites and Follows list (Btw, I think the general popularity of robst probably has a lot to do with the hatred).
