I've somewhat exhausted my list of potential fics, so I'm on the search for more! Preferably with Luna or Fleur also involved, but it can be anyone else as well. c:


** linkffn(10493620) is Harry/Hermione/Theodore Nott that is quite unique and well-worth a read, in my opinion.

** Linkffn(7121913)

One of my favourite oneshots. A tad short and it's left open if it is the opening of a triad or just a physical, platonic relationship between a couple and a friend.

** Technically, my story "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water" qualifies - it's Harry/Hermione/Ron. Their relationship is already established, though.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

*** Advance warning on this one, the story is 40+ chapters and 400k+ words in and the romantic plot has advanced to Hermione turning red every time Harry is around.

Which is a good thing considering the ages, but it's not exactly a story about their relationship even if the future harem is obvious.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
