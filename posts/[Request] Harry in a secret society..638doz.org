** The Deathgate trilogy, starting with linkffn(2567446). It's the best of this type of fic, and has held up really well in the decade since it was written.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

** I dunno where the author's taking it, but the most recent plot arc in linkffn(More Than Equal by Ordinarily Prudent) has Harry joining a not necessarily secret yet reclusive society of elites known as 'The Mage Association.' They work for the betterment of magical society, dissemination of knowledge and any other goals those with the most influence in the group have. I'd say the story is slightly above average in quality.

*** I disagree; the author completely ignores harry's established character with three paragraphs of exposition rewriting everything about him. It was super cheesy. If that's your thing, more power to ya but to say it's 'above average' is honestly false advertising.
