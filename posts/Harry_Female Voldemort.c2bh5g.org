Am I the only one who read Limpiezi de Sangre by TheEndless7 and wanted way more of this pairing? I know his/her wasn't a true pairing by any means, and wasn't even romance, but it made me wish it was. I'm not hating on that story, I actually thought it was brilliant, though a bit depressing near the end. I just find it made me want way more.

So, I have two a few questions:

1. Does anyone know any good fics involving this pairing that are a decent length? I can't remember the name of it, but I've already read part of the one where Voldemort pretends to be a teacher and I'm not a fan.

2. Would people read a 200k+ word story on this pairing. I've been toying with the idea of it since reading TE7's LdS. I know I would do it one of two ways, but I don't know which of them I would go with; but if there's any interest I could totally see myself starting to post it this summer.

3. What would you guys even want from a Harry/Female Voldemort story? Or do you just find the pairing too ridiculous?

4. Do you think it works better if Harry travels back in time? Or in the present day? I've seen it done both ways, and both have their perks and drawbacks.

Also, if you guys want to read TE7's story (I strongly recomend it, though I'm sure most of you have already read it) here you go: linkffn(11752324)

** In addition to all the fics that were linked here (I love Power is Control and highly recommend it), there is also Descent.

!linkffn(10755261)

Descent is, unfortunately, abandoned, but it's notable for being a f!HP/f!TR, an ever rarer pairing.

Also, self-promotion time!

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

Departure from the Diary is a fic I made because I wanted to add something to the abysmal number of fics with this pairing. It's an experimental piece of writing for me (written in first person from a single character's perspective), so it's not my best work, but I'd like to think that it's worth a read. I plan on writing several scenes delving into Tamelyn's memories in the upcoming chapters.

  End of second year AU. fem!Riddle. Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Thankfully, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** YES!!! I loved Limpieza de Sangre and wanted more of Harry/Fem Voldemort but it's really hard to find good ones. To answer your questions:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12934044/1/Cleansing-the-Sins-of-the-Past]] (sequel to Limpieza de Sangre), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13250880/1/The-Advantages-of-Being-Sane]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12927826/1/Power-is-Control]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13102306/1/Gaining-Power]] (sequel to Power is Control), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm]]
2. I would definitely read 200k+ Harry/Fem Voldemort pairing :)
3. Anything you or any author is good for the story
4. I think Harry going back in time would make it easier for the author to write since there is the whole "Harry can change Fem Voldemort before she becomes evil" but doing to present day would give more interesting plot

** Thunderstorm is the only one I know of, but it's a great one. I'd definitely like to read something along the lines of what you're describing, I was disappointed there was such a lack there after i stumbled on thunderstorm.

Personally, I think back in time is the better way to go: it separates Voldemort from being such a monster a bit; especially the whole â€˜hideous due to rituals' thing.

** I completely agree and I also want more. That said there is another story that I think you might enjoy, it isn't a fem Voldemort (it's fem harry) it isn't a romance, (At least not between harry and tom), but /feels/ similar. Also, it's just really damn good. It hasn't been updated in a while but I don't think it's abandoned.

!linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding)

It deals with a lot of concepts in an interesting way. It gives Voldemort a reasoning behind his actions without justifying the atrocities he's permitted to do them, as well as taking an interesting route with the horcrux in Harry's scar

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
