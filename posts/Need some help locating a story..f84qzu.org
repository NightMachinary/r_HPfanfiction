The story consist of which I can confirm involvement between Harry and Susan Bones and Amelia Bones. From which I can remeber in the story Harry has some sort of relationship early and he goes to gringotts to his vault and picks up Christmas presents for Susan Bones and I feel like other girls which I believe to be Daphne and Hermione but the present he gifts susan I remember being a ring that only the lady of the house may wear. But it was defiently based off his inexperience that he didnt know that it was. If you could put my head at ease trying to figure out the story of this.


** Sounds familiar. Check Robst's page on ff.net. Sounds like something he might write.

** I swear to all that is mighty is that I have read curses cure like 3 times because I thought that was it and in still not finding the Christmas part to confirm that for a fact that it was the story. The main thing I'm leaning on is that it is defiently deals with a ring that was meant for the matriarch but he didnt realise that and I'm almost postive that it was not cursed cure. Unless it is past like chapter 20.
