Anyone stories where Hermione is a child of one of the founders (specifically Rowena or Godric), kinda like Harry in Baslisk-born. As in being somewhat immortal and starting school in 91 with Ron and Harry. The story would span over 1000 years. Plus if her parents are somewhat immortal to and takes the identity of Mr. and Mrs. Granger. Or at least one parents is immortal. Rubbish explanation but hopefully you get my point.

The other thing I'm thinking about is stories where Hermione is adopted as a Potter. Either through time travel (read all the usual suggestions) where she grows up as James sister, or Harry adopting her as a sister.

Thanks!


** The only one I can think of where Hermione gets semi adopted by Harry to gain the legal protection of the Potter family, even though it's just Harry and he isn't even pureblood, is linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), which is Harry/Hermione.

The only one I know where they become siblings through adoption is linkffn(The Accidental Animagus), but there it's Harry who's adopted by the Grangers, not the other way around, but while Hermione stays a Granger she's pretty much Harry's adopted sibling as far as the magical world is concerned.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I once read the beginning of a fic where Hermione has a close relationship with Remus, and travels back in time to the beginning of the marauder era and is adopted by The Potters, but I don't remember the name of it. Does anyone else?
