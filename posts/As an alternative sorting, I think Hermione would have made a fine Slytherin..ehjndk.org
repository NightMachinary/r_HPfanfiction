Every time the subject of alternative sortings comes up, its a general agreement that *Hermione* should have went to Ravenclaw, but honestly I think she would have done at least as well, if not better, in Slytherin. Yes, she values intelligence and learning a lot, but that doesn't mean being academic excludes you from any other house besides the Ravens. Heck, canon-Hermione herself is proof of this. As is Dumbledore and Merlin.

​

Hermione is driven, highly ambitious (her academic drive, SPEW, setting up the DA, Prefect), powerful (the DA coins, the space enlargement charm on the bag, getting the hang of spells really early on) and can be very cunning when she wants to (the plan to infiltrate the Slytherin common room, pretty much all of DH, precautions in regards to DA). She is analytical and always wants to have a plan in place before she engages into a certain action. Not to mention she quite clearly believes in ends-justify-the-means, as is shown by setting a teacher on fire, leading another teacher to what she no doubt thought will be a grueling death, or at least severe injury, stealing Dumbledore's books on Horcruxes (I hope my memory doesnt trick me on that one though), and kidnapping and holding hostage a journalist while in her Animagus form.

​

Tbh, I am kinda surprised she didnt dive a bit more into 'Dark Arts' too, since A. she clearly doesnt buy into Wizarding stereotypes/social norms unless she sees the value of them. SPEW shows this clearly. And B. she comes from a Muggle background. The Medieval-esque dichotomy between the forces of good and evil has long since ran its course. I totally see her researching Dark Arts just to see if they are truly, intrinsically evil, or if its all just social taboos Wizards have.

​

To quote the Hat, *Slytherin would help you on your way to greatness, no doubt.* More so than Gryffindor imo, and definitely more so than Ravenclaw, which would have offered her with the least amount of growth from where she was at 11.

​

*Draco Malfoy* Oh, boy. That kid was every negative stereotype about Gryffindor House, all rolled up into one person. Brash, obnoxious, always speaking his mind with not a single regard for consequences, pretty crappy at making up a cohesive plan. He wore his heart on his sleeve and he didn't even think about that not being anywhere near his ideal view of Slytherin. I think Gryffindor was a better choice for him. Not just because of his personality, but because it would have helped him grow out of his toxic mindset much sooner.

​

Ironically, the one alternative sorting I'm not feeling is the one that's actually canon. I really dont see Harry being Slytherin. Kid was a Gryffindor through and through. Maybe some comments will prove me wrong, but as it stands right now, I'm actually inclined to believe the Hat sensed the Horcrux and wanted to sort *it* into Slytherin rather than Harry.

​

Honorary mentions: Percy, Fred and George would have all done well in Slytherin. Especially Percy. Dumbledore doesnt really strike me as Gryffindor. It's... hard to say with him. I'm more inclined towards Ravenclaw>Slytherin>>>Gryffindor.

​

Any thoughts? And just as important, any fics with those sortings? Especially Gryffindor Draco, and him still being his canon self, at least at start.


** I always thought she was better in Hufflepuff. She was very hardworking and her loyalty to her friends was unquestionable.

BUT, her Gryffindor traits dominated her other traits. She was very brave. She set Snape's robes on fire in first year, who was most scary professor in Hogwarts. And in a dialogue in first book tells us why she was Gryffindor.

  Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.

  /"Hermione!"/

  "Harry - you're a great wizard, you know."

  "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.

  "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things --- friendship and *bravery* and --- oh Harry --- be /careful/!"
#+end_quote

It shows us that she valued bravery and friendship more than anything, so there was no question why she was in Gryffindor

IMO, this is why she wouldn't work in Hufflepuff. To me, her loyalty is with a small group of people (her friends). Hufflepuff loyalty, in my opinion, is to the house.

However, I do agree that her loyalty came out bc of Ron and Harry. I think it would be possible for the hat to realize this in a fic, but not as likely as her tendencies for other houses

** The sorting is about value as well as personality. Hermione herself, if I'm not mistaken, says she values bravery above all else. Yes, she could've, in theory, done well in Slytherin. Draco Malfoy, in theory and reality, would not have done well in Gryffindor.

Also, most characters could've fit in a different house. I think JKR, despite making Slytherin bad for most, did give us varying personalities in every house (though housemates are kinda similar). Only TMR and Slughorn fit perfectly.

Draco lured Harry and Ron to the Trophy Room and didn't show up. The bottle of mead plan was actually pretty good and he managed to get a bunch of Death Eaters in the school.

He's a century's old politician. It would be weird if he was. His younger self was kind, ambitious, loyal, intelligent, and arrogant. That describes half the characters.

They're ambitious, yeah, but so is Ron. One just lacks the drive. I don't see how you can look at Harry and call him a Gryffindor through and through and not feel the same about Fred and George. At their core they're not that different.

TL;DR yeah, I think, in theory, she could've done well in Slytherin.

**** For some reason, I always got the impression that Draco's previous attempts to kill Dumbledore were purposefully bad. Like I always thought that he was procrastinating as much as possible, but in order to make it seem like he was on top of everything to his parents and the other Death Eaters, he had to at least make some effort to kill dumbles. But since he was seemingly reluctant to finish the task (if the sobbing in the bathroom scene is any indication), he didn't actually try very hard. So to me, I thought it was actually a pretty clever thing for him to give the poisoned mead to Slughorn, as it meant 1) the DEs know he's trying to kill dumbles 2) Slughorn is probably going to drink it, as you said, and 3) Slughorn is like the most likely person at Hogwarts to have a bezoar or antidote close by, and therefore the least likely to actually be harmed.

** So here's my attempt at trying to convince you: Harry's not-so-obvious Slytherin qualities are why he's my favorite character.

He's ambitious as fuck. In every single book he finds a goal and uses every tool at his disposal in order to achieve it.

He follows the rules only when it suits him. He uses his invisibility cloak whenever he encounters an obstacle between him and what he wants (restricted section, spying on Draco, etc). He also does this repeatedly without even thinking about why it might be wrong.

He uses the half-blood prince's book to impress Slughorn, get on his good side, unrightfully earn the Felix Felicis, and ultimately get the answer about Horcruxes that he's looking for. (Not to mention using Sectumsempra without knowing what it was - a time where I think his Slytherin side scared him.)

He's a bit manipulative at times, like when he's double-crossing Griphook (he doesn't have to know when Harry's planning on giving the sword back).

He uses the Unforgivables (and in the books he does it WAY more than he does in the movies, also Ron never casts the Imperius - it's JUST Harry). There are the obvious Crucios against Bellatrix and Snape and Carrow, but most Slytherin of him I think is his repeated use of Imperio in the Gringotts break.

There are many other examples, but I'm on mobile right now... I just think all of those things are ALL Harry - not the sliver of Voldemort soul.

*** I agree with most that, aside from the 'ambitious as fuck' bit. I'd say he's more partly ambitious as fuck as he doesn't seem to do or want to do anything but play chess and Quidditch unless someone is less than twenty minutes from death, after which he finally gets his act into gear and pulls out all the stops to do things (Quirrell in book one, Ginny in book two, Sirius in book three. He starts to prepare a little more in book four, to the point of nearly oversleeping for the second task, but that's still mostly driven by Hermione and Ron). After the damsel is rescued and the adults give their regular pat-on-the-head-and-ignore-everything moment and wander off, he goes right back to complacency again.

(This is not me saying that all Slytherin actions are insidious - hell, I consider myself Slytherin.) I also see the Imperius as the most "give me what I want" out of all of them, which is Slytherin af.

Cruciatus is another story (and speaks to your point) because when Harry tried to cast it/did cast it, it came from grief and rage. With Imperius, it was absolutely him using any means to achieve his ends.

Harry is... well not necessarily contented, but certainly not setting sights high on what he wants to accomplish. 'Survival' is not usually a very ambitious goal. I suppose he isn't content in accepting his status as boy who lives, but he doesn't exactly work hard to defeat it either.

** I recently thought that Fred and George would have made very interesting Ravenclaws. I used to think with all their sneaking, scheming, and developing pranks and their strong ambitions to start their own joke shop that it would have allowed them a decent fit in Slytherin. Though of course the disregard for the rules, not being afraid of the possible consequences, and going against their mother's wishes so strongly has its obvious Gryffindor sides as well.

So, why Ravenclaw, you might wonder... The twins are witty and have creativity in spades. They invented so many sellable items! They conducted tests like crazed wizard scientists, tinkered out their products to a good, standard, and reliable quality, started a new subspecies, and managed to invest the money Harry gave them responsibly. As much as Ravenclaw gets admired for its academics, the house is also known for creativity, wit, individuality, and originality. I would argue that the twins possess all of these traits. Yes, including individuality. They have each other and are clearly fond of their family, but they also differ from their family. Molly kept comparing them to their older brothers, remember, and how Bill, Charlie, and Percy never got in as much mischief as them. Not to mention that neither of them became Prefect while all their other brothers did (and Molly casually overlooking this), and not even trying to "fit in" by doing great on all their OWLs. And we obviously see how Fred and George differ from their peers as well.

Of course the twins are also intelligent, despite not testing well or particularly caring for standardized academics. Besides, I think it would have appealed to them as a great joke to be in Ravenclaw with all their other siblings in Gryffindor, too. They'd certainly be able to see the humour in that. :)

That fic's Slyffindor Seven was a power crew that made everyone examine what House divisions really meant, and how we really /shouldn't/ let House affiliation get in the way of a quality friendship or alliance.

The fic is pretty dated, and unfinished, and involves sexual content that is probably against the rules of this sub to link, but it was a fic that rather /established/ a bunch tropes and really opened up a lot of people to the mixed bag qualities of Slytherin House.

It was also influenced by Anne Bishop, not quite a crossover, but if anyone recognizes the idea of witch v Witch from the Black Jewels, hmu via dm and I'll see if I can find this old gem and its parody fic too ;)

** My headcanon has always been that the hat sorts people not based on what they /are/ but what they /value/.

Virtues are often correlated. There's no reason why someone couldn't be clever and hardworking or brave and cunning- quite often those traits go hand and hand. And there are going to be plenty of 11 year olds who embody none of the traits of the Founders.

Hermione is undoubtedly bookish and clever, and also ambitious and at times manipulative. But that isn't what she values most. Even in Book 1 she states that "friendship and bravery" are far more important to her than her intellectual gifts. The hat sorted her based on that. To paraphrase Dumbledore 'It is not who we are born but who we choose to be.'

Also this interpretation helps us decode some otherwise inexplicable sorts (Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Pettigrew).

If I'm shown a canon Slytherin that was at least indifferent to muggles like most people in other houses seem to be, I'll take back my statement.

Slughorn is indifferent to muggles -- he lives among them when he's in hiding, and he doesn't differentiate between students with different blood status. I'm not sure how much more indifferent he could be.

As for Slytherins who are indifferent or better to muggles -- Andromeda Tonks, formerly Black. We know she's in Slytherin because every Black before Sirius was in Slytherin. She runs away to marry a muggleborn, so pretty sure she's okay with them.

And as for Slughorn, it's simply a point to his cunning that he hid among muggles because he genuinely believed no one would find him there as opposed to simply moving to a magical community in Any other part of the world. You can almost presume that he thought it would be the last place anyone would think to look because...who would think of muggles?

I'm not sure why it's so important to you to paint every character in the house this way, but the fact that multiple characters choose to engage with muggless/muggleborns is a point in their favor.

There are a handful of canon slytherins by your definition -- ones that we know don't like Muggles while they were in school: Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle. If you want to use that determine that 1/4 of the students of a school that's been around for 1000 years were racist to the core, that's your choice.

**** It's not just fanon, JKR 'told' that Slytherin was cunning and ambitious, and the hat suggested it wasn't all evil, it's just what she 'showed' never had any of that. I think this was basically a mistake. She tried to make up for it with slughorn but really she needed to have Draco get a redemption arc and/or introduce, for example, Daphne Greengrass as a good-guy Slytherin student

** A lot of ppl would've done well in Slytherin. Unfortunately, at the time of the HP books, it was seen as a “dark and evil” house. So unless you were a Death Eater kid, you wouldn't have gone in. I find it hard to believe Harry was the only one who knew that u could influence the hat's decision on what house to go. Like Harry, other ppl could've pushed for ravenclaw, the closest in my opinion to Slytherin or another house. After all, what kid wants to be seen as “evil”? At 11 years old?

I believe more in the values of Slytherin as the ambition and self preservation part but kids can be cruel. It's better to be seen as a brave hero rather than a snake soooo....

And families tend to stay in one house. Like Malfoy said “My whole family was in Slytherin”. I'm guessing this is the same for other dark inclined families. I can't imagine Crabbe and Goyle naturally ending up in Slytherin. They seem too dumb to function. So they posh just ask for Slytherin as per their family's wishes and to stick with Malfoy

On the mirror side, all weasleys have been in Gryffindor. I see how Percy and the twins lean on the ambitious side (starting their own business, climbing up in ministry) but they knew how badly it would make them look. Oh no >.> a Weasley went evil. They're in the snakes pit.

Hermione would have been a good Slytherin as well. She has so much ambition. Unfortunately at her sorting time, if she had gotten into Slytherin it would've been a death sentence for her. School politics would not allow her to thrive there.

All the Slytherins talked abt in the HP series we're all Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, etc. All pure blooded ppl obsessed with blood and think they're superior to everyone. The so called “evil” house would not have accepted a /mudblood/. 😒😒😒😒Just look at how Malfoy tries to call Hermione a mudblood every time he sees her to try and get under her skin. Snape as I remember was barely tolerated and he was a half blood. That's why he clung so hard to his mother's bloodline. “The Half Blood Prince” so no one will remember his filthy muggle father. The exact same thing Tom Riddle did. Hermione as a muggleborn would not have been tolerated at all. Even if she has excellent grades, all ppl will see is her muggle heritage. Heck, the Slytherins did this even when she was in Gryffindor.

** forgive me if im wrong but didnt Slytherin (person) hate muggleborns and didint want them in his house. if so wouldnt he enchant the hat with his ideals against muggleborns therfore barring muggleborns from entry into his house.

Tom Riddle got in as a decendant and ge was not muggle born just thought to be. other than that is there any slytherin that is a muggleborn?

** I am a big fan of the Slytherin!Hermione premise---when it's actually about facing adversity and rise to power, as opposed to a romance with a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Slytherin in Leather Pants]]. Unfortunately, it's slim pickings.

However, canon Hermione is a Gryffindor through and through. You write about her ambitions, but there are different kinds of ambition. When we speak of personal ambition and "greatness", we generally speak of what one might term "Slytherin-ambition", the pursuit of recognition, status, power, or just pleasure, stability, and creature comforts for oneself and one's own, while being fairly indifferent to everyone else's well-being. But, one can also speak of "Gryffindor-ambition" to make the world a better place, often whether the world wants it or not. In other words, what makes something "Gryffindor" as opposed to "Slytherin" is the end, not the means.

In his youth, Tom Riddle was planning how to avoid his own death. Dumbledore was planning to /take over the world/ for the greater good. Worst-case Slytherin is the memetic Hitler: a genocidal tyrant who oppresses you for the good of himself or of whatever group he identifies with; worst-case Gryffindor is the memetic Stalin: a genocidal tyrant who oppresses you for your own good. The character who exemplifies Slytherin at its best is Slughorn: an expert at the top of his lucrative profession, who trades favours and cultivates connections to improve his own life.

Now, Hermione does have a bit of Slytherin-ambition: she likes to be acknowledged as the smartest person in the room; but even about that, she is not that competitive: she doesn't resent Harry in the areas where he does better than her, doesn't try to catch up, and turns down the opportunity to use HBP's Potions textbook because she views it as cheating. Her ambitions are overwhelmingly Gryffindor-ambitions, no matter how ruthless she may be about pursuing them. If she were worried only about her DADA OWLs, she could have formed a study group with Harry and a few friends. Instead, she risked expulsion to make sure as many others as possible would be prepared. SPEW was her trying to break down a system /that she was benefiting from/.

Oh, and Draco is very Slytherin. Sure, his "ambitions" are petty and small-time, but they are all Slytherin-ambitions: they are ultimately centred around himself and maybe his immediate family. Can you imagine Draco sacrificing even his time and money, to say nothing of risking life and limb for anyone else? Along similar lines, Vincent Crabbe wasn't particularly clever, but he knew enough to follow Draco---and so benefit from his resources and prestige in Slytherin---until it was time to betray Draco in favour of a stronger master when Draco faltered. (Note that he wasn't particularly competent about carrying out the betrayal.)

Ravenclaw!Hermione was a closer thing, because she does like knowledge for its own sake---even if social reform takes precedence. I think that she would have probably fit in better there than she did in Gryffindor; perhaps to the point of becoming for her year in Ravenclaw what Draco was for his year in Slytherin.

In HBP, a competitive!Hermione would have made use of the HBP book when Harry offered to share. She went with her sense of fair play instead, a very Gryffindor decision.

She wants to prove that she better than the book, she can't be better if she's using it. She's used to being the smart one, she relishes it, which is why she gives in and helps/does the boys homework for them, and why her biggest fear is failure.

** I see the Weasleys, otherwise, no to all of it, and this is why I generally dislike alternative sortings. Hermione does have very ruthless qualities but the reasons Ron didn't like her at first would be 100x more offensive to Slytherins. SPEW and DA are morally driven, and she goes about it with no thought to the harm to herself. Harry isn't ambitious, but his sneaky rule-breaking behavior especially in the first few books is definitely 50/50 Gryffindor-Slytherin. Malfoy doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve, Harry generally socializes with the very pro-muggleborn side. We don't know what Ravenclws, etc generally thought about these issues and being outspokenly bigoted definitely wouldn't hurt him considering the social circles he ran in.
