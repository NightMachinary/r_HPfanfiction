As the title says, I'm curious on one would write a proper, in-character Luna which of course means none of that Seer-Luna stuff or really any of the other crazy takes on her character. I just want to think on the best way to characterize her as she is shown in canon. Bonus points for how to write her post-DH since I'd like to try something where she is moving more into adulthood because I have an extra hard time imagining how she would act as an adult. Some of her behaviors as a teen were eccentric and cute, but as an adult would be less so and I don't think she is quite as nutty as her father. I don't know. Just curious what people think about her.


** The most helpful advice I've ever received is to model your characters loosely on ones from other stories.

Luna is a complicated character because she has a very contradictory way of thinking it seems. She is very loose. Everything will eventually turn out okay - her shoes will come back. But she also goes out hunting for things that seemingly don't exist. She vigorously believes in these creatures, but she doesn't bother explaining herself to people who ridicule them. Luna always gives me the feeling of what people call a reincarnated soul - she has a contradictory type of thing where she is both way more mature yet not quite. She has the seeming wisdom of an old person at times with the curiosity of a child. Not to say she is wise, but it fits oddly. Maybe a character like Aang from Avatar could work depending on your view of him.

The most essential thing for Luna is her veil of mystery with a shade of lunacy. Her character works because she is less than a side character. I'm not sure how to alter her character to make it seem reasonable because she was designed not to be. It's easy to be mysterious when you don't see her internal explanations - if she would give you one anyways.

** The first thing I'd like to recommend is to write in third-person view--/Luna thought for a moment/ rather than /I thought for a moment./ It's how the canon books were written, and I think it may make things easier for you in general. (That's not a dig at first-person point-of-view writing in general, I enjoy it very much. But Luna's hard enough as it is).

Now getting into specifics, I'd say make a list of Luna's characteristics. And try to separate canon from Fanon as best you can. For example, there's no indication in the books that Luna walks around Hogwarts barefoot--that was only in one scene in the movies:

- Luna is compassionate.

Luna is very gentle when she comforts Harry after Sirius's death. She doesn't even deliberately broach the subject. She says "I'm sorry about your godfather," and then she mentions, again gently, that she believes she and Harry will see their loved ones again in the afterlife.

Luna also goes out of her way to comfort Hermione after Ron makes her cry. She initially thinks it's Moaning Myrtle when she goes to comfort her--which implies that Luna has comforted Myrtle. Which means Luna is a better person than I'll ever be.

Luna calmly reassures Harry when they are surrounded by Dementors during the Battle of Hogwarts. Dementors make you relive your worst memories. Luna saw her mother die. Three guesses what she's reliving at this moment. Dementors can suck out your soul, a fate worse than death, deprive you of the afterlife. Luna must be beyond terrified around Dementors, and yet she reaches out and reassures Harry to think of something happy.

- Luna will not change for anyone except for herself.

This part is especially important. Luna will not change unless *she* decides to.

As Rowling put it, Luna has the incredibly rare quality of "Not giving a damn what others think of her." Keep this in mind--Luna won't change because she's bullied. She won't change because her friends think she should.

Re-reading the scenes where Luna stands up for herself. She never actually does for herself. She stands up for the Quibbler--"My father's the editor. I'll have it back, thank you." She stands up for Harry, "You can laugh, but people used to not believe in the Crumple-Horned Snorkack or Blithering Humdinger either." She stands up for the people who tell stories to the Quibbler--"There have been loads of eyewitnesses [of heliopaths]."

If an adult Luna is clashing with co-workers, she will not change for them, unless she thinks it will make her do a better job.

- Luna is completely comfortable with death.

  Luna believes in an afterlife. She believes that those we love never truly leave us. For Luna, these aren't platitudes for a funeral, they're central to her character.

--------------

So going on from there, what is Luna's motivation? A quest for truth? A quest for friendship?

If this is post-DH, is she still at Hogwarts? With Ginny and Hermione? Does she spend much time with them? Remember that Ginny and Luna are frequently seen in each others' company in /Order of the Phoenix/ despite being in separate Houses, and that was before everything that happened afterward. Hermione shared a room with her in Shell Cottage: Did Luna comfort Hermione after a nightmare? Did Luna recognize that Hermione have secrets she didn't want to share?

Or what about Xenophilius? He sold Harry out to Voldemort. While canon implies the Trio didn't elaborate on what happened, will you have Luna find out? Is she angry? Sad? Indignant? Would she have preferred dying to having Harry betrayed? Does she think the Death Eaters would have killed her anyway?

And as for her eccentric traits from her childhood, I'd like to point out this particular quote from C.S. Lewis, as I think it sums up a philosophy that Luna would be very comfortable with:

“When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty, I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”

*** Thanks so much for the advice. You had some good questions and analysis here. I think this will help me a lot. I usually write in third-person anyway so that won't be a challenge for me.

**** You're welcome!

Oh, and one other important thing. Most of Luna's odder moments in canon are when she's in mixed company, usually in the DA, but also the Quidditch commentary.

When Luna is in a group, she's more outspoken. She is fierce to defend the Quibbler in front of people she knows don't agree; she laughs so hard she cries after Ron tells a not-particularly creative joke, and is laughing so hard, she's completely oblivious to the others having started laughing at her instead of with her. Funnily enough, Luna's overactive sense of humor isn't touched on much in fanfic.

When Luna is by herself, or with just one or two other people, she's often much quieter, and this is when her compassion shines. She reaches out to Hermione alone. She comforts Harry alone. She spends a great deal of time alone with Mister Ollivander and he later describes her as an immeasurable comfort.

It may be a good idea to give Luna a confidant of her own. She comforts others, but who gives her comfort when she's upset? Canon does imply that Ginny has stuck up for her in the past--Luna mentions in passing that Ginny has stopped people from calling her Loony.

** Read through her dialog (and maybe watch the 5th movie) to dump out the fanon portrayal from your brain.

Maybe take some time and write out her motivations. What are her goals? What interests her? What are her insecurities? How would the events of the war (e.g. her father betraying Harry, her long-term imprisonment) affect her?

I think you're right. Young adulthood is a transitional stage, but without social pressure to drop her nutty behaviors she probably wouldn't unless there was internal motivation for the change ("I don't want to be like my father" type reasoning)

Oh, yes. As much as I hate that movie(it is my least favourite for several reasons), Evanna Lynch's portrayal of Luna is */spot-on/*.

***** Yeah, I agree. There were definitely some good parts from the movie but overall it is not the best. Luna was portrayed very well by Evanna Lynch.

** Reiterating some of the other comments on this thread: I think some of Luna's most important, and often overlooked, characteristics are her quiet compassion and her desire for understanding (not knowledge per se, but understanding). Convey these traits, along with her whimsy and curiosity, and you'll do great by Luna! Amazing Luna posts in this thread!

** In my opinion, Luna, like the Dursleys, was meant to be over the top. I think that even if Rowling herself were to write a story about Luna, it would be underwhelming. Luna is enigmatic largely because we don't see her much. The few times we do see her, she says something strange and memorable. If we read about her all the time, she would lose her charm. That's why most Luna fanfics are average at best.

Something I've noticed is that most characters with alliteration follow archetypes. Pansy Parkinson, Luna Lovegood, Dudley Dursley, Severus Snape. As interesting as Snape becomes in the later novels, his earlier characterization is like the rest in that the reader remembers him and only has one attitude towards him. No one has empathy for Pansy or Dudley because they are 1) unattractive 2) dimensionless. If Luna were not described so ethereally, she would not have the fan base she has. If she had any characterization that made her more real, then she wouldn't be Luna. Whenever there is a Luna scene, her physical features are often mentioned as an introduction as a way to get the reader to remember how ethereal and transcendent she is.

** Read stories by Northumbrian (on AO3 is probably the best archive), it's best one in my opinion. Still a bit crazy, but not unrealistic crazy. Lovely.

** Hello!

I recently finished a long time story of mine where I tackled making Luna one of the main protagonists, I'm not going to say that I did it /right/ or that I did it /well,/ but from the reader reception my version of Luna seemed to come across pretty well.

Most authors tend to embrace the "Looney" aspect of Luna- I personally dislike writing a character like this. The joy of being the author, is that /you/ get to decide how to develop your characters properly.

I decided to make Luna have a...form of synesthesia (A disorder where stimuli are 'cross wired', examples are things like individual numbers have a colour, sounds have a distinct taste, sometimes words have sounds.) I used this to loosely imply some of her behaviour and perspective, since she literally interprets the world differently.

I also made sure that I didn't write Luna as a.../good/ character. She was neutral, made some wonderful choices, and made some absolutely terrible choices with the best intentions.

The hardest thing to accept is that people will /always/ hate the way you write Luna, so the closest to canon with a distinct twist to it is the best way I've learned. I've also learned, that writing Luna in first person will never go over well. Luna's charm is the insane layer that she blatantly, or accidentally uses. Maybe its a coping mechanism, maybe its her actual personality that is revealed behind the strange sentences of her. To write Luna as a normal character is hard, but if you write her with her strange habits you need to make sure they are /consistent,/ and make sense (even if only to her.)

** Luna is whimsical; she has a childlike wonder, but is very perspective as well. She's able to talk to Harry, after Sirius was killed, she's able to see that it was Harry through the Polyjuice Potion (Something that shouldn't have been able to).

In my opinion she's the total opposite of Hermione, probably why Hermione is often irked by her.

Hermione is rule abiding; fearing being expelled more than death in the early books, not willing to think of authority as being wrong, being very logical.

Luna appears to be the opposite; while it doesn't seem she's very caring about the rules, or about being expelled, or by what the authority think. (She and her father wrote in the Quibbler after all; people going to that more for more truthful statements during the war).

She's very caring (Like I said, able to talk to Harry; when no one else was really able to talk to him during his dark time).

She likes to think of random conspiracies or of random creatures as well (Having that whimsical childlike; wonder that I talked about).

Luna is one of my favorite characters; she's incredibly difficult to write well; but she's amazing (to me).
