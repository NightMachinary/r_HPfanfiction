** If you find Draco Malfoy the Amazing Bouncing... Rat? by maya, it's from Draco's pov, but it mentions Murphy's law and stuff. Not really the same because nobody's prepared, but a lot does go wrong.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** There are a few stories I have read that mention Murphy's Law but it is rarely more then a single mention. Similar to that there are several fics where Harry refers to himself as "Fate's Bitch". The two stories listed below have 3+ mentions.

** Harry learns to expect things to go wrong, because he has some kind of reset-after-death ability instead of the usual plot armour, in linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter). Ran away from Dudley in the wrong direction? Picked up by a Death Eater, knife to the chest. Got separated from friends on the Hogwarts Express? Expect to land on the tracks.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/]])

Timely Errors is a fun story with essentially that. It's a Thursday and things always go wrong on Thursdays and he ends up being covered in time sand and sent back in time. It's just good craic really! The DADA teacher is a Moody-esque knock off and Harry's trying to avoid him because they're too interested in Harry's experience with Unforgivables. It's back to Marauders but the Marauders don't like him which is a different dynamic. It's fun I recommend it!

Harry is very 'Well this just may as well happen my life is dumb enough as is". It's very funny. Very Murphys Law.
