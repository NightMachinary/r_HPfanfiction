I'm looking for a fic that has Hermione not believe Harry about the TWT, and has Harry not forgive Ron and Hermione for not believing him about the Triwizard tournament, like in A Cadmean Victory No slash please, thanks!


** I'm pretty sure that Hermione believed Harry from the start and spent a lot of time helping him prepare even for the first task.

**** What you specified was that Harry not forgive Ron and Hermione as the point of divergence. You didn't specify that Hermione not believing Harry about TWT was an additional point of divergence, so I thought that you might have been misremembering canon.

*** I thought she was skeptical, but didn't want to leave her friend to face whatever was there, but it has been a while since I read the books. (Like a year)
