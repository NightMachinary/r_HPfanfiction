*** Basically, writers trying to say that Harry's bad luck is because of a curse or something like that and that it's common to all the Potters. Like how some people say that untidy hair is common to all male Potters.

***** The whole shitty luck thing is based on how Harry seems to get involved in every bad thing that happens at the school, rather than say killing curses. So if you wanted to you could argue that he isn't lucky or unlucky, but rather just filled highs and lows with nothing in between.

** For those who dont know, Potter luck is basically getting into scenarios that are crazy. Ie. Fighting a basilisk, Quirrilmort, Triwizard tourney. If the story is after canon, the list might include: getting blackout drunk and waking up in Africa atop a dead Nundu that you mysteriously killed, or getting a drink in a bar, and somehow being recruited by the Italian Magic mob.... Basically stuff that could only happen to the main character

** this is one thing I don't particularly mind, as I feel like it's human nature to look at odd occurrences and try to name something like that, generally with a roll of the eyes, ha ha. I have had some really good luck in certain circumstances, and know very well how mercurial fate would be if it was a person, and I ended up coining a term for when those really weird unexplainable things happen to me; so it's pretty natural for characters to look at someone who has weird bad things happen a lot that he's also /somehow/ able to stumble through and survive.

Some writers take it a bit far, but it's less of an issue for me than a few other tropey tropes

What about it annoys you though, because it might be some other reference that I haven't read?

** If there is a legit reason for it, it's fine. Potter luck, more often than not resembles Devil's Luck in many ways. Ones luck in a situation is inversely proportional to the skill/luck in gambling.

There's one fic that the Potters got a blessing from an Incubus, and then later got cursed by a Succubus. This resulted in Potter Luck.
