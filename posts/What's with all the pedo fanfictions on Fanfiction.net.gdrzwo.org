So many Harry Potter/Snape, Hermione/Snape, Harry Potter/VOLDEMORT, etc etc. It's all very disturbing how well received these stories seem to be by the community.


** Well, as a former Snarry fan I can only justify what I felt at the time. Maybe other people's experiences were vastly different.

I started reading SSHP when I was about 16/17 years old (for context, this was around the time HBP and DH came out). At the time, I found it was a major turn on to imagine a relationship with someone much older, and so I guess I transposed that into the kind of fanfiction I liked reading. Although I am female, my favourite character was Harry, and I always felt a love-hate relationship with Snape. The guy was both hideous and strangely compelling as a character. Given their animosity towards each other, it follows by the law of fanfiction they should bang, right? Right? It was quite telling that I was disturbed by fics that portrayed Harry as a fifth year or lower - basically, younger than I was at the time was pedophilia, at my age it was OK (because 16/17 year olds are very mature, of course /s).

Looking back, I am quite put off by the pairing. I guess I could read some where both are consenting adults, although the fascination with that pairing was long since worn off, but Hogwarts-era is just horrifying. I can only guess that most fanfic readers of these pairings were like me - they wanted to read about a character their age being romantically involved with someone more mature, and in their minds it was OK because they thought they were mature enough to handle it and consent, and therefore the character would be in the same position. In retrospect it is revolting and completely ignores the fact that an adult would basically be preying on a child, which is the other side of the coin that I could not see at the time.

** As someone who has read and still reads a lot of HG/SS fics, I agree a lot of them are disturbing and problematic. The power imbalances, the age difference, etc.

As a kid I didn't realize that at the time. Though I certainly never read any fics where she was as young as 12.

Now I do and I don't read those types of fanfic anymore. There are certainly a ton of HG/SS fanfics where Hermione is an adult, where the power imbalance is addressed, etc.

I started working in a school at 18 and was warned that even if I was dating a 16/17 year old in any context, then it is against the law. I worked in primary, btw - so they weren't saying 'don't date anyone at the school'. Luckily for me, my partner is older than me.

** CW: rape, sexual assault, pedophilia

Honestly yeah I have a problem with many fics like this. For one, many detail explicit sex with minors. Secondly they do so without attending to any kind of power relations. Like, NO. An 11 y/o cannot fully consent to a 45 year old man who is in a position of authority over him/her/them. And adding magic in doesn't change that.

I feel like that shouldn't have to be said.

Something about fanfiction makes people believe it's fine to celebrate statutory rape. It's one thing to write about it & it's another to write an entire story where the plot is: look statutory rape is fantastic bc they are magical & the 12 y/o is on board. üòë

People think it's fine bc "they're not real" and "it's probably a 12 year old who wrote it" but these excuses make no sense anywhere else. If your uncle just decided to tell you a fake story about statutory rape that was fantastic would you like that? If they made a TV series celebrating statutory rape would people be on board? No

Obviously everyone has different ethical boundaries, so I can't say it's not ethical for everyone but it's certainly not ethical to me.

Very few people argue that rape is an unacceptable topic. Much more common is the opinion is that it is a sensitive topic, and that many stories fail to appropriately handle it or unnecessarily use such a serious issue that impacts people in real life as a lazy trope to further the plot, and that doing so can be harmful.

***** "Literal pedophilia" involves real children and real sexual predators. Please stop muddying the waters by calling fanfiction pedophilia. Characters can't be harmed by writing about horrible things happening to them, whereas real children don't need fandom crusaders whipping up false accusations that do absolutely nothing to protect them and that associate a very necessary word for sexual abuse with online, amateur storytelling. I mean, come on. Have some perspective.

There's a puritanical, controlling streak in fandom these days that tends toward vicious denunciations that have actually harmed real people by running them out of fandom or doxxing them for shipping characters with an age difference.

****** so it is okay to write fictional pedophilia, then, just because it isn't really hurting anybody? this kind of thing only encourages real predators - it provides them with something that is far from therapy, but actively encouraging abusing minors in a multitude of ways. i think that as someone who has been groomed, i am perfectly valid in saying that writing about pedophilia is fucking repulsive if you don't handle it carefully and treat it like it's somehow romantic. and even if it didn't stop my abuser, i certainly don't enjoy the idealization of it that is said to 'not be important' by people like you.

i mean, most of the comments on ao3 with fics like these are like 'oh this is so hot' or 'this is so sad but so wellwritten :((' and if you'll look carefully, you'll see that people are /genuinely getting off to this./ what's next, real child porn? some people genuinely only write this. it's not just mistaken teenagers thinking that an age difference between a teenager and a middle-aged man is okay, it's people churning out vernon dursley fucking harry in the ass as a child or something equally disgusting.

that's all. also, it's just being a dick to point out 'literally' like that when the actual definition is commonly not used for anything but emphasis.

#+end_quote

Yes, it is. Just as it's okay to write fictional murder. And no, most fanfiction of that kind isn't "actively encouraging abusing minors" and I've never seen anyone produce proofs of a correlation between fanfiction and an increase in pedophilic abuse or activity; or fanfiction and murder. Since fictional characters don't even exist, it's dubious to insist that what a person finds hot in a story, with those particular characters, dynamics, and make-believe, would bear any resemblance to what they condone in real life. Many women have rape fantasies; I haven't met anyone who actually believes that real-life rape is like that, and we certainly don't want it happening to us. These are highly charged and extremely emotional areas, so making personal accusations without foundation is not helpful. If someone allegedly crosses that line, they should face arrest and a court of law, just as, if a fan writer or reader were to allegedly murder someone, they should stand trial. Any reprehensible acts that are taken out of the realm of fiction and performed in the real world are in a different category, because they directly harm real living human beings, and there are pre-existing laws to deal with that.

What happened to you is frightening and horrible. Real-life pedophilia is a despicable criminal act, and it ought to be prosecuted, and kids need to be protected. That's not in dispute, as far as I'm concerned. And to make matters more difficult, several of the writers I know who have written underage content (and whose stories are brilliant, although dark) are people who have been sexually abused themselves. They identify with damaged characters.

I'm not idealizing anything in fandom. What is there to idealize? And I prefer dysfunctional relationship stories to romances myself. But I don't believe that challenging the increasingly widespread assumption that writing underage content endorses real-life pedophilia is somehow saying that pedophilia "isn't important." There are a lot of slippery-slope arguments in fandom, about this subject and others. I've never read the Vernon Dursley fic and never will, but yeah, I believe it exists. I don't believe it represents a support of pedophilia because I know nothing about the author or the context. People write dark fic all the time; to me, it sounds like a horror story.

And no, I wasn't being a dick. Take "literal" out of the equation, and it still isn't pedophilia. On the other hand, if you're going to use terminology describing criminal behavior or intent, and if the implication is that the authors or readers are therefore liable, be precise in how you phrase it. "Pedophilia" is an act deserving of incarceration. "Literal" is a word that currently means two exactly opposite things, and colloquial usage for intensifying a statement doesn't cancel out an even longer history of meaning "factual." You were basically pointing a finger and saying, "This is pedophilia."

However, one reason I'm fed up with this backlash is that I know three people who have been hounded out of fandom due to "pedophile" discourse. One I don't know well enough, and we don't share a fandom. The other two had never written underage content at all, but the fandom attack dogs condemned their ships. They were slandered in public posts. Capslocking bloggers threatened to contact their employers. They were bombarded with messages to kill themselves, with graphic descriptions of various ways they should die. They took all their fanfiction down, for every fandom they were in, and deleted their fandom presence. And it was all about ship wars and the way fans on a power trip will irresponsibly equate an age-gap ship (a 23-year-old having sex with a 26-year-old, in one case) with child abuse. It's been going on for years, and the intimidation culture that uses "pedophilia" as its rallying cry thrives on bullying people.

** It mostly feels like authors (and readers) forget the characters real age. How many fics actually have Harry acting like an eleven year old? It's mostly OC characters all the author's age, shoved into the bodies and setting necessary to make fanfic. With written stuff there's no real visual cues to go "fuck this person is way too young". It's mostly "what if Harry fights the basilisk and then gets together with Tom" with the Harry in their brain resembling themselves and the Tom resembling their fantasy boyfriend. Then story!Harry ends up 12 because that's how old he was when those events happened in canon.

I find these stories a lot more palatable if you mentally add 7-10yrs to all of the Hogwarts students and just pretend this is a university fic. That age also tends to fit their characterization better.

** It's fiction. Fiction is filled with a ton of things that would be super problematic in real life, but people seem to forget, they AREN'T real life.

Look at any freaking vampire teen romance. Look at the huge number of shapeshifter romances that border just on the edge of beastiality (and probably plenty of self-published ones that cross the line). Look at shows like Dexter, or Breaking Bad, where the protagonist is a very bad person.

Look at the huge number of middle-grade and YA books that have kids facing things that would be hugely scarring and traumatizing for anyone in real life, while adults act completely irresponsibly. Heck, look at horror stories. People enjoy writing those and enjoy reading those, even though some are extremely disturbing.

But we enjoy all of that. Because it's fiction. No one thinks it's okay to look at a horror author and say ‚Äúwell, he's obviously a psychopathic sadist, look at what he writes,‚Äù or at a woman who enjoys shifter romances and say ‚Äúshe's obviously into beastiality, look at what she's reading.‚Äù

Most people are able to acknowledge the line between fiction and reality. They understand that the story that they're writing only exists in words and images in their mind. No one is actually getting hurt. There isn't really a 200 year old vampire romancing a 17 year old girl, or a werewolf ‚Äúalpha‚Äù dominating some woman.

The same applies to underage fics. Some people enjoy reading or writing those stories. They know it isn't real, the same way we know that a story about a demon clown in the sewers isn't real.

It's a form of entertainment that allows people to explore their darker sides without hurting anyone. That is not a bad thing. It might make you uncomfortable, but not liking something doesn't mean it's bad. It just means you don't like it.

My point was that people fantasize about very disturbing things that they never want to happen in real life. Quite a few women fantasize about being raped and even act out this fantasy in a safe way in a bdsm environment with a partner they trust, yet they would not enjoy being raped for real.

Adult fiction (and many of the r-rated fanfics are adult fiction) is primarily about fantasy. Just bc somebody reads and writes fanfic about underage HP characters does not mean they are pedophiles. (Just like reading and enjoying rape fic does not make you a bad person.)

Yes, I have read Harry/Draco, Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione stories where they were still at Hogwarts and going at it like bunnies. Does not mean that I would enjoy watching a video of underage teens doing the same. Actually, I think I would be quite disturbed and horrified. I used to enjoy such stories with younger protagonists when I was a teen myself. When I re-read my fav fics from that time again, I automatically age them up in my mind.

I am feeling transported back the early 2000s when many people decided that "adult rated HP fanfiction should not exist, those are kids, it is pedo porn" and pressured Warner Brothers and thus fanfiction.net to delete anything that had a higher rating than PG. IMO people need to chill out about this, bc it does not solve the underlying problem that the human mind is a dark and disturbing place.

Regarding pedophilia being a mental illness: yes, it is treated as such by many. But I do not think this is a good solution.

More modern approaches to pedophilia and mental health all acknowledge that there are people who are hardwired into being attracted to children and young adults and that this attraction is difficult to impossible to change. The goal is thus not to cure them, the goal is to teach the afflicted coping strategies. Many who are attracted to children and seek therapy for this understand intellectually that a child cannot give consent and that a sexual encounter is traumatic and extremely damaging to the child. They have no wish to hurt children, yet at the same time yearn for companionship with a person they are sexually attracted to. For people in such a situation it would be potentially dangerous to read porn involving underage characters.

Does not justify a blanket ban on adult-themed HP fics. YMMV.

** It's kind of intrinsic to any HP fanfic where sex is a thing, since most of the main characters are minors. You either have extreme age difference, two minors getting it on (not much better form a "is this pedo porn?" angle), or you age up the characters...

And while the last results in not-pedo porn, you have to make major changes to a lot of character (since people change as they grow up) and it's more like OCs in an offshoot of the main HP setting rather than fan-fiction of the major characters.

Or you just do what the book did and ignore sex as a thing that people do, but that cuts don on available themes a lot.

I do something similar to this; I make the sex happen offscreen. Even ignoring the fact that I'm very bad at writing sex scenes in general, I feel like I can tell my stories without having to get explicit about two teens having sex. It can be referenced, characters can talk about it, but I've just never felt like my story would be improved if I got more explicit.

That said, I will sometimes go a bit more risque with adults, but not too much more so. And I imagine if I ever wrote a rape scene I'd have to go a bit more explicit that I like to, but so far I've not ever written a story containing rape.

Looking back on my youth, it was fucking tragic how little education there was to accurately warn teenagers against these kind of relationships. Yeah there was those assemblies, but who really paid attention? All we were really taught was worst-case scenarios and just told no.

I distinctly remember being the only one of my friends in high school that balked at the idea of these kind of stories (and that kind of attention from older individuals in general), and that was only because I had been victimized at a /very/ young age and saw nearly every unrelated male that was the slightest bit older than me as a potential threat.

** I've been a crusader against this garbage for as long as I've been part of the community.

As an Aro Ace person (Meaning Aromantic Asexual), I generally avoid romance fics on principle, which has resulted in me not reading this shite, but it's still a massive problem in the community. There are people who defend this stuff with pedophile rhethoric, like "it's not real", which is an evasive stance and clearly shows that they don't see the severity of this situation.

Worse, there are authors who exclusively write stuff like this. I know there is one person who self-describes as a "tomarry writer" in this community, which made me sick when I learned about it during an interaction in one of my discussion threads. They went on to say "it just happens", which is highly disturbing.

Rule 8 has done a lot to help for this small niche of the community, but the source of the problem still exists out there. There are too many degrees of seperation between me and people like this, so I can't tell you /why/ they do it, but the fact remains that they do do it.

(Another major part is that most of these pairings are Slash, and that Slash in general is all but exclusively these pedophilic pairings. Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Snape and Harry/Lucius make up 70-80% of all slash, and that's *not* an exaggeration. Add on Harry/Draco and you have 90-95%, but that one isn't as problematic as the other ones. This gives proponents of these practices a hiding spot and a shield to use - if you are against this, that means you are "against slash", and therefore homophobic, when really you're against pedophiles. The people of course react accordingly.)

Bad situation all around.

I strongly disagree. I would say that in HP slash Harry is far more likely to be paired with Draco than with Snape or another significantly older person. Actually I would say that HP/DM is the most common romantic pairing in all of HP fanfic. This is supported by the data released by fictionalley in the early 2000s when I was most active in the fandom. I doubt it has changed that much. I would say that I've seen a rise of more het and gen fics since then, but in slash Harry/Draco is still the most common pairing.

That /is/, in fact, an exaggeration. It's hard completely accurate data, but filtering AO3 by M/M, 40k out of 115k fics are tagged Drarry (that's 35%), 15k are Wolfstar (13%), and only in third place you have Snarry with 11k stories (9%), out of which is hard to tell how many are actually about school-age Harry with an adult Snape, but only 1k of them are tagged as underage, so considering generously that plenty of people don't tag properly, I'd say there's maybe 4-5k stories, a staggering....4%. Wow. Tomarry (which is specifically a different tag than Harry/Voldemort on ao3, and many Tomarry fics have them both at the same age) only has 3k stories. Harry/Lucius and Harry/Voldemort don't even appear on the top 10.

And you know what? If you're against slash because you just don't like slash, that's fine, but if you're against slash because you're against pedophilia, then yes, that's a bit homophobic of you. On AO3, 5% of M/F fics are tagged underage, compared to 6% of M/M fics. It just looks like there's so much more because there's more slash /in numbers/.

And that's what tags are for. To filter out content you don't want. The golden rule of fanfiction: don't like it, don't read it, and the back button is right there.

That's not "pedophile rhetoric," dude. It's the truth.

So, as a Snape/Harry writer, I'm curious to know what you propose to do. I've already taken my lumps from Tumblr fandom and been called a pedophile for shipping Snape/Harry and Twelfth Doctor/Clara Oswald in Who fandom, so go ahead and get in line. Are you going to call me sick to my face? Are you setting yourself up as the arbiter of what's allowed in fandom, what's prosecutable, what's morally acceptable and what needs to be run out of town on a rail? Are you going to tell me that you, as an aro ace person, understand the indirect relationship of sexual fantasy to fictional dynamics better than I do, and that you can judge what I get out of the dramatic, self-indulgent, sometimes highly inventive, sometimes naive stories in my corner of fandom through your filter of bad faith and drum-beating hatred? You definitely have the tone of someone trying to stir up a mob mentality by using loaded words like "disturbing" and "worrying" and "garbage," not to mention the casual, profligate use of "pedos." You don't know jackshit about the people writing these stories. There are a /ton/ of "Tomarry" and "Snarry" writers and readers in fandom, and none of them, to my 15-year-knowledge of HP fandom, has ever been guilty of anything more than bad SPaG or bad characterization. Yet you're using this sub as a platform to spew accusations without evidencing any actual commitment of a crime, just fomenting an emotional attitude that can be used to incite agreement. Because to disagree, of course, means to be guilty of "pedophile rhetoric."

So I'd like to know, what is it you're trying to accomplish here? HP fandom is known for shipping everything with everything. Some of the fics are extremely disturbing, and I've learned to spot the ones I don't want seared onto my memory. But you're randomly characterizing anyone who ships certain pairings as literal predators, people whose fumbling fictional romances condemn them as undesirables who need to be driven out.

Seriously, what are you trying to do? I find your contemptuous, poisonous rhetoric far more disturbing than any fic I've come across, because you're not just expressing your disgust for pairings you obviously loathe; you're not just shuddering away from upsetting scenarios; you're taking aim at authors, the real people making up sexy, silly, unbelievable stories for entertainment, and I find that fanatical focus a little bizarre.

Hey, my dude. Thank you for expressing your insanely valuable opinion all over this comment.

You didn't ask any question - so I'm going to grab your accusations and venting by the neck and ask my own.

Why do you write stories about adult men and children having sex? Because that's what it comes down to. You can hide behind flowery language all you want, but unless you do a timeskip or a time travel or skew their ages, that's what it is. If you take those measures, then my comment wasn't aimed at you. If you do write them with unchanged ages, and as you say, find it "sexy", then /I/ find that very, very worrying.

How don't you see that this is /sick/? I'm talking as a person whose two best friends are survivors of a predator. Abuse of this kind isn't a joke or lighthearted fun. It is /sickness/. It is /twisted/. It's an act that should never be accepted in our society, enlightened though we may be. It's a thing that requires such a warped sense of what is wrong or right to accept that I can't help but wonder about yours.

Those are my two questions for you. I also see your aphobia and think you're a massive jackass for that alone. It's obvious that my comment hit a personal note for you - this may be a moment for introspective. Is this really the hill you want to die on? Defending pedophilia?

I think you're a little one-track-minded here. And you haven't given me evidence that fanfiction contributes to pedophilic behavior in society or in fandom itself. I've also noticed that it tends to be women's sexual fantasies in an amateur arena that draws all this rage and high dudgeon and denunciation. All the antis I've run into have wielded their accusations as a way to bash and dogpile other people in fandom, when if you really wanted to make a difference, you could take your ire and your burning desire to catch predators and volunteer with the CPS where you might have a chance of actually helping someone.

My "hill" is fiction, even dark fiction, even sexual fantasy. And it's not aphobic to wonder if an aromantic ace person would have the same relationship to sexual kinks as a sexual person. Maybe you do. Maybe, like the one declared aro ace person I know, you have zero interest in fictional smut. But you seem to have set yourself up as an authority on what the relationship is between dark sexual fantasy and real life behavior, and you're on a self-proclaimed "crusade" to cleanse fandom of "garbage." The last time I saw such ardor to expel fans for writing the wrong kind of sex, it was a Christian watchdog group threatening LiveJournal with legal action. In that case, it was also "underage" material, but strangely enough, it meant a lot of LGBTQ journals got deleted as well.

I realize that your niche probably attracts a lot of people who assume you do write about sexual relations between children and adults, but if you don't actually do that, then none of my comment is applicable to you.

The problem is that people like that exist. Look in this thread, browse Ao3 with your pairing as a filter. It's sickening. That is what I'm against.

And brother, the aphobic part wasn't that you "wondered". It was that you assumed I had no idea how romantic/sexual relationships work based on a stereotype.
