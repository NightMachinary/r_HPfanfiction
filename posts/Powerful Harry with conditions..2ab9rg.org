I want to find a fic that has a relatively powerful harry, but I really dont want one where he starts out OP at birth and unlocks magical powers, would be great if he works towards them. Would be great if its super long going forwards from first year. Also im ok with any pairing. I can not stand anything that resembles robst's fics ( so no harry becomes a smooth talking gentleman badass who is completely in love with hermione and willing to kill people in the great hall.) No unnecessary snape or dumbledore hate fics please. That's really the only set in stone thing I need but I obviously dont want something that is absolutely nothing like what I said.


** Have you considered Shezza's Denarian series (starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian Renegade]] and has a number of subsequent novels in the series, totaling around 700k words)? It's a crossover with Jim Butchers /Dresden Files/ series, but you needn't familiarity with that series to enjoy. It tells the story of a sarcastic, anti-hero Harry who happens to have a fallen angel in his head. There's no H/Hr (quite the opposite--Hermione loathes him) and Harry's interactions with a sympathetic Dumbledore character are very good.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni Sama. Harry starts out a pretty normal first year kid, and by the current update point (147 chapters and counting) he's a total badass, but his powers come as a result of bad / big things that happen to him, as a result of Voldemort (who's kind of a good guy) taking an interest in him. Probably my favorite fic of all time, but be warned, it's got a higher word count than the HP series itself, and Harry is technically still in sixth year.. (I think.) Pairings so far have been Harry/Luna and Ron/Hermione, but the fic is constructed so that it's like an entirely different world (almost) so almost all of the characters are a little different from their canon counterparts. Snape is one of Harry's mentors, but Dumbledore is the bad guy in this fic.. (but he's not headmaster, he's over in Germany or something. Since Voldemort took over Britain, Dumbledore is the de facto bad guy to Britain, but he's pretty true to canon so far... well intentioned, but very much for the greater good.) And Harry is definitely not a smooth talking killer. Even after six years being groomed by the Dark Lord, he's still very much Harry, friendly, doesn't like to use force when he doesn't have to, desperate need to be loved, super loyal to his friends and family, etc. I'm probably selling the fic short... just go give it a shot, and you'll see if you like it or not. The first 20 chapters are pretty much indicative of the pace... it's got political intrigue and world building like crazy, so it moves slower than most fics do, but I think it's the better for that.

Hope this helped!

*** Oh, I couldn't get to the end of the first year in that story. Harry is so offensively "everyone is wrong and I'm right", and gets away with that attitude around Snape (bordering silly), Bellatrix (now that's just wrong) and Voldemort (we have now entered unintentional parody territory). I get it, the way you show someone is a badass is by having him show up other badasses, but HE IS ELEVEN, and with such a self-assured sense of superiority that is totally /not/ the humble kid full of wonder at the discovery of a new world.

**** I remember thinking Harry was a bit immature or what have you, just as you did, but I think that's to highlight the change in the later chapters/books. But if you aren't a fan of Harry (and other characters) not being true to canon personality wise, it's probably not the right fic for you. :)

***** It's not that he's canon or not. On the contrary, I have a few problems with Harry being one of the dullest characters in canon because he's the absolute standard normal-teen-becomes-hero trope. It's just that how are we supposed to believe that these people are dangerous when a kid walks all over them?

Snape, you can say... well, this is an AU, and life has treated him far better than it had under Dumbledore, so he might be willing to grit his teeth rather than establish an order of absolute authority. Bellatrix is pushing it, but you can say that maybe, without Azkaban, she isn't quite a merciless killing/torture machine and would like some extra responsibilities and the such. Voldemort? He'd make Harry understand exactly where his place is - under his boot, forever.

Because with all due respect, in a normal school, when an eleven year old kid mouths off to his teachers, principal, and the dictator of the country... he gets /corrected/. Over and over, or else kicked out to be with other juvenile delinquents. But not Harry, he has the mystical Plot-Armor^{TM} of nothing-will-go-too-wrong because he's the hero... and once you see it, that just ruins any possible suspense.

Canon Harry paid harshly for that kind of BS, and even for things that weren't his fault. It didn't help much, but he learned to base his hatred of others on injustice, who to avoid and how, and other valuable lessons... because some people didn't give him slack. McGonagall nearly automatically blamed the trio because they reminded her of the Marauders, Snape just handed out detentions with sadistic glee, and Filch made both of them seem cuddly. Here, the staff just says "huh, let's just let him do his thing". And by the staff, I mean, the one that takes it's queues from Bellatrix Lestrange.

Maybe this gets fixed in later chapters. Perhaps Harry learns that his actions have consequences and starts being humble... but somehow, this just seems that super!Harry will already be more powerful than Snape (20 years experience over Harry, 3rd most powerful wizard in canon) and Bellatrix (30 years experience over Harry, foremost after Voldemort in use of the Dark Arts) combined by third year. All that's missing is him having 18 familiars, and becoming a leader among all magical beings or something. Tell me I'm off the mark here, and I may change my mind and give it another shot :)

** I hate to even rec this, because I am both unsure it is what you're looking for and SUPER sure the writer will never finish the story.

[[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/story.php?storyid=2][The Mirror of Maybe]]

The story is Snarry, but there's more plot outside the love story than there is a love story.

The premise is that there's a mirror Harry encounters at the end of his 5th or 6th year. The timeline splits and mirror!Harry goes on to fight and win the war, become a 'War Mage' through tremendous effort, etc. He lives something like 13-17 years (the numbers escape me now) in the mirror. But that timeline is a mirror timeline and it spits him back out as a fully-informed, knowledgeable adult in a 16-year-old's body. The 'War Mage' concept is really lore-heavy and well written. The idea of a Mage is someone who is able to use other species magic, not someone with unspeakable power or control. The mirror timeline in which he learned these skills is portrayed a very violent and painful. Now, having come back, he feels he can change the timeline of the real world and save people some pain and suffering.

** I'm going to get tired to pimping his story here, but The Santi's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]].

Harry's twin brother follows the canonical story, while Harry himself is smarter and during the first year, takes up extra lessons from Quirrell to become considerably more advanced. When no other professor will consider letting him out of lessons, he transfers to Durmstrang where they will - he of course keeps in touch with his brother (who is best friends with Ron and Hermione), his family, and eventually returns to Hogwarts (not as a student).

It is a fantastic story.
