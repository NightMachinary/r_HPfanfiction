"The champion for Hogwarts is... Harry Potter!" Dumbledore said.

All eyes in the Great Hall turned to Harry, their stares accusing. At that moment, another piece of parchment was ejected from the goblet, which Dumbledore snatched from the air.

"The champion for Durmstrang is... Harry Potter?"

The stares intensified. Another parchment flew out of the goblet.

Dumbledore looked at it and sighed. "The champion for Beauxbatons is Harry Potter."

Angry shouts filled the air. Harry raised his goblet to the Great Hall in a mock toast. "May the best man win."

** OK, but now he has to get past three dragons at once, rescue three hostages from the lake, and... well the maze isn't any more difficult, but the Cup takes him to Voldemort's, Emeric the Evil's, and Herpo the Foul's resurrection rituals in succession. By the end of it he's just like "what, /again/? Don't tell me you're gonna monologue for an hour like the others did"

I'd like to see this in a story. It might be fun.

And now I'm imagining an Eddie Guerrero inspired Harry that I didn't know I needed.

This is making me want to read more comedic fan fics where Harry acts like that all the time.

A friendly sweet Harry, but one who still pranks, is a bit pompous and an ass, loves to mess with folks heads, joke, and cause drama or silly problems for his own amusement.

*** "Was that a Portkey?" Cedric asks, "Dunno? Lets test it." Harry shrugged, snatching up Cedric's wrist and swirling back to Hogwarts. Leaving Voldemort and Peter livid. Hours later, after being paraded around the common room as the victor, he looked back ponderously and thought, "The hell was that about?"

** ▪︎ TASK 1: A trio of dragons are warring over a clutch of eggs. Fire and spikes and huge monsters snarling and snapping at one another. Harry's goal is to retrieve the one gold egg within the pile. All whilst the dragons turned on one another and then the interfering boy.

▪︎TASK 2: Beneath the Black Lake, the three dearest to Harry's heart are held behind the ranks of a slew of merefolk and other water born species. Harry must rescue only one. His attempts to do otherwise... unleash the most powerful beast beneath the waters surface.

▪︎TASK 3: A maze filled with riddles, mysteries and beasts most foul. Harry has to navigate his way to the centre of it where the TriWizard cup awaits.

All whilst the school (including both its staff and his only friends) distance themselves scornfully from the attention the ridiculous attention hog. Lambasted by the Prophet and others outside of Hogwarts school and left a social pariah, welcome nowhere (not just in Magical Britain).

#+begin_quote
  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.
