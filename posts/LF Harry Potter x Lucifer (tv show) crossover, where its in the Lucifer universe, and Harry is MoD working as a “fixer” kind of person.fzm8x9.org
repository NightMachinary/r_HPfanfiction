Title


** Could work as semi-crack, semi-detective story, with Mr Black or Caphius Cain influences.

Because of various plot-threads always converging, an unaging, seventeen year old Harry seems to make a stop at Lucifer's Lux every week or so.

He also makes sure his visits are very quietly done, since Azrael and he have a complicated relationship ("I'm not her boyfriend, Lucifer!") and he doesn't want to draw her attention.

("No, Lucifer: the Resurrection Stone isn't a promise ring!")

Chloe, once in "the know", presumes he's another angel -- before her revelation, he's another one of "Lucifer's eccentric relatives".

Amenadiel, once the stick up his ass is pulled as seasons go on, finds Harry's dodging of his sister hilarious and watches with proverbial popcorn.

Lucifer is semi-annoyed, semi-amused by his visits. And when Azrael 'coincidentally' visits as Harry ducks out, finds it darkly amusing.

("Thank Merlin for dad's Cloak!")

Maze is actually unnerved by him -- an incident where he accidentally transfigured her into a teapot... and where, as a demon, she was still fully conscious. Every time he tries to apologize and make amends (because he's not a dick), he ends up making things worse to the point where she tries to duck out on him entirely.

("I can fix this!" Harry waved the Death Stick, and Mazikeen's nose re-transformed back into a spout. "Oops?").

Mother, in Charlotte Richards' body, finds everything so 'novel' and, caring for her family, tries to "repair" the 'relationship' he has with her daughter.

(The doors to Lux slammed shut with an ominous bang, and the lighting abruptly dimmed. Highlighted on the stage where many of Lucifer's nightly performers plied their trade were a single table, two chairs, two silver plates and silver cutlery, and a single, burning candle that bathed the white linen tablecloth in a comforting, warm glow.

It was all anything but comforting to Harry.

"Oh, balls."

Azrael walked in, looking around confused. Her eyes lit up on seeing her 'boyfriend', though.

"Double balls."

On the balcony above, hidden by the shadows, Goddess leaned over, steepling her hands. "Touch... touch hands!")

** So Azrael, the angel of death, is that fun, younger girl that pretended to be Ella's imaginary friend. In this case, would Harry be her master? Would God allow that?

*** Depends on how you define "Master of Death". There's a lot of ways to define "master" and a lot of ways to define "death". He could be anything from Azreal's boss to just a fancy necromancer.

He doesn't have to be /absolute/ in his power, he could just have power far beyond mortal kind while still being lower than the archangels.
