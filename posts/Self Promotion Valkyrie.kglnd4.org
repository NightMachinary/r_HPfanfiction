My new fanfiction, Valkyrie, tells the story of a woman and a dog who are suddenly thrust into the world of Harry Potter. I don't have any pairing tags up, but they will mostly be canon. The MC is an original character. She's aromantic and the fic will explore that a bit, but it's not the main focus of the story.

I'll post this on FFN at some point as well. Updates should be semi-frequent, depending on real life stuff.

Hopefully the bot works, I think it hates me.

** I love it so far! I hope the MC will be more reasonable than the usual SI.

  What would you do if you were suddenly transported into a storybook world, one where you have all the answers? This is the decision Lorelei Smith has to make when she goes from certain death to being unceremoniously dumped in the world of Harry Potter. Try as she might, this new world doesn't feel quite real to her, and the temptation to play with fate is overwhelming. If this is a dream, then that makes her God, doesn't it? Despite her uncertain grasp on reality, real lives hang in the balance. One woman and her dog have the power to turn the world on its head... for good or for ill.
