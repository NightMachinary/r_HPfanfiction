:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been searching for this fic for several weeks but no luck so far. The things I remember are:

- For whatever reason the malfoys start a muggleborn sponsorship program; they sponsor Hermione
- Hermiones parents are despicable people, her mom is a social climber
- Her parents do not respond to the updates the Malfoys send them, having no interest in their weird daughter
- Eventually she gets adopted by the Malfoys, I think they use a blood adoption ritual and she chooses a new second name
- Her parents 'get' a new daughter by using a smuggler ring (I think it was the moms brother). The girl is forced to get perfect teeth and wear frilly dresses (they want a 'perfect' daughter)

I unfortunately can't remember if this is the main storyline or if there's more things happening at the same time.. Please help!


** If anyone finds this I would be interested!

*** I can't exactly remember..But in the story the Malfoys were very nice people. So they were either not as bad as they are portrayed in canon, or Hermione wasn't as lightsided as in canon. But unfortunately I can't recall those details

*** I don't know this particular fic, but a lot of Malfoy/Death Eater sympathetic fics use the trope "we don't hate Muggleborns for their blood, we hate them for their culture" (we're not racist, we're just anti-immigrant). And a subset of those fics have purebloods sponsor Muggleborns to educate them in Magical culture and etiquette.

(I think this trope, like all tropes, can be done both well and horribly.)

**** I saw it characterized in "They Shook Hands." It's on ffn, and I can't remember the author, but it should show up on google easily enough.

** I literally just finished reading this like two weeks ago! It's Nobody Cared by etherian linkffn(5756718). The story is mainly about Snape adopting Harry through some ritual, and Hermione being sponsored by the Malfroys is a subplot.
