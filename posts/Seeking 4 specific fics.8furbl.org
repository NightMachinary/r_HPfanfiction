Hi,

I'm looking for 4 stories. 2 from which I have some solid information and 2 which are more like bonus request because I have really few memories of it. I don't remember the titles obviously but some important plot points at least for the first 2.

- 1st story : Harry gets in an alternate dimension (summoned or not I don't remember) where his mother is alive and also his sister (or maybe it's an younger alternate version). I think he gets summoned after winning his own war and if I'm not mistaken, the alternate Ginny is a right bitch and Harry gets with Hermione? Not sure about the last bit.

- 2nd story : I'm not sure if it was a alternate dimension but well... in this story from which I remember even less, Hermione is a slave to the Malfoy (lots of muggleborns are and taken before getting proper magical education) and Fleur to Bill Weasley. Harry is pretty OP if I remember well and there is also a !bad !spy Tonks which tries to infiltrate Harry's operation and manage to hurt him. I'm not sure but maybe there was a thing with Susan Bones not talking because of a trauma but maybe I'm mixing stories.

The 2 next... well don't bother too much I remember so little.

- 3rd may not even be a dimension hopping at all and is more of a bonus request. I remember even less except at some point, Hermione gets kidnapped by Malfoy and Harry (who's a bit OP) goes to rescue her and use some clones of himself (robots or magicals I can't remember) and destroys Malfoy and some Death Eater. Sry I read so many fics that I have difficulties remembering details from some.

- 4th : meh even worse sorry. Maybe it's even in the previous one but well bad recall and all. The only thing I remember is that, at some point, Harry fights against Bellatrix (near a cliff?) and manage to kill her but I don't remember well if he freeze her, decapitate her or both. Ugh!

Anyway if anyone has the titles of these fics I would be grateful. Thanks

[EDIT] : 1st and 2nd stories found. Respectively "Parallels" (3150414) and "Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper" (3751748).

While I will add a new request here as I was re-reading it made me think of 2 other fics.

- 5th : I think it was also with dimension travel but Harry arrives in a place where Hermione doesn't know him and isn't even at Hogwarts. She abandoned magic long time ago for reasons I don't remember. Everyone tell Harry not to go see her because it'll be hard but he doesn't listen and stalk her a bit, saving her once from bullies.

- 6th : AU, Harry gets trained by an acquaintance of Dumbledore (an american or australian auror if I remember well) and later Harry gets kidnapped and tortured by Voldemort and his Death Eaters and finally gets rescued by an assault on the manor by the Order of the Phoenix. Harry's mentor sacrifices himself against Voldemort to allow Harry to get rescued and Ron who was also captured fights and kill Draco after which Narcissa promises she will kill Ron. After the whole ordeal Harry suffers from the trauma and his afraid of the dark

  Harry has won the war and lost everything he held near and dear. In desperation he gambles everything on a dimensional jump. HPHG Bad Weasleys good Dumbledore. Rated for language and implied sex

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
