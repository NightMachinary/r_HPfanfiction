The potters died that day protecting both their children. 18 month old Harry now with a scar on his forehead, And his 3 month old brother , Charlus. Thankfully unscathed from the drama but terrified from the commotion.

That fateful night when Voldemort was vanquished, Sirius Black, Collected both his godson from the Wreckage. He didn't hand either off to hagrid he just told the half giant to deliver a message.

And gave him his motorbike since it was nearly impossible to ride the thing with two infants.

Instead, grief strikes, and filled with a betrayal fueled rage, but weighed down and reminded of the reality of the situation by both the children with him.

Sirius Aperated to the only safe house he could think of with someone that could help him take care of children.

He ended up on Andromeda and Ted's doorstep at 3:57 on that cold November morning. With Harry Potter in his arms and little charlus in a sling across his chest.

Sirius didn't go rat hunting that November... but Alastor Moody did.


** Yes yes!!!! I'm so down for WBWL but they get along like family instead of adversaries (

It's so tiring trying to find these WBWL/Harry loves his brother

Also why are there are too few WB(G)WL/adversary sister fics?

#+begin_quote
  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

***** If I remember correctly Moody tried to avoid killing. But if Peter tried that bullshit with blowing up the street I think Moody would have killed him first.

Moody was not a murderer, but he did what was necessary. He did kill Evan Rosier - he has killed Death Eaters. It just wasn't what he tried first. His favorite way of dealing with them was arresting them.

*** His brother Charlus is 3 months old in this prompt, which fulfills the "born as the seventh month dies" and allows the divergence of Harry being 3 months older than canon (and thus /clearly/ not the child of the Prophecy). At least, I /think/ that's what pygmypuffonacid is going for - it can get a little hard to tell with English /probably/ not being their native language.

It's a WBWL fanfic prompt, Harry's age doesn't have to adhere to canon.

**** ??? I mean yes, of course fanfic doesn't mean it has to adhere to canon, the correction was just a habit lol sorry.

But Charlus could be born on Harry's birthday just a year later. Actually that would be kind of interesting and confusing. If they were both born as the seventh month dies, but on different years, which one is the prophecy child? They think it's Harry because he was born just after the prophecy was foretold but it's actually Charlus.

***** It'd be just as interesting, to me, to have Harry /blatantly/ not be the child the Prophecy refers to, but to still give them both a relatively happy childhood and have a supporting-protagonist "Harry isn't the BWL" story. Better than all those "one gets neglected, the other gets spoiled rotten, whoops we just turned our potential Saviour into an edgelord" that like 99.9% of these stories turn into.

******** Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived.

The basic premise is that either Harry has a sibling, or Voldemort goes after Neville instead - fulfilling the prophecy for Harry in some convoluted way while actually being disembodied by the other.

Usually in these fics, the one hailed as the Boy-Who-Lived grows up spoiled rotten, the other one gets neglected and/or abused, and neither of them is a likeable person by the time they actually make it to Hogwarts.

********* Okay just says at least with this prompt. Harry still has his scar, Charlus is the right age but they will be raised by Sirius ... At least with this promise I highly doubt either of the characters would be treated badly.. Voldemort is gone and Sorius went to his very Slytherin but favorite cousin Andromeda for help... On all likelihood with this prompt, the Black's would spin it as lily and James somehow taking down Voldemort to protect there kids.Plus I highly doubt a cannon sirius would ever mistreat James Potter's children.

****** I've always been curious about the following stories

WBWL with happy family life with younger brother

WGWL with Harry and his sister as adversaries

And your one Harry not being the right boy who lived. It's his bro but everyone seem to think Harry is the boy. This one would take a lot of plotting to get right.

And yes to Edgelord Harry 😂 - I'm reading one right now, and one of the few reasons I love it is because the writer has redefined magic in the story which is quite interesting. But it does get tiring reading through his hatred for his parents who survived (which is justifies to a certain extent but does get underwhelming from time to time reading the same “Ill never forgive them... ever”)

******* Now the plotbunny is stuck in my head. God damn it. I already have like 5 HP WIP, I do not need another.

I was thinking that the truth of who's the BWL doesn't come out until like the final battle. Harry gets defeated (not dead but like disarmed and injured) and his little brother is like ‘not my big brother' and steps in front of him Molly Weasley style and defeats Voldemort. The power he knows not, the love of his big brother.
