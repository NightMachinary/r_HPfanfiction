I personally think of it as a cheap gimmick that an author uses, because they aren't comfortable enough to write that character in a good light.

It's one thing to hate a character, but no need to purposely bash them. I can't see Ron Weasley acting like the next Draco Malfoy. I can't see Dumbledore stealing Harry's money.

Use them sparingly in stories if you hate them, bring actual enemies to the forefront. If you want Harry and Draco to be friends, have it be Zacharias Smith, Theodore Nott, or Blaise Zabini who is the one hating on everyone. If you need a hateful adult, have it be Lucius, Bellatrix, etc. One of the Death Eaters.

Heck, Dumbledore you could say doesn't do that much in canon, so no need to have a negative force with him.

So, I was just curious about everyone's thoughts on bashing. Do you like it? Can you read it, or does it annoy you?


** I think you're conflating two different things here.

I have nothing against turning a canonically good character evil necessarily, but it has to be done well. The problem with bashing isn't that they do that, it's that they do it by stripping the character of all their canonical positive qualities, wildly exaggerating or completely making up negative ones, and often having them completely fail in all of their attempts to inconvenience Harry. It's basically just an OC with a canon character's name that has no purpose beyond serving as Harry's punching bag.

For instance, Manipulative!Dumbledore as a well-intentioned extremist is a much more interesting read than "Manipulative"!Dumbledore as a mustache-twirling villain that just wants to steal Harry's money and fame.

** It's the laziest thing on Earth. The author can't be bothered to properly analyze the character so they just make up flaws that do not actually make sense. And it's so frustrating because deconstructing flaws is one of my favorite things to read. But bashing isn't doing the work to actual get into the heart of said flaws and make them do better.

** Bashing is a missed opportunity, IMO. It's more interesting to write/read about a dimensional character than an idiot or a cartoon villain.

In the case of Harmione stories, there are plenty of ways to justify them not getting together with Ginny and Ron (other than “The Weasleys are after Harry's fortune”). Neither couple was convincing in canon, so it shouldn't be hard to disentangle them, and then you still have Ginny and Ron as viable characters for use in non-romantic plot lines.

*** Like have Ginny be a Lesbian. I saw one where Ginny cheated on Harry and Harry was in love with someone else. So they broke up but still remained friends. It was nice. I think it was trans Harry

Ron could end up with Lavender for heavens sake

** I personally don't mind it. Sometimes it's done well sometimes I don't feel like reading it. I think it can be good for AUs or what if's if it actually is part of the story and is more than just an excuse to break up a couple or put one together.

** I don't have problems with it because much of fanfiction is wish-fulfillment. That being said, it is also "easier to write" because one-dimensional characters act one way and always will. What really irks me is when someone bashes Ginny, Ron, Harry's Younger Brother in WBWL fics, and stuff like that, only to have Harry, who seems to be jaded and cautious, accept them with open arms. If someone's personality is shown or said to be one thing and then their actions do a quick 180 without logic it annoys me. When I'm writing, if there's a character I don't like, I'll try to minimize their role rather than bash them, but to each their own. I just want people to have personalities and actions remain consistent, or if they change, change slow-ish and with logic.

** It depends how you define bashing. Obviously making them cartoonishly evil is just pointless. However, sometimes exaggerating their flaws are used as a plot device to justify the divergence from canon, which can be a necessary evil. For example if you have a typical 'Harry pulls himself up by his bootstraps after Sirius dies' fic, 'lazy Ron dragging him down' can be an easy short-cut to explain why he is suddenly so much better and then you can go on and focus on the story you want to write. This especially applies if you want Harry to change his friends, as you need to give a reason for him to ditch his existing ones.

** Bashing is a mark of a poor writer. It's less that they're antagonists, but more that they're just plain bad at it. They're anti-Mary-sues, where their plans are so awful that the glorious hero wins immediately with no effort put in. Let's compare two Manipulative!Dumbledores. The typical lordship bullshit Dumbledore does completely random mind control shit and chomps down on lemon drop after lemon drop, while Harry becomes the amazing Hadrian Jameson Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Gaunt-Stark-Ravenclaw-etc after a single conversation with goblins. One chapter and suddenly HJPBPGGSR wins over dumb-as-a-door and marries his harem.

Compare that to another fic series with a Dumbledore abusing mind magic, Of a Linear Circle. There's two real differences between the plots, along with a significant difference in overall writing quality. First, there's an actual point. The Elder Wand didn't like being taken without murder, so it started possessing Dumbledore to find a worthy host. The entire war is engineered to build up to the two holders of the other hallows dueling over ownership of the wand. Second, he isn't instantly overthrown. The protagonists spend many, many chapters planning and disassembling parts of his plans, and it certainly isn't a one-and-done deal. The big mind influencing magic he relies on is only found by an expert on mind magic and enchanting, not some random ancestry test. The protagonists make compromises about what they can fight Dumbledore on, and they don't win every time no matter what.

In short, bashing is just the product of writers who need more practice.

** Bashing is a way for the author to vilify a canonically good character without putting in the effort of creating a credible backstory and subsequent shift of personality.

In short, a tool for lazy or inexperienced writers.

** I love it

Sometimes, sure, it's not done very well but I've read some really good ones. Obviously don't make them cartoonish, with that awful, awkward dialogue (usually because Harry overhears them revealing their plan).

** I don't mind it depending on who's being bashed. Like, Ginny bashing rubs me the wrong way, but I can live with it if Ron and Molly are being bashed since I don't really care either way about them, but I can't deal with Weasley bashing unless Dumbledore's being bashed too. But I absolutely won't read stuff that's bashing Hermione or Harry.

** I think moreover it's an easy way for authors to get rid of traditional or canon pairings, making way for more alternative ones if the usual characters are tossed aside through exageration of negative qualities

Its also commonly done if you want a morally-grey / dark story, to steer characters away from the "good side"

** Honestly nothing puts me off a story quicker than bashing by the author. Usually, the character being bashed is acting completely OOC which is also a big turn off. Even if it's a character I already loathe.

** In general it's a sign of an immature writer who believes that if they dislike a character then the character must be treated as evil/incompetent/etc. Of course, there are exceptions, but as a rule that seems to be the case more often than not.

** Honestly, I read bashing fics as easy as any other fic, not because I particularly favour it, but because I like the storyline that comes with it. Give me a "Harry is the Lord of 50 Houses, but oh no! Dumbledore was stealing his money" fic anyday, cause I can just eat that shit up.

I don't think this is a perspective that a lot of people consider. I don't hate the common people that fanfic authors bash, and I can acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses and I can rationalize their actions, it's not black and white. I just really enjoy reading bashing fics and I don't discriminate. I could read a Dumbledore bashing at one moment, then go on to read a Mentor!Dumbledore the next. I'm an equal opportunity reader.
