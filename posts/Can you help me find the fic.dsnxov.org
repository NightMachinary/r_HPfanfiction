:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a story a while back and i'm trying to find it again. All i remember is that its Time Travel to Marauders time and there is a scene on Platform 9 3/4 where bombs go off and I believe Petunia is killed. If you've heard of this please reply!


** Is it the one where memory-loss, fem!Harry is believed to be an Evans cousin and adopted as Lily's twin sister? And then Petunia does the whole killing curse/sacrifice thing to save her sisters?

  She had a life once, but she doesn't remember. All she knows is the ashes and blood she tastes as she wakes up yet again... She's got one more try to get it right. - Haesel hadn't quite thought of this when she'd accepted Death's 'chance to live with those she'd lost'. AU, time travel, fem!Harry, T for now?
