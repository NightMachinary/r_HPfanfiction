Titel says it. Harry becomes a Bodyguard and during his work falls for his client. They might have an affair (by affair its not necessary meant that he is unfaithful, if he is married, but more in a "Political" sense....or whatever. Maybe she is unconsciously involved in crime or something like that. I accept both, though). Doesnt matter, if its hinted or detailed.
