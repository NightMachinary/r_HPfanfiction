In which Daphne presents data and points out that Voldemort killed purebloods as blood traitors, and more died in his service to make him seem a feasible option. It takes time for her to convince people, but she does, and ends up forming her own group.

So come fifth year, her group is on the alert for the pureblood killer after hearing Harry's claims, and get sufficient evidence, but do not want to work with Dumbledore's group of which Harry is tacitly a part, perhaps covertly interrogating Harry.

For some reason they have to work together, bringing them out of their hidden in plain sight situation, and they have to grudgingly co-operate.

It would be more interesting to read this from the POV of Daphne/her group.
