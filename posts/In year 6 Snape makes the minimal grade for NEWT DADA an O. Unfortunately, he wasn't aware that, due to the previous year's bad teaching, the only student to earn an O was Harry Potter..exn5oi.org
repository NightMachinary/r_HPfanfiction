** There was no one in the classroom. Harry frowned and checked his schedule again. He had the correct room. He had the correct time. Why was he alone? Surely he wasn't the only student to get an O on his OWL? Alright, yes, Hermione had only gotten an E, but it was hardly her best class.

The door, upon opening, made a defined noise in the otherwise silent room. Harry jumped. Professor Snape strode in, his cloak billowing out behind him. Snape paused. His eyes swept the empty row of desks.

"Mr. Potter," he said. "Where are your classmates?"

"I don't know, sir."

Snape's mouth pressed into a thin line. He continued to his desk, where he shuffled around the parchment sitting atop it. His hand paused on a page. He read it once. And then again. He blinked.

"Potter," The word snapped out abruptly. "Draw your wand."

Warily, Harry did so.

"Today, we're going to have a practical exam on dueling. Begin."

*** Snape began casting before Harry could take a breath, get in a dueling stance, anything.

Panicking, Harry dodged some yellow curse that sounded like an alteration of the Body Bind spell. Well, he might not have entirely dodged it as now his whole left side went slack and unresponsive.

"Unfair!" Harry cried. "We haven't studied this, I don't even know what that spell was!"

"Then think. Fast. Potter," Snape growled. Another hex flew just above Harry's head as he ducked.

"Expelliarmus!" Snape simply /flicked/ the disarming spell away.

"Predictable. Do you expect to be able to defend yourself against Dark Lords or their followers with /that/ spell? I assure you, they know your habits, O famous one. /VULNERA DOLORUS!/"

Harry flinched at the sudden conjuring of /that/ name, but managed a weak Protego that shattered when the spell hit.

"Think. /Confringo!/ Faster. /Reducto!/ Potter. /Relashio!/" Harry managed to dodge or block the former spells but the latter zipped around and struck his wand hand, causing him to drop the wand involuntarily. Snape twirled his wand without an incantation and the idle stick flew into his grip.

With a smug grin, Snape looked down at the boy. "Thus concludes our first lesson: learning how to lose."

"I didn't submit, professor."

"What?"

Harry charged his teacher with all the anger, strength, and stupidity afforded to male pubescence.

​

" /Levicorpus/," Harry hung upside down by his ankles. He twisted uselessly in the air for a moment. He grew dizzy as all of his blood rushed to his head.

"Foolish," Snape sneered. "If you are ever in so desperate a situation that you need to physically attack someone, then you /must/ be /subtle/. You will never land a hit if your opponent sees you coming. Your defenses must be more flexible and inventive. Three of your other options were to wandlessly summon your wand, to wait until your opponent was close and vulnerable before attacking, or to pretend that one of their spells hit and play dead. For your homework, you will write me twelve inches on why each one of these choices is better than a reckless headlong charge." Snape wordlessly flicked his wand upwards. Harry crashed to the floor in an ungraceful heap. Snape waited until he was once again on his feet before continuing.

"You are, I believe, a complete novice in the use of wandless spells. What is the advantage of wandless magic, Potter?"

"Casting without a wand?"

"I will beat critical thinking into that thick skull of yours, if it's the only thing I manage this term. What else, Potter?"

"I don't know," said Harry stiffly.

"A wizard," said Snape, "that casts wandlessly, can never be disarmed. There are limits, of course. A wandless spell will always be less focused and less powerful. It also requires more concentration and mind power which some..." Snape's eyes bored deeply into Harry's, "...lack. Now, without moving /from that spot/, retrieve your wand."

Also for [[/u/sue_donymous][u/sue_donymous]], everything we know of the previous war was that it didn't have long drawn out battles but rather was full of short Guerilla attacks by Death Eaters who usually either out numbered their foes or frightened their prey. The entire Death Eater army in book 7 got beaten back by the top 3 years of Hogwarts. Death Eaters aren't usually great Fighters they are great shock troopers because they are almost entirely shock and awe.

** To say he was surprised would be an understatement. Half of him believed he never actually woke that morning, the other half thought it was some sort of cosmic joke.

Here he was, sitting in the seat third row from the front and two chairs in. It was his unassigned assigned seat after all. That was beside the point. The problem was, he was alone. Rows of chairs pushed hastily to the tables in front of them was the only company he had. There were no paintings to remind the class of the fool from his second year. The carefully placed diagrams from the third year have been ripped down. The jars of body parts from the fourth year had been discarded. Thankfully every that was even remotely pink has been stripped from the classroom. Harry wondered if Snape had just opened the window and started chucking items out.

The only thing to remind him of the previous years was himself. In his unassigned, assigned spot. His bag was resting next to him with its flap open, waiting for him to reach in and withdraw a book.

At first, he had thought he was early. Frantically after arriving he pulled out his folded schedule, which declared yes he was a few minutes early. That just let to his eyebrows knitting together in confusion, surely Hermoine would be here at this time. Last he heard she was planning on continuing her studies in DADA. Ron also was supposed to be here, this was his best class after all.

He had sat down and reread his schedule until he could recite it backward. He was in the right place. At the right time. So where was everyone?

He couldn't be the only one in DADA, right?\

Of course, his life the cosmic joke it was, proved him wrong. He was the only one who had passed with the required grade.

At least he would forever cherish the pained expression on Snape's face. It had looked to Harry that he had eaten food that hadn't sit right and was just starting to affect him. Snape had then snapped his eyes back to his paperwork before rushing out of the classroom into the office.

Bored of tapping his fingers against the aged wood, he pulled his DADA books out and started to read. When it came to spells he would silently do the hand motions until they became smooth before adding in the incantation. He was on his third spell when Snape came back into the room with his wands billowing behind him, his sneer ever-present.

Severus didn't say anything before he started shooting hexes and curses at the boy. Quickly Harry rolled to his right before throwing up a shield. It held against four spells before starting to spiderweb in front of him. He threw the desk on its side and ducked behind it right as his shield splintered.

Listening, Harry heard Snape's movements go to the right of the classroom. Before Snape could get a view on his student, Harry bounced up and threw several variations of cutting curses, each on stronger than the previous. After the third cutting curse, which hit his right bicep, Snape threw up a shield. Only it lasted two spells before shattering inward causing him to stumble. Harry took the opportunity and threw a tripping hex. Once the man had fallen, Harry threw the most powerful stunner he could muster. Snape had thrown his body to the side at the last minute, the overcharged stunner streaming passed him and taking a heavy chunk out of the wall.

Snape stopped, his breath was coming out a little hard. He peered over the desks and chairs to see Harry stand with his wand in an attack position. He was turned to the side, limiting the amount of body that could get hit. Harry wasn't breathing hard. No, he seemed to be eerily in his element. His jaw was set, his lips slightly downturned, and his eyes were so sharp that they would be able to cut steel. Harry's eyes noticed the motion, they flicked to the teacher crouched behind furniture.

Before Snape realized what was happening, three spells were flying towards him. Two were burnt umber, and the final was a golden yellow. He dodged the first two but the last clipped him in the shoulder. Suddenly Snape couldn't tell which way was up and which way was down. At first, he thought this a /confundus/ but he knew what was going on, he just couldn't get his sense of direction right. This wasn't a spell Snape knew.

It wasn't a spell that was taught. The boy had been self-studying.

While trying to move his body to the wall, two more spells slammed into his back. he tried to turn but suddenly his feet fell like jelly. Once on the floor, Snape started to cough up slugs much to his displeasure.

Once he heaved up the third slug, the vertigo stopped. Finally able to move the way he wanted, he stopped the onslaught of slugs. He tried to stand only to fall back to the stones. He had forgotten about the jelly-leg curse. Once that was countered, he stood up on high alert. He looked around the room, it seemed to be empty. Snape's eyes narrowed to the door that was now slightly ajar.

Had the boy run?

He took a step forward to investigate when he was thrown across the room. He slammed into the chalkboard in the back of the room, the wood splintered under his weight. He looked upwards, on a chain hanging from a ceiling for cages, Harry dangled upside down.

The boy had tricked him. Not only that, but he was casting powerful nonverbal spells at him. He had done something no other student had, he had taken Severus Snape down.

When Snape had returned to the room, he had wanted to test the boy. It had to be a fluke, no way could Potter be the only student capable of passing the exams. Now, as he groaned at the aches blooming across his body, he didn't just pass the exams.

Harry had outstandingly exceeded his expectations.

** Harry is kinda mediocre, though. Snapes generation was amazing, creating spells, altering potions, making AMAZING maps, mastering animagis and stuff like that. Harry's entire generation is just....so ugh, when you think about it. There was Dumbledores time, when wizards were generally better it seems. Aberforth came off like a powerhouse during the final battle, and grindelwald, and Newt all seem so unique and powerful. Queenie IS broken, and the american wizards all seem amazing. Tom's classmates went on to become powerful enough to fight trained aurors head to head. I'm not even gonna mention Tom. Neville's parents were apparent powerhouses, Harry's own parents were clearly broken on a scale when compared to Harry and his friends (They fought Tommy boy 3 times and survived.) Then theres Snape, and regardless of what you think of him, he IS an all around badass.

*** Maybe let's stop comparing the 4-5 best people of every generation to Harry's entire one? And children to adults?

We know of 4 wizards from Dumbledore's entire time. 2 are prodigies. BCJ got twelve OWLs, so does Percy. We only know of adult Frank and Alice. Tom's classmates were in their 50s fighting aurors. Aberforth is a 110.

Also, Fred and George did some pretty amazing things and Harry wasn't mediocre in defense, which is the topic of discussion.

Edit: forgot about Aberforth and how to spell

No new spells or incredible enchantments. Not even any truly great fighters, Harry's among the best in his generation there, and he doesn't come close to Snape, let alone Riddle or Dumbledore

Except the stuff Fred and George do. And do you really think Snape, or anyone else, was dueling as well as they did at 17 as they did at 35+? Yes, 17 yr old Snape > 17 year old Harry, but the same could be said for Percy, Hermione, and many others. They nor 17 yr Snape are tossing Harry around like that either.

******* He's a preteen to early teen boy in a completely new world. Realistically, would his response be to knuckle down and prepare for war?

His parents' generation grew up with the effects of war very evident, and attacks a common thing that they'd hear about, with their parents likely involved in the war one way or another. They'd know what was truly at stakes in the war.

Harry would be suspicious of attacks, sure, but as a young boy with no proper adult influence in his life, personally he'd be more likely to panic about it, facing direct attacks but not really thinking about the problem otherwise, than to start making long term plans. He barely understood the wizarding world, I doubt he'd be up to making any great discoveries.
