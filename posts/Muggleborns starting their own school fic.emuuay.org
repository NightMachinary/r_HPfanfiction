:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's about a Muggleborn oc who starts his own school, or is going to after using artificial insemination to increase the ‚ÄúMuggleborn‚Äù population. I think he uses an old Black property as the school and has Sirius thinking up names? And I remember he and Remus flip houses too? I want to see if it's updated, but I can't remember the name

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** That fic was really cool, and now I'm annoyed at how early in the story it died.

Got any comparable fics? I really liked the oc's and the concept of changing the wizarding world with such a 'mad ' plan.
