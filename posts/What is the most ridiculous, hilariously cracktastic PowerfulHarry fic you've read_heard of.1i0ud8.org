** No contest: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2554200/1/HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH][30Hs]]

It even has a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ThirtyHs][trope page]] to describe the awesome for those who can't stand to read the immense ridiculousness of the actual story.

EDIT: First lines of the story, to set the bar

#+begin_quote
  Dobby relished his groinsaw's roar as he withdrew the flesh-choked blade from the astronaut's ruined skull. He turned to Harry, thrusting his bloody, retina-covered pelvis with elfin fervor.

  "How does Ronnie Ron taste, master?"

  Harry spat out an eyeball. "Like some kid with eyes."

*** I read part way through that tropes page and I believe that part of my brain melted away.

Total side note, but I'm currently working my way through Holly Evans and the Spiral Path, which I assume you are the author of. It is the best 'squicky' fic I've read in a long time.

***** As a coming of age tale for a girl hero instead of the bog-standard boy hero, Holly goes through a lot.

For one, being poisoned by Basilisk venom, cured by Phoenix tears and catalyzed by fragments of the Philosopher's Stone has some gruesome consequences for her. It was intended as a metaphor for the changes brought on by puberty.

*** I've been in fanfiction for a long time (though not as long as you, you have me beaten by at least a couple of months...I think), and I was sitting here wondering "How have I never read this amazing crackfic?"

Then I read it, and now its simply "Why?"

I could see sending Harry to Hell and these being his tortures...or this is what goes on in Luna's head and Harry's dreams. . .

I'm off to read the Tropes page, to see if I missed something important......

** Since 30 H's has been given its due, I'll post my runner-ups:

Additional candidates for the 'guilty of excess' stories, tamest at the top (Warning- you are entering a dark and untamed country of warped wordsmiths. No links- just search for the names if you really want to go there)

*HP and the Rationalization of my Methods by LessWrong* (a.k.a. Meth-ods of Ratio-nality)

WWWI (What's wrong with it): Never has a writer gone to such lengths to hide their authorial filibuster under the pretense of 'Harry's just smarter'. This Harry is insanely competent, genre-savvy and mostly in command of every situation. Approaching 100 chapters but hasn't finished Harry's first year at Hogwarts.

*Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart*

WWWI: starts interesting and fairly reasonable, but starts to swing erratically in unexpected directions; for each new idea that occurs to him, the author tries to weave in the existence of another level of wank as if it were planned from the beginning. Dumbledore is the villain, also using Horcruxes and time manipulation to clutch at power, but Harry is able to discover or make allies with those with ways to outmaneuver the old man and his catspaws.

*HP and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents*

WWWI: A very silly romp involving a horny ghost that inspires equally frisky behavior in Harry and friends. Mostly fun, rarely squicky but it happens.

*HP and the Midnight Sun by Vanir*

WWWI: Harry is on the fast track to god-level powers, assisted by highly-sexualized creatures from Scandinavian and other folklore. Also starring Gabrielle Delacour. Any time Gabrielle is a prominent part of a Rated 'M' story, you know it's NSFW.

*Crack'd Mirror by cloneserpents*

WWWI: Patterned after the Mirror, Mirror Universe in Star Trek, Harry is switched with a despotic version of himself from a dimension where morals are at best a fetish. His effect on Harry's friends in this world prods each of them into their previously-repressed BDSM tendencies. It's crack- just roll with it.

*Not Go Gentle by cloneserpents* (what's with this guy? why do I keep reading his stuff?)

WWWI: Take the above, remove all hints of humor and replace with Clive Barker-inspired horror. It's basically what happens when Harry is ritually tortured into becoming demonic.

*Harry & Kiki: Tales of the Boy Necromancer by SamStone* [Has absolutely nothing to do with Kiki's Delivery Service, just to be clear] a.k.a Enter the Silver Flame

WWWI: Take all the above, wrap with seventeen layers of excess prose, then bake in Meth. Sure he's eleven, but the death-rituals make him look fifteen and act like the X-rated version of Dr. Doom. His aura seduced the Director of the DMLE as he met her at King's Cross station. Somewhere amidst the maze of thought-explanations, you notice that they just had sex, right there, with nobody noticing because of the magical preparations made beforehand (that the author seemed to just realize might be necessary), so let's spend another 800 words describing how that came about and who was being pleasured while he thought of it. Amelia Bones just blushed. Harry's inhuman vixens just had an orgy to celebrate the end of their latest power play. Amelia cleared her throat.

/By the way, if anyone wants to give similar hyperbolic assessment to my works, feel free. This site is nourished by amusing piles of unsubstantiated opinion./

Dresses? Perhaps he should have purchased a pair of black pumps instead of the sneakers...
