:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic I didn't read but (I think) I remember parts of the description. - James and Lily survive and take care of one of their children - their other child is raised by Snape (I'm 95% positive it was Snape not Sirius) - I think the child with Snape was Harry and not the OC child? - I think it might have been a WBWL story?

One I've seen today that sounds similar is The-Girl-Who-Was-Behind-The-Curtain but this isn't the one I'm looking for.

This was on Fanfiction.Net and only a couple of weeks ago but for some reason I can't find it again. Any help is appreciated. Anything similar is appreciated. If it's Sirius raising Harry or Harry is with his parents but the fic is focused on an OC raised by Snape, go ahead. Just give me any fics you think are similar.

Thanks!!

Edit: on Fanfiction.net recently I meant I saw it recently not that is was posted recently! Though maybe it was new?


** Family Bonds by xXdesertroseXx on FFN is dead so it isn't what you're looking for, but it's similar
