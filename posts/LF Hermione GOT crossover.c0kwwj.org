Hi so I'm driving myself insane I'm not sure if this fix is a hermione or a fem!harry one or the other where they are reborn into Westeros as rhaegars daughter? I know it's not much but if you could help you would be a god send. Also if you think there's any good hermione fem!harry crossovers Id love to read them! It's just I've read most fanfics and looking for something new. TIA


** I know 2 Hermione in Westeros stories. Neither really fits what your are looking for but I'll share them anyway. The first is Hermione travels on accident through the Forbidden Forest or something. linkffn(12689889) The second Hermione is reborn as the daughter of Steffon Baratheon and is betrothed to Rhaegar Targaryen. linkffn(12053601) They are both okay but not what I was looking for so I can't give a solid recommendation.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her. Part 1 & Part 2 complete! Part 3 coming in Oct 2019.

*** For some reason I had never thought to check if HP x GoT fics were a thing. The bot summary for The Winter Witch sounds intriguing. Not the OP, but thank you for sharing!

** Linkao3(602693) is one of my favorites in this crossover. I'm in the middle of The Winter Witch, and it's fantastic. Definitely recommend.
