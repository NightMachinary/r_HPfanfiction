Or anything other than simply saying that her death invoked an ancient magic or the power of her saved him or whatever. No slash (unless canon or can be worked in without destroying a characters personality) no bashing no fem Harry


** linkao3(Evitative by Vichan) does have slash, but it's very minor and only at the end.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16521608/chapters/38699969][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkao3(16521608): Blood Magic is a central theme of this fic, which is used by good and bad guys. Although not explicitly stated in his other fics, this author rejects the notion that Voldemort offering Lily the choice to stand aside was necessary to activate the sacrificial protection

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
