All I want to know is if the idea of Harry dying when he's killed by Voldemort is actually an AU/fanfic? I'd like to make one with my own ideas but I'd like to know if there are any existing ones I should credit :)

â€‹

If anyone cares this possible book will be posted here, but if it works out I might post it on ao3 too ^^ [[https://www.wattpad.com/user/-loathful]]

(A new account!)

p.s. I am really sorry if I did anything wrong with this post - I haven't been on reddit for too long (I'm only on here for the fandoms) so I apologise if I did do something wrong. :)


** Hey! Yes that would count as AU as it's a change from canon - more specifically it's a canon divergence fic of everything leading up to that point is the same!

Don't worry about existing ideas - it's fanfic, people are bound to overlap. This is your idea, it doesn't matter if people came up with something similar. Just don't deliberately plagiarise and you will be fine.

Good luck!

*** Okay thank you for the information, that makes sense. And thank you! I will try to put this fanfic/AU together. ^^ Hopefully it will come out alright.
