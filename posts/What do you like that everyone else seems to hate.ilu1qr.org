Just things that people tend to dislike. For example, if you love Dumbledore bashing.

I personally don't get why everyone hates prongslet so much. I'm not a fan of Remus saying things like ‚ÄúI have to protect my pack‚Äù but prongslet just sounds like an endearing nickname to me and I kind of like it. I don't mind pup or cub either, though I wouldn't say I love them. Imo, the nicknames seem like something Sirius would use, not Remus, so I don't like it as much when they both use them, but it's sweet when it's just Sirius.


** My favorite non-canon pairing is Harry/Hermione/Ron. The Trio friendship and relationship is a fundamental theme in the Series, and I love seeing them getting together. I'm not bothered by the unconventional M/F/M relationship. Given how many writers push M/Multis, why can't I support my favorite female character have both her beloved boys?

***** I can't really picture Ron with any characters we know of. For me, Hermione isn't an option because while I know that some people argue that bickering and fighting like they do constantly is fine in some relationships, that doesn't make sense to me at all. Constant fighting for me seems unhealthy. I can easily see her go all in for her work and submerging herself into it, and then end up taking Ron for granted and forget his needs in the relationship too. We see throughout the whole series that she's frequently criticising and belittling him. He's already insecure, and I think that'd make Ron either depressed or angered. Considering she attacked Ron twice (HBP and DH), I can see her as resorting to violence when she gets angry enough. From my point of view, their relationship is emotionally and perhaps also physically abusive. For Ron, anyone but Hermione would be ok.

** Manipulative Dumbledore. The old man who has made a lot of choices he didn't like is great but manipulative dumbledore is much more fun for me. It presents a villain that is much more present in the story as opposed to Voldemort who only really ever shows up near the end of the year. The downside is that whenever manipulative dumbledore shows up, he's portrayed as an incompetent jackass because there's no way Harry can win against Voldemort AND competent evil Dumbledore.

*** I love an actual manipulative Dumbledore (as in one that addresses the absolute fuckery going on in canon). It makes no sense to have a "Ho ho ho, my dear boy, have a lemon drop, my dear boy, they aren't poisoned. Don't go to Gringotts and get an inheritance test, my dear boy, there's no point" when canon Dumbledore uses child soldiers to accomplish his goals. I love linkao3(24288577) because it doesn't do any of the usual manipulative Dumbledore bullshit, just Harry coming to terms with being raised as a weapon. Or Of A Linear Circle, where the Elder Wand didn't like Dumbledore not killing to take it, so it's been amplifying his need for control and engineering a conflict where it would be passed on to a worthy host.

You don't need stupid absurd situations to have someone who really shouldn't be in control have power.

** Mindscape-type Occlumency. It's not super common, but the few times I've seen it mentioned people seem to dislike it. I think when used by a good writer, it allows for a lot of creativity, exploration of the way a character's mind works, different types of tension, and also is just fun, even if it's not "realistic" (whatever that means in the world of HP fanfics).

I don't actually know a lot of fics that use it, tbh. I like it in the Pureblood Pretense series, and also in the Saving Connor series (at least what was done with it before I stopped reading for different reasons), but nothing else really comes to mind, and I think it could be explored in a lot more ways.

Marriage laws. With the things the Ministry pulled in canon Marriage law never seemed out of realm of possibility to me. Nor it seem strange that the characters would go along with it seeing as they went along with some really questionable stuff in canon.

Also the forever questionable friend/boyfriend Draco and/or Voldemort. Yes, their canon selves are not somebody I would ever be interested in meeting. But guess what? People are allowed to like reading about morally grey, and yes even morally evil characters, as protagonists! AndI'm not only saying 'Draco is a war criminal but we're still allowed so see him have a happy life'. It's also 'Harry is allowed to like an ex death eater despite the shit they did in the past'.

** A lot of people hate it when Remus calls Harry "cub" or Sirius calls him "pup." Personally, I find it kind of cute and endearing, though I can understand why some people dislike it. I kinda jump between preferring to see Harry as an adult despite how young he is or a seriously abused and love-starved teenager.

I absolutely /love/ Lord Potter-Black fics, though. Not the really bad ones where no one knows how to write, but the ones that include politics really well and the plot's decent. I don't care if it's cliche, I love cliches a lot of the time, but I love it. Harems, though, are something I absolutely hate that these fics include.

Manipulative Dumbledore is something I like, though most people make him evil. Evil Dumbledore is something completely different that I simply just don't agree with. Like, in most fics, they have Dumbledore steal money from Harry along with the Weasleys and have him know that the Dursleys abuse him but he doesn't care "for the Greater Good" and all this bullshit. Now fics where Dumbledore (like in canon) believes that leaving Harry with the Dursleys and not telling him about his heritage and the ilk, now that's something that I don't mind. Dumbledore isn't inherently evil, though he does tend to see himself as a chess master or something similar to a God. Or maybe he simply knows best. But fics where he doesn't see that his decisions are wrong, now those are fics I like.

There are fics where Harry uses a time-compressor thing to fit years of knowledge into the span of a few days. Many of the fics I've read have simply skimmed over it and made Harry learn like ten years worth of stuff within like ten days, which I don't like, but if it's something like an hour/1 minute=10 minutes, then that's something I can agree with. And he doesn't use it all at one time, either.

The King/Queen of Slytherin trope. A lot of people hate it when children are doing politics in-House, but I personally love it. I've come across a really good fic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10139565/1/Travel-Secrets-Third][Travel Secrets: Third]]) that does it wonderfully.

Not many people villainize the Marauders, but I came across a */really fucking good/* fic where James and Sirius kinda forced Lily into marriage with James. It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet]]. It's a little slow and annoying and ridiculous in the beginning because it seriously villainized Dumbledore, but I'm a huge fan.

Twilight crossovers. I haven't come across many that fit my requirements, but I absolutely love fics where Harry's shipped with either Edward or Jasper. Most tend to be Hermione shipped with Carlisle or Charlie, though, which I find annoying because I want Harry-centric fics.

Harry/Ginny. Not a lot of people tend to like this pairing, and I'll admit that I disliked it when I began to read Harry Potter fanfiction, but I've come to love really thought-out romances between the two. Soulmate fics, in particular.

Shortening Hermione's name to 'Mione. A lot of people hate it for some reason but I think it makes sense. Obviously, not using it every single time you have to say her name, but on occasion it's nice.

Master of Death. There are surprisingly little fics about Harry as MOD when he's either reborn or is summoned to a world where his parents are alive or whatever. Not necessarily something people dislike, but just things that people don't seem to write much about from what I've come across.

Grey!Harry or Dark!Harry. People tend to hate evil Harry but Harry's not typically evil in these.

Orphanage fics. From what I've seen, people tend to hate it when Harry's sent to an orphanage because they feel that it's basically just stealing Tom Riddle's childhood and plugging it into Harry's. There aren't many fics that explore this.

Slytherin Ron. A lot of people argue that since canon Ron absolutely froths at the mouth at the thought of Slytherins that there's no way that he'd be one. Personally, I'd love to see more fics that explores the Golden Trio being put in Slytherin. I've only come across one ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8671198/chapters/19877506][Pathetic, Ordinary, Liars]]) that I like.

A lot of people like to bash on Harry/Remus or Harry/Sirius but I'm a big fan of that if it's written well.

Extremely powerful Harry. I understand how people find it completely ridiculous that fifteen or sixteen-year-old Harry is like a bloody God (which I completely agree with), but if it's written well, I love fics where Harry is super good at duelling and is intelligent and the like. Like, it's shown that he's really good at Defence. He's gone head-to-head with Death Eaters before, I'm sure with a little extra training he'd be able to defeat most of them with some effort.

** I've never minded nicknames as long as they don't get too out of hand.

Everyone seems to call out the enemies to lovers trope but I'm never quite sure why.(Weather it's dramione, Drarry, or anything with Bellatrix or Snape) I love watching characters change and develope as they age. Especially post war when they are for the very first time since age 10 living a normal life.

I'm a sucker for a good ole soulbond/soulmate/veela fic. They're really good with pining too.

I don't mind prongslet or pup or pack. If it doesn't deter from the main storytelling (as in, that's what they say all the time) then it's endearing.

*** Two big things I like about his fics:

1) Originality - yes, his fics are quite tropey (especially by current standards), but they each contain at least minor/peripheral elements that I haven't seen elsewhere, and no, it's not because those ideas are so terrible nobody else would use them (in most cases). For someone like me that's read tons of fanfics, it's a breath of fresh air to read something novel.

2) Tension - at times RobSt's fics have legitimately gotten my heart pounding with tension/excitement. That's hard enough to pull off with a movie or TV show, let alone written prose.

*** The wish fulfillment part is a matter of taste.

The part of Harry Crow where everyone is reduced to either a one-dimensional doormat for Harry, or a one-dimensional caricatured enemy, though, is legitimately bad writing.

(Seriously, his first ever words to Professor McGonagall are a horribly rude and vicious public tirade for her part in him being left on his relatives' doorstep, and forever afterward she sings his praises to everyone for his /politeness/? Ron is just straight out abusive to absolutely everyone and never notices he's doing it? Dumbledore is both obsessed with controlling Harry, and utterly incompetent at it, and has no other character traits?)

I know quite a few people hate time travel stories but I really like them IF they're done right. Tbf it's usually a phase I go through every so often, I'll read a bunch then not read any for months. Annoys me so much that there's so many that almost never get updated or are abandoned all together.

** Most things! For me, the joy of fanfiction is the creativity and scope to use the familiar setting to tell the story that /you/ find interesting and compelling. Fanfiction is, more than anything, collaborative writing, or creative participation in bringing more of what you want into a world already set up that you have interest in further exploring, and I love seeing what people do with those.

I also have come to think that this is perhaps a rarer way today to experience fanfiction. For me, each fic is a separate world and universe. I don't come to think that one particular pairing or imagining becomes my new headcanon, or even comes to replace or challenge canon. They are all able to exist simulatenously alongside each other in my head, and I don't find any kind of conflict with that because each is its own separate 'what if' story.

For me, most things I'll be open-minded about because there's always the potential it will be done in an interesting and compelling way - and if, for something like e.g. a Snape/Harry pairing there are canon elements that would make that squicky, usually the author will simply change them to head it off.

** I love inheritance, raised by a wizard, political, Lord Potter (and Black-Evans-Peverell-Gryffindoor-Slytherin) power wank.

Preferably all in one story.

My perfect story would be Harry raised by the Flamels to be extremely strong, inherits 10 families worth of magical equipment and votes when he is emancipated (which of course he would be), is friends with a bunch of cool people from all of the houses (with or without Ron and Hermione), and stomps his way through the Wizengamot with his new power block. Bonus points if he's extremely good at magic, muggle martial arts, and the law. (I have a soft spot for when he pulls rank on Snape and Malfoy)

I know its trite, over done, and usually extremely badly written, but I love fics like this.

Can't help it.
