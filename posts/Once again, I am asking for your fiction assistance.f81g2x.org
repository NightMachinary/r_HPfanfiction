:END:
Takes place during Harry's 6th year I believe. Might be 5th though. He's some of the details I remember:

-Harry burns his possessions in the Great Hall during chapter 1 or 2.

-Dursleys are murdered

-Harry disappears and is trained by a man named Forge, who has a well he can use to see the mortal realm?

-Harry is a war mage or something.

-Harry takes Ginny, Neville, and another into different periods of time.

Been looking for months, so any help is appreciated
