Personally I think if he looked like Lily she would be even crueler, because it would be the ultimate reminder of her sister


** Well, in The Cursed Child its mentioned that Petunia kept the blanket in which Harry was wrapped as it was the only thing reminding her of Lily. If we consider that story canon, we could assume that fem Harry would be treated /better/ since Petunia would see it as a second chance - she clearly has regrets.

If we are sticking strictly to the original books its a bit harder to say. If she sees Lily as someone who abandoned family for magic, fem Harry might have it worse.

On the other hand, if she sees the magic community as the bad guys then it would make sense for her to hate boy Harry more since he looks like the wizard who "stole" Lily away.

Also, since Dursley household appears to be quite "traditional" fem Harry would probably have an easier time in general. Like they probably wouldn't allow Dudley to hit her or might even tell him to protect her?

She might get better clothes, since /normal/ appearance standards for girls are higher than for boys etc.

*** I'd agree with that, and add that the perceived rivalry between two cousins mirroring the two sisters would definitely be changed. I feel Petunias insistence of Dudley always being put first was fueled by Petunia feeling pushed aside by Lily.

*** Also I think Petunia keeping Harry's blanket is a bit of a character development as far someone horrible like Petunia can go. It shows regret of how she treated Harry and specially her relationship with Lily, but yes, I don't think 'Henrietta Potter' formative years would be easier. Probably female Harry would get more mysoginistic abuse from Petunia since she would project Lily and narcisistic rage on her. Petunia was simply not right in the head.

** She treated her sister terribly. Don't see how making Harry look similar to her would change her behavior.

** I think she's fucked up and seriously needs therapy, so even if she did treat her differently she'd still be horrible, in different ways. A cherubic red headed child would bring out the same jealousy, and a girl would bear the brunt of her seriously intense internalised misogyny

***** It has different implications, lmao. Just like it would if he wasn't white and she still made him do all of the work.

No act is in a vacuum, and when you're writing fiction everything is a decision, and you have to think about all of the implications and nuances because the fact of the matter is that people are racist and sexist and really shitty.

**** lol we only see her interact with dudes in canon. But the way she interacts with them tells me she has some ideas about a woman's role in society.

Plus she's written by a terf who is riddled with internalised misogyny as seen in the way she wrote literally every female character.

not here for a debate though, just sharing my opinion on her character to answer OP's question

  in a burst of accidental magic, Harry uses legilimensy to see pictures of his mother, and wish magic turns him into a little girl who looks like Lily. Vernon dies, and Petunia looks for somewhere to move. In Crawley they meet a little girl who also has accidental magic and with Petunia's knowledge and Dan Granger's cunning, plots are made. Fem! Harry, an experiment for me.

** I think it's more of the same. Maybe he wouldn't sleep in a cabin but he would still stand all the abuse. Specially considering that she would see Lily in female Harry and she would project, similar to Snape.
