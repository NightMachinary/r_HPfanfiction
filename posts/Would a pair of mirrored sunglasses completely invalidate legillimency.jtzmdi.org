Hell, getting them for every student in hogwarts mightve protected them from the basilisk, or at least leave them only petrified (not that they knew what the monster was).


** I don't think so. While the reflective surface may reflect it, you can still see through it. In COS Colin Creevey sees the basalisk through the camera and gets petrified, unless some Runic enchantment mumbo jumbo is added then it's up to the perview of the writer

*** What about legilimency though? It would keep their eyes from meeting yours even if you could see them.

You seemed to know it wasn't spelt right, but it looks like you chose the wrong misspelling of 'university'

** We don't know enough about how Legilimency works to really say.

One thing that is worth noting is that whilst Snape /does/ say that "eye contact is often essential to Legilimency", he does so in the context of how "time and space matter in magic". A reasonable interpretation is that by "eye contact" he meant you should be able to see your target, not that you need to be looking in their eyes.

In particular when Snape casts the spell on Harry, Harry is looking at Snape's wand. I.e. they aren't making eye contact. The idea you need to be looking the target in the eye might be fanon to be honest.

** All you should need to block Legilimency would be enchanted clothing with Shield Charms like the Twins invented. Protego can throw back the Legilimens spell as Harry showed against Snape. Nothing more fancy required.
