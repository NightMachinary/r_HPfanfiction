** I'd say linkffn(Tyrant) is your best bet. It's an adaptation of Julius Ceasar, and features Harry that chooses to be an intellectual, rather than an auror or a soldier.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.
