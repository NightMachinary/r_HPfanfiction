But not the kind of "misunderstood anti hero" type. Im looking for fics in which they are evil and they know it, but at the same time not feel like they are written by a pre-teen edgelord trying to make the most stereotypical and cartoonish villains ever. The longer, the better, too.


** I am Lord Voldemort? linkffn(12980210) is very creative and has plenty of engaging dueling scenes.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)
