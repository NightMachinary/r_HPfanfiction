Rather than deciding I wanted something to read, I stumbled into all of this by way of an imgur posting that had wanted posters of various OotP members. One of the comments linked to a DM/HG fic that was amusing enough... and it all went downhill from there.

How many other people got started on fanfiction without any real intention to do so on their part? How did you get pulled in?


** I rewatched the films. The last shot of the DH epilogue is a fade-in to Harry and Hermione with Ron and Ginny pushed off to the sides. Googled 'Harry and Hermione' and haven't looked back.

**** Melissa Anelli is hardly an impartial source. Both mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron are canon hugboxes that despise H/Hr and went out of their way to split the fandom into extremely bitter elements after HBP was released. It's no surprise that they dislike the movies as well.

Also, the quote at the end of that rant is misattributed and taken out of context. First of all, it's not from the first book. It's from the scene in PoA where Snape takes over DADA for Remus while he's busy being a wolf. Secondly, the full quote is:

#+begin_quote
  "That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger," said Snape coolly. "Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all."

  Hermione went very red, put down her hands, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and *Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week*, said loudly, "You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told?"
#+end_quote

Added emphasis mine. Think about what life must be like for Hermione at Hogwarts. Instead of shrugging his shoulders and allowing Hermione to have her own separate interests, Ron lambasts her weekly for enjoying school. I think if anyone had their rough edges sanded down by the movie's alteration of that scene it was Ron.

Lets not attribute blame to one side here. The shipping flame wars date well before HBP. Cassandra Claire was butting heads with all of Gryffindor Alley over shipping way back in 2001.

Also, you miss the point. I don't really care that much about Hermione, either books or movies, and its the same qualities that endear her to other readers that rub me the wrong way. But I do like Ron, and despite your analysis, the movies /did/ take away most of his good lines and award them to Hermione. Especially the Sirius Black thing, which pissed me off, because it takes one of Ron's defining lines in the series and gives it to Hermione. Even the epilogue thing, which you mentioned, is a (not so) subtle slight to Ron and Ginny. Which is funny, because it's exactly what (most of) the 'Harmonians' have been doing for years -- glorifying Hermione at the Weasleys expense.

****** To my knowledge, no administrators of H/Hr websites were given exclusive interviews with JKR on the eve of a book's release. Melissa and Emerson disagreed with my viewpoint and preferences regarding characters in the series. Instead of saying 'Agree to disagree,' they called me a delusional, militant lunatic. I understand if you think that doesn't cross some sort of line because Cassy Claire said some rude things on the internet. It doesn't sound equitable to me, but I understand people will feel differently about it.

I strongly disagree with the assumption that the majority of H/Hr fans embrace Weasley bashing. If you want to read those fics, they're certainly out there. There's no denying that. If a story has lots of bashing and Hermione-Sue everywhere then that's just weak writing and not a component of the subfandom.

** Firefly was cancelled.

I went looking to see if more stuff was available in book form and stumbled onto a Jayne/River fic on literotica. Searching for more brought me to [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green eyes]] which is a crossover to HP. This story was much better than most of the Firefly fanfic, and I reasoned out that ~300,000 fics for the fandom would give better odds of finding good stories than ~2,300.

** I don't recall how I got into fic directly. I think it was ages go, like right after GOF came out. I was just Googling (probably with AOL search or DogPile as it was so long ago and on dialup) and I found ffnet. I looked around and I know the first thing I clicked on was a post-Hogwarts or non-magic AU where everyone was underwear models. I didn't understand anything fanon at the time so words like “Slash” meant nothing to me. Then it turned into a very hardcore (pre-purge) Drarry and I left the site for a while because I was very, very young. I came back at the time of OoTP and started consuming mass quantities.

I read plenty of other stories and pairings too though. It's mostly clicking on suggestions from this subreddit, reading half a chapter, and deciding if I'm interested enough to continue.

** I stumbled into it through the other way. I wrote a short story for my friends about Sirius suffering in Azkaban, and one of them was like, "You know, you can post this on the Internet. It's REALLY good!". That was in sixth grade...so 12 years ago.

Better than my husband, at least. Back before the fifth book, he was a snobby little computer nerd who found a "pre-released" version of the book for a download. Turns out it was just an elaborate fanfiction. He was very disappointed, so much so that he never actually read books 5,6, and 7. I'm trying to rectify this without much luck...because he's still a snobby little computer nerd. :)

** Well by the time I started reading Harry Potter fanfiction I had been reading Naruto fanfiction for years, but I started HP after getting a summer job that gave me lots of down time and to spend that time I decided to read the series, I got through the first three in a day each and read 4&5 over about two weeks but by the time I got to 6 I was utterly burnt out and though "hey lets check out the Harry Potter fanfiction section I always disliked how Harry never got with Hermione this should be good" and I never looked back.

But my actual entry into fanfiction was through a youtube series actually. I was randomly searching for Naruto videos when I came across what was titled Naruto AIM chats, there were actually dozens of them, they were incredibly OOC as you can imagine and they actually started my love for non-canon pairings because in a few they had Naruto with literally every girl his age but Sakura and Hinata. These youtube videos led me to searching on deviantart for similar where I found a series titled Naruto OOC which then led me to fanfiction.net where my first actual fic called From Ramen with Love and fanfiction has consumed me in some way or another since
