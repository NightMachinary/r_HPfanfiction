:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I'm looking for a fic I read a while back but don't remember the name of. I think it started in 4th year and focused on the tournament. Several events were different, with one of them being some sort of team event in the forest. I think there was also a dueling event, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
