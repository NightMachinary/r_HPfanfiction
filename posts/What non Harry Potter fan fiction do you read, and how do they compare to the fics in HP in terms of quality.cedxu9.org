I've read a few Naruto fics, a few Star Wars fics, and even an extremely long (and still ongoing) DBZ fic but I've yet to come across anything close to the works in the HP fandom. Naruto possibly comes the closet for me but I just don't feel the same pull that I feel for HP. It's a draw that keeps coming back and searching for new fics. I would consider myself a Star Wars fan above all else but even those fics feel lackluster when compared to Harry Potter. Although that could be due to the fact that there are literally hundreds of Star Wars books (I'm including legends and Disney canon), and I myself am quite partial to the old legends canon so I think it's a little bit harder for me to see the different possibilities fan fiction authors come up with. Whereas in Harry Potter my personal idea of canon is just the 7 books, so I think it's easier to read about what happens next or how the story changes when Harry is raised by x person. But I'm interested to hear your thoughts and if you've found other stories that compare to the ones often recommended here.


** Worm, Star Wars, Game of Thrones, others here and there.

Mostly Worm. I've written a handful of abandoned stories for Worm. The Worm fandom is /tiny/ compared to HP. I'd say the average Worm fanfic is head and shoulders above the average HP fanfic, just because the fanbase trends older.

Having said that, the bell curve for HP is so frigging huge, you could take the top 0.1% of all HP fanfics and have more to read than the entire Worm fandom. I'd also say that the very best of the HP fandom slightly edges out the very best of the Worm fandom, just due to size alone.

** In my experience Sturgeon's Law applies equally to all fandoms. The Harry Potter fanfiction community just happens to be 10x the size of almost every other fanfiction community and predates most other online fanfiction communities by many years. Following Sturgeon's Law, if only 10% of all works in any given fandom are good, then it's not surprising that 10% of 613,000 (HP fics on FFN) ends up being more fics than, say, 10% of 40,600 (Star Wars fics on FFN).

Personally, I've found at least a few awe-inspiringly good fics in every fandom I've read. I've read more HP fanfiction than anything else, but I also love some fics in the Avengers fandom, the Labyrinth fandom, Animorphs, Prince of Persia, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, etc. Each of these fics is equal in quality to the best HP fanfics I've read.

Here are a few of my favorites in other fandoms:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]] - /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ fanfic set in a distant future when humanity is under attack by an alien civilization.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/402721/][A Forfeit of Dreams]] - /Labyrinth/ fanfic with Sarah drawn back into the Labyrinth several years after the events in the movie.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3205954/1/Did-You-Miss-Me][Did You Miss Me?]] - /Prince of Persia/ fanfic about the 'Prince' learning to rule a kingdom while struggling to cope after surviving his sands-corrupted alter-ego.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8126969/1/The-Hangman-s-Hands][The Hangman's Hands]] - /Avengers/ fanfic focused on Loki which picks up after his defeat on Earth and goes in a completely different direction from the later movies.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9963063/1/Bargaining][Bargaining]] - /Avengers/ fanfic about Loki traveling back in time to prevent Thor's death.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][r Animorphs: The Reckoning]] - /Animorphs/ fic with a different take on the original series focused on less tropey/more strategic thinking enemies and heroes struggling with the consequences of their choices.

So while I've read everything worth reading in Fandoms like "The Fosters" and "The SOcial Network", and new stories are slow to come; I can go to HP on ff.net or ao3 and find 10+ chapter stories that I've never seen before.

** I've read a lot of The Song of Achilles/Illiad/classical works fics. There isn't much, it's often either very poetic/a (gritty) modern adaptation or something just more crack-ish. I'm a bit obsessed with these works, so it's always a lot of fun, and it's often very clever. But it's nothing like what I've read in the HP fandom (which I started really looking through since last décembre).

I've read (too much) Teen Wolf fanfics. And it's relatively similar to HP. With the same tendency to bash the part of the trio, same overuse of tropes. And it has the same vilain that can be redeemed and be a source of very interesting stories (yes, I'm the type who reads the TMR/&Harry that are kinda messed up). (Though, there is a lot less sex in HP fics, which I appreciate).

I'm discovering the Avenger/MCU/Iron Man fandom, through the crossovers where Harry is shipped with or son of Tony Stark (if anyone feel like recommending some). I find the writing much more critical of the characters and plot holes of the material than HP. It's very less novelistic in style, I find. Maybe it's because the world is much more realistic than HP, but I find it much more... cold? I could find some fics in HP that could be published, but as good as the fics I found in the MCU are, none of them have this type of quality/feel.

I always end up going back to HP fics and prefer their character development, plot lines and writing style over other fandoms. Although it may be that this subreddits recommendations just trump anything else I can find on my own anywhere else.

** I used to read Hunger Games, and if I could find any that is decent I'd read Skulduggery Pleasant or anything Cosmere.

Basically, what attracts me to fanfic is when I see a worldbuilding element that isn't fully explored or isn't explored in the ways I'd like in canon, cause fanfic can expand on it.

With HP, that's basically any part of the worldbuilding, cause JK went for a wide but shallow approach.

With Hunger Games, it's the Games themselves, the other Districts and the other Victors, which is why The Victor Project is my favourite.

With Skulduggery Pleasant/Cosmere, it's the magic systems and huge variety of options they present.

As for quality, I think HP has more high quality fics, but largely because it's such a popular world for them, I've certainly read HG fics of equivalent quality.

** I read a LOT of FMA fanfic. Honestly, they're generally on the same level when it comes to quality, but more often than not, even stories with similar premises are WILDLY different in terms of atmostsphere.

For example, linkAo3(Light in the Darkness by Sigrun23) and linkffn(Stairway to Paradise).

The former is serious but upbeat (Probably not the right word, but that's the best I can describe it). The characters are trying their best to fix anything they can, but some things just can't be fixed. At the same time, it's a hopeful, "Come hell or highwater" sort of story.

And the latter is a lot more solemn. Roy has almost no idea what he's doing trying to take care of Ed, and he's just winging it and hoping he does something right. This fic swings smoothly between fluffy-ish and depressing. And it gets downright heart-stopping towards the end.

I've seen no great difference in writing quality or story quality between them... except that Naruto and Harry Potter have the same ability to explore far and wide without going completely out of character. Buffy is pretty good about the same, but the tropes can be harder to read and are more widespread (Xander/Spike Slash? ugh...)

** Not many, no. Fanfiction is always difficult because authors have their own ideas of how characters talk and act, and if those ideas are too different to your own, you're not going to enjoy the fic. Or at least I'm not. So the main ones I read are from ones where I got into the fanfiction /before/ I really liked the original work. Harry Potter I went off for a long time, then got into the fanfiction,/then/ got back into the original series and realised I actually did really like it. I read Merlin fics before I ever saw the show, and probably would have been better off never seeing it tbh.

** There are some excellent Inuyasha fics that deeply examine Japan from a historical and cultural perspective. It's also a universe where time-travel, magic, demons/creatures can be explored. Martial combat, arranged marriages, star crossed lovers, redemption are all themes I enjoy. There's also a smaller number of fics focusing on political mechanations and sexism. The main characters are in their teens in canon, so has a YA basis (though I generally l like post-Canon fics with adult characters).

The primary protagonist is a displaced female dropped into an antiquated culture via time travel and she has modern ideas about racism, sexism, gender roles, etc... She discovers she has magic (kinda) only in her adolescence and has missed the training and education to wield it like others might have. Reminds me a bit about Hermione being so earnest but so out of place. Also, the leaving of the world you were born into for the world you were destined for.

Inuyasha is a half-breed orphan that saves the world with his band of friends.

Theres also conflict between full demons, humans and half demons which reminds me of that blood status conflict in HP.

I also like angst and broody as hell male protagonists, which abound. Many of the minor characters have unexplored back stories, which together with a rich universe, makes great fanfiction possible (in my opinion). Canon parallel, or post Canon for characters that ended up open ended fics are my favorite for avoiding the discordance that wildly au fics give me.

The fandom is easy to pick up with a quick perusal of wiki for the bare bones of the story. The movies are on Netflix, as is an English version of the cartoon series. And the manga is amazing.

The MC, Jason Creight, is OC and Ash is only a background character barely mentioned a couple of times, and almost all the story takes place before he first set off in his journey. The story eventually comes to a point where the main character interacts with Ash in a certain arc, but again, Ash is just a background character and just a device to get the plot going. It was published in 2002, but it's one of the best pokemon fics I've ever read. Could be the nostalgia speaking, though. I haven't read it in ages and I'm talking from what I remember from the top of my head. I don't know how I'd feel about it if I read it today. But still, I remember it being very well written, the character development was very good too, the battles were well narrated, and the story in general is well grounded. Obviously it's limited to second gen, since that's all there was back then, I think, but still it's a very good story.

** I read a lot of crossovers between HP and a variety of fandoms. Some of my favorites are with Marvel characters.

As for non-HP FanFiction, I typically read Arrow, Once Upon A Time and Gilmore Girls stories.

Arrow stories are usually pretty awesome. Great SPaG and plot movement. Lots of variety in genre and trope.

Once Upon A Time depends on the ship that you are looking for. There aren't as many options for some of the smaller ships, but the large ships like Captain Swan have some killer stories.

I'm team Logan for Gilmore Girls, so I struggle to find stories some times since it seems like most of the fandom is Team Jess.

** I really like my little pony fanfiction because the characters in the show are so one -dimensional and the show basically exists to sell toys. It means that it really does lend itself well to fanfiction and worldbuilding.

Here are some characters, just go nuts basically.

Great for diverse fanfiction.

​

Here are some of my favorites.

​

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/34706/starlight-over-detrot-a-noir-tale]]

Monster attacks. Crime. Illegal hallucinogens made from electric fruit.

They say things didn't use to be like this. They say things were different, before Luna came back 60 years ago, but Detective Hard "Hardy" Boiled of the Detrot Police Department has never known any world other than that demarcated by the seedy streets of his beloved decaying metropolis; a world in which the coroners sing and dance, surveillance bugs have personality disorders, and the Chief of Police is a scarier entity than most of the eldritch things the city attracts.

The grey unicorn who turned up dead outside the posh High Step Hotel seemed like just another case, but her missing horn is the pointy tip of a very large and nasty iceberg. It's up to Hardy and his friends - a rejected monster hunter, a psychic cab driver, and an underground antiques heir - to find out what's going on in an investigation that promises to stick more than a cupcake into the very eye of Detrot.

Especially if Hardy has anything to say about it.

​

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/16358/my-choices-twisted-tales-through-time]]

On secret assignment from Princess Celestia herself, Twilight investigates a powerful magical artifact for clues to the mystery of Luna's transformation in the evil Nightmare Moon. Incautious use of the artifact sends Twilight hurtling back in time. Can Twilight discover what caused Luna's transformation? And will she ever make it home again?

(Sounds kinda generic but this is one of the best timetravel stories I've ever read. Sadly it was never finished)

​

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/120494/the-assassination-of-twilight-sparkle]]

One year after her coronation, Princess Twilight Sparkle is dead, killed by her own subjects out of fear and jealously. After the funeral, Princess Celestia isolated herself from the world, mourning the loss of her brightest student and daughter figure.

But she cannot weep forever. She must take control of her duties once more. Haunted by the memories of the assassination, and its aftermath, Celestia slowly makes her way to Twilight's resting place to find some closure.

​

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/140415/aftermath-of-a-fallen-star]]

Sequel to ^ This fic spawned a whole group of fanfics in the same universe.

​

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/5170/project-sunflower]]

It is the year 2038, and the Earth is slowly being consumed by a space-borne monstrosity dubbed the Black Tide, which is using nanotechnology to remake the planet into something hideously alien.

Erin Olsen works for Project Harmonics, humanity's last-ditch effort to find a new world before the Tide can wipe them out. But when that world is found, and it turns out to be occupied, Erin will need to find the courage to face the unknown in order to save the inhabitants of both worlds.

​

​

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406279/if-wishes-were-ponies]]

Harry Potter, after a beating by Dudley and friends wishes he had somewhere safe to go, and starts crawling home. He ends up in Equestria. The young Cutie Mark Crusaders find him. A year later, a Hogwarts owl unleashes the CMC, Harry, and Equestria upon wizarding Britain! And adorable cute magic-wielding ponies upon the rest of the world.

​

Hope that helped.

** WhenI was in high school I read a LOT of Star Trek, Sherlock, and Supernatural fics on AO3. Then I stopped reading them while I was in college (I was cool) but then after college got REALLY into X-Files fic (which is really Really excellent). Most of the good X-files fics were on [[http://fluky.gossamer.org/][Gossamer]], which is an archived site from back when the X-Files was actually on TV.

I tried to read doctor who fic but it was all truly awful.

I've also read some South Park fics, and some fics about audio dramas like Wolf 359, King Falls AM, and the Bright Sessions

** Let's talk about ponies.

(For those OOTL: in fall 2010, Hasbro, the toy company, released the most recent iteration of shows meant to sell ponies to young girls, /My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic/ (/FiM/). It gained a following among young and middle-aged men, who called themselves bronies. I will direct you to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_fandom][relevant Wikipedia article]] for more information.)

Here is a list of fandom things that bronies have done markedly better than the next best fandom:

- Everything

Some examples:

** Fanfiction Sites
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fanfiction-sites
   :END:
We get to argue the relative merits of FFN and AO3. Bronies have [[https://www.fimfiction.net/][Fimfiction]]. Features include:

- Stories and author profiles come with pictures attached. (Remember, bronies have done everything better than the next best fandom, and that includes fanart, even if an unfortunate proportion of it is rule 34.)
- Far and away the most attractive layout. (This is related to the above point.)
- Far and away the most functional layout. (This is related to the above point.)
- Author blogs.
- A functional tagging system. ([[https://i.redd.it/mqu02fkpjpn01.png][This]] is not functional, and you can tell because you didn't even need to click to know what image that would be.)
- A more-functional rating system.

** Writer development
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: writer-development
   :END:
I don't write fiction, so I wasn't really around for this part, but I know there existed effective structures for aspiring writers to meet and work with experienced writers. In the early days of the fandom, the hub you went to for stories was Equestria Daily, which curated links to stories that passed a system of prereaders, who would give you at least some feedback if your story was rejected. From [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMMs8H-GpFIXPsQeC0RNu8V-Cq6uyGl_UERpOUK_6KY/edit][The Editor's Omnibus]]:

#+begin_quote
  backlogs can dramatically reduce the quantity and depth of the feedback we can provide.
#+end_quote

Notice, backlogs limit the amount of feedback the prereaders provided, but they---writers skilled enough to be entrusted with discriminating what should be featured---still provided feedback to any yahoo who sent a story their way, although you really should have availed yourself of the many other resources in the community first.

** 'Fic finding
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fic-finding
   :END:
In the beginning, there was Equestria Daily. Equestria Daily would post 'fics that had been screened for quality and then let users rate them. In this second round of rating, some stories did so well that they were designated 6-star. Then some guy named Chris began a [[http://onemansponyramblings.blogspot.com/][blog]] where he rated the 6-star stories on a 5-star scale.

Also, Fimfiction has the best tagging and best rating system.

--------------

I suppose I should recommend some 'fics. The following I enjoyed and should be readable to someone unfamiliar with /MLP:FiM/:

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/234149/what-we-wanted-to-do][What We Wanted to Do]]
- [[https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Cupcakes][Cupcakes]]
- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/13565/naked-singularity][Naked Singularity]]
- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/][Friendship is Optimal]]

(Many of the best 'fics, particularly the longer more 'epic' ones, require in-universe knowledge. Also, ponyfics tend to be much shorter than Harry Potter 'fics. This may be related to /MLP:FiM/ coming in 22-minute installments and /Harry Potter/ books coming in several-hundred-page installments.)

--------------

Other fandoms:

I beta-read [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/naruto-lighting-up-the-dark.51004/][Lighting Up the Dark]] (Naruto).

[[https://m-mcgregor.livejournal.com/tag/fanfic%20commentary:%20i%20am%20what%20i%20am][I Am What I Am]] (Buffy) is a good story by itself, but then the author went through and wrote out inline commentary for the whole thing. I think this is something unusually interesting for those around here. (Unfortunately, that version only exists on Livejournal, which is worse than either FFN or AO3.)

** Right now I'm in the middle of a binge of Kingdom Hearts fanfiction.

Some, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9580894/1/Remember-the-Tides][Remember The Tides]] are novel-length fics from interesting points of divergence. That said, they tend to stay to the stations of canon within the Disney worlds.

That said, I tend to prefer slice-of-life fics. With this in mind, one of my favorite authors is MugetsuPipefox.
