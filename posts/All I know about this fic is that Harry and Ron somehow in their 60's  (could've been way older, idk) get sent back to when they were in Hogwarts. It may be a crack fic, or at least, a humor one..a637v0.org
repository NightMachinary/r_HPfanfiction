#+TITLE: All I know about this fic is that Harry and Ron somehow in their 60's + (could've been way older, idk) get sent back to when they were in Hogwarts. It may be a crack fic, or at least, a humor one.

My brother told me about this fic like 2 years ago and he never remembers the name of it so I could read, and he doesn't remember much else about it, just that it was funny and fun. Which sucks, because it got me curious.

Help a brother out will ya?


** Is this it?

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
