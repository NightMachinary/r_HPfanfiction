I'm looking for a fic that takes place in Asian culture preferably that relates magic with the ancient martial arts. Any suggestions?


** In linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox) Harry & Sirius spent some time in Japan.

In linkffn(30 Minutes That Changed Everything by Radaslab) Harry & Co spent several time-compressed summers in a school in Japan.

** Not the best, but is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine linkffn(10918531) it is a Fate/Stay Night crossover, it doesn't focus so much to martial arts, but does have O-Fuda.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
