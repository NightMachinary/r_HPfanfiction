**** That story is one of the most unintentionally offensive things i've ever read. It's /clearly/ written by an "Irish" American person that has a very confused view on the Troubles and introduces the Poke-IRA as main characters and it's just painful. I adored the first three years until the PokeRA turned up and ruined the entire thing. Even if you can get past that Luna being a Veela and therefore making thousands of references to real world pop culture (this is literally a plot point and every other word she says is like a Supernatural reference).

***** The author has stated many different times that the Johto Revolutionary forces are modeled after the Sons of Liberty from the American Revolution. I have no idea where you are getting anything to do with the IRA.

Yes, Luna makes a million references to pop culture (which does get annoying after a while). However, it's not directly because she's a veela; it's because she's an /untrained/ veela. Other veela in the story (Cynthia, Diantha, Fleur, etc) don't behave the same way as Luna. She's also not just referencing Supernatural, as well. She's referencing a ton of different things. Hell, she made a Team Fortress 2 reference in the current book ("Seduce me!").

From him constantly mentioning that they were based of situations in Ireland and Johto being a very bad Ireland knock-off. If he's changed it recently then weird but it was 100% based on his understanding of Ireland and the IRA when I read it. There may be other influences but it is beyond me how you could read that and say those characters are anything other than Irish.

I said like a Supernatural reference, not just Supernatural. The last chapter (I just checked) also has a huge section devoted to her and Hermione singing Wicked songs in the Great Hall. It's awful.

******* Sure, the author said that Johto is analogous to Ireland, but the Sons of Johto are explicitly and repeatedly stated to be based on the Sons of Liberty, not the IRA. I can't recall a single mention of the IRA in the very copious author's notes. The closest that the author got to it is in the notes for chapter 9 of book 4, in which the author states:

"I am basing Johto on Ireland and its relationship with Britian"

(which also shows yet another of the author's many, many spelling errors).\\
My opinion is that the author is essentially taking the setting of Ireland and plopping the American Sons of Liberty into it. Is it a culturally sensitive decision? Nope. And I personally am not a fan of that plotline.

You should note that I agreed with you there.

Anyway, this series is a sort of guilty pleasure. It's not good prose, it badly needs a good beta (I have respectfully volunteered for this but the author has ignored me each time), and half the subplots are completely pointless. However, the worldbuilding is pretty good. I'd love to see another author take the setting of this series and write their own story in it.

And you wonder why the violent Irish terrorists draw comparison with the IRA? Like I said, it's unintentionally offensive which makes it all the worse. The talking points that are raised are very reminiscent of the IRA too and the commentary on Ireland in general is cringey.

I completely agree with you there, I persevered because of that alone and just gave up when I got to the last update (about 1-2 years ago) because I couldn't force myself to go back. I'd kill for a proper cross over but the only other one i've read that's reasonably long is just an almost word for word rehash of canon with pokemon.

*** There's probably a decent crossover of Harry Potter and Pokemon waiting to be written, but this slightly misses the mark. It falls into 'guilty pleasure' category for me.

The author all but admits they didn't read the HP books fully upon starting the fic, so they're dwelling in fanfic of fanfic realm, just like HPMOR. This is how you get stuff like Luna making cringeworthy pop culture references.

And then there's the... 'interesting' interpretation of Pokemon canon. For one, Kanto and Johto are (based on) actual places in Japan, which makes turning Johto into Ireland and adding in the IRA an incredibly /inspired/ choice. Somehow this incredibly bloody history coexists with both a version of the Harry Potter world and the relatively carefree world of the Pokemon anime. And then, somehow, humans can turn into Pokemon in an analogy to the Animagus transformation. This is never explained, because magic isn't a thing. (Not to mention that now there's a region based on Great Britain, the whole fic's now sitting on an unstable premise.)

Tonally, it's a bit all over the place. Some serious moments, some extreme mood whiplash, some super serious parts, and then wacky hijinks and Luna making Deadpool references.

Honestly, though, there are a lot of genuinely interesting plot ideas in all the BS. The true identity of Voldemort, the true betrayer of the Potters, the original purpose of the Order. But those moments are a bit sparse and far between.
