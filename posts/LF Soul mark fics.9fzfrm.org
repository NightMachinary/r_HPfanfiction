I just read linkffn(like the rain chooses the grass) and it has an interesting take on soul mates. Having a matching 'soul mark' is an interesting idea, and I'd like to read more like that.

The longer the better, preferably with Harry as the main character. I'm, personally, really picky about pairings. I probably won't read anything Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, or slash. That said, someone else might search the subreddit for the same thing I did and stumble onto this in the future. So link'em anyways.


** This one is H/Hr [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/876098]]

** There's linkffn(11923792), which is pretty dull, but it does fit your prompt.

It's Harry/Daphne IIRC with a bunch of other pairings.

  "Scars can come in handy." --- Magic gives the gift of a soulmate. Separated by war, alliances, beliefs, and blood, but connected by skin. What if you shared the scars of the person that magic has given you? What if you really, really wished that you didn't?

  Not once had he ever considered his soulmate would be anything other than a black woman. His opinions on that are already far too solidified to allow for anything else. Yet, green eyes and a carbon copy soulmark are telling him otherwise. (Female Harry Potter)

*** Not really what I'm looking for, I don't think.

Like I said- soul marks, not /just/ soul mates.

Having some sort of physical sign that matches between two people that basically says "ay you're soul mates" is more what I'm wanting. In 'Like The Rain Chooses The Grass' it's a full blown design on two people with individual words in a language they speak describing them. But anything along that vein works, I've seen a few fics use scars.
