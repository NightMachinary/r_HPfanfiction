I'm really into the Weasley twins lately and I'd like to know some of your favourite fics involving them as main characters or important characters.

Doesn't matter if it's a Fred pairing or George pairing or no pairing. I just want something that explores their characters and what they're like. Where we see some of the things they get up to. I think their dynamic is so interesting and they're fun characters, it's sad to see so much of their potential wasted when they're cast aside as side characters.


** Crossing Lines is great, they are quite in-character. So is Snape. It's not particularly funny even though it's the twins but it's a good engaging read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines]]

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193]]) has one of the twins as one of the 3 most prominent characters. It's by my favorite author who also wrote a couple other fics that get a lot of love in this sub (Life skills outside the curriculum and The secret language of plants). This one is not very whimsical, but it's very well-written with a great plot and character development.

Happy reading!

  A story of loss and grief, the best section of the newspaper, art appreciation, good and bad detective work and the awful way around words of Harry Potter.

** Lumos by Treesap is my fav(currently unfinished but with regular updates!!) it's post war George/Hermione AU where Hermione loses her memory. The author alternates between the “present” timeline and the history of the relationship in a way that coincides with the books really well!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24328411/chapters/58657078]]

Also love Muggle by Tinax2, it's about a muggle girl named Lexi finds herself back in time at the beginning of GOF and goes through the last book, the twins are main characters

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/215788195-muggle]]

Fox Ears is great too, for me it's what really happened post- war
