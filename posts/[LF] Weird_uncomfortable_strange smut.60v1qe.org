The kind of smut that makes you go "Did I /really/ just read that??

(It has to be good smut though.)

Other than no slash, go crazy with the suggestions. It'd be interesting to see what you guys +fap to+ read.

*** Really? I remember reading quite a few polyjuice misadventures weirder. There was one where a gay guy uses it to turn into a girl while his boyfriend was going to use it to turn into Harry, but then Harry himself turns up and the guy doesn't realize it till afterwards. Meanwhile the boyfriend-turned-into-Harry confuses some random female for his boyfriend and later it turns out they are related or something... .

**** That's /A Black Comedy/, in a story being told by Ghost-Ginny without smut. The woman was the guy's Aunt, who wrote an article for the Daily Prophet about how Harry Potter is the world's greatest lover.

** There's always the classic Squid/Hogwarts. I seem to recall one with the sorting hat but I don't remember if it was actually good, just uncomfortable.

** I occasionally sort by the oddest pairings I can think of at the time. Like Dobby/Hagrid, the infamous Giant Squid/Hogwart fics, but by and far the most horrific and WTF smut fic I have ever found is a Ron/Hedwig one. He ends up raping the bird to death, and then continues to use the increasingly decayed corpse.

If you really, really want I can try to find it again...but man was it weird.
