Are there any fics where the main character (preferably a lightning era kid) goes back in time to their younger body to start over, and end up with a physically older witch or wizard who is mentally close in age to them? ie. Harry goes back into his younger body and ends up seducing Narcissa the second time around. Bonus points if they don't come clean about the time travel right away or at all.

I'd prefer no harem fics or explicit underage please.
