I'm looking for fics that have really well defined rules and constraints to magic (or the economy tbh). There's one in particular I remember reading where McGonnall instructs the class not to eat transfigured food or ever transfigure something into a gas because it will revert back. Anyone know? It was a pretty elaborate section.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has both. It's a WBWL story that attempts to fix a lot of the holes left in canon (and in standard fanfiction cliches). There are nice explanations of tons of things like whether wizards all around the world have wands, how the economy works, and why wizards even need wands if wandless magic/accidental magic even exists.

If you like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/91/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][the excerpts below]], you may enjoy the worldbuilding in this fic:

*On why the Weasleys are poor when they have magic*:

#+begin_quote
  "This is probably just because I'm Muggle-raised, but wizarding culture sounds incredibly corrupt."

  The older man shrugged. "It's a matter of perspective. The Muggle government taxes everyone and so, in theory at least, has to pay attention to everyone's wants, although it's not a surprise that it pays more attention to wealthier people than the poor. Among wizards, you need galleons to fund government projects, but the wealthy wizards are the only ones who have that much in liquid assets and so bear the brunt of taxation. Most common wizards don't have a lot of currency because they don't need it. With limited exceptions for food and shelter, magic can give you whatever you need to survive. If you know how to apparate, you can transport yourself almost anywhere. If you're good with Transfiguration, you can make most everyday items you need. If you know the Reparo Charm, nearly anything tangible you buy will last a lifetime or longer. In all of Diagon Alley, there are only four stores that sell clothing because only rich wizard-folk -- or wizard-folk who want to be perceived as rich -- bother to pay for clothing produced by other wizards instead of simply transfigured out of used garments. I believe the comparable Muggle term is post-scarcity society. Most wizard-folk only need galleons in large quantities if they decide to operate a business of some kind, and they usually get the money from investors among the old rich families."

  Harry wasn't entirely sure what post-scarcity meant, so he made a mental note to ask Hermione about it later. "So basically, most wizards and witches can take care of their own personal needs without any aid from the government, but for big ... society stuff, I guess, the Ministry provides it and pays for it with taxes mainly paid by the wealthiest families in exchange for 'special favors'?"

  "A crude but accurate summation," Artie said. "And if you think Fudge is bad, you'd have hated Millicent Bagnold. She was the one who signed off on dismissing all charges against dozens of marked Death Eaters who claimed with little supporting evidence to have been under the Imperius. She concluded that Sirius Black's confession made convicting most of them an impossibility, so she agreed to dismiss most of the remaining prosecutions if those accused paid out enough galleons to essentially rebuild our whole society after a decade of constant destructive warfare."

--------------

*On magical cores:*

#+begin_quote
  "Well, what is a magical core, then?" Harry asked. He'd heard the term used several times but never gotten an explanation of it.

  Moody shrugged. "Depends on who you ask. Some say it's something inside you that generates the power that fuels your magic, whether something immaterial that's part of your aura or some part of your body that's below the level of a cell and too small to detect. Others say its more like a imperceptible portal that lets you draw energy from, well, somewhere else. Some people say it's your soul, but I'm not about to wade into that metaphysical thicket today. My point is, nobody knows for sure. What is known is that while the core cannot be directly perceived or measured, you can estimate someone's core strength by various magical tests. The Lubinsky-Chang test is the most accurate, but it was invented by foreigners, so here in Britain, we stubbornly cling to the Belby-Cadwallader test for measuring core size. Under that standard, your core would be rated Theta-Green, which is rather impressive for someone not yet thirteen. Naturally, core size, in this case, doesn't mean physically big or small but rather refers to magical output. Someone with a larger core can cast more spells before tiring; can cast more physically demanding spells like shields, Patronuses, and Unforgivables; and can master more wandless spells than someone with a weaker core. That last bit is most important to our current discussion because you only have a finite number of these hypothetical metaphorical psychic strands and that number is limited according to your core size. In other words, there's a strict limit on the total number of spells you can possibly learn to cast without a wand. Most wizards don't even bother to learn more than four or five. For the typical experienced auror, it's probably twenty or thirty. I personally know sixty-two wandless spells. For someone like Dumbledore or Voldie, it's probably a hundred or more."

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** I think HPMOR has that scene you're talking about where McGonagall lays down the law about never eating or drinking transfigured material.

As for HPMOR itself, I can see why people don't like it, but I really enjoyed the thorough treatment the author did of trying to actually address all the inconsistencies from the books and find ways to explain them.

**** It's essentially an AU in which Petunia married a scientist instead of Vernon, and as a result Harry was raised with a more "scientific" mind and goes under the name "Harry Potter-Evans-Verres." Or "Harry PEV," as I'm going to call him.

Harry PEV is essentially a self-insert for the author as he goes through his first year pointing out how stupid and illogical the author thinks the wizarding world is.

Can't answer for anyone else, but I don't like it because it's essentially like Harry PEV: Horribly smug, extremely patronising, infuriatingly annoying, and utterly convinced of its own genius and wit, even if it isn't anywhere near as clever or funny as it thinks it is.

****** A lot of people dislike it, and you pretty read a review detailing it in its worst light.

If you do read it, read it with these first few alternate chapters, because for some reason the author never went back and revised the first few chapters to make it better. Like a lot of fanfiction, the first few chapters weren't very good.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-Rationality]])

I would recommend reading them instead of taking the word of someone else, especially considering how much this sub hates it. Read those chapters and then decide if you want to continue. I, personally, really liked it. That said, it is definitely a flawed work, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth reading.

A common statement is that HP is an SI of the author, although that blatantly isn't true. He's kind of a Gary Sue in those first few chapters, which is why you should read that version.

I like the story because of how different it is from all other HP fanfiction. It's blatantly different in how its magic works, the history of Voldemort, the tone of the story. It's actually a very fun story that I enjoyed a lot. It's just flawed, that can actually be ignored on the first go around.

Also, you might need to read more than those first 4 chapters linked, because they're still somewhat stereotypical. They're the classic shopping trip chapters.

It starts getting good once he gets on the train. Several neat stuff happens there and at Hogwarts, in the feast and the morning after.

Honestly, skim read through the first few chapters if they seem a bit stupid. Later on, just skip through any giant monologues about science or whatever. If you still don't like it, it's not for you and that's ok.

tl;dr: It's an incredibly divisive fic, and it's better to give it a try than rely on someone who dislikes it. Plenty of people love it. Despite this, it is a flawed fic, and it's fine if you don't enjoy it.
