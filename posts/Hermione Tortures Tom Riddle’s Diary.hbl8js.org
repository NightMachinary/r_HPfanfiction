:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic in which Hermione tortures Tom Riddle by writing in the diary once a day to force him to experience solitary confinement.

Eventually he tells her what she wants to know.

I'd love that specific fic although if anyone knows of similar Dark!Hermione fics I'll take them too.


** Something similar happened in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House]]) or its sequel, though Hermione is replaced by a Slytherin!Anti!Hermione called Valeria.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

*** This is definitely a story with Hermione torturing the diary:

Chapter 6:

#+begin_quote
  The next morning she got up, spilled emerald green ink all over its blank pages, closed the diary and went about her business.

  She felt, briefly, guilty about what she was doing. She knew, with her keen and practical mind, that leaving Tom Riddle alone, bored, awake and lucid for days, was... not ethical. He'd captured himself in that book, of course, but other than that -

I'd also recommend it.

  Ginny made a thin, distressed sound. “I ... Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly. [Hermione gets the diary. Things go differently from there. AU.]

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731/chapters/7591550]])

I think this is the one you're looking for. It's great and the author (who has incredible fics in several fandoms) has the beginning of a sequel up. Unfortunately, the sequel only has one chapter and hasn't been updated since 2017.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10774203/chapters/23896434]])

The closest, well-done Dark!Hermione I can think of is linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or]]), which is also incomplete at the moment.
