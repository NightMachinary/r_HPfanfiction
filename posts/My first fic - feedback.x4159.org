**** Sorry, I realize that was sort of dickish.

There were a lot of run-ons in the sample you gave us. The detail was there but you were giving too much at once. Try leaving out all of the laser detail until you are more comfortable writing in an easier to read style.

***** However, I understand and agree; I very rarely write anything in which my particular style of writing is quite so inappropriate.

** I can't even read it. I get a "forbidden" page on DevArt

EDIT: Thanks for the link! So I wasn't expecting slash, which isn't really my cup of tea so I'll just talk around that. Overall you're a good writer; good characterization, well edited, etc.. The only problem I see is that you have a tendency for run-on sentences. Go through and read some of the longer sentences and break them up into two or even three smaller sentences. Other than that, it's a good first fic!
