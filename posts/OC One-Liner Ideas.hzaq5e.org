I'm making some OC's, and I'm struggling to create any distinctive and individual characters. So HMU with any of your ideas!

** When you say you're struggling to make them distinctive, what do you mean? Is it the character design you're struggling with, or actually writing them up in your story?

*** I'm not writing a story. I'm trying to make my OC's to fill out the year group above Harry's.

By distinctive, I basically mean not stereotypical and boring!

**** Ah, okay. So, what kind of information are you using for each character?

Something physical (looks, height, musclemass, etc), something personal (demeanour, personality, intellect, idiolect/dialect/accent, etc), and something for backstory (history, heritage, cultural beliefs, etc), or similar?

I don't have any suggestions for specific things that might work for you - I'm not familiar enough with the HP universe for that - but I can definitely say that working out what your options to 'sum up' a character are will likely help you work out more interesting ideas for them. You've got to know what slots you have to fill on your character design in order to fill them, after all. :)

The thing you've got to remember is that all those character traits will interact somehow - they're parts of a whole character, not just individual blocks of things that happened to be stored in the same place. So, you either go macro or micro in approach. Basically, you either start with one trait (micro) and work your way outward, or you start with the whole (macro) and work your way down. Though, interaction doesn't have to be synergistic. It can be conflicting as well!

For example, Justin Finch-Fletchly is commonly used as the 'Arrogant Aristocratic Muggleborn'. That's his 'macro' scale character summary. If you wanted to work downward, you might then look at physicality. How would a rich kid en-route to Eton look? If he's got money, he can probably afford expensive clothing, personal trainers, and whatever the guy version of beauty products is. That would be a synergistic interaction, because the two properties (rich and pretty) work together.

If you wanted something conflicting (and probably more interesting!), you could make him unattractive-looking. Perhaps he tries covering it up with the aforementioned beauty products, perhaps he simply owns it and doesn't care, perhaps he deliberately goes out of his way to dress inexpensively and keeps everything presentable but low-maintenance as possible.

Then you can expand that out into backstory to find his motivation for that - perhaps he was looked down on by other rich kids for not playing the coiffed-hair and un-pocked skin game, perhaps his parents are image-obsessed maniacs who want the picture-perfect family and he feels depressed he can't live up to it?

As a second option, you could also google some tabletop game character design tools:

- Character generators exist - eg. [[http://www.whothefuckismydndcharacter.com/]]
- Trait generators exist - eg. [[https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/character-traits.php]]
- Backstory/history generators exist - eg. [[https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/backstory-descriptions.php]])

There are a tonne more out there which you can find with a google, those are just some examples. They might give you some ideas. I use them a lot for inspiration while making characters for D&D games. :)
