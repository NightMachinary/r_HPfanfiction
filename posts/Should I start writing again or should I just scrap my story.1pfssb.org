A couple of years ago I started to dabble in fanfics and started to write my first one. I eventually abandoned it because I felt that it wasn't up to par. My second story, at least to me was a better written tale and a bit more unique. Sadly life got in the way and my last update was in 2011. Recently I've finally have a bit more time and I would like to start up again but I don't know if my writing is any good or if the story will be garner much interest. Here's the link. Thanks for any advice you guys!

** Hold on for a bit and I'll get right back to you with an answer.

edit: Its an interesting concept for a story. Moved a a fairly quick pace but it seemed like the characters had a bit of outside knowledge or made an illogical jump to the conclusion that they had.

I remember in canon (not that I'm saying you have to stick to it JKR provide book guides) but LV didn't know what caused the "bother-wand" effects until after he had consulted a wandmaker.

It was an enjoyable quick read and I'd like to see what happens further down the road with your story.

*** I attribute his understanding of the Brother Wand effect to him speaking with Alivan over the year he was captive. While not able to craft his own wand, he would be able to understand the basics and he would probably ask about any problems that could pop up with the wands if they were connected.

** If you're still excited about the story, then continue it. If not, find a story you are excited about, and write that.

*** I am. I have ideas for the story that I find interesting. I just wanted to see what others thought because what I perceive as good could actually be bad.
