I recently binge read all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6099036/1/Caf%C3%A9]]

Sadly it seems to be unlikely to be finished. One of my favourite things about it was the portrayal of goblins, definitely not the usual cliches as it had some depth into the culture and meaning behind actions that were not overly friendly, hostile or just annoying.

I've been looking for a fic with similar aspects with little luck. Would appreciate any suggestions,

ps any other Pleasedial123 fans?
