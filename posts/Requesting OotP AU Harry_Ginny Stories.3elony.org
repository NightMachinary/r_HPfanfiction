I am looking for any novel length stories or at least above 50k words where Harry and Ginny get together in Order of the Phoenix. I recently read this compilation of like 40+ one shots of different places Harry and Ginny could have gotten together earlier than in canon and really wish I could read longer stories from those launching points. I would like it for them to stay in character but the plot doesn't have to stay canon but nothing too crazy or unbelievable. If you guys have any suggestions please let me know.


** I can't think of any particularly good stories where they get together in OotP, at least not off the top of my head.

But if you don't mind a post OotP AU (it's got nothing to do with HBP), Taking Control by Fake a Smile is really good, and long. 523k and a 70k sequel.

*** If you think of or see anything let me know but this is the compilation I was talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7055185/1/Harry-Loves-Ginny-and-Ginny-Loves-Harry]] Some of the ideas were a little repetitive but it was still an enjoyable read. I think it is still being updated with new one shots periodically as well.

** Not really. Most good H/G fics are post canon. linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent by Sanction) may be what you're looking for, but it was written before OoTP was released, the the 'gotten together earlier in canon' doesn't really apply. It is an amazing fic nonetheless, and it has aged very well.

**** I've reviewed the story elsewhere before:

There are so many things to love about this story, it is hard to even list all of them -- the writing is top-notch, the worldbuilding is brilliant, the magic system is complex and magical, the plot is completely and utterly unique in the fandom, the characterizations are amazing and the OCs -- fucking hell, the OCs.....

Gallowbraid. Lyle. Magnus. Danny. Jamie. /Dahlia/. Every single one of them an OC, and every single one of them with brilliant, in-depth characterizations with their own rich back-stories. Normally even a a couple of OCs in a fanfic would be too much, but Sanction gets you interested in them from the get go, and it never even matters that they're OCs, because they're better characterized than most canon characters and you're invested in their fates in no time at all.

Dahlia was mentioned before, but she deserves a special mention of her own. She is the centerpiece of all lore in the story, and is utterly brilliant in her role. Never before has a character been so well characterized in fanfiction. Trust me on that.

The lore itself is amazing. I will probably remember the story of Dahlia and Volarius as long as I live. Not to mention the whole story behind the Moody/Gallowbraid feud.

The story as a whole revolves around Harry's quest to obtain the crystal cage, which does not really sound all that impressive at first, but it the journey that makes this story an epic. This is basically the story as Sanction describes it :

#+begin_quote
  It took 22 long chapters for me to realize that all this time I have been writing about the Odyssey. Isn't the subconscious mind a funny thing? In this tale you have a hero whose primary concern is to make it back home to Ithaca where his beloved awaits. Two gods fight to either bring him home or throw him off course. Enemies accost him at every turn, and his journey takes longer and longer than he could ever have expected.
#+end_quote

Harry's maturation during the course of the journey is one of the most important themes of the story, takes place in multiple steps and is overall really well portrayed.

Ginny's own maturation as a character is done really well. The Ginny/Jamie character arc would probably be the best thing in any other story, but here it barely scrapes into the top five. Still very well done though.

Dumbledore is amazing, none of that indy!manipulative!Dumbledore crap.

The Moody-Gallowbraid duel was the most innovative duel I've ever read in fanfiction. Sanction did a great job creating a heated rivalry between those two. Same for Danny-Magnus, though to a lesser extent.

The intros to some of the chapters are epic. This one is probably my favorite:

#+begin_quote
  "For the Aurors, the name Gallowbraid was an in-joke---it meant a non-existent person, a red herring. The phrase 'to chase a gallowbraid' meant to pursue a figment of one's imagination. This phrase originated from Alastor Moody's allegations that a Dark Wizard called 'Andros Gallowbraid' was the perpetrator of certain crimes during and after the first reign of the Dark Lord. Having no records of such a man or any proof of his existence, however, it was widely believed that the aging Auror was steadily going senile, that Gallowbraid was simply a concoction of some of the worst Dark Wizards he had sent to Azkaban, and a convenient villain to blame for the cases he could not solve.

  Now, of course, we know better. Sadly, that knowledge came after the damage had been done."

  --- Lionel W. Bishop, War Journals.
#+end_quote

Of course, the story isn't completely without flaws. The first 3 or 4 chapters of the story are solid, but still rather bland. There is no real hook for the later chapters, and the writing makes it clear that Sanction was still finding his feet as a writer. Fortunately, the chapters five to nine are some of best ever written in fanfiction, and the story becomes a can't-miss from then on.

If there is one fanfic that deserves the word /epic/, then this is it. Very few fanfics manage to stand the test of time -- this one has just grown better over the years as it has become clear that in terms of sheer epicness, this story will never, ever be matched.

The fanfiction.net versions has formatting problems for a couple of chapters. Try the [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=172&chapno=1][Sugarquill]] version instead for those chapters.
