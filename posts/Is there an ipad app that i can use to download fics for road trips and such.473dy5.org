** You should be able to use a computer program such a Calibre to download ebooks/fanfiction and easily move them to your device. Youll need to use a seperate ereader app to read them on your ipad though.

**** I just use iBooks and it works for me - I sync books with iTunes using Calibre and they're automatically downloaded to my phone

***** Will Calibre let you edit the genre or name of the iBook? I want to group all my fics by pairing. Right now I have them in categories, but it's confusing because I can't tell which fics I've sorted and which I haven't.

**** Appwise, i dont. I read ffn on a dedicated ereader (kindle paperwhite), and dont own a tablet. I know that kindle has an app, which would work well so long as you remember to download the epub and convert it to azw3 in calibre.

For the kindle, azw3>>mobi since azw3 retains use of the chapter select feature (ie, a dropdown table of contents). Epub also has that feature, but mobi does not, it uses a hyperlinked ToC as a page in the book (either 1st page or last page, i cant remember

For general use, the 2 relatively easy access filetypes are mobi and epub, of which epub >> mobi for the same reason that azw3 is better: the ToC

***** That's odd. I use .mobi files and have the chapter select function on my paper white.

****** Really? Huh. I remember specifically when i started using calibre to convert epubs to put on my kindle, it defaulted to .mobi and i couldnt use the dropdown chapter select feature. I tried converting to azw3 instead (since thats the format amazon books are DLed in) and then i was able to use the dropdown chapter select feature.

I assumed it was the filetype, but perhaps it was just a settings issue? Anyone else care to chime in with experience or knowledge?

******* Well you did say it was some time ago. It's possible that the mobi file format and/or firmware on the kindle paper white's been updated since then. Or calibres been updated since then.

Is pretty rare for me to convert a fanfiction to mobi file format and not have a working table of contents under the "Go To" button. Not with the web sites and tools I use (the usual ones)

** Mobile downloads are extremely easy and fast with the [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/][p0ody downloader]], which the ff bot here uses.

Once your file downloads, you can easily open up the file using the Kindle app for mobi files, or any other generic ereader for epub. For Android users, I recommend using the Moon+ Reader app for epubs.

** [[http://ficsave.com/][Ficsave]] should work on any browser. And the iOS ebook reader does accept .epub formats.

What I don't know is if you can automatically read those files after downloading them, or if you have to manually transfer them to the ebook reader app via iTunes.

Download fics using P0ody-Files downloader, and open them in iBooks.
