Just curious, cuz it sounds like a good plot bunny, Harry somehow finds a way to cure Astoria of it, but involves something they both must do or something like. Like i said, never seen it be a plot focus in any fic.

*** Well, a shit load of fics use just that fact from the CC, but don't go into the epilogue. I'm just wondering because of the potential for premises that this curse could create and that no-one seems to use it.

***** Well, no. It may not be very good but it /is/ canon, and does contain interesting /concepts/ that fanfiction can explore. There's nothing wrong with the ide of the Greengrass Curse, or of Theodore Nott growing up to be a skilled artificer; it's just all rather badly written.

No! It's badly written Canon.

TBH it's not even that bad. It's almost as internally inconsistent and irrational as other books, especially HBP and DH. It's just that her reader base is not as young and naive as it was when those things came out.

P.S: Coming from a non-English background and reading English literature late in life I failed to see the awe inspiring fairy tale picture that caught many of the JKR reader base when they were kids. It's my personal opinion. Downvotes will change neither that, nor the quality of her books.

***** Honestly, I haven't seen any /specific/ criticism of Cursed Child that wasn't related to Hermione's skin, but I also haven't read it or sought information about it. I see a lot of vague complaints of inconsistency and stuff, to be clear, but not other specific complaints.

****** Hermione's skin color is fine honestly, the real problem is the plot. I won't spoil anything since I'm on mobile but it essentially breaks one of the other series' very important rules, messes up the characterization of most of the HP saga's characters and glosses over noticeable plot holes.

******** First off, they break the canon time travel rules.

Remember in the third book when we discovered time /couldn't/ be changed. It made sense and explained why nobody thought of going back in time and killing Voldemort, or using it to fix any other problem actually. Cursed Child forgets that; the protagonist goes back in time and changes things. It literally uses this as it's the main plot-device, consistently going back in time when they feel like it.

Secondly, why is Hermione so stupid? She not only keeps the last time turner in England, which in itself isn't that crazy if we consider the logic of Cursed Child and it's new canon rules, but Hermione hides it in a place so obvious a bunch of kids could find it. It feels like Harry's first year again with the Philosopher's Stone except it isn't even half as difficult to obtain the time turner! Harry is an oblivious asshole who, even with all the problems he had in his childhood, conveniently forgets what it is like to get bullied at school and just ignores his kid. And don't even get me started with the alternate universe, in what kind of world is Hermione dependent on Ron? Why would she become the next Snape?

Lastly, the trolley witch...the fucking trolley witch.....

Oh and the obvious villain is obvious

But it totally can. Wizards even have laws against meddling with time. Why would you make a law for something that is impossible?

As a one-off play, CC is (probably) very entertaining, if you see it live. As a canon continuation of the most beloved saga our generation has, it is problematic to say the least.

***** Eh, don't be too quick. Rowling didn't write /Cursed Child/, but she did write the /outline/ and approve of the final product. It's a badly-written book, but I'm afraid a lot of the /lore/ in it (which definitely includes Delphini, and /may/ include the Greengrass Curse) is no more or less canon than what she might say on Pottermore or in interviews.

** Linkffn(The Red Knight) addresses it and lampshades it. [[#spoiler][They claim that the Greengrasses are actually part Veela, but they made up the curse since it sounded better to Pureblood families to have cursed blood as opposed to mixed blood. I swear it's better than it sounds. Apparently the Greengrasses and the Delacoeurs have had a long-standing feud and that leads to complications in the story. Also, it relates to the plot in Daphne Greengrass and an explanation on formal Pureblood alliance contracts]]
