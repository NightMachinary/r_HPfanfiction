Hi,

I would like to read fanfics about harry being a reincarnation of anyone really...

Sure we can go big with someone like Theseus of Athens, Merlin, or anyone... Or just some random person. As long as Harry or fem Harry remembers their past life/lives.


** So there is an unfinished one where Harry has lived a bunch of lives and hasn't been able to do the thing so Death sends her into a body of a Peverell, so it's not what you're asking but you still might enjoy it? It's not finished but I found that I was content with where it ended.

Is that something you'd be interested in?

*** You mean “The Last Peverell” by animerocker646 linkffn(12744735) (slowly being published also as linkao3(29167410)), right? It is pretty good (and it has even positive!Petunia!).

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right?

** Try linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious) Not sure if it will ever be completed, but it's pretty darn good.

Fair warning, it's a HPxGOT crossover that's pretty good.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

** There are a ton fics where Harry is a reincarnation of Salazar Slytherin. You can find them on AO3 under the tag Harry is Salazar Slytherin. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22945375/chapters/54848749][The Difference a Soul Makes]] Harry has been reincarnating for centuries, maybe even millennia thanks to a ritual. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504][Full Circle]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26362207/chapters/64207408][To Live Is The Rarest Thing]] Harry and Tom Riddle have been reincarnating for a long time and have been reincarnated as Harry Potter and Tom Riddle again. Just to warn you if that's not your thing, the named fics are all Tomarry fics.
