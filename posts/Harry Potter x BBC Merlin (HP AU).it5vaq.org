Just so happens that Harry Potter is the reincarnation of King Arthur- if pulling out Gryffindors (King Arthurs) sword from the icy lake is anything to go by. [Deathly Hallows]

Merlin, a miserable young man, with the weight of 600 years on his shoulders, feels the resurface of power- it is soft, it is sweeping, and the aura is so much like his friend Arthur's, that it makes him want to cry. But he does not, instead, he goes searching for his once and future King.

Thankfully, his small cottage is not too far from the lake, and as Demetors attack a hole in the ice in the lake, as well as a bushy-haired girl who is fighting for her life, Merlin uses his magic to scare off the Demetors, before helping the young woman save her drowning friend.

But Merlin's breath catches in his throat as he pulls the dark-haired man up, who looks so unlike his King, yet has the exact same aura as him. And with Merlin's curiosity, he decides to help the pair find the horcruxes, before helping to defeat Voldemort.

And I wouldn't mind it being Merlin x Harry, but ya know- I guess they would bond over their shared experience of a sense of duty to a prophecy, as well as Merlin training Harry how to fight back I imagine. I also imagine that Merlin sort of was pinning over Arthur in the past, but never did anything more due to Arthur loving Gwen. Maybe have something similar near the end with Harry and Ginny.
