***** it is LITERALLY masturbatory. there are some very badly written smut scenes. back when first read it, i liked it, although i also liked manipulative dumbledore and lord potter black stuff, so read at your own discretion.

** If you read "Twins" by the same author, it also has another Celine Malfoy/Harry "pairing" as well as some other... stuff. YMMV, though it does have one of my favorite lines ever written in a fanfic.
