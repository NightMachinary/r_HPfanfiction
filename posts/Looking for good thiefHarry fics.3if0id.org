I've searched around on FF.net, but you know how limiting that can be, and there isn't really an easy way to search around on the smaller fan fic websites.

Basically, I'm looking for fics where Harry is a thief. Any pairing, crossovers, it's all fine. I have a feeling I can't be too picky with this.

Thanks!

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

  DZ2's Twice-Blessed Half-Blood Challenge! The Potter Luck has an origin, as does their strength in Transfiguration. Harry's always been faster then most when it came to running from Dudley, but it takes a single letter to set off a new path for him to blaze. The future is shadowed with the fire of a forge, and it takes a thief to steal a brighter future for all.

** linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) is enjoyable. It does have character bashing though (Dumbledore, Ron, Molly especially) and features Harry/Hermione/Luna as time/dimensional travelers who decide to rob all the purebloods/DEs to prevent their funding of Voldemort. It's fun and well written but it's not high-brow serious literature by any means.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
