** Probably not the same one but linkffn(No Competition by Evilgoddss) is fun. At least the first chapter; the rest is ... weird.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

*** While Wind Shear IS incredible, Harry's an adult in that, and I think the fic OP is looking for has him as a child. I'll have to look through my archives and see if Ive got it saved somewhere- I think I remember seeing it.

**** Wind Shear is one of the few stories I have read twice all the way through. Love the take on Harry's tranfiguration/animation power in that.

  [HIATUS!]Deliciously Dark. Evil too. Bellatrix finds baby Harry left with the muggles & discovers his unusual accidental magical trait, one that she finds... Very Appealing. She decides to keep and groom him to be their next Dark Lord, and enlists the aid of Narcissa. Harry/Bellatrix, quasi-harem for a reason but H/B/N overall. M for a reason. THESE CHARACTERS ARE EVIL

*** This one is a teeny tinybit weird. Bellatrix starts thinking of toddler Harry as her future lover or something.
