So, I've recently been looking for this older HP fanfic that I read a couple of years ago.

Harry, Ron and Hermione all enter into some kind of virginity bet- they have to lose it by the end of the year or something. It's HPDM and Ron has some kind of relationship with Katie Bell (could be one of the other older Gryffindor girls though) who is going out with his brother. At one point Ron tries to kill himself in the story too.

Anyway, I'd like to read it again and I'd be much obliged if anyone remembers it.

*** Well, that was nowhere near as good as I remembered it! It was one of the first I ever read, that probably explains it. Thanks for the help. At the very least, I got a trip down memory lane.
