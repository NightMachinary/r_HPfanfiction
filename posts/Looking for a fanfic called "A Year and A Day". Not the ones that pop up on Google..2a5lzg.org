I read this one maybe 3 or 4 years ago. It was either written before the 7th book came out or it just took place during what would be the 7th year. It was X-rated and it had all of Dumbledore's Army living in Grimmauld Place and searching for horcruxes from there. Lots of different pairings, and it was really long. Can anyone help me out? I searched the title on Google and all I got was two unrelated stories with the same title.


** Is this it?
