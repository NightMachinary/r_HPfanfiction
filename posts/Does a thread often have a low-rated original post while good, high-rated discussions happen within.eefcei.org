I've been enjoying the discussion in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/edw722/fun_fact_harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows/]] here and noticed that the original post only has a net total of 6 votes, but there is a very lively discussion happening within, currently up to 111 posts of mostly meaningful comments.

Does this happen often? When I first came here I tried to read up on important old threads by sorting for "Top - All Time".

Are there any important discussion I might have missed? Any threads with topics you enjoyed digging into?


** Not really that I have seen, really it is the topic of this one that is so decisive.

Not really going to get into my views on this. Had a huge thing typed up, realized I don't care to share that much, so instead you get this.

Lots of people hated the base topic, many people are tired of being told they're not inclusive enough of different things. They hate being told what they are doing wrong by some other group spouting the newest failure.

This is a place to escape that stuff, it's fanfiction for a young adult fantasy boy series. They don't want serious here, they want to discuss how many metrics tons of tnt explosive is an Erumpent Horn equivalent to. Absolutely useless but fun and interesting things.

There are likely dozens of subreddits about feminism, actionable females, or some other cause or injustice. This isn't the place for that.

So let's keep this place fun, not a political social hellscape of stuff that has nothing to do with the maturation cycles of Mandrakes around the world, shipping difficulties and costs of them as compared to letting a few muggleborn miss over half a school year.

*** Do you think you should have posted this in /that/ thread? Maybe with a suggestion on more appropriate subreddits to take it to?

***** Okay.

My only concern for this thread was to catch up on stuff I might have missed which was important or interesting to at least a subsection of the people here.

****** Yep, and I replied why I think it was unique in having low votes but high discussion quality. Not seeing why people are downvoting the hell out of me.

******* I don't know about any downvotes but...

I would have upvoted you if you left your answer at that, but you went on to write so much more which looked like a rant, and which seemed a bit like you were shaming me for liking such a discussion here.

*** Then I am more than happy that you haven't posted in that thread. I am not big cultural crusader myself, I posted it truly mostly as “a fun fact”, but I have been pleasantly surprised how actually civilised discussion we got there.

And no, I don't care at all how many points I've got, I am still not sure I know what it means, or where to find my total score. If I post here, it is only because I want to participate.

**** About the points, when I visit reddit on a computer, with a wide enough browser window it displays the total net points (for account life I think) at the upper right.

I still don't know if they mean anything, other than people appreciate one's posts?

***** They don't really mean anything except I guess some inferences can be made. 0-100 people are either new/unactive or bots or trolls. 1000-5000 are the mostly normal people going about normal reddit lives. Extremely high point people are the ones that just kinda make generic clickbait posts on popular (and braindead) subreddits.
