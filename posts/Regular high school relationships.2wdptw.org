It seems that in a lot of fanfiction, Harry's first relationship is just a smashing success and he only ever dates one person his whole life. Any fics out there where he dates around like a normal teenager? Or, if there is one pairing, the relationship has it's ups and downs?


** Yes, check out the Triangle Prophecy trilogy. The first is called Harry potter an the Psychic Serpent. I can't remember the author and it may or may not be on fanfiction.net but it's got harry dating around a bit, hook ups without love, unreturned feelings, relationship fights. Oh yeah, and some good action and plot. This is one fic that's stuck out to me, out of the gagillion I've read.

**** Yes! Thanks for finding that. I hope OP follows through and reads it. Heck, I kind of want to re-read it now.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] does this pretty well.

*** Can I just say thank you this. God damn it has been a long time since a fic made me literally laugh out loud or smile so much. Although I feel like this doesn't necessarily meet what the op was asking for (mainly because some things just haven't come to fruition yet due to it not being completed) it is hands down one of my favorite pieces of fan fiction to date. The author captures the feel of being a teenager very well and also develops a rather interesting plot that isn't all about relationships.

** This is a great point and one that is really understated. High School relationships often are over and done with in less than a month. Ron/Lavender esque.

** Resonance by green gecko kind of has that, but mostly right after Hogwarts. It's got two sequels, one of which is complete, the 3rd story may be abandoned (I'm not at the point of looking at their love journal to see if there's an ending yet). But they're on fanfiction.net and the romance isn't really vital to the plot or even a major thing I don't think.
