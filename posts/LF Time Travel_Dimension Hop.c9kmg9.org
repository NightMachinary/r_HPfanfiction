Hello all,

​

I have recently read a few HP/ASOFIA crossovers and I was wondering if there are any other stories out there sending Harry or whoever to the past or another world entirely. I am specifically looking for a medieval or earlier world where magic isn't advanced. I enjoy the world/civilization building that almost certainly spring up around a wizard. I would ideally like a low fantasy world but I am open to almost anything.

​

Thanks!

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon was to ascend the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

** Not medieval but I just recently discovered the Lost Traveler series. It's a fanfic series but it's not Harry Potter and the Lone traveler. Just the lone traveler. But he goes to many different dimensions and time lines, at some point becoming very over powered. I think the world building is pretty great and detailed.

** You didn't say if you minded slash, so if you don't mind slash, check out The Pendulum of Choice series by Rushlight. In it, Harry uses a device to travel to different dimensions looking for something, he's just not sure what. - There are currently 22 chapters plus epilogue. I say currently as it was originally 20 chapters, but he has since added a couple of more and has indicated there may be another chapter added (though it's been over a year since).

*General Caveat:* Here you will find pairings for Harry/just about everyone you can think of (along with other varied m/m pairings). There is noncon and death and angst and other assorted nastiness. On the flip side, there is also love and humor and hope and trust. Ratings range between episodes from G to NC-17.
