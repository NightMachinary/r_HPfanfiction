Seriously Snape bullied him for years when he was an adult and Harry was a literal child, like. His sad story or whatever doesn't mean you can bully children. He was genuinely not a good person lmao.

What middle name would you have preferred?


** Rubeus? After the one guy who truly was unerringly loyal to Harry.

** Personally I would rename all of Harry kids, firstly dead people only get middle names, it's not fair to saddle them with the expectations of being Harry's kid /and/ sharing a name with a war hero, and secondly ditch Albus and Severus, I don't think Dumbledore ever had a personal enough relationship with Harry to justify using his name, and Snape definitely deserves no personal recognition.

My suggested names for his kids would be something like "Richard James", "Stephen Arthur" and "Alfred Sirius". First names are all British/English monarchs which appears to be one of the Weasley naming traditions, and James, Sirius and Arthur are all various father figures to Harry. I'd rename "Lily Luna" to "Jasmine Lily", honour Harry's mother and keep the plant naming convention going.

*** I feel it also disrespects the memories of the dead. Surely it makes it harder to remember someone if you now use their name day-to-day for someone else. Now if anyone is talking about James or Lily Potter, they would have to go out of their way to remind their audience that they are talking about the old James and Lily, who died decades ago and not the pair who are alive and kicking.

** Vernon Tom. And for the 2nd Daughter, Bellatrix Petunia. Harry's naming skills weren't the best, he just named his kids after who had the biggest influence on him.

** I literally hate HATE what Harry called his children. Well, mostly.

I don't think James should have been his first name. It should have been his middle name, or sirius James could both be middle names. I think it's kind of weird having a daughter and son named after his parents, especially if they supposedly look like them?!? Maybe just a nice normal name like Gideon James Potter (a bible name, relatively normal in muggle standings but also named after Ginnys uncle and the man who's watch Harry has, unless thats fabian?!)

I despiseeeeee albus severus. I literally want to launch Canon severus into a ooze of lava. (I hate him in most fanfic too unless it's really well written mentor!Snape). It should have been something like Alfred Charlus Potter or Daniel Sirius Potter or Ethan Rubeus Potter.

I like lily's name. I think naming his only daughter after his mother is fitting. Lily Potter gave up her life and love to save her child, and it's her protection that saved him all those years. I love botanical names, and my fanon is that Lily's mother's family had a tradition of daughters named after flowers. I also think luna is sweet, as luna is both Harry and ginny friend, but she was also the only one who didn't make Harry feel self conscious and was the only one to truly instill calm within him during fifth year.

As you can see, I have strong opinions on the names of the potter children.

** It would have been way better for them to name their kids their own unique names instead of giving all those children portmanteau names from a bunch of war heroes that died only a couple of years before they were born, and maybe reserved the middle name for honor naming.

Like Samuel James.

It would have been super cute if they'd named a girl Calla Lily. Calla is Greek for beautiful, it's a species of lily, and Calla Lily Potter could have grown up to become an herbology professor or something going by their universe name rules lol. Calla lilies also symbolize resurrection in flower language so it would have had some nice callbacks to Harry in addition to honoring his mom.

** Alastor Regulus Potter works pretty well, two hardworking intelligent ambitious and incredibly brave men who died for what was right(hopefully allowing for less pressure to be in insert house here). It also allows formerly Albus to keep the nickname Al while honoring those that would otherwise have faded into the background. I'm also partial to the idea of Severus as a middle name to spite the Snape because if anyone he'd probably want either no one named after him or a Malfoy if we go the is Draco's godfather route(I'm currently blanking on if that's canon or fanon).

** In fairness, Harry used Severus' first name, the one he would have been known by in his childhood, the one Lily would have used, rather than his last name, the one he went by as an abusive professor and a self-loathing double agent.

** Honestly, Severus deserves to have a Potter named after him. Simply because he would definitely loathe it, lol.

Now, being serious, I dislike most of Harry's kids names. Personally, I prefer when kids get their own names in general, rather than being named after another person. I'd leave honorifics for middle names, if they really /have/ to name their kid after someone else.

...Though if I had to choose among names of other characters, I like the sound of Albus Rubeus better than Albus Severus. But honestly, I'd have called him something like Alex or Alexander, and maybe a middle name after someone.

Lily Luna is my exception to this, it just has a really nice ring to it, at least to me.

** Sirius James Potter. Having two kids named after a husband and wife is icky.

Lily Dora Potter. Luna didn't die. Nymphadora hated her name, so Dora is a reasonable alternative.

Albus Dobby Potter. Dobby honestly deserves top billing here but alas it's too silly sounding. Cedric and Alastor are also great ideas.

For fanfic: I always felt like Harry was needlessly confrontational with Scrimgeour. I always prefer if he comes up to work as an ally. The guy did get tortured to death without giving up any info on Harry. I also like the sound of Rufus. This doesn't really work with the actual relationship they had in canon though.

** Literally any of these: linkffn(12542863)

Including the crackier names. /Especially/ the crackier names.

... On a more serious note, it kind of bugs me that Ginny seems to have had zero input/recognition in the naming of their children - all of them were named after people who were important to Harry, but not necessarily to Ginny.

Of the canon names, the only one I kind of like is Lily Luna. Maybe Arthur James and Sirius Frederick for the sons? That way both names are important to both parents.
