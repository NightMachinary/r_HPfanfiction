Hey, guys, I just thought I'd post this into [[/r/HPfanfiction]] in case anybody else is doing NaNoWriMo, either with HP fanfic or of their own original stuff!

In the HPF Discord (separate to the [[/r/hpfanfiction]] Discord), we've got a writers-room chat and we've just set up a leaderboard to do NaNo together. If you're planning on doing NaNo and you're interested in having someone to chat through about any writing business, or if you're the competitive sort and would benefit from seeing other people's word counts as we go, feel free to join!

The plan is to organise some "sprints" every week! That's a writing game where a time limit is set and we write as much as we can within that time, usually between 10 and 20 minutes. Then we all feedback afterwards. It's great if you work well under pressure and want that little bit of extra motivation to get stuff done in a short gap of time, you know?

It's also a general HP fanfiction chat with different subchats for various ships, so feel free to join even if you're not a writer yourself! I just thought given the season NaNo stuff would be of particular interest.
