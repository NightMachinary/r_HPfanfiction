So, I've read a few of this kind before. Specifically, I'm talking about fics where harry ends up on some island. Things like Island of Fire, where he's there with loads of people, or like that one crackfic where he makes his own island.


** Now I really want a Castaway parody with Harry playing the part of Tom Hanks. And I'm totally not sure who I'd want to be Wilson. :D

*** Dobby, of course. There would have to be some kind of anti-apparition, anti-portkey, anti-elfsnap ward over the whole island to prevent easy extraction though

**** I mean, if Dobby is Wilson, then Dobby is imaginary, no? Though I think that'd be funnier, having Harry hallucinate imaginary!Dobby coming up with reasons he couldn't just take him off the Island.

"Why can't you just side along me, Dobby?"

"The stars aren't right, Mr Potter!"

"You sound like Ollivander."

"Oh, uh... The starzies not rights, Master Potter?"

"Riiight."

** I vaguely recall reading a Harry/Fleur story that begins with Harry taking off from Grimmauld Place with Kreacher's help and his hiding out on a tropical island alone, until Fleur joins as a tutor. Sorry I couldn't recall the title, though. It was on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], but there are so many stories there, I couldn't find it.

** I'm guessing the "crack" fic is On An Island in the Sun by Rorschach's Blot

linkffn(9279255)

You have these two stories from nonjon that has Harry getting ownership to atlantis/avalon where he creates a Sanctuary

Harry Potter and the Freedom of Apathy

linkffn(2329599)

Harry Potter and the Apathy of Freedom

linkffn(2432499)

And you have this story where several groups of girls (starting with Astoria and Daphne) help Harry and build a sanctuary on an island he owns. A Slytherin way of being by catchingafallingstar

*** Yup, that's the one. :D

Love Rorschach's Blot. Top tier crack.

I think I've read the Apathy ones, but that last one looks interesting. I'll give it a go.
