I was wondering if anyone had played with the idea of combining these two couples. Charlus Fleamont Potter and Dorea Euphemia Black?


** Good idea, but I'd say switch the first and middle names. Fleamont supposedly got into fights at Hogwarts over his name. It seems odd that he would go by a weird middle name instead of just using his relatively normal first name.

** Personally I don't think we see enough families with multiple branches in canon so welcomed the fact that the Potters had more than one branch. But each to their own...

** What's the point? Either you acknowledge Rowling's words as extended canon or you disregard them.

And what you are suggesting sounds like you prefer the fanon concept but use the second names as "insurance" against people who might otherwise call you out on not sticking to canon.

I mean, you can do it, but I fail to see the benefits other than maybe avoiding an angry review.

*** I actually prefer the Canon Names, sort of. I had this idea because I like the character concept of Fleamont more than Charlus and I like Dorea more than Euphemia. So I wanted to go with the idea that it's Fleamont and Dorea. But then I thought it would tie things together more if I just combined the characters.

** Linkffn(10709411)

This is the only one I have ever seen that has that concept in it, yet it only shows up later.

** I've come around to the idea of Fleamont and Euphemia. I usually write Charlus as Fleamont's cousin.

But I don't see any benefit in combining them, to be honest. If you want the "baggage" Dorea brings, just write her as Dorea. If you want a "clean" Potter family, write alongside canon.
