Knowing how obsessed Ginny was with Harry as a kid combined with the darkness she saw in the chamber of secrets. I think a Dark Ginny pining after Harry would be great. I would prefer it if Harry wasn't dark to see the contrast.


** Ginny never survived. The Diary has merged with the original Ginny. She (he?) has the memories and powers of both, and this secret might be the reason why canon Ginny suddenly becomes so awesome. Of course, it takes some time for her to recover and redevelop her his?) skills.

Later, her (his?) skills are very much responsible for their lucky escape from the DoM; her airtight magical contract is the key to DA's safety during Year 7; and her killing of large number of Death Eaters during the Final Battle prevents a collapse of the defenders. During her duel with Bellatrix, she holds back a little too much and is almost hit by a killing curse. But alas, Molly takes over and finishes the job just fine.

After the war, she continues to use (guide) the Trio to advance her cause, while playing the role of a popular athlete herself. From time to time though, she needs to kill and torture some pesky enemies just for stress relief. Twenty years later, the Trio does indeed make it to the top, and she can happily rule behind the scene. Both Tom and Ginny should be proud of her achievements.

  "He is so beautiful, Tom.. I wish you could remember" Or, the one where Voldemort is quite shocked and very, very pleased once he finds out what his old diary managed to do to poor, innocent Ginny Weasley.

** Actually, I have a theory Ginny had given him the love potion in the canon, but a small dose only to catch his interest so he would finally look at her not as the Ron's sister, but as a potentional girlfriend. Once the potion wore off he did the rest voluntarily. I came to this conclusion because it had always seem to me Harry's infatuation appeared out of nowhere. And the potion played quite a role in Half-Blood Prince, so I took it as a subtle storyline behind. No need to agree. Like I said, it's just a theory. :)

*** Oooohh dammm I love that honestly! I think we need more dark Ginny in the fandom there is so much potential! Jk really could have done something great with them knowing that they could bond over the trauma Tom Riddle/Lv brought. Her stalkerish behavior there is so much to write! I love your theory great job never thought about it that way
