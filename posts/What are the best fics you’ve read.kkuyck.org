Just looking for good fics to read.


** My all-time favourite is the Black Queen series by Silently Watches on FFN. Fem!Harry, non-BWL Harry. The series is dark and pretty fucked up (think Downward Spiral type of fucked up, but it also makes you hate pedophiles with a burning passion), but has some of the best worldbuilding out there, with unique magic systems and a heavy focus on rituals.

Some other fics I've reread several times: Delenda Est and Earl of the North by Lord Silvere on FFN, the Denarian Renegade series, Benefits of old laws on FFN, A Black Comedy by nonjon on FFN.

Honourable mention to the author TheBlacksResurgence on FFN. All his fics have the same plot, but reading one of them is something I'd definitely reccommend.

** linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

It is the most plot heavy, intricate, sly, cunning, genius story. It's so well woven and we'll written.

It has everything. You name it. Secret societies. Family trees. Magical lore. War mages. Titles and lands. The history of languages. How modern muggle history influenced the wizarding world. The Peverells. The Founders. Time Travel. Politics. The bloody queen!!!

It's something else. I cannot possibly do it justice because so much happens but oh my got it's incredible.

** Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay - linkffn(13230340)

​

This is an ongoing fic where Harry turned into a dragon. It's lighthearted and very enjoyable.

***

Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]])

​

Though the sequel of this fic isn't complete, I found the ending of this fic solid enough that I basically consider it a completed fic.

​

I'd describe the basic premise is that Harry thinks potions are really interesting (even though he's bad at them) so he studies them harder.

***

The Quiet Ones - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1057502]])

​

Part two of this series isn't complete and hasn't updated since late 2019, so if you don't want to get into a fic that might never update, I might avoid this one, but I really liked it.

​

Due to a spell on Harry, he was teleported from the Dursleys to Sirius Black... in Azkaban. Due to pretty much just ministry incompetence, no one notices this fact until he's Hogwarts-age. He comes out surprisingly sane, but pretty much nothing like canon Harry.

***

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027]]) (also on FFN [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/][here]])

​

Okay so my description of this one is going to be longer because I have Feelings about this fic.

​

It's a subversion of the Wrong Boy Who Lived (WBWL) trope. The prologue is written to be misleading, looking as if the fic fell into those tropes. This turned me off the fic at first, but then once I read the first chapter of the story itself I was instantly hooked.

​

As a warning, this fic is a lot darker than canon, and has more things that could be triggering to people (worse child abuse, a character attempts suicide, torture via magic, etc). Also, several characters (like James Potter) start off really shitty before genuinely improving.

​

But, despite that, (as can be inferred by me mentioning this fic), I really adore this fic. It's one of my favorite fics of all time in any fandom. Hell, I'd probably put it pretty high in my list of "favorite works of fiction I've ever seen", though it wouldn't take the top spot.

** My personal favorites are

linkffn(12798308)

Which has Harry becoming extremely powerful, and has a strong as hell love interest.

There is also linkffn(11815818)

It's a HPxSAO over

  The magical world isn't as ignorant of muggles as it seems, and Lucius Malfoy has an idea on how to get Harry out of his way. Now Harry is in Japan and trapped in a virtual world of swords. Cut off from his friends and allies, and what he knew, he has to make new ones and get used to an illusory world that has become all too real. Welcome, to SAO Harry. Do try to survive.
