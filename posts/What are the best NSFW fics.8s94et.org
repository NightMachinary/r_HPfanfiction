  Harry Potter's world is flipped upside down when he is unexpectedly visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare species of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of Harry's problems when he discovers just how drastically his life is about to change. How will our young hero deal with an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive?! Join Harry on an epic tale of love, lust, and innocence, as he battles against much more than just dark wizards and learns just how strong bonds can be.

*** My favorite part of Searching for the Power is when some people call him out for his lack of understanding regarding real sexual relationships (This is smut though, what can you expect) and he goes complete [[/r/ihavesex]] in the author notes talking about how he has slept with over 100 women and he is still best friends with all of them and had many of them for regular girlfriends but unfortunately he lost all the pictures from his swinging days with his ex-wife and doesn't live near those 100 women anymore.

It's pretty tropey and dated, but I enjoy the occlumency and some of the character interactions,

  Fast-forward, ten years later. Mistress Hermione is so proud of her little Harry! She knew this was exactly how things were supposed to happen right from the start. She's sometimes slightly dysfunctional, just a little possessive, but still adorable... although disagreeing with Mistress Hermione is not recommended. She has a little problem, though. ‚ÄúHappily forever after‚Äù is more complicated in real life than in books...

** I have a feeling most HP nsfw fics feature technically underage characters, so I hope you're okay with that, OP.

Edit: might as well link one of mine. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11843274]]). It's Angelina/Alicia/Katie/Harry/Ron/Hermione. Not my best, but it's decent.

I thought it was fun. I used to play with it after a shit and pretend it was a gear stick, for 10 minutes at a time. I never told anyone. And the first time I jacked off, I just did it like it was actually a gear stick until I finally Googled how to do the deed. At one point I was rubbing the opening of my urethra and boy oh boy did that sting like a bitch.
