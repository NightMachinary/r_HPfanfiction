#+TITLE: Seeking some reading recommendations from fellow SS/HG lovers. Have read nearly all of Harmony Bites, HGSS Review as well as a list of epics I found. Prefer at least 100K stories with at least a bit of smut (though not PWP.) Have I really read everything good or am I missing something?

**** The only one I've read is linkffn(A Maid in the Devil's Manor) and it was pretty good.

** I always recommend Beyond 84 Charing Cross Road - it's my absolute favourite Snamione fic

The author (s) is darnedchild

Great plot, not too cringe worthy

** I read through painless-j's list of ss/hg fic back in the days of livejournal (lol). PJ's site is down, but I found the het recs on the wayback machine (not all are ss/hg):

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528232209/http://painless-j.net:80/blog/2007/09/02/hp-recs-het/]]

A fair warning- most of painless-j's recs were pretty dark, but there's a mix of stuff in there and some of it's pretty good. All of the recommendations are at least 10 years old and some have been taken down. Also, you'll have to edit the urls to make them work.

*** This is perfect. I haven't read all of these and I love that there are good summaries. I have read so many the titles are starting to blend. Appreciate it!

**** Sure thing! Honestly it was much easier to find good ss/hg when there were active fanfiction communities on livejournal and people hosted their own ship-specific sites. It's a completely different scene now.

Anyways I also recommend Anna's Roman Holiday series if you haven't read it. It's not totally ss/hg specific, but features the ship later. Regardless, I'd consider it a classic of the ship: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20050204110801/http://www.witchfics.org/anna/index.html]] (unfortunately the last book in the series can't be found complete anywhere online)

  What begins as Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione leads to a life he never thought he deserved to live. The past and the present mesh together in a story of protection, betrayal and trust, and how the Battle of Hogwarts might have been fought. Rated MA for tender sensibilities.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
