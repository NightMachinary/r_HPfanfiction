** That's actually pretty hilarious I can already hear the

"Harry...didn't your mother ever teach you manners? She's so glad to see you"

Then create an illusion of an alive Lily standing there arms outstretched saying

"My son, oh how I've missed you..."

Damn I should really never be given powers of any kind I think I'd really fuck somebody up

** Somehow I read this as "Says "Time for a family reunion" before bringing them out to fuck +with+ Harry". Well, that would be even higher level of fucked up. Also, why is my mind constantly in the gutter?

*** Despite the fic relegating that incident to a mere retelling, i.e., not a major part of the story, I quite enjoyed the fic. I was a bit wary of the "Hadrian" in like second chapter, but the author was aware of the negative connotations of that name and fit it appropriately, if not a bit satirical LOL. Also, Harry & Iris Potter's sibling relationship was quite nice :D.

** "In Somno Veritas" doesn't have large scale horrors happening, but it has some very disturbing, smaller ones. You know how Nagini wore Bathilda Bagshot's skin in DH? We see Voldemort experimenting while creating the spell to do that with Hermione's parents; it does not end well for them. Also, it's HP/LV, so that in itself is disturbing. Yet it manages to make the relationship believable and non-rapey without making it some amazing, sexy, light magic romance. Their relationship is kind of like a car crash: horrifying, but you can't look away.
