  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
