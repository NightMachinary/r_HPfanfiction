What stands out the most is that there is a very disgusting bit where it turns out, Chris Argent's father had a child with another hunter woman, and then that child turned out to be the girl he convinced his son, Chris, to marry. Meaning he deliberately had his son marry his own half sister. Also, I believe he might have killed his daughter's other half brother for insurance money?? It was a pretty fucked up family ordeal, if you can even call it a family.
