Looking for F.F that are alike to Rocking the Boat by DeLaCroix. With Harry and Hermione together. Loved the ideas in Rocking the Boat (Harry being outrageously powerful, wandless magic, new wand makers, different geographic locations, Harry taking over the Black estate, the laws regarding old families and the type of relationship Harry and Hermione have (slight Dom and Sub kinda thing)). I'm open to something that has a bigger thread of romance/ erotica as I do enjoy those kinds of things. But the main focus/ points would be: wand/magic law, the black estate, adventure. Basically everything mentioned above.

Apologies that this is a rather long winded post, but I don't want to miss out on possible gems of literary.

T.I.A ðŸ™‚
