Hermione dies in the final battle, and Harry wants to personally tell Mr. and Ms. Granger about it. Then he realises he never actually learned anything about Hermione's parents at all; except that they were dentists. And Hermione had sent them to Australia after removing their memory of her... right? As Harry looks into it it he learns of a dark secret behind all of it...


** The dark secret is that Mr and Mrs.Granger would murder their patients with dental tools then dump them down a chute leading to their neighbours' pie shop where they would be baked into meat pies.

Hermione Oblivated them after finding out so they wouldn't do such socially unacceptable things

** Harry found the answer after four years of searching. By accidentally knocking over a scrying orb in a magical supplies store. Which showed a newspaper. The same one that was on the coffee table at Hermione's house.

Her parents were on that bridge while the death eaters destroyed it. She was still in denial and came up with the "memory charmed, and sent them to Australia" story.

It was bittersweet . The Nutrageous candy bar that is. It was in the freezer for a little over five years.

​

Sorry, had to do it. Nutrageous candybars were super popular after they were invented in '94.

** "Mister and Missus Granger, I'm sorry for your loss," Harry said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.

"Mmph, mmph, mmph mmph," Hermione's father responded.

It was certainly difficult for the man to speak, seeing as he had a ball gag stuffed in his mouth. Of course, the bright red really popped against the black PVC that covered the rest of his face.

"Bad puppy," Hermione's mother said, striking her husband with a riding crop. Adjusting the leather harness wrapped around her slender torso, the only thing she was wearing, she added, "I'm sorry, we don't know what you're talking about."

This was getting weird and awkward. Maybe he should not have arranged for a meeting in a public park during broad daylight, Harry thought to himself, as another mother covered her son's eyes and quickly ushered him away from the trio on the park benches, shooting them extremely dirty looks that Hermione's parents seemed completely oblivious to.

"It's just that, well, your daughter... is no longer with us...," said the Boy-Who-Lived.

"Our daughter?" asked the woman, looking confused for a moment, before her eyes suddenly lit up. "Oh! You're into /that/ kind of roleplay."

"Um, excuse me, but I've got to go," Harry said, suddenly very uncomfortable, before pointing in another direction. "Over there."

"Well, if you ever change your mind, puppy and I are looking for a new man of the house!" the woman called after the retreating teenager.

How's that for a different kind of "dark" secret?
