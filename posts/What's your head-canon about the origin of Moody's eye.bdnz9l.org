Are awesome prosthetic eyeballs just easily available to all wizards? It was getting stuck after Crouch wore it and he didn't get a replacement, so I would assume that this isn't the case.

Did he make it himself? The previous point makes this seem unlikely, but I suppose it could be very difficult to make, or it could take a long time, or something.

Maybe it's some ancient artifact that he hunted down after losing his eye?

 

If you've got a head-canon for how he got the eye, what is it?


** Albus gave it to him as part of one scheme or another, and he used the Elder Wand to make it. That's why Moody and Dumbles are the only people that can see through the Cloak.

** Gellert made it to find the Hallows, Dumbledore took it when he defeated Grindelwald, and gave it to Moody when he lost his eye.

** Generally speaking, the approach I take is that the vast majority of cool magical items like Moody's eye, Newt's suitcase etc. are one-offs made by the person who uses them. You can't just go into a shop and buy one.

Moreover, I generally imagine that these items have to be earned somehow. The creators don't just sit in a workshop and make them out of readily available materials using spells you can find in books. Their creation involves adventure of some kind, either to gain a key magical ingredient/material, or to engineer the circumstances necessary for the magic to work.

** The eye was from his friend who is an enchanter like kakashi type of tragedy. .. some dark bastard attacked the guy, moody fought of but it was too late the curse on the enchanter was progressing. So the enchanter gave his greatest creation his eye.

The eye was meant to see through enchantment so he can overlap, collapse and stuff his creation. His creations are so amazing that he was targeted. It would also make all the heavily protected items moody has makes sense, like.... I can't fight with you so I'm giving you all items to protect yourself kind of thing. Everything was keepsake for that person. Everyone keeps on saying he was paranoid due to enchanters gift... But once, for once, moody let his guard down... It cost him the life of his dear friend, the enchanter.

** He lost his eye during the Grindlewald war, for several years he went with just one eye until Albus needing Moody at max power after he acquired some new scars dealing with Knights of Walpurgus/Death Eaters created his eye to give him the depth perception back but threw on a number of additional powers to it to allow him to counter espionage and assassins from the other side. After the war Moody just kept it

** When Alastor Moody scored 10 O's and 2 T's on his N.E.W.T.s, his parents rewarded him by trapping him in their home duelling arena with 10 indeterminate Veela, Succubae, and Mimics as well as 1 Gorgon and 1 Beholder.

Alastor killed the two attacking monsters at cost of his left foot from mid-calf and his right eye turning to stone.

In a ludicrous display of bravado inspired by the beautiful womenfolks, Alastor performed a switching spell wherein all of the Beholder's eyes, all of the eyes from the Gorgon's snake hair, and both of the Gorgon's own face eyes were all swapped at once into his own casualty of an eye socket.

The delusional confidence Alastor used on his deranged attempt at healing resulted in an eye that can see anything, through anything, and is only somewhat under his control.

Years later after nearly a decade behind the curtain, he aced the entrance exams for the Auror department of the Ministry of Magic and then did some magical stuff catching bad guys for years.
