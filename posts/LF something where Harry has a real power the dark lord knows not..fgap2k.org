Yes I know love could be a real power but I'm looking for something where it is a power he has that voldemort doesn't like control over water or something of the other.

Harry keeps telling Voldemort what power he gets. Fate/Destiny/The Prophecy keeps giving him new ones.

** I like "Elemental Harry" a lot, linkffn(5648259).

"Harry Potter: Air Elemental", linkffn(11995519), is ok, but not outstanding. I feel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]] gets a little too formulaic with his Year 6 indy!Harry stories.

This is a comment I found by [[/u/inquisitorCOC][u/inquisitorCOC]] 3 years ago. I read the second one myself and I really enjoyed it!

** You could probably say future knowledge/ability or something like that for most time-travel fics as well, though thats dubious.

The problem with a whole new power for that is that...well...Harry already has several 'Powers the Dark Lord knows not' in his arsenal. First, the obvious warnings he gets of Voldemort's presence from his scar (literally a warning bell for him on imminent danger). Then their is his frankly overpowering ability to see and feel what Voldemort does, while being protected from the reverse occurring (not to mention Voldemort inexplicably not making the obvious connection). And finally, there is the Parselmouth ability, which while ruined by the whole 'Ron-mimicking-Parseltongue-to-get-into-the-Chamber', still aids him in both his numerous adventures and further gives him insight into his enemy. So Harry already has several non-love powers, though they are thankfully double-edged swords on occasion

Depending on your tastes, these fics might count though:

- linkffn(Ectomancer): its heavily implied that Harry's connection to the astral world is the power, though never officially stated. A GREAT adventure fic, and that dragon man...
- linkffn(The Mind Arts): Harry has an unnatural predilection for mind powers. Fic is weakened by overpowering Harry a bit and the rather aimless nature of much of the story though, so YMMV.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): probably can be said to be the spell he learns from the Parkinson grimmoire, though again never stated.
- linkffn(The Denarian Renegade): arguably Miciel's coin and contract, the power of the Knight of the Cross, or the Words he learns later in Book 3.
- linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter): the groundhog day style of time-travel basically, although that cat is out of the bag by 4th year.

*** It's "Necromancy". You can remember it by "necro", which means "dead" or "death" in the greek rootform - also present in Necromorph, for instance. "Mancy" technically means "to gather information through", so Necromancy would be summoning the dead and talking to them, but in recent times it's changed into "magic involving". So Necromancy would be magic involving death, usually used to describe magic that can raise the dead, but not truly resurrect them.
