Seen it recommended a ton here so started reading it and got to about 3rd year and...wow...wow I hate it.

It's everything wrong with moviecanon Hermione ramped up to 1000, like she's given other characters big moments, is easily the most powerful person in the universe and is given these really dumb thoughts that are clearly there to imply she's a genius but we all know it's just the author inserting things in that they know form canon - like basically her guessing a bunch of future plot points/character motivations way earlier than they're revealed in canon.

There's next to no point in anyone else being there because you know Hermione will save the day even if it was Harry or Ron or Dumbledore in the original series.

The maths bit I liked and honestly most other characters are really well done but Hermione is just so unbelievably annoying I can't continue with it.

** Two things I liked: 1) The world building of the castle. The stairs that go up and up and get smaller and everything gets bigger....some of the ideas like that I really thought were interesting. 2) Fred and George as different people with different personalities. I really appreciated that.

I can stand a badass!hermione fic or a badass!harry fic but what mostly turns me away from those fics in the end is the unnecessary long-windedness and too many extraneous side plots. That's why I stopped reading this one.

** I have somehow managed to get through the first (which I enjoyed) the second (which had me wincing) and have almost finished the third (which I disagree vehemently in parts).

Someone already mentioned the heavy emphasis on Christianity/religion which did make me slightly uncomfortable although it did make for some good spells. The main appeal for me, as for other people on this thread was the world building and heavy magical theory which is absolutely fantastic.

That being said, what annoyed me THE MOST to the point where I almost wanted to leave a bad review (and I've never left a bad review) was Hermione's insistence on the superiority of the muggle world/technology. Apparently all of the wizarding world's problems come from the fact that they haven't ‘caught up with the muggles' or appreciated the wonderful solutions/intellectual advancements of the muggles. Every other sentence in this series is “well, in the muggle world...” and it drives me crazy!!

** I just thought that math and worldbuilding were neat.

It could legit have been a story set 10 years later with lots of different names and a radically different plot. I just liked the math in the magic and the way the worldbuilding was used.

Is the characterization kinda weird sometimes?.. Yeah. Is the stuff with her leaving Hogwarts, etc, also kinda weird and BS? Most certainly. Is the plotting kind of confusing in the way in which it artificially includes more weird math shit for no reason but to make Hermione more important(see: Book 4's new final challenge, and book 1's light encryption numbers thing, etc)? Yup. Could it have been executed better? Of course.

But it has math nerd stuff, an awesome mentor in Professor Vector, and neat worldbuilding. So I like it.

Also, like, it's neat to see burnout in a genius character, since lots of the Genius![character] fics pretend the person also has infinite time and infinite resources and infinite patience.

** It makes Hermione into a palatable, compelling protagonist for all the readers who read canon HP and disliked the way she was portrayed (bossy, naggy, overbearing, close-minded, and condescending) but thought she had a lot of potential if she had the same abilities but a different personality. It's the same thing that Cultural Anthropology or Starfox5 fanfics do, turning canon Hermione into Badass!Hermione.

Some people like it because as a female protagonist, Hermione can be active and have agency in her own right instead of waiting for Harry to do his Chosen One stuff. A female lead also avoids some of the more annoying relationship tropes and gratuitous objectification that happens in OP powerwank Harry-centric fics that follow a similar fix-it fic premise.

**** Here is the problem : Harry Potter makes not a single fucks worth of difference until after the graveyard scene.

​

Book one - Dumbledore's gonna move that stone into the Castle Regardless as to whether Harry Potter is there or not. Voldemort is gonna come for the stone and he's going to fail weather Harry's there or not. One could argue he's more likely to fail if Harry isn't there as he'll be stuck in front of that mirror.

​

Book two - The chamber of secrets being opened has absolutely nothing to do with Harry Potter and everything to do with Arthur Weasley and his muggle born protection act and Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy slips that diary into Ginny's bag in order to discredit Arthur I don't know if there's some sort of bizarre feud involved as rarely do you see people get into fist fight unless they mutually hate each other (or alcohol is involved). Regardless the chamber is opening whether Harry Potter exists or not.

​

Book three - Unless I'm missing something from books 1, 2, or 3 Harry Potter had absolutely nothing to do with Arthur Weasley winning at the daily prophet's Galleon lottery. The resulting escape of Sirius black in his attempt to murder the ever living f*** out of Peter Pettigrew Has very little to do with Harry Potter. Harry didn't take the picture Harry wasn't in the picture he wasn't involved in any way with the Weasleys and Pettigrews trip to Egypt.

​

Book four - This is the turning point where Harry potter's actions begin to influence the story And Peter Pettigrew having been exposed Goes to find Voldemort and bring him back triggering the plot to get Harry into the graveyard and resurrect Voldemort. This is really the single point In my mind will you can start to diverge from Canon successfully. Up till this point You have to radically Go for the alternate universe where characters are either missing Or alternatively completely different From how they portrayed in Canon As everything up to this point Are entirely events created by adult characters in this world.

​

So I give a lot of slack to stories That end up rehashing the first 3 blocks Making their minor changes Writing out the characters as different than Canon etc .

​

My issue with Arithmancer Is the same issue that I've had with the vast majority of fan fictions That describe the wizarding world As completely cut off From the mundane world. Simple fact is you can't Bring in People from the mundane world who at 11 have experienced a bit of it and certainly absorb the ideas things that are normal in common And expect them to Embrace the magical world just such a degree that they for get completely about the mundane world and all the advancements it has made. The idea That Wizards of an academic intent Professeurs People for whom knowledge is a goal in and of itself Would not be aware Of nuclear physics It's applications in producing power in weaponry The advancement's made By utilizing The hadron collider And really Any respectable yellow paper They could be applicable to their fields of entrance That was published within the past 20 years, Stretches the bounds of disbelief. I am well over the Hill In terms of age And I am not In an academic field However my chosen areas of interest Are as fascinating to me today As they were when I became interested then them as a teenager And I continue to devour All the applicable knowledge the advancement's made And yes even yellow papers.

***** I don't think it works like this. I mean, yes Book 1 and 2 will have the central plot point than canon (some can say that Dumbledore did the stone plot Because Harry would be there, for a minipulative Dumbledore for example, but The muggle Protection Act and Malfoy response are not directly linked to Harry).\\
But After Year 2 I think you can totally separate the story from canon.

-For exemple, the aftermatch of year 2 can be vastly different depending of Harry previous actions. Weasley should win the lottery, but a grieving Weasley family after Ginny death or one that has to deal with the accusions against Ginny because Harry "caught" her or even one who fight Malfoy who has been caught, would not go to Egypt, so Sirius would not see Peter and escape.

-And without Sirius escape, you don't have Peter in Albania to help Voldemort, capturing a witch in the process and creating the whole Tournament plot.

But more seriously, when people complain about non original plot, I think it's less about the central plot, and more about the little events. I remember reading several time a Slytherin Harry asked for a duel in the trophy room the same way it was in Canon. Why would he go when Malfoy sleep in the same room as him? And when you have a Malfoy friend, you just replace him with a Stupid! Ron.\\
It's interesting to see how a different caracter would deal with the same situation than canon, but I hate when a different caracter does exactly the same thing as Canon even when it should be totally OOC for him.

***** I think there's a subtle distinction to make - it's not that Harry's actions before the graveyard scene don't /impact/ or influence the story (or the wider world) - they do. Stopping the basilisk is a Big Deal, and would have been far harder without a parselmouth stumbling across the entrance there, just as an example.

After book 4 is when Harry's actions begin to more consciously drive change in the wider world, instead of being more reactive to and self contained within Hogwarts.

For the separation between magical world and the mundane world, those are just following canon unfortunately. So while it would make sense for muggleborn to stay connected & interested in the muggle world... that's not the default setting.

**** I put it down to Hermione's successes having more significance (and feeling more meaningful to the reader) if she's shown tackling the challenges she faced in canon and resolving them with even more competence. It underlines the divergence of her character from her canon self, while still providing a baseline of how far she's come. Yes, Hermione /could/ deal with a bunch of OC D.A.D.A. teachers, but it's not as satisfying as watching her put Umbridge in her place.

Going between canon stations and leaving the rails completely is a toss-up for stories, frankly. Some readers hate the stations, but another group of readers would lose interest if the protagonist left Hogwarts to go to Ilvermorny with a cast full of OC's.

****** I agree with that, but the later events in the books are highly dependent on earlier events snowballing. Voldemort would never have been a threat in Year 7 if Sirius had never seen Fudge's Daily Prophet and broken out. Pettigrew would never have run off to Albania if he hadn't known Sirius was on his tail. Voldemort would never have gotten enough strength to wake Barty Jr. out of stasis mode if he hadn't been helped by Pettigrew. To make Voldemort a villain for the school-aged protagonist requires some elements of canon.

If Voldemort found some way to return on his own time, it would very likely be 30+ years later. And then the MC's school years would be very boring and uneventful.

Looking at it from a writing perspective, recycling the stations is a way to inject external conflict into a story. Conflict and overcoming challenge is the essence of storytelling, and a SuperHermione character is not exactly the type of person to have a crisis of faith or moral struggle that fuels a powerful internal conflict. In the books, her character has always been about the "My Way is the Right Way" approach.

******* But as an Author you have the power to stop the snowball and make a different avalanche instead. Sirius doesn't have to break from Azkaban and Harry can still be involved in Triwizard Tournament, maybe as a new plot from Lucius Malfoy. Voldemort can still be resurrected in 4th year by a different follower, maybe Bellatrix breaks out of Azkaban while the Ministry is focused on Sirius?

Hell, Voldemort can be resurrected after the end of Hogwarts and that still make the story intersting. How does Auror!Harry or DMLE!Hermione tries to convince The Ministry the truth? When will Dumbledore shared Horcruxes information to Harry? Does he wait until Voldemort return or taking them down while Voldemort is still not a threat?

I agree with you that Accidental Animagus is better on personal conflict than the war. Seeing Hermione breaks down because Trolls guard the Gryffindor tower and trying to find love with George is pretty interesting.

If the author wants to do it that way, there's no reason why the deck can't be stacked so that Quirrelmort, the Diary Horcrux, and the Philosopher's Stone are in the castle at the same time. But the whole appeal of following the stations of canon is that it offers the author a consistent set of challenges with an increasing difficulty level as the years go on. One mystery a year, one major issue or antagonist, and one satisfying resolution that the protagonist has to earn before they can "level up".

And the "slow level up" structure is the one that The Arithmancer follows, instead of the "tossed in the deep end from Day One" structure. Whether that's good or bad depends on your taste, and how much fanfic you've read in the past.

***** I don't think Hermione has to face the exact same challenge as canon to portray her as badass. Hermione already shows that she can handle the canon challenges, even if with great difficulty. Showing her facing a different challange and still came up on top shows that she's a bigger badass than canon.

There are a lot of Badass!Hermione that's better than the first five year of Arithmancer series. She led the Muggleborn Resistance in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/31/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], pretending to be a snotty Muggleborn in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]], being an Animagus before she turns 13 in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], and she remade the Wizarding World political culture in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]].

TBH I'm a bit disappointed that The Arithmancer is a basically canon rehash. I read TheArithmancer after I read Accidental Animagus first and I'm expecting a different plot with Badass!Hermione. There're a bunch of interesting plot in Accidental Animagus and the most interesting thing in The Arithmancer is how a MathWiz can be a brilliant spell creator.

** I have mixed feelings about The Arithmancer (and sequels).

When I read the first book I really enjoyed it but I find I can't read it again now. Hermione starts off as utterly wet and suddenly transforms into a world-beating witch capable of almost anything.

The second book was okay but spent way, way too long with the characters faffing about doing not a lot.

The third book wasn't really a story, more a set of points that White Squirrel wanted to make.

The series is certainly certainly original, with its clever use of maths but I felt the characterisation was poor. Others have made the point that Hermione does almost everything and most other characters are largely irrelevant. Other stuff is thrown in for no real purpose; the whole House Elf section of the castle, for instance.

I'm glad I read the series but in the future it'll be one I dip into to find certain scenes rather than re-reading in total.

**** Hermione has like 2 crises of faith (since she's Christian apparently??), spends a weird amount of time looking into wizards' approach to religion, and also exhibits a pattern of appealing to Christianity on occasion in a more-than-just-colloquial way.

It's not super noticeable if you have grown up in a religious household or surrounded by religion, but if you're from a more secular (or even just not Christian) background, it's too close to her just pulling out a rosary from nowhere sometimes. Specially since I don't remember anything at all that would imply she was ever anything other than maybe culturally, non-practicing default-Anglican.

Even though HP has super Christian ethics throughout it, religion is basically just aesthetic in the books (Christmas exists largely for the purpose of presents) and honestly I like that way more than when it is just... Assumed to be the building block of a worldview, the way some works clearly heavily influenced by the religion of the author can be.

** It's a wish fulfilment power fantasy where Hermione is the main character and has the skillset to save the day.

No different - except in many ways, imo, better reasoned and supported - than any of the many Powerful!Harry fantasies where Harry has all sorts of powers, is The Sole Hero rather than part of a team, or, if part of a team, is much more powerful or variedly powerful than anyone else who may as well be set dressing, and/or is the sole focus of the story.

I would even go as far as to say canon falls slightly into this in as much as Harry usually saves the day, often by chance, dumb luck, inherited power or McGuffins that happens to be the exact thing needed to save that particular situation.

Ultimately it's just the author's sandbox and probably is written with fans of Hermione the character in mind, and for that reason centers on her. Take it for what it is, a lighthearted what if. Could be that you just aren't the target audience if that's not something you enjoy to read about.

**** I didn't say it was the case definitively, just that it might be. Tbf your OP didn't really clarify that detail.

** I've just started it and so far I like it well enough. I've read so many Harry-centered fics that a well written Hermione fic is like a breathe of fresh air. Author has some pretty interesting ideas on how magic works. I like Hermione exploring Hogwarts trying to understand how it works.

​

It's ok if you don't like it. Life's short. Read what you want

** This is the story that convinced me that not all Harry Potter fanfic was bad. So if you're reading this, White Squirrel, and I know you are, know that this one had a huge impact on me and I really liked it.

You can't please everyone!

** Loved the exploration of magic, the castle being a non euclidien geometry was fascination, but got kinda bored after a while and let go.

It is a bit of a Super! Harry but with hermione instead tbh, but I did adore the maths bit.

** Female empowerment! Seriously, as far as I know most fanfiction writers are women (that's why there's so much slash out there, because most men don't write that as they don't think men are attractive and especially not gay men!) and women like female empowerment (it's what feminism does these days! Gone are they days most feminists just wanted equal rights! No, these are the days where they believe that doing a 180 of the world the first wave feminists grew up in, so discrimination against men instead of women (women's quotas for great and well payed, but not for shitty manual labor jobs - and that's just one example...another would be unequal healthcare spending! Especially the research...more breast-cancer research than prostate-cancer research, despite the fact that surviving breast-cancer is more likely!)....

​

Otherwise? I don't really know, I am not a Hermione fan (I don't hate her either), so I don't care for this fanfiction (have tried reading it, but it wasn't that interesting to me :( )

​

ps: Note: I am not against equal opportunities! I am against discrimination in all forms (be they against men, women, gays, religious folks etc.)! Hell, frankly: The most attractive women to me are TOMBOYS!

** I don't like the character Hermione in the story. I LOVE the world building in it though. Yes she is overpowered. But that isn't why I love the story. Its the world that is built around it, is whats special about it.
