So, I was re-reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived - by Jbern]] and thought, why aren't there more like this? And if their are, I've not seen them yet. I also thought of some interesting ideas to go along with that.

Obviously, why not Lily in Harry's body? Would be an interesting shift and the whole Snape dynamic would be weird. Then, what if its a duel possession kinda thing, Harry and one of his parents in the same body. Would be an interesting way for Harry to survive the last killing curse if his parent sacrifices them self again for him. Then I thought what if Lily was pregnant and when the killing curse killed Lily, it only disconnected the Baby's soul from its body and it instead latched onto Harry's body after he gets hit with it too, completing or out right invalidating the prophesy in the process.

So yeah, It'd like to see more of this and thought I'd throw that at you guts while fishing for any similar stories.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8092431/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spirits-Within]]. This is James and Lily in Harry. Dubious quality given all the Dumbledore bashing tropes but it fits your request.

** I've only read a little of 'The Lie I've Lived'. But did Lily really **/SPOILERS/** cheat on James with Remus? If so, I hope the narrative didn't try to somehow portray Lily like the victim, and James as the asshole. Also, what was Harry and Lupin's relationship like?

*** It's been awhile since I've read it, but I'm pretty sure it was handled fairly complexly and realistically to the point where everyone comes out looking kind of dickish.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)
