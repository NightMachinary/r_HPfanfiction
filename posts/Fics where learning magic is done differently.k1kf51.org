Like generally it in stories I've read where the mc is good at magic or smart they just read alot research alot and then they are just good at magic. And they logic through it.

Things like amount of practice required to get good at a subject isn't really considered. So just by understanding the theory you can excel. Even if practice is required it can be done in like a year. And you don't often see a huge amount of struggle with any subject.

Less logical subjects are also kind of hand waved. We know for example there are aspects of several types of magic that aren't logic based.

The unforgivables require conviction and the right emotion for example, so does the patronus and even to a degree flying ( calling a broom to your hand). But the more intuitive or emotional or even physical ( duelling for example i assume requires a unique set of skills) aspects of magic I feel are hand waved more. If you are good at one aspect it just becomes you are good at all aspects.

So fics where that practice is more important and the less logical and more intuitive and emotional and maybe physical parts of magic are considered more. Maybe different characters have skills in different aspects of magic. The person who excels in say transfiguration potions and runes may struggle in Defense charms and divination. Someone who good at figuring out how to use spells in the classroom may struggle to use them effectively in a duel.

Preferably not Hermione or Harry as mc just to be atypical for this type of fic. But I mean its already pretty specific a request and idk if that exists so if it only exists with those two that's fine too.


** Everything you said is something I try to incorporate into all my fics. IMO it's less about magic and more about having a well-rounded character. It's rare to have someone that's good at EVERYTHING. For example, one of my characters isn't the best duelist, but she is ace at runes/rituals, wards, and runes.

Anyway, your best bet would be to focus on fics with dark magic, specifically Harry learning dark magic. Those fics are the ones that take a fresh look at magic or change the system. It's probably the closest you'll get to what you're looking for. I can recommend a few if you want, but they probably don't focus on learning magic.
