  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

*** I've avoided this story for so long because I didn't care for the synopsis, or the fact it was Dimensional AU. I find it to be very well written, intensely enjoyable, and to feature perhaps my favorite ever portrayal of Luna Lovegood. It's relatively heavy on angst, but it's essential to the story in my opinion.

** *Harry Potter's most excellent adventure* - linkffn(11619134) Stargate/HP Crossover\\
Humor/Crack - After the final battle in the timeline\\
Harry ends up crossing paths with SG1, antics happen. Ends up "borrowing" a mirror that connects to alternate realities. Finds one where he died on that Halloween, but parents survive. Voldemort is still alive, but hidden.

Prior stargate knowledge is helpful, but the majority of things is explained as needed.

  Harry Potter simply wanted to take a break from being everyone's hero. Who'd have thought that being kidnapped by Jaffa out of some lousy Diner would do the trick? Poor SG1. They have no idea how far down the rabbit hole goes. Harry Potter/Stargate Crossover, eventual AU (COMPLETE, if you can believe it!)

*** Would you say its SG heavy or does it just use SG as a method from which to travel over?

**** Kinda SG heavy. 60/40? It's post battle, so Harry ends up with them, separates, and joins back once in a while. The alternate reality parts are hilarious though. He's trolly in this one.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.
