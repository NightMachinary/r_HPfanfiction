Kinda like Queenie. Hopefully with no evil or seriously psychotic Harry if possible.

Thanks!!


** Well I can't not mention either Mind Arts by Wu-gang, or The Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man. Both of which I think are really good, with Prince being among the best I've ever read on FF.

Sorry for not linking either on mobile and it's acting funny

Edit: fixed the title of one of the stories
