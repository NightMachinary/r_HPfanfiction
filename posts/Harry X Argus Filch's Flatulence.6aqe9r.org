It was a Valentine's Day that the population of Hogwarts dearly wished to forget (Memory Charms inexplicably proving ineffective).

Romilda Vane was up to her old tricks and had snuck a homebrewed 'Love At First Sight' love potion into Harry's pumpkin juice.

A homebrew potion that she had gotten mixed up with a 'The Sound of Your Voice' love potion, resulting in missing the kneazle fur trimming and including fwooper feathers instead.

Fred & George sent their regrets that they couldn't visit Hogwarts owing to their high volume of customers, but sent along samplings of their pranks to everyone they knew.

Including a box of surprisingly delicious Baked Bean Brownies to the old caretaker, Argus Filch. Take a moment to guess what Baked Bean Brownies do.

--------------

"Bleh," Harry grumbled as he wandered down the hallway just after breakfast, with Ron and Hermione by his sides, "Next time, I'm having the peppermint pasties /after/ I drink my pumpkin juice."

"Like eating a snack after cleaning your teeth, huh, mate?" Ron chuckled quietly.

"As a child of dentists, it is my professional opinion that you shouldn't have snacks for half an hour or so after you clean your teeth." Hermione added, in a manner suggesting she was making a public service announcement.

And then it happened. As the trio wandered past Argus Filch on their way back to Gryffindor Tower, the cantankerous old caretaker wobbled and let out a great, big, loud, wet, smelly, surprisingly musical, and did I mention, /loud/ fart.

Ron snickered; Hermione made a show of covering her nose and turning away.

Harry, however, stared, his eyes slowly drifting in different directions, his mouth forming into a wide grin.

"Oh, my love, play that /again/."

Argus Filch scowled, "Don't you make fun of-" he was interrupted as his buttocks let loose another big brass break-of-the-wind.

It was too much for Harry. He flung himself at the old caretaker, throwing his arms around Filch's waist, scooching around to nuzzle at his bottom and mumble deliriously about 'beautiful music' and 'always be together'.

"Get off me, you maniac!" Filch yelled and screamed and tried to kick Harry away, every movement of his legs punctuated by windy blasts.

"Non, non!" Harry declared loudly, taking on an odd french accent, "Can you not hear, monsieur! It is destiny that we be united!"

Ron and Hermione looked at each other. Hermione mentally assembled a list of 'potential causes for Harry acting this way' and transmitted them via eyebrow waggling to Ron. Ron silently considered the possibilities, selected 'Romilda Vane messed up a love potion' and returned his results with an eyebrow raise.

"I look for Madame Pomphrey, you find Slughorn?" Hermione asked out loud. Ron nodded, and the two took off.

"At last, we are alone," Harry crooned to Filch's bottom, "Now, my love, make more of that beautiful music for me, that glorious symphony of song and scent that defines you so well..."

"Hel*BRAAP!*elp, Potte*HOONK!*one b*TWEEET!*s!" Filch screamed as loud as he could, the repeated loud and stinky notes from his posterior drowning out his cries.

--------------

By not-exactly-random-chance, Romilda Vane was stalking after Harry, Ron, and Hermione after they left breakfast.

When Ron and Hermione dashed past, not even paying attention to her, the young girl dashed forward into the corridor, "Oh, Harry-"

She stopped. Harry was clinging to Argus Filch, his face firmly pressed against the caretaker's behind.

Romilda made to step away, but Filch spotted her, "Do something!" he yelled, "Get the pants off my loony! I mean *THRUUUP!*-"

"Yes, yes!" Harry's muffled voice cried, "Help me bring down this leathery veil that keeps us apart, quickly now!"

Romilda smiled weakly. Then she took a hesitant step forward, raised her hands, sniffed at the air (which was starting to turn a distinct shade of green)...

Then turned and fled, screaming louder than Filch, arms flailing in the air as she took the stairs 4 at a time, not stopping until she had found a room deep in the dungeons with a very thick door.

  I think there is a contest going on, Koreanhamster666 vs ksense2016, to request the weirdest pairings.

...And I thought I'd go for the weirdest, and throw a mini-fic into the deal.

** I don't know how I feel about what I read quite yet. But I do know it made me start laughing hysterically. Though thankfully not enough to have flatulence.
