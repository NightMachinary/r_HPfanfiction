I just finished reading Dead Things by EclipseWing and I was wondering if there are any fics similar to it.

When Harry dies he gets transported back in time just enough to make sure he doesn't die

** Harry is also frustrated and tired of his undying in linkffn(8149841)^{Again and Again}, though there every time he dies, he wakes up on his very first birthday. He's very old and tired of life. Somewhat similar is linkao3(1113651)^{Sisyphus}, but there he wakes up on his 11th birthday and the universe really doesn't like it when he tries to alter things.

There are fics where it's stated that he won't die unless he wishes so. In linkao3(The Darkening of Your Soul) it's even done - during Quidditch Harry's skull is cracked (even his brain could be seen) but he doesn't die and wakes up a week later completely fine.

I heard that in linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine) Death is personified and revives Harry if he dies.

Also, if you're interested in more Master of Death!Harry fics, check out my collection ;) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fapnkx/master_of_deathharry_excel_collection_help/]]

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
