First off, you all got me off to a great start with your recs, I've got a lot of good ones to choose from. However, I'm reading from my kindle, and while I've figured out the process to download from fanfiction.net, I can't figure out how to download stories that aren't there (Learning to Live Again, in this case) but are on harrypotterfanfiction.com. Any help?
