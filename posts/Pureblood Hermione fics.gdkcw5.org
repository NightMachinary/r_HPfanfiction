Looking for fics where Hermione discovers she's descended from a pureblood family. Bonus points if there's politics, or if Hermione ends up being a spy.


** Linkffn(New Blood)

Hermione is the purest pureblood in the world! Or at least that's what she claims. Not everyone believes her, even though she has a prophecy to back her up. It's quite vague and most of the details she's just making up. In the end even she herself isn't sure if she's really touched by magic or if she's just really good at making a self fulfilling prophecy come true.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
