*** I agree. The problem is that there are so few good Harry/Fleur fics out there. Every once in a while I'll try to search for a new H/F story, and I simply come up with the same handful that I've already read.

**** Have you read Half-Blood Romantic? It's a fairly recent work that's still lucky enough to be updated so far. I've followed the Harry/Fleur pairing for over 5 years now, having read pretty much all the notable works during that long time and I gotta say this is probably the best I've encountered.

Harry/Fleur is an unconventional pairing because of the age gap and later on, her engagement. Half-Blood Romantic works so far because it embraces this dynamic, and addresses the benign imbalance that would exist in a relationship between the two, that many fics in the pairing surprisingly and disappointingly shy away from.

***** I gave that fic a try at some point, and then I gave up on it. I can't remember the exact reason why though. I quickly skimmed back over it, and it might have been because of the over-analyzation of absolutely everything that is said or done. Like in chapter 2, Harry goes into detailed introspection about pros and cons of liking or not liking Ginny vs Fleur and he comes to all sorts of very insightful conclusions about Ginny based on a few converstations and words. It broke my suspension of disbelief. Harry doesn't think, talk, or act like that. Those parts read more like an essay about HP pairings than a story.

At least I think that's why I gave up on Half-Blood Romance. I could be totally mis-remembering things...

** I'm pretty vanilla in that I like the canon pairings, especially Harry/Ginny and Remus/Tonks. I think it's because I enjoy writing all those characters and identify with them all in different ways, so it just feels cosy to me. I won't deny that Harry and Ginny needed more development, and I would have liked to see more in HBP, so I guess that's what fanfic is for.

Non-canon, I like Seamus/Dean because I think the dynamic and story could be pretty interesting and angsty but with a happy ending.

  Lily Potter was never Lily Potter, but only James ever knew the truth. And instead of a son, they had a baby girl, Rayna. Upon discovering their sister's death, Thor and Loki swear to protect their niece, when they find her. How will the discovery that she is one of the Aesir change the events after fourth year?

** Harry/Hermione

With the way the characters were developed, and with how the narrative played out, this simply makes the most sense to me. Besides, while there's a lot of bad Harry/Hermione fics out there, the good ones can be really good and have convinced me about this pairing.

Other ships are fine - I know a lot of people don't like Harry/Hermione, and that's fine too.

Other than that, I'm pretty Harry-centric in my reading. There doesn't have to be a ship, but others I like include, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Luna.

**** Here's some of my favorites off the top of my head in no particular order.

- Returning to the Start by timunderwood9. A time travel fic wherein Harry goes back in time and Takes Care Of Business in a somewhat believable manner. Bonus points for him not getting into a creepy relationship with Hermione while she's 13 and he's mentally 30. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]])

- Coming Back Late by alchymie. Totally awesome fic - it might be the best fanfic ever written. Deathly Hallows and politics and wonderful characterization. Sadly, it's been abandonded, but there's enough present to provide an exciting read, the story's climax, and a good bit of the resolution. Several points are left hanging, but what'cha gonna do? One of the best HHr fics ever written IMHO. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]])

- Time in the Fire by Odment Tweak. This might be my all-time favorite fic. It's not perfect, but it knows how to hit you right in the feels. It's a time-travel fic with a twist. I've probably read this one 50 times. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]])

- Resistence by lorien829, or really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][loriend829]] for that matter. She's got several wondeful fics that are all worth reading, this is just my favorite of the bunch. It was written before Deathly Hallows - so there's some differences there. It's from Hermione's perspective in a world where Voldemort won the last battle, and it follows how the surviving good guys continue the fight. It's pretty awesome. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- Notebooks and Letters by chemprof. This is the fic that got me interested in the HHr pairing years ago. The premise is that the published HP books are an embelished telling of the events that really took place. Hermione sits down with her daughter and gives her the real story through reading her old diaries and letters. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]])

- Harry Potter and the Lost Demon by Angry Hermione. Written before Deathly Hallows, so again, some differences there. The author is excellent and her characters are spot on. She also adds some new and very imaginative elements to the HP world. She also plays with the soul bond and love potion tropes in a way that is incredibly creative - it's the only time I can think of that they've been done well. Excellent story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Coulsdon Eagle. Origingally published on the now defunct Portkey.org, this fic adds some changes to year 5. Because of some tricky magic with unintended consequences, Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry's. It's a great story. I remember following it as it was being published and the excitement that came with each new update. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

- Finally, if you're looking for something on the lighter and/or funnier side of things, check out what [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876][kyc639]] published back in the day - again originally on Portkey.org but now archived. He wrote Harry with a great, sarcastic sense of humor. Well worth checking out. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876]]

- And then of course there's my humble addition to the fandom: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]) It doesn't really stand with the above fics, but I'm adding it anyways.

Enjoy!

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione.

**** Good Harry/Daphne fics are few and far between. I've only ever found a scant few that were really worth the effort:

- Pureblood Princess by TheEndless7 is by far the best of the genre. It's told from Daphne's point of view during 6th year. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess]])

- Letters by TheEndless7 is technically a Harry/Fleur fic, but it actually has my all-time favorite instance of Harry/Daphne in it as a kind of side or secondary pairing. The way Daphne is written here is simply marvelous. It's also great in that there's a bonus alternate epilogue that lets the fic end as Harry/Daphne - so you can read it that way if you so choose. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]])

- Contractual Invalidation by R-dude is a another good fic. It goes into politics and scheming a bit more than the two above, but it also manages to present an interesting Daphne character. I thoroughly enjoyed it. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation]])

- Uncle Harry by R-dude can be seen as a kind of prequel to /Contractual Invalidation/ that I listed above. It's a slice-of-life oneshot, and very well-written. I think it humorously and accurately portrays what it would be like if Harry married a pureblood princess. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533/1/Uncle-Harry]])

- The Reluctant Champion by TheUnrealInsomniac is also on my favorites list, but I don't really recall much about it other than I liked it at the time. However, I remember thinking that the ending, and the now abandoned sequel weren't that great. The fic started off rather light and funny, but it ends kind of as a downer. Still worth reading though. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5071058/1/The-Reluctant-Champion]])

- The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin356 - I'll include this here for completeness' sake. I haven't read it for years, but I recall it being one of those fics where Daphne comes in and solves all of Harry's problems for him by getting him to be more politcal/slytherin etc. I liked it years ago when I read it, but I'm not sure if I'd like it as much today. Take it with a grain of salt. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7508571/1/The-Fall-of-the-house-of-Potter]])

Other than those, it's very hard to find a well-wrtten Daphne fic.

** Harry/Hermione is my favorite by far. I like them mainly because I think from a canon perspective they made the most sense. I can read any Harry/Female Character pairing, but I have a hard time seeing Hermione with anyone other than Harry. I think the main reason for that is that canon-wise there just isn't that great a selection of male characters. Neville or Ron are the only two decent main-ish characters available, and Ron treated Hermione like trash for most of canon and Neville seems to subdued throughout the books to be able to stand up to Hermione when she needs it. The rest of the male characters in the books that had any role at all seem to be death eaters or weren't developed at all. If you go out of her age range, then there are more options, but I'm just not interested in reading Hermione with Snape or Sirius. The age gap is just too large and Snape is irredeemable.

I know a lot of people like Dramione (and Drarry for that matter), but I just can't see Hermione forgetting the way Draco treated her during their Hogwarts days. She might forgive him if he makes an effort, but forgetting all that and then falling in love with him seems a tall order.

To actually answer your question. Harry/Slytherin (usually Daphne). Im aware that Daphne is a name with a fanon background. One of the issues I had with the series was that Rowling kept throwing in 'house unity' but that didn't mean jack. Without her post facto additions, all Slytherin's are evil (although some have a brief clash of conscience). By pairing Harry with a Slytherin we get to see that no, they aren't all bad. Its humanizing.

Oliver Wood x Marcus Flint, because sport rivalry

Cedric x Neville, I just thought about it, about Neville having someone kind and patient and it kinda works in my mind.

Draco x Bill, I just thought someone older and impressive for that little shit, again, one fanfiction where it worked and my mind is set.

Ron x some girl that just loves quidditch and plays. Him fangirling over a female quidditch player = fuuun .

** Harry x Draco

I can't believe there isn't more love for them in this thread.

I find their relationship fascinating. Complete antagonists in school, but at the time, always within each other's peripheral vision. It's not like they hated and then ignored one another - each went out of their way to get a rise out of the other one.

Then you get 6th year, when Harry is straight up obsessed with Draco.

And then malfoy Manor and the fiendfire - as much as they hate each other, as much as each will go out of their way to fight each other and get on their nerves, each will also go out of their way immensly to save the other one. It's like they acknowledge that all that harassment wasn't /serious/, at the end of the day, they have one another's back.

Not to mention that any time they are snarky to each other is just quality entertainment. Draco x Harry is always hilarious. It's never boring. It's just so damn fun to read about.

Also, I do think they balance each other out - neither has to walk on glass in front of the other, Draco would never treat Harry like he's explosive or fragile - he would always just treat him normally, which is what Harry wants. And Harry's pure heroism is attractive to Draco, I think, who desperately wants to be the good guy but doesn't necessarily know how - things are too gray for him. So he admires Harry's black and white world view, his conviction, and how he's always manages to be good.

** The Titanic. It was said to be a unsinkable but on the night of April 12, 1912, it bumped into an iceberg, split into two and sank. There was a famous movie about it featuring modern day treasure hunters looking for a piece of jewelry, which leads them to interview an old lady who reminisces about her long lost love who died in the Titanic tragedy.

Oh wait... You're talking about another kind of ship.

** My OTP (and probably most common) ship is SS/HG, which I like because it makes sense to me. My second tier favourites are Myric and Pinch, because I can see them in my head clearly despite never having read fic for either.
