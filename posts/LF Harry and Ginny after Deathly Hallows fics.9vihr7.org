** Try floreat castellum. Some really good fics on her page on fanfiction.net.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others]]. This fic is a fantastic one and just what you're looking for. Probably the main fic that got me so into fanfiction

*** Thanks! I think OP is looking for post Hogwarts though, and NFO doesn't go much beyond DH.

[[/u/DeathDefy21][u/DeathDefy21]], have you heard of the site SIYE.co.uk? It's dedicated to h/G and has loads of post DH fics!

In terms of specific authors, I would recommend Little0bird, pottermum and BigFatMaybe. All of them are on that site. You may also like Northumbrian, who has heaps of stories.

** I would recommend Strangers at Drakeshaugh linkffn(6331126). It's a bit different though. While I would call it a Harry/Ginny fic, its actually from the perspective of the muggle neighbors.

** So, this story doesn't 100% fit your request.

Ginny is sorted into Slytherin, and starts at her first year at Hogwarts, but it is not simply a rehash. The first 5 years are written in single (long) chapters. The other half of the book is about her 6th and 7th year. It ends in her 7th year (post DH) which is then continued in two sequels.

It is 100% the best Harry/Ginny fic, and I think many would agree with me. It has fluff, but also post war angst.
