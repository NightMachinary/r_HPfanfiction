#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

** Weasley Girl by Hyaroo is (for me) the most fun, interesting and well written fic of that trope. The relatively small changes compound throughout the story and its sequel, changing what looks to be a stock standard canon story to something exciting and new.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** I have trouble picking a single best story, since it really depends on what aspects you care most about.

Some of my favourites have already been mentioned (eg. Pureblood Pretense), but here are the ones which haven't:

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/Effects_and_Side_Effects]]) is quite possibly the most plausible harem fic I've ever seen, and has some very creative world-building to boot.

The basic concept is that Harry Potter gets turned into a girl when he manages to turn the tables on an attempt by Voldemort to steal back his horcrux, then a bunch of girls use a bond (that's normally intended for marriage) to ensure they can't betray his secrets to Voldemort. They can leave at any time as long as they don't consummate the union... but, by the time they're willing to give up the protection of the bond, its strife-suppressing effects will probably have allowed them to grow so comfortable with each other that they don't want to. Harry eventually discovers that he'll be able to regain his male form as a secondary animagus form... but he'll need to practice to be able to hold it.

It's /not/ a kinky fic. In fact, it's a fic that I'd characterize as "Often, I forget that Harry is a girl throughout this... and that's a good thing."

Together with Pureblood Pretense, I think I'd consider it one of the two "best-written fics which contain non-trivial gender-bending" in the HP fandom. (ie. They're very well-written, but they don't focus on the gender-bending enough to satisfy someone who's looking for a fic that's truly /about/ gender-bending in the personal, experiental sense, rather than as a vehicle for a romance or the development of a literary hero or what have you.)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2569549/1/Wandless_Magic]]) is a humorous series of vignettes exploring what might happen to the wizarding world if Harry Potter took place on the same Earth as C. Jones's The Virus. (In which a chance encounter between Tenchi Muyo and Ranma ½ results in everyone on Earth getting a copy of Ranma Saotome's "Cold water gender-swaps you. Hot water takes you back." curse.)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/The_Girl_Who_Loved]]) starts out a little silly, with Harry Potter getting sent to Jusenkyo, China (from Ranma ½) when Dumbledore tells him "The Power [Voldemort] Knows Not" is mpreg with Snape, causing Harry to panic-apparate to the opposite side of the globe. He ends up then falling in The Spring of Recently Drowned I Don't Know Who She Was (Sailor Moon). As I explained in my summary of the previous fic, that means changing form based on water temperature. However, silliness aside, it's actually quite the enjoyable romance between Harry Potter and Usagi Tsukino (Sailor Moon) once it gets up and going. (Initially, with her as a ghost. Later, when she's resurrected with the help of magic from the Sailor Moon setting.)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2296193/1/Harry_Potter_The_Boy_Who_Lived]]) is one I always remember as having been smart about glossing over unchanged canon events. It's a first-year fic with a (sadly unfinished) second-year sequel and the basic idea is that there never was a "Harry Potter"... just a Hallie Potter, and Dumbledore has convinced her that, for a variety of reasons, it would be better if she attended Hogwarts wearing an illusion that makes her look like a boy.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16165/EllandrahSylver+Fool+s+Consequences.htm][Fool's Consequences]] by EllandrahSylver (posted under the Twisting the Hellmouth policy that you can post stuff other than Buffy crossovers there as long as they're less than 50% of what you post) is a gender-bending Harry-Draco ship in which one of Draco's attempts to sabotage Harry in potions goes so horribly wrong that Draco is permanently turned into a girl and forced to bond herself to Harry as restitution under some old line theft laws.

It's a fic that I'd describe as "well-enough implemented that I kept reading despite hating elements of the concept". (Primarily, the ever-present "waiting for the other shoe to drop" feeling I get from "Calypso Malfoy" being magically bound to obey Harry if he slips up and gives her an order.)

It's also got a bit way into it where Fred and George get pranked into temporarily thinking the same thing happened to them (I think it was one of their older siblings but I forget the reason it was a reasonable prank in context) and the author has done a spin-off collection of sexually explicit scenes which includes one of them taking advantage of the learning opportunity. (Accessible via TtH's support for grouping stories into series.)

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
