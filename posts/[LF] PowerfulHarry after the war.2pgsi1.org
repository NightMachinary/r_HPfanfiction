I'm looking for Post-DH fics where Harry gains powers after the Horcrux in his scar has been destroyed in the Forest. Preferably no pairings, but if so, then H/G, H/HR, H/D(aphne), H/F. Thnx for the help!


** I've never considered that but it would be cool if "mark[ing] him as his equal" actually brought Harry's power level /down/ to Riddle's level.

*** Interesting idea. What would he gain though?

**** Maybe he is a seer with the unique power to access magical knowledge from the future. Or a kind of metamorphamagus that can become a dragon or some other sturdy form. Or a natural flier.
