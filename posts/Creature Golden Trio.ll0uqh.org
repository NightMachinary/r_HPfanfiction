Not sure if this should be put as a prompt or a request. I don't know if there are any fics where Harry, Ron and Hermione are magical creatures/beings, but not because of a creature inheritance. They are either born as one or they are turned before Hogwarts. As the only non-humans in their year (as far as they know), they become friends. Shenanigans ensue. How would the trio secretly being creatures change the plot? Please, no canon plot retelling. Bonus points if Ron is the one who is a werewolf for a change.


** You know, I'm tempted to write this. I have something kind of similar in my 'fics to write someday if I get bored/have time' where a magical virus is released that turns every magical /not/ already an animagus into a creature/human hybrid. (Basically a Grindlewald nazi that wanted to make 'super soldiers' escaped and spent the years since inside his self-sufficient country house/manor hideaway under Fidelius. When he's almost dead of old age/health problems he says screw it and relases the virus in every magical shopping district worldwide a few weeks before classes start. Long incubation with zero symptoms until it's too late.)

Basically the virus kills people, its a warping of the animagus transformation, so the only way to surrive is to learn the animagus transformation. This happens during third year, Sirius hears about it, gets into Dumbledore's office and begs him to let him help/take veritaserum.

Sirius and others help students complete animagus transformation to surrvive. Their human form is still half-animal though.

I don't really have a lot of plot, more relationship driven than anything else. I imagine Harry as a gryphon, Hermione as a tiger, and luna as some white cat with elf-ears with lava-lamp markings that constantly move and are affected by her mood. If i did this I'd probably make neville a dragon and have him and harry have the instinctive urge to kill each other, since Harry's animal is capabable of killing dragons, but only if an ambush/instant kill works out.

This would basically be the end of the Pureblood movement, and a massive upheaval in magical society. No more easily walking among muggles.

**** I would probably have the weasley twins as fox/male kitsune, Ginny as some winged creature maybe a quetlecoatul(never can spell it) and would probably kill Ron off.

** I was reading one a while back where adult auror!Harry among with a bunch of other people were kidnapped and then sorta turned into magical creatures through blood infusions, but I can't remember it.

It was Harry and Ron as auror partners, though.

** I know of a few where Harry is some sort of "half-breed." They are typically WAY off the rails though. One he was half phoenix, one where he was an elemental spring to mind. Wouldn't recommend either tbh. There are plenty of stories with Harry and Hermione being animagus together. But I don't think that's what you are after.

*** Yeah, I was hoping for something with Ron as well and no complicated or superpowerful stuff.
