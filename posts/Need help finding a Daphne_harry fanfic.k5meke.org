  Daphne's sick and tired of having to be perfect and used, and that was why she left. She didn't expect to find Harry Potter, yet he was the perfect person to hide with. Her father wouldn't find her with him. Thus she stayed. What happens now? Rated M for later chapters, for lemons, suicide attempts, torture and language. Daphne's 17, Harry 16. HBP AU. OFF hiatus. Dark-ish!Harry.

**** I've read it now. It's not bad though the first few chapters are a little rough with lacing and whatnot. Like the little scene where daphne explains why she hates her father felt like it didnt belong there. But the later chapters are better and I would like to see it completed someday
