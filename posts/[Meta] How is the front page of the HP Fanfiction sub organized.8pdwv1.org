I used to think it was by which threads were most recent but then I realized that you would see 2 days ago above 10 hours ago. Then I thought it was by upvotes but I see 17 upvotes over 48. So my question to you all is how the hell is it organized because it's been bothering me since I subscribed like a year ago.


** - The moderators can sticky up to two threads. These stay there for as long as they please.

- The ones below are sorted by reddit's magic soup, but generally follow the following rules:

  - Threads with more upvotes are ranked higher\\
  - Newer threads are ranked higher than old ones
  - Early upvotes count slightly more than late upvotes

...it's not trivial, and most of it is actually secret because reddit doesn't want us to know.

** I think it is sorted by "popular" by default.

*** Really, do you think there's an option to change the ranking system?

**** You can change to best or newest if you prefer. I almost always switch to newest.
