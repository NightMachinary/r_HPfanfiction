** Linkffn(Lord of Caer Azkaban) is a popular one. It isn't the best writing, but if I remember right it was somewhat original while following a lot of the Ancient and Noble House cliches.

Edit: Just a fair warning, I reread the first couple of chapters. The author uses their instead of there a few times and it can be cringeworthy.
