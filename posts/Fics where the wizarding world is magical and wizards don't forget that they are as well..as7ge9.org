I've seen quite a few fics where magic is used oddly sparingly. A couple of adult wizards will help someone with their trunk.. by each grabbing an end and physically lifting it between them. No levitation, no feather-lightness. Someone washes dishes by hand. Harry and friends get injured at Hogwarts by regular magic or mundane things, and they get stitches, slings for their broken arms, and crutches for their sprained ankles. Etc. It almost seems like the authors have planned moments to use magic, but sort of.. forget that it exists, or don't think about how it would be used other than when it's "important".

So I'm just looking for fics where magic is ever present in as many aspects of wizarding life as possible. For example, I remember reading one fic where it was briefly mentioned that the magical equivalent of showers are stalls that have enchanted self cleaning water that rises off the floor in a sort of mini-waterspout and perfectly cleans you in very little time. Or something like that. In another fic someone, I think Hermione, enchanted their robes to hover a millimeter above the skin and to be warm and maybe some other things. I'd like to read some stories filled with that kind of thing; magic is involved in near everything, and wizards/witches use it nearly as often as they use their hands.

So yeah. What good fics have the most magic-saturated settings?

Thanks

This baffles me the most, considering how often Madam Pomfrey shows up in the actual books.

******** Exactly. I can see a Muggleborn or muggle fanatic using stitches where all else has failed, but in general, the magical methods are much more efficient. They're safer, quicker and usually less painful. Personally, I've had Ron cut himself on the hand and Mrs Weasley use a healing charm that behaves like stitches, but Hermione was the only one to recognise that, â€˜Hey, that looks a lot like when muggles get stitches!' To the witches and wizards, it's just a healing charm that brings the skin back together when it's gaping slightly, then seals it.

** I don't mind stories that decide to treat magic either way - use it for everything vs. use sparingly - but what rubs me the wrong way is when the author never bothers to give even a single line of context explaining /why/ it's one way or another.

Like if you want to write a world where people pick up trunks instead of levitating them, then at least throw in something like:

"But Mrs. Weasley," Harry asked, "can't you just float all the trunks onto the train? Or magic them directly to the school?"

"Oh Harry dear," came the condescending reply. "Magic can, of course, easily do both of those things. But we don't just go throwing spells around willy-nilly, and especially not in places like Platform 9 3/4 or Hogwarts."

"Why not?"

"Well here, for example, we're nestled into a very small space sort of in-between the Muggles. With all the locomotors running around and eckletricity running through the place, we've got to be careful about destabilizing the enchantments that make the platform possible. It's been stable for almost two centuries, of course, but magic is a finicky thing. You never know."

Or something.

** one of my biggest pet peeves are witches complaining about their period.

In a more equal world where women health problems were always treated with as much serious effort as men's and be it just that witches did the research themselves, I refuse to believe that not at least a hundred different potions and spells exist that deal with it in seconds or minutes.

No way in hell!

*** Yeah, I get ya. Even if they haven't found a way to just magically stop periods entirely (it's entirely believable that they haven't in canon imo), I'd expect magic to make it a lot less unpleasant.

In a hypothetical more highly magical wizarding world, I imagine that taking care of it is, at most, as difficult as drinking a preventative potion monthly.

Does she overshadow Harry? I'm perfectly happy reading about a strong/smart/etc. Hermione, but I admit that for me Harry is too entrenched in my mind as The Main Character. I usually can't help but shy away from stories where he's overall overshadowed by anyone his age.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** It's so annyoing when they don't use magic. We know there are levitation spells, what's the point of walking around? And instead of toilets they should just vanish the waste from their bodies. There's got to be a night-vision spell, so why bother with lights. I bet there's a way to learn things through magic, so school is pretty pointless too. There are confirmed cleaning spells, so showers are entirely useless. Potions are probably just as nutriotious, maybe more than food.
