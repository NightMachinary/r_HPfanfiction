So you know all those really bad Harry goes to gringotts, gets a ton of Lordships, and becomes a massive tool stories?

That, but with Hagrid or Dumbledore.

A suggestion is that everyone is just so terrified of Dumbledore that no one can stop him.


** When Lucius Malfoy shows up to kill Buckbeak, Hagrid transfigures him into a Hippogriff and Buckbeak into Lucius Malfoy.

Hagrid uses his political marriage with Maxine to become king of the Nephilim, who are giants, which aren't mentioned in HP canon at all but become a thing for the fic, then he kills Laufey of the Frost Giants, who is supposedly from Norse Mythology but is clearly based off of the version in Marvel Comics, and also he gets the Cyclopes of Greece to forge superweapons for him, but their characterization is ripped off from Percy Jackson. All of this ignores the fact that giants are supposedly going extinct in canon, except for a line where it mentions that because giants are going extinct in canon, Hagrid needs a wife from each giant tribe to help repopulate. Also, by banging these wives he can get a unique giant power from each tribe. These powers are never mentioned later or used to resolve meaningful plot conflicts.

So at the end of all that, his title becomes something like Rubeus Hagrid Laufeybane Gigantes ben Yahweh etc., etc.

The story consists of incredibly tedious giant politics with occasional completely out-of-place incredibly specific giant smut that completely wastes the premise.

** I mean this is canon Dumbledore minus the gold. 3 of the most powerful titles, everyone is too afraid or in awe to go against him despite questioning the instructions every step of the way, and he was a massive tool in HBP.

*** I think you missed quite a bit of it though.

Dumbledore acts like Indy! Harry.

So pretty much everything else Indy! Harry does.

Have everyone call him lord Dumbledore.

Claim a bunch of accounts with the goblins.

Randomly crucio people.

It sounds a ton like Voldemort, but I want a comedy element.

**** Lord Dumbledore-Gryffindor-Peverell-Emrys-White-Sheep

Also, he has a harem consisting of all the 'perpetual bachelors' the Pureblood families like to pretend aren't part of the family. All of them are ~40 years old, compared to his ~150. This is still more wholesome than the harem in Dodging Prison +for Grooming Children+ and Stealing Witches.

He also gives himself a massive amount of superpowers, starting with Occlumency and Legilimency and ending with literal godhood, and he also upgrades from Fawkes to having an elemental beast of every element.

Also, he buys a massive magical trunk the size of Hogwarts. What does he put in there? Nothing, which is actually a plot point.

Also, no one actually thinks he's doing anything wrong. When McGonagall, Harry, or Hermione notice his abuses of power, they nod sagely and say "For the Greater Good." At no point does Dumbledore himself say the phrase.

***** I mean this Lord Dumbledore should have neutralized that upstart Riddle easily, unless he had some other nefarious plans to achieve the Greater Good.

Maybe Riddle to him is like the Separatists Systems to Palpatine. Harry Potter eventually becomes the apprentice he has been looking for all these years, and will liquidate both Aurors and Riddle's gang,

I can already see Lord Potter marching towards the Ministry at head of Dumbledore's Army, with this music in background: [[https://youtu.be/h2n7j1iUHuk]]

****** Yeah, it's all part of his master plan to put Lord Potter-Black-Evans-Voldemort-Gaunt (by right of conquest)-Weasley-Lupin in charge of the magical British puppet state when he conquers the world.
