Assuming that the room can let you do the transformation would the effect be permanent or would it wear off as you leave the room because the Super Soldier Serum was created by the room and therefore cant leave the room?

Pretty much the Question boils down to Is the Super Soldier Serum used up in the transformation or does it stay in the body?


** That's assuming it can make the SSS at all, which I doubt. It's not a God room, it just takes from the castle or creates simple structures, is my guess. The Serum is a highly complex synthesis.

But for the sake of the story, assuming it can be, I would say that since the Serum would bond with the body (I think? I don't know how it works) or otherwise enact a change physically, the change would stick.

** The RoR wouldn't be able to provide it in the first place. It has limitations, food and drink being the canon ones. I can't see how a significantly more complex molecular compound that impacts human biology on a base level would be possible.

Even if it could provide a reasonable approximation I would expect the effects to be harmful or potentially even lethal upon leaving the RoR. Just because you could transfigure something to look like an apple doesn't mean it would provide nutrition after all.

*** as long as you take the ingredient into the RoR it could probably give you the equipment to make the serum.

** Perhaps it could find the formula or remake the machinery but as said, the potion/medicine aspect wpuldn't be possible

*** as long as the room could give you the machinery it would be possible getting the equipment would be the hardest part.

To get the serum or a magical equivalent you you would just need access to the possible ingredient and some Felix Felicis to make sure you make the serum correctly.

then you just need a second dose of Felix Felicis for the friend you are having operate the equipment to make sure that the transformation goes perfectly. you would need to make sure that all the Felix Felicis was out of your system first to make sure it would not interfere with the transformation.

** I...uh...hmm.

I think it'd be real. The magic of the room (and by extension, Hogwarts) is apparently powerful enough that whatever it creates can be used for long periods of time (like the bathrooms it created for the DA in book 7). I'd assume nothing changes once you bring that stuff out of the room.

I could be wrong though.

** I would assume that the Serum would fall under Gamps Third Law since it provides nutrition value. Now the other equipment and everything else, sure.

I would make the entire Idea of the SSS, a scientific attempt at recreating a story that is magical in nature, like a story about a knight who performed a ritual that made him the perfect human and with that he was able to defeat his enemy that was a huge threat before he got boosted

** That's pointless to discuss, as in the Potter-World, comics do still exist, meaning that it is fictitious to them as well. The only likely way to become a Super-Soldier in the Potterverse is Ritual Magic, Alchemy, Potions, Dark Arts.
