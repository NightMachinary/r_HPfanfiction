I am looking for a fic where things are pushed a couple of years. Voldemort revives until the end of Hogwarts, Harry is much more prepared having 7 years of magical training (not asking for a OP Harry where even after the whole 7 years of training he can go toe to toe with Voldemort.)

I am not looking for a drawn out battle where the wars extends for decades, the war should end within Harry's early twenties.

If it can meet any of the following it would be great ( I am not asking for it to meet EVERYTHING, the following is optional)

A completed story or a regularly updated story, tho incomplete rare gems are welcomed.

There is romance with Daphne or Fleur or another girl. Can't stand Ginny/Harry but if the romance is secondary to the plot it is fine.

If Harry goes around the world for a couple of years for more training, again, not decades, it would be good.

Harry didn't waste valuable Hogwarts time with useless classes as Divination, he took something better like ancient runes or focused more on defense/charms/transfiguration

Sirius lives.

Dumbledore takes a more active role in training Harry.

--------------

This comes out of my tiredness of seeing Harry being as powerful as Voldemort with less than 5 years of magical training.

There are many ways an author can tackle the Voldemort problem, like pushing the conflict a couple of years or tweaking the horcruxes a little where every time one is destroyed Voldemort loses strength to the point Harry can barely hold himself against him (Voldemort is still more experienced) but a weakened Dark Lord can be ganged upon.


** Two fics stand out in this category, and Harry never went to Hogwarts in both:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort and fled Britain. Harry grew up in Muggle world, went to Oxford and Sandhurst Military Academy. His opportunity arrived when Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): A more brave and cunning Lucius Malfoy won the first round, Dumbledore and his surviving followers evacuated to France. After 18 years, they would have their revenge. Ron/Hermione centric.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
