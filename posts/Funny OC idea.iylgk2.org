Read this and let me know if you agree

So, I had this genius idea for on OC. As a rule of thumb, I generally don't enjoy many OCs, mostly because they seem to usually be poorly thought out, and mostly wish fulfillment. However, if I read one like this, I would love it.

He's another muggleborn in Gryffindor, with exactly 2 points to his entire character;

1. He is really horrible at magic
2. He's obsessed with Karate

He's all like “Yeah, you know how to stun someone; I do too..... with Karate!”

This happens several times every year, and is like a running joke. Every new year he always brags about how he's a higher belt now, until finally he's a black belt in time for their 5th year.

He goes with them to the Ministry, and follows Harry when he runs after Belatrix, and encounters Voldemort with him. This is his big moment.

Voldemort's like “You can't hope to defeat me. I am the greatest wizard of all time. I know magic beyond your comprehension.”

And the OC steps forwards, throws his wand at Voldemort and says “Yeah, you may be better than me at magic, but I know something you don't. KARATE!”

Then he does a cool almost cinematic flying kick right towards Voldemort, and promptly gets murdered without a second thought. Because MAGIC WOULD MURDER ANYONE TRYING TO FIGHT IT WITH MARTIAL ARTS. ITS MAGIC.

Not only would this completely useless OC with blatant foreshadowing hype the reader up for the inevitable use of Karate, but the let down would be the highlight of the story, and subvert expectations. It would become an instant classic.
