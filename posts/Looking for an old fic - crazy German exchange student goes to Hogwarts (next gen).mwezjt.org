This must have been years ago but I've been searching for a fic which was next gen, and had a German exchange student called Marcus (I think?!) who came to Hogwarts, and he was crazy and threw massive parties.

They also used 'Wizbook'... And that's about all I can remember but I loved it and would really like to reread if anyone knows what it is called!
