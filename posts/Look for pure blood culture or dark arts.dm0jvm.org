Look for fics where there is heavy culture and traditions around dark arts or pure blood culture. Less of Harry learns to become a lord and more talking about holidays like Yule or darks arts are an affinity and you can do ceremonies around that. Recently read Evitative by Vichan it made me want more!


** Evitative is so good. I hope they update soon.

** RainingInk has a story that fits that description. It is only available as a repost with the authors permission and is clearly marked as such. I can't for the life of me remember the title of the fix though.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

** The Perfectly Normal series, by BrilliantLady, goes /a lot/ into wizarding culture. It explores their religion, culture, etiquette, and all other kinds of stuff.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.
