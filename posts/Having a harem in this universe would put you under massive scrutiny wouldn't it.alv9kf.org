I always feel a bit off when I see the usual Dark/Grey Harry that somehow gets a train of attractive women/girls to chase him about. The Imperius curse and apparent ease in making a love potion, considering an uneducated Merope and a schoolgirl Molly made one, would make it incredibly easy to force someone into a relationship. Merope essentially enslaved Tom Riddle Senior so anytime I see or read a harem fic, a part of me always thinks back to this and just how weirdly accepting of it everyone is. Considering the sheer stupid levels of rumours spread about Harry in canon, I've never really seen anyone accuse Harry of using a love potion or straight up using the Imperius curse.


** Well, harem stories usually presume that harems are an established tradition in the Wizarding World, so it wouldn't be thought of as particularly weird. No need to assume love potions when it's right in the name that it's this old thing involving soulbonds and magical contracts, you know?

(P.S.: Could somebody kindly tell me why Reddit refuses to tell me post more often than once every ten minutes? Is this a recently-registered-account thing, or what?)

*** I think it's less than 100 (or so) karma. With your posting frequency, you should have that back in a day or two.

*** Yes, AU social ideas make harem stuff "acceptable". You are looking at it from a canon universe perspective, flachra. :)

*** How do you even verify that? What is to stop someone from using the Imperius or Love potion and then telling everyone "oh, we are soul bounded you see. Yep. That is what happened."

** HP does have the potential for some interesting stuff here (magical system with relatively undefined social system). However, Haram fics are usually just weakly justified (and sometimes they don't even bother with that) wish fulfillment bores.

I have yet to see a pic do this well to either explore the realities such a relationship would entail or some interesting aspect of magic. Some have come close (I recall one about politics of a coven, and another about sex magic), but prehaps predictably they all devolved into simple with fulfillment...
