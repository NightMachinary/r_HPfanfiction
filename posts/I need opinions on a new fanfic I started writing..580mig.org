Hi everybody.

Over the last day I wrote the draft for the first chapter of a new fic. Its supposed to be a fic dealing with the magical world of the 10th century, ending with the Founding of Hogwarts. All of it is from the eyes of Harry who has decided to not be reborn into his old life after he got killed in the Forbidden Forest, but rather tried for a new life in the body of Alrun Ragnasdottir of the Peverell Clan.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBAaNj5RWAp0-85l1c6VzyjAUDrU8rLbjE7GcvFhfGU/edit?usp=sharing]]

What I'm asking for you is a critical look on the first part of it, the scene in the "Inbetween". I'm pretty sure I'll rewrite that completely because I'm not happy with whats happening in it at all.

The rest of it is probably more of a "What would you like to see?". I plan on a story about how Harry's/Alrun's presence in the lifes of the Peverell Clan, Rowena Raveclaw and subsequently the Founders changed the outcome of centuries of magical history afterwards.

Its gonna be a Harry/Rowena with a normal-powered Harry, which in comparison will look powerful as I go off the assumption that magic also went through a process of becoming better, more effective and "modern", just like technologies did. Think of having a machinegun in a medieval battle and you'll know how I'll go about this.

Anyway, I can only repeat that this is a draft. Please don't be too offended by some of my dumber choices for words,...


** An interesting concept. Three things:

1. The section where Harry is talking with Dumbledore and Alrun is unnecessarily long. It's a plot device and to be honest no amount of "justification" is going to make it feel less of a plot device. With that in mind you might as well streamline it.

2. Some of the names seem strange. Ragnasdottir has Nordic roots, apparently being a Danish name, and the Clan system comes from Scotland. Neither of them are really appropriate for an English family such as the Peverells. England at this time was culturally Anglo-Saxon.

3. In the scene in the bazaar, the word you're looking for is "haggle" not "hackle".

*** 1. Yea. I'm not sure what i'll do with it. Maybe I do go the path of just streamline it. But I do like the fact that it is Harry's decision to become Alrun and not just one more thing that just happens to him.

2. Yes... I'm still doing research on that front. It is surprisingly difficult to find some good maps of the times. But I'm confident in my decision to make his new family Norse or Danish (as it will be part of the plot how this family remains in the good graces of the Anglo-Saxon King). I still need to look into the naming conventions of Danes. But I just rolled with it for now, for the drafts sake. I don't even have a timeline yet, so there's that. Rowena is born somewhere around 990 according to the wiki, so the current year would probably be 999 AD, to make Alrun and Rowena the same age. But frankly, I could set the whole thing in the early 10th century and it wouldn't matter in terms of characters. Its more of a decision what kind of setting I'd like.

3. FirstDraftProblems. Thanks for the pointer.

**** I was also going to comment on the names- so far most of the names are nordic or nordic sounding (for info there check out reenactment websites [I'm in Regia Anglorum, it does a reasonable genral intro to the history and has other useful guides for names/clothes/weapons], the sagas can be used too though they're written significantly later but so far its not bad).

Peverell from my quick check was only introduced in England through the Norman Invasion. (One of William's knightly natural sons adopted the name after his step-father).

I too wince every time 'clan' is used by anyone as its a) Scottish, b) an anachronism, but a very popular one that seems to pop up in all of the Founders fics (well either that or they're generic high medieval fantasy.).

In terms of dates, you are going to have to pick something concrete if you want to use actual history in the plot, or even if you want to be just vaguely correct. The 10th century involves a huge upheaval in terms of how Britain is- east England is being reconquered from the Danes, and England united properly during the first half and the last quarter involves a resurgence in the Danish raids. There are various wars in between too. Obviously the Kings and their relations with the Welsh kingdoms and Alba are very different as well.

As Hogwarts is founded in the last quarter of the 10th cent. You're probably looking at a setting of 925-960 ish depending on how old you want Rowena to be when Hogwarts is founded.

If you go with 920s, you're dealing with Aethelstan's conquest of Jorvik (York) and his assertion of power of Alba and Wales which would tie in fairly well with a Danish family struggling with Saxon politics. If you're in the UK the BBC have just been running a series of programs on this.

I also seriously suggest you look into contemporary views on magic. The Anglo-Saxon legal codes have a variety of stances on it from 'kill every witch you find' to 'its only a problem if they actually kill someone with it' (though some of the religious texts complicate things by denying it exists and requiring fasting from both the accuser and accused as magic is pagan so believing someone is a witch is a pagan thing to do...). A quick skim through the wikipedia page on Volva also throws up stuff on how the saga's views on witchcraft were that it was an incredibly gendered thing and Norse guys could be killed for practicing magic (though obviously sagas are slightly dodgy in their accuracy, being Christian views on the pagans of 200 years before).

Of course, its not necessary to go for something so insanely accurate, even if I would love to see something like it (I haven't found any and am writing my own, hence why I might be a bit over critical. This is also why I am advising on lots of research as I didn't do enough before and the advise above is basically to avoid the mistakes I made).

You are on the right track though! Visits to foreign lands for healing is really great (I might have gone with Constantinople but that would probably be more of a christian one...) I look forward to reading more!

***** Hey, thanks for the feedback. Yes, I realized that the naming is an issue. I'll leave it like it is for now as I simply have no time to delve too deep into research. But you give a very good tip, so imma check that out.

When it comes to the historical stuff, I'm currently doing research on it. But being a Central-European myself, british history is completely new land for me, so it might take a while. As for now its only a Peverell "Clan" (still searching for a better way of describing a norse/danish kind of that) against saxon land-nobility.

In this fic the Christians/Saxons and the wizards supporting them will be the main villain. It will also eventually change into an Alt-history fic as Ragna and Alrun influence history.

All in all, I think I'll do a lot of pick-and-choose, as adding magic to the mix changes a whole lot up in the first place.

Thank your for the feedback. I greatly appreciate it.

****** The sagas from what I remember have family groups living on a farm/farms and referring to them by the farmstead names, which were named after their founders (so Bjorn founded Bjornsted and his family were known as 'those guys from Bjornsted').

Pick-and-mix is a good choice- its impossible to integrate things fully. It's a bit hard to deny magic when the guys you're fighting are using it... so anything is going to be alt history.

Names are very easy to get right though- googling will bring up a suitable list. And doing it will make it feel much more 'Viking'.

** First off i'd like to say its a good start and a lot of promise, I like fics set in different era's that the standard ones. I'm not really sure what to say in terms of improving what you have already written but going forward i'd like to see some in depth writing on the magic of the times, a lot of fics gloss over that or just use modern day magic and as you have already demonstrated with the potions then things are a lot different.

Also the relationship should be a decent part of the story as well due to the time period and it being a same sex couple. I would imagine there would be a lot of issues within the family and the family's allies due to this, maybe even trouble with the family you mentioned harry being married into.

The only other thing i can think of is exploring the world properly. Alot of fics set in a different time seem to focus on one area but with this being set pre statute then i would imagine there would be interesting places that you could write into the story rather than just the standard diagon/knockturn/hogwarts & hogsmeade.

I'm not too sure if this is what you where looking for but that's just a few idea's i had after reading it, Also if you do post it on ffn or another site can you link it here as i would like to see how it progresses.

** That was really interesting.

Regarding the Inbetween: I liked that Dumbledore and Alrun showed Harry what would happen if he died. I liked that Harry based his choices on what he knew his friends' lives would be.

I think I would have liked to see Harry think about truly dying and getting to be with his family and friends and maybe even having a third person with Dumbledore and Alrun, just so each option had an advocate (or if it's Lily, advocate to live on, no matter which life he chose.)

Regarding the 2nd half: I like the mention of less effective potions and them walking through the bazaar.

I think Harry's gender dysphoria would be a good subplot that moves throughout the story--as Alrun goes through puberty especially.

One thing I find weird. I know the language is English so we can understand it but I'm sure it was different 1000 years ago. Having Harry mention (whether in the Inbetween or the next scene) that he just seems to understand the language of the time would help me suspend my disbelief a bit.

Something silly: I clicked it and thought, '12 pages? I'm not in the mood to read 12 pages,' but read it anyway. By the time I got to the end, I kept pressing the down arrow to scroll farther down. 'Where's the rest of it?' lol. Harry isn't usually my favorite to read, but if/when you post, promo it so I can read it properly.

Done. Good point. Thanks.

I read through the Inbetween scene again and agree that Lily, or Sirius or someone the like would do the scene some good. I'm unsure how I'll handle it. Thank you, though. This gave me some angle to start working on it.

** I loved this! It was a really interesting teaser of what's to come and I can't wait to read more. It will be interesting to see how Harry deals with being a girl in his new life. I do really like how you portrayed their magic differently - i.e potions aren't as effective or well developed yet.

Great story that got me into it very quickly and I couldn't stop reading.

** I can't believe you wrote this in one day! It is a very unusual story, and you paid attention to a lot of details. I like the idea of Ron as a businessman, perhaps it even was a lie to convince Harry, but it could be true to his character. What is it that you don't like about the first part?

*** It feels rushed to me. But I wanted to get to the juicy parts of medieval Bagdad, Europe and Britain so I just flew over that scene. I got some good feedback though, so maybe thats just my own impression? In any case, the scene will see some overhaul one way or another.

** I tend to be rather negative in my comments, so let me start off by saying: you've written a fair bit, it's already well above average and has good potential, so don't stop writing.

This would be easier if you enabled commenting on the document.

#+begin_quote
  Harry followed Dumbledore's invitation onto a spot next to a young girl.
#+end_quote

Whom Harry had not noticed before then, and now is only noticing in passing. It could have been a rubbish bin or a folded up newspaper, but it's a person.

#+begin_quote
  or rather, to say it in your way, Harry Jamesson of the Potters.”
#+end_quote

You're trying to make it seem like she's Anglo-Saxon, pre-Norman conquest. You're making it sound like she's from Skyrim.

Anglo-Saxons didn't start using /any/ sort of patronymic or surname before the Norman conquest. They used epithets -- there was a king who earned the epithet "the Unready", for instance -- though those were most commonly awarded posthumously and mostly to kings. Vikings were much bigger on epithets.

#+begin_quote
  Into the Everything
#+end_quote

"the Everything" sounds like she's trying to be overly mystical and not really succeeding.

#+begin_quote
  “You were tired.” Harry said.
#+end_quote

You have a period before the right quote. This means it's the end of the sentence. I should be able to insert "And then" after it and have it make sense. Instead, that would give us:

#+begin_quote
  "You were tired." And then Harry said.
#+end_quote

Small grammar issue, but it boils my blood.

#+begin_quote
  To experience love like only a mortal can. Emotions stop having the same impact once time is no longer against you. One does not love or hate with the same intensity.
#+end_quote

Is this common knowledge in the wizarding world? Is the existence of an afterlife common knowledge?

If they're both common knowledge, I'd understand that people would be reluctant to commit suicide in the face of a Dark Lord. But it would still be pretty common.

If people knew of the afterlife alone, then suicide would be /way/ more common.

Or if they don't know about an afterlife, why would Harry's instinct be /let me die already, I'm sick of living/? If he came back to life, he could run and hide in the worst case. He could help others. He could actually /do/ things.

How would anyone know anything about the afterlife? Do the dead and living get together every now and then? Do ghosts write to people on the other side? Is there a trade in books and music? Are there famous dead philosophers? What's the deal with ghosts if there's a real afterlife?

I totally forgot that. But for any future viewer I fixed it.

Thank you for your feedback. I'll work a lot of it in. For the grammar stuff I'm happy to say that I have a beta and stuff like that will be filtered out by a second pair of eyes.

But I'm afraid I don't understand what you're trying to say with the afterlife stuff. No its not common knowledge and no, the existence of it is not known. Death is and will always be a mysterious thing shrouded in secrets in the mortal realm. When Harry's soul goes into the Inbetween he knows nothing about the afterlife. He is then told those few tidbits you can read about by Dumbledore and Alrun (who are the actual souls of the two and not just two figures Harry imagines). I'm afraid you need to elaborate on your assumptions for me to answer.

It came off as if Harry had already decided he'd rather be dead and was reconsidering at the last minute. If the existence of an afterlife isn't common knowledge, I'd expect some disorientation, a bit of confusion, and some time in thought.

Or if his recent experiences were enough to make him suicidal, I'd expect it to take some more time for him to get back into an even mental state.
