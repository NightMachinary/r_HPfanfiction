** Interesting. I think you could do something interesting where the Mirror of Erised shows not just a person's greatest desire, but if such desire is actually achievable, it shows you step-by-step how to get there.

So like when Albus looks in the mirror and sees himself standing next to Gellert and Ariana, what he really ends up seeing is a little movie in which he pops over to Nurmengard, murders Gellert, and then commits suicide.

Obviously he doesn't do this, but it'd be a reason that the Mirror is seen as an insanely powerful and /very/ dangerous artifact. After all, it provides a step-by-step playbook for how to dominate the entire world, if your greatest desire is to become the next Dark Lord.

You could definitely take the idea and run with it. At first, it's wish-fulfillment super!Harry, but as he gets more and more dependent on the Mirror, he starts getting paranoid and slowly goes insane, obsessed with protecting the Mirror and preventing anyone else from glimpsing it.

It'd be a pretty OOC Harry at first, since he wouldn't see his family (which would mean showing him committing suicide), but I suppose the hacky and easy way to solve that is to dial up the abuse a bit, so Harry is less obsessed with his parents and more with "being strong enough that nobody can ever hurt me, /ever again/."

*** Hmm. I think for him not to see the family, he would have to realize he will never have a family and that wishing for it is stupid and will lead to his demise. He kills the Dursley's in their sleep and runs away to muggle London. He stumbles along the Leaky Cauldron and Tom, the bartender, opens the passage for him. He then goes to Gringotts and confesses to everything. They shelter him until he goes to Hogwarts and during the summer. He learns to speak Goblin, but that's all (otherwise it would be to much like Harry Crow in terms of his goblin culture).

** Grants, not simply shows? Thats intriguing, you can do a lot of interesting things with the Mirror in that case, since you need to rework it a little bit. From the top of my mind, I think I would go with Erised being some kind of demon that convinces young Harry to release him in exchange of him fulfilling his greatest desire - being stronger than Dumbledore. Sounds a bit trope-y at first, but im thinking of Erised being more similar to Gaunter O'Dimm than some kind of Aladeen-esque jinn. The demon would then just curb stomp Voldemort and starts unleashing havoc and all sorts of tricks across the planet. Harry may even be oblivious to this for a while, as he remains a mere child, even despite the extra knowledge.

*** I was thinking along the lines of since he is the â€˜Chosen One' it fulfills the desire to aid him in his quest to defeat the Dark Lord.

My other train of thought is that the mirror was created by his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather with the help of Merlin and was enchanted with ancient Magic's that will grant the heir of Merlin and the heir of the many greats grandfather their deepest desire. James is descended from the many greats grandfather and lily is defended from a squib line in the Merlin family.

The second one sounds a bit far fetched but with a bit of creativity I think it could work.

**** In regards to your second idea, Dumbledore somehow hides the Stone in the Mirror, so who is to say that centuries prior, someone hasnt hidden something else in it and never came back to retrieve it. Imagine if he suddenly has all these awesome powers and knowledge, but as time passes, he starts randomly switching to Celtic, and he deals with personality disorder. All of a sudden, you have what may as well be a time traveler from Antiquity stuck in an 11 year old body and struggling to make sense of who he is.

***** He then has bursts of accidental magic, despite having never had them before, due to his new power attempting to break the magical bind placed on him by a certain Dumbledore/Mcgonall. The bursts of magic end up destroying his house's table, Slytherin(?) and somehow petrifying the Bloody Baron. Instead of the stone in first year, the heir of Slytherin, either Hermione (from a squib line) or Pansy releases the Basilisk of their own free will to kill Harry.

****** I dont think the chamber is needed in year 1, and Riddle could open it himself, since he cruises around on Quirell's head. I could see Harry randomly sitting on the Slytherin table though, and trying to sleep in their bedrooms until other kids confront him and he looks at them completely confused and answers in a completely different language (Merlin was Slytherin). A good opportunity to have a really big, or otherwise weird, accidental magic burst is him seeing one of the House ghosts and wondering how the heck did they die. Merlin and those ghosts should have lived around the same times, in the Potterverse. And as he would be dealing with all this mess, Quirell could steal the stone and Voldie comes back to life in year 1.

******* That idea sounds better. And then he disguises himself and comes to Hogwarts as a teacher.

***** There would have to be a catch to prevent the heir from abusing the power and all that. And yea it does sound a bit like wish fulfillment.

I'm just throwing out ideas.
