[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI][Neil Gaiman - Inspirational Commencement Speech at the University of the Arts 2012]]

It's from 2012 so some of you may have already seen it, but I just came across it today. It's not strictly about fanfiction, or Harry Potter, it's about working in the arts in general, but I hope I'm allowed to post this. I've been feeling stressful about working on my fic recently and watching this video cheered me up a bit.

Good luck to everyone, whether you're a veteran or just starting your first fic, and remember - enjoy it!


** This has given me the courage to write my gender fluid MoD!Harry Godlike!Harry Dark!Harry Harem hurt/comfort/angst fic that will shake the world to its foundations.

**** generally that's a list of things that will make me skip a fic if I see it in the description. "shake the X to its foundations" is a common crapline to see in a description. hurt/comfort and angst are something I don't care for because for the most part those are teenager problems and I don't care what a bunch of kids think.

Either the world was built on sand or you have multiple nuclear warheads.

*** Okay, took me longer than I'd like to admit to realise what this meant. I don't have to clarify that I'm in no way breaking rule number 4, right?

**** I don't think so. I just thought it was funny that you were posting about Gaiman and your username matches. Neverwhere is my favorite of his.
