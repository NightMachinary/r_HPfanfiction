Harry is a good dude and he helps people out. Later, at or near the end of the fic, a group of people go around and say how Harry helped them (e.g., The Twins mention how Harry have them 1000 galleons, Ginny mentions how Harry saved her from Tom, etc.) in a touching, cathartic moment.

I can't think or any examples from the HP fandom, but some similar concepts are the movies /Seven Pounds/ and /Pay it Forward/.
