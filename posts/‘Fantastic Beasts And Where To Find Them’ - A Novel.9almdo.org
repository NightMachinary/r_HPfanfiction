** I'd be on board for it. The main issue I can see is that some of the creative choices of the film might not translate well into a novel.

** As long as you bring something new to it. New sub plots, interesting characters, new ideas and themes, then go for it. But if all you're doing is writing down the events as they happen in the film then it seems to me to be creatively a waste of time. Spend your energy on creating something really new.
