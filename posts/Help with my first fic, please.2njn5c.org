** How I would write it - make of it what you will.

--------------

“Harry!," Ron barked, "Harry! Wake up you lazy git!”

Harry moaned in his sleep, Ron was having none of it, and threw his dirty shirt in Harry's face, “Harry get up!”

Harry shot up from his slumber at the violation, his hair a messy black mop and glasses askew he stared bewildered at Ron, some drool escaping the corner of his mouth.

He gave Ron a withering look, his eyes promising unending torments for the method of his waking.

“We're going to be late for class," Ron explained meekly, "...hurry up and get dressed?” said Ron as he began to search for his left sock.

“What,” said Harry looking at the clock on the wall of the dormitory. “Whoa! Geez- Bollocks! Why didn't you wake me up sooner?!” Harry muttered in frustration.

“Oh I don't bloody well know /Harry/," Ron shot back mockingly, "...maybe because I just woke up as well,” Ron's voice cracked with a surge of frustration, “Honestly mate, how are you the chosen one?” he said whilst shaking his head, a small smile tugging at his lips.

Harry began frantically slipping on his robes and throwing his feet into his shoes (forgoing his socks) and was just about to proclaim his readiness when he suddenly realized that something was missing.

Something important.

His lifeline.

His /wand!/

Harry frantically patted down the pockets of his robes and whipped his head around toward the chest at the end of his bed in search of it to no avail.

“What's wrong with you,” asked Ron, “You look like a ruddy barn owl moving your head like that.”

Harry suddenly jerked his head upward at Ron with honest panic in his eyes.

“Ron," he said slowly, "/...where's/ my wand?”

“Your what? - your wand? You sleep with it /under your pillow/, you tool." Ron answered jokingly.

In answer Harry picked up his pillow and flung it on the floor with enough force the feathered cushioning blew apart, peppering the carpet and their robes in small white feathers.

“My wand Ron, my wand!” Harry near-screamed, eyes bulging in fear.

"Accio wand! Accio /wand!/ ACCIO-/BLOODY/-WAND!" He roared, waving his hands around his head insanely, hoping it would increase the spells' effect. His panic-infused magic such that half the room looked to be ensnared in his rushed spell, and within a half-second the contents of the entire room looked to have erupted, no semblance of order or tidiness remained.

Harry ran around the boy's dormitory in a frantic search for his lost lifeline; under his bed, in his trunk, underneath dirty robes, nothing. Just as he was about to give up his search he saw something out of the corner of his eye; a small, pale pink shoe-heel disappear through the doorway of the dormitory down the stairs to the common room.

Hoping beyond hope he flung an arm out and emitted an incoherent cry of rage, his fist clenched to get /any/ hold of whoever had fled; in response the dormitory door slammed shut so powerfully it cracked down the middle; looking like a mountain troll had tried to run it through.

Harry shot to the door, trying to pry it open with his bare hands - down the stairs he could hear some people shouting. When he breached the doorway he turned just in time to catch the barest glimpse of the the possible thief as they turned right to go down the stairs after they got past the Fat Lady.

/How did we not see him?!/ Harry fumed, /He had to have been in the bloody room with us the entire bloody time!/

“What'd you run in here for,” mumbled Ron as he stuffed a pumpkin pasty from last nights' feast into his mouth behind Harry.

“Ron!," Harry spluttered, /how can he not understand the seriousness of this?!/ "Someone just /stole my wand!/" he fumed, "Do you remember how shite you felt when you snapped yours in the Ford Anglia /incident?/"

Ron's eyes bugged slightly - likely more remembering the howler he got from his mum than anything else.

"...Only a Gryffindor could have let them in..." Ron mouthed, "/Or.../- It was a Gryffindor who took it - who else would know where you keep your wand?”

Ron pretended not to notice the glance Harry sent his way.

"I don't mean to go all-Hermione on you," Ron admitted sheepishly, "but can't we just go to McGonagall?"

Mutely agreeing, they left he common room together (Harry feverishly asking if anyone there recognized the thief: /No/).

As they walked the cold stone halls of the castle, Harry realized just how helpless a wizard actually /was/ when they don't have a wand to fall back on. Almost by instinct he was checking corners for a Slytherin ambush.

/McGonagall will know what to do,/ was his mantra with each footfall.

Another thought entered his mind unbidden; /His/ wand was the only thing that saved him from Voldemort...

Unnoticed by all except the portraits, the Boy-Who-Lived cowered behind his friend.

#+begin_quote
  the first fictional piece of literature I have written
#+end_quote

I've heard it said that every writer has a million words of crud to get through before they can write anything decent. I've also tried reading stuff I wrote a few weeks previous and flinched back in horror.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry! Harry! Hey, wake up you lazy git,” Ron yelled as he threw on his robes, “Harry get up!”
#+end_quote

'Yelled' goes best with an exclamation. "Harry! Harry!" Ron yelled as he threw on his robes.

#+begin_quote
  "Hey, wake up you lazy git."
#+end_quote

Typically insert a comma here: "Hey, wake up, you lazy git."

#+begin_quote
  as he threw on his robes, “Harry get up!”
#+end_quote

Runon sentence. Period instead of comma. You have a habit of doing that. You can get away with it sometimes, but it takes experience to tell where. Also, you're having Ron yell a lot without anything else. It's a little suboptimal. I'd shorten the yelling or put in more action in between.

#+begin_quote
  Harry shot up from his stone like slumber,
#+end_quote

You're unlikely to go from stone-cold slumber (which is perhaps the expression you were thinking of?) to full alertness. But if you do so, you're likely to do so at the first stimulus of a given type and magnitude. Given the order of narration, Ron was yelling for a solid five seconds, during which Harry didn't wake; at the end of it, Harry awoke suddenly. It's possible that Ron had been calling softly at first and then broke into full volume at the last bit, but you didn't say that.

#+begin_quote
  Harry frantically patted down the pockets of his robes and whipped his head around toward the chest at the end of his bed in search of what he was missing but, what was it?
#+end_quote

Build up to a panic. In this case, he's missing something; he should be confused first, then he should search determinedly, then he should panic not earlier than fifteen seconds after starting the search.

Skipping on a bit for brevity.

#+begin_quote
  “Ron, someone stole my wand. Let's go.”
#+end_quote

"Let's go"? That phrasing suggests he's off to breakfast with everyone else. It does not seem like an appropriate response.

#+begin_quote
  /I have got to get my wand back/
#+end_quote

Right. And he'll get to his first class of the day -- Transfiguration, let's say -- and have to tell McGonagall that he's missing his wand, at which point her eyes will bulge in shock that anyone would misplace their wand, then summon a house elf to find it, or use a summoning charm, or whatnot, and if it's not immediately forthcoming she'll either contact Ollivander and get him a replacement, or scrounge up an heirloom wand that will work well enough for him to complete class.

Pretty much immediately, it's someone else's problem. So you have two options: either the professors are incompetent and Harry manages to get his wand back first (which is supporting the traditions set in place by canon), or the professors are competent and resolve the problem using readily available spells that Harry &co haven't learned yet. I'd expect Neville or some even worse schlemazel had lost their wand in the murky depths of Hogwarts many times before. There must be some way to deal with it.

I suppose you could put this as starting on the weekend to give Harry some extra time before professors find out about it. It would also help if not everyone were in the room when Harry discovered his wand was missing -- less likely that Seamus or Dean or Neville will contact a helpful professor, more time for foolhardy antics.

** Harry seems a bit out of character.

Hard to really criticize when there's like 100 words though. I can only suggest you work on your aversion for question marks.

“Harry! Harry! Hey, wake up, you lazy git,” Ron yelled as he threw on his robes. “Harry, get up!”

Harry shot up from his stone-like slumber, hair a messy black mop and glasses askew as he stared at his dorm mate in bewilderment.

“We're going to be late for class, hurry up and get dressed,” Ron told him as he began to search for his left sock.

“What...?” said Harry looking at the clock on the wall of the dormitory. “Whoa! Why didn't you wake me up sooner?”

“Oh, I don't bloody know, Harry, maybe because I just woke up as well!” Ron's voice cracked with a surge of frustration. “Honestly, mate, how are /you/ the Chosen One?”

Harry began slipping on his robes and shoes and was just about to proclaim his readiness when he suddenly realized that something was missing. He frantically patted down the pockets of his robes and whipped his head around toward the chest at the end of his bed in search of what was absent -- but what was it?

“What's wrong with you?” asked Ron. “You look like a ruddy barn owl moving your head like that.”

Harry suddenly jerked his head upward at his friend with a look of fear in his eyes. “Ron, where's my wand?”

“Your /what/?”

“My wand, Ron, my wand!” Harry was screaming now as he ran around the boy's dormitory in a frantic search for his lost possession. Under his bed, in his trunk, under some dirty robes -- nothing. Just as he was about to give up his search, he saw something out of the corner of his eye: a small, pale pink colored foot disappeared through the doorway of the dormitory into the common room.

“Hey!” shouted Harry. He began to chase after the mystery man, but when he reached the doorway the supposed thief was nowhere to be seen, and no evidence as to where he had gone. How had he missed him? He had been so distracted with Ron's attempts to get him out of bed for class, he had never even noticed there was a thief in the room!

“What'd you run in here for?” mumbled Ron as he stuffed a pumpkin pasty from last night's feast into his mouth behind Harry.

“Ron, someone stole my wand. Let's go.”

Harry began to head towards the door of the common room and into the halls of Hogwarts. "I have got to get my wand back," he thought. Only problem was, he had no idea who or what had taken it.
