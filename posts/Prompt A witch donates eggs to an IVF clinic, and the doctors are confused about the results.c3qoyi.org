** Honestly, if wizards really wanted to get a leg up on Muggles, replacing all the donated sperm and eggs with 'wizard/witch/ genetic material and having a huge baby boom would be a good start. Granted, it would have to be a dark witch/wizard running this operation who was willing to play the long game and who wasn't all about the blood purity...

*** There is a fanfic about that linkffn(12327848). It seems abandoned and it didn't get to the interesting part (i think, i've read only a bit of it).

But honestly, it's a wonder noone did something like that. Pureblood supremacy is really a moronic and self-entitled ideology of the wealthy elitists, but i'm pretty certain that any aspiring dark-lord with any common sense would come up with something better - after all, why pit a wizard against a wizard when you can pit a wizard against a muggle? You wouldn't be even technically lying if you convinced them that they are better and more worthy than those without magic.

Magical Supremacy FTW.

And cosidering that a relationship between a wizard and a muggle tend to result in wizards you could replace the whole population of earth with only magical people in a few generations. From a certain perspective, it could be even considered a morally upstanding endevour.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** I had that as a possible post-endgame for my current work:

#+begin_quote
  Around 2010, Minerva alerts Harry that Hogwarts is being suffused by a spate of vision-impaired Muggleborns with messy black hair. A bit of investigation and it turns out that fertility clinics across the UK accepted donations from an anonymous contributor. Profile read: "Black hair, green eyes, 5' 11", Twelve stone; might have gone pro rugby but instead joined law-enforcement; IQ 125 and a certain something special." Once this donor's sperm had been used, it became obvious to the clinicians that it was exceptionally fertile stock- every client got pregnant at first try, often with twins. It became the defacto choice for those with IVR difficulties. The source was identified as Polter, Frank
