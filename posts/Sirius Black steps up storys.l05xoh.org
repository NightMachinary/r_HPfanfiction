I'm looking for storys where Sirius steps up and takes on the responsibilities of godfather. I am ok with Harry originally going to the dursleys (In fact i probably would injoy it better if he did). I'm looking for storys where Sirius makes it harder (or impossible) for Dumbledore to send harry to his death.


** Linkao3(A Marauders Plan by Catsarecool) this is exactly what you are looking for. Warning it is a Harmony story and only book 4.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

** linkffn(innocent by MarauderLover7) - the setup for this story is that cannon is essentially the same until Harry is 8, which is when Sirius breaks out and comes to see him. Things progress from there, and the series is currently in the equivalent of Harry's fourth year at hogwarts and is very consistently updating. It's an absolutely wonderful story, specifically with a strong Sirius & Harry relationship. Couldn't recommend it more

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  After a few too many hard knocks in early childhood, magic has turned Harry into a tough, twisted, somewhat impaired and very ugly version of himself with a severe speech defect.Magic is also going to help him learn how to kick everybody's backside.(This story has a lot of very short chapters and is posted daily.)

** Linkffn(A Second Chance by Breanie) - this one is popular with Hinny and Remadora fans. It's an absolute monster at 2254k+ words, and still counting. (No, I didn't add an extra two.) Because it's so long, I haven't finished it, so I'm not sure what happens with Dumbledore, but there's some Sirius and Remus co-parenting and dealing with Harry's trauma after rescuing him from the Dursleys. Also on ao3.

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
