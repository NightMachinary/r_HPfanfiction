Hey guys. I have an odd request. Id like to read a fic that has Harry Potter teaching. I dont care what he is teaching, be it Transfiguration or anything. I read what there is of 0800 rent a hero. linkffn(11160991) I love the concept. I just want to read about how harry would teach Id prefer 50k plus words. Simply so I dont blow through it in under an hour. Thanks!


** linkffn(2477165) is a ridiculous take on how Harry might teach if he was more like James and Sirius and less like Harry.

(It's the second in a trilogy, following [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s//1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where In The World is Harry Potter]], which is also ridiculous, but they're both well written. I can't remember if I read the third one, but nonjon is a good writer so I recommend their works.)

It's probably not what you were asking for, but hey. They're entertaining stories.

*** Having read all three, the third is just as good as the other two. The series is completely unrealistic in terms of Harry's power/abilities, but this allows it to focus on making the rest of the story hilarious, though it is internally consistent, and at times, in my opinion, quite clever. To be honest, while I haven't read a whole lot of works that featured Nicholas Flamel as anything other than the mysterious maker of the Philosipher's stone, this story has, in my opinion, the best portrayal of him. I'd also say that while the Harry in this trilogy definitely isn't canon, it isn't an unrealistic portrayal considering all that is supposed to have happened to him that didn't in canon

I will say though, that you ABSOLUTELY NEED to read Where in the World is Harry Potter linkffn(2354771) first. This is a series that for multiple reasons is even better the second time around, and one of the reasons for this is only revealed near the end of the first story and the second treats it as old news, understandably.

It's a great series, but yeah it isn't what you are specifically asking for. Unfortunately, I can't think of anything not already mentioned in the thread

** I find that most stories that feature Harry as a professor are badly written, for one reason or another.

Here's one that I remember being quite enjoyable (but it's been a while since I've read it, and my fanfiction tastes used to be shit, so I can't vouch for its quality):

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconias features Harry as a teacher at Beauxbatons. However, it is less teachery than 0800 Rent-A-Hero and more Harry/Gabi romance. However it is still a fairly good story.

Obviously, these are slim offerings. The first one is very short, and the second is still a WIP. But I think the second one totally counts? I really like it so far, honestly, and I can't wait for the next update.
