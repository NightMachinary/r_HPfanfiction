I used to hate x-over fics then I ended up reading a hp/xmen slash fic and a few others. Now I'm looking for some good ones.

I would like longer fics but not a requirement Slash is ok, not really a fan of femslash


** As a request, this is very broad. Narrowing it down to a secondary genre would help, like these scifi/space requests (not all are crossovers): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4qtads/lf_hp_scifi_fics/][scifi]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4l5b6z/request_harry_goes_to_space_fics/][space]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xe42j/request_looking_for_fics_with_a_magical_exodus/][exodus]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3pl0tq/romanceharem_space_crossovers_with_a_superharry/][superHarry in space]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4t7lac/lf_fics_where_harry_has_a_space_ship_cause_why_not/][spaceship]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/524g62/looking_for_fics_similar_to_space_haven_by_esama/][space haven]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4epzyu/spacecrossover_haremmulti_pairings/][harem in space]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/29k55u/space/][space?]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/55f0gz/looking_for_good_fics_where_harry_readswatches/][influenced by sci-fi]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1tbx82/scifi_hp_fiction/][Sci-Fi]]

These threads asked for something a little different (vaguely oldest to newest): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3kvjn3/request_crossovers_with_more_conventional/][conventional fantasies]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3lfb32/obscure_crossover_fics/][obscure]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zdqhh/crossovers_that_do_something_unique_and_original/][unique & original]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4kbdfj/rare_hp_crossovers_in_that_there_are_only_a/][small fandom]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4pl472/lf_slice_of_life_crossovers/][slice of life]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4h7tij/lf_harry_centric_crossovers_that_were_not_marked/][unmarked crossovers]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4smau8/crossovers_that_arent_tagged_as_crossovers/][untaged crossovers]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4w0okq/request_lf_obscure_crossovers/][obscure 2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4zg6u1/hp_crossovers/][Hermione centric]]

This might also be worth reading (some recs too): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/50d9et/discussion_what_are_your_favorite_booksmoviesetc/][discussion of what makes a good crossover]]

If you want a specific fandom to cross with, search this thread for it. If nothing there catches your eye, maybe make another, more specific request.

A decent HP/Buffy crossover, probably the best of the lot (not that the bar is really high...). Completed.

linkffn(4388682)

By the same author, HP/X-Men. This was actually really, really good. I sometimes feel bitter he hasn't updated since 2011.

linkffn(2452681)

HP/Hellraiser. I won't say anything about this except the atmosphere is masteryfully set. My 2nd favorite Ruskbyte fic.

linkffn(8501689)

HP/Star Wars. Sort of lighthearted, entertaining fic. I love this, to a large part thanks to the hilarious HK-47 dialogue.

Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. (Ongoing, regular updates)

** I enjoy avatar linkffn(9622291) and haven't really seen any of Von's stuff linked here. She's taken a rather long break, but does periodically reach out and has told me that she's planning to finish this story in particular. What's there is good.

linkffn(8957424) Illusions of Grandeur- HP/Supernatural crossover. Snarky, sarcastic Harry. Just how I like him. This one is complete, with the sequel getting sporadic updates.

linkffn(9796094) Enharmonic Interval - Author seems to have succumbed to bullying on ffn and fallen out of fanfiction, which is a shame. This is an Avengers crossover done differently. What's there is good, and worth a read.
