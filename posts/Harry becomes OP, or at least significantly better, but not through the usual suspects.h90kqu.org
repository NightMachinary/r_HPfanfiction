By usual suspects I mean him going into Gringotts and coming out inheriting half the Wizengamot. Then training in the RoR each afternoon and moping the floor with Dumbledore within a year.

I feel like Potterverse magic is one that just lends itself so well to OP characters. So I'm looking for fics with Harry, or any other MC/OC/SI that takes advantage of that. Legilimency to copy someone's decades of experience into their brain. Potions. Rituals for better memory. Rituals for stronger, faster body. Rituals for stronger magic. Legal/Fiscal loopholes. Raiding the Muggle world for wealth. Just taking advantage of every possible application of Magic that we irl would spot from a mile away, but the actual wizard society seems oblivious to.

Plot or pairings don't really matter, though, the longer it is, the better.


** linkffn(Barefoot) has Harry with the power of psychometry, which means he can completely understand the history of an inanimate object by touching it. This includes wands. The result is similar to your Legilimency idea.

linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) looks to be shaping up to end up with an OP Harry, but he still regularly loses his practice duels. He learns to do magic previously thought impossible because no one bothered(or in one case avoided telling) him it was supposed to be impossible.

  Harry has the ability to learn the history of any object he touches, whether he wants to or not.

** I'm thinking of "combine a ton of infinite water bottles and magic fuelless flames to build a bunch of unlimited impulse steam rockets, stick them to asteroids and hold the world hostage for a hundred billion galleons"

I'm not sure if the wizarding world has any kind of defense against a few hundred tons of inert rocks traveling at half a percent c after a week of acceleration. Most magic seems to rely on wizards with human response times hitting the target with a spell, and good luck doing that to something at a thousand kilometers per second.

Alternative strategy for a redo fic: Visit Jeff in 1994 with a hundred grand of investment money and some compulsion charms and wait a few decades until those Amazon shares are worth more than the GDP of the entire wizarding world.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13356023/1/Voleur-D-%C3%A2me]]) Si is inserted into Ron the night of the champion selection While it's not said outright other than for specific spells or rituals the Mc and Harry take a similar path to power as grindlewald and dumbledore did There are a few parts that make me cringe but otherwise the fic is great

  A soul from our world is thrown into the body of Ron Weasley in the exact moment that Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. Teenage hormones, dark lords, and missing memories is a hell of a combination. SI
