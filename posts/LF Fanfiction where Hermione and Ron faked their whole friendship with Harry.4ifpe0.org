**** /Lord Hadrian Potter-Black strode into the Great Hall, emerald orbs glowing and swirling with power, after spending his summer holidays in his time-dilated trunk in the vaults of Gringotts. Over the summer, he had uncovered his friends' betrayals and Dumbles' manipulations, and was on a warpath to show Magical Britain who he really was./

/"Dumbles! I am Lord Hadrian Potter-Black, and I demand a private suite for residence at Hogwarts! I, Lord Hadrian Potter-Black swear that I will never spend another moment with my so called 'friends' again! So mote it be!" exclaimed Lord Hadrian Potter-Black, as he raised his phoenix feather wand in his right hand and his basilisk venom wand in his left hand; after all, he knew the oath would be doubly effective if he swore it with two wands./

/"My boy, I am afraid that for the Greater Good and the Lesser Good and my Personal Good, I cannot allow that," twinkled Albus Dumbledore, the founder of the Order of the Phoenix, and proponent of all things Light™./

/But Lord Hadrian Potter-Black knew better than to fall for the grandfatherly persona put upon by the real Dark Lord of Britain! "DumDum! I, Lord Hadrian Potter-Black, do claim the Lordship of Gryffindor, and evict you as Headmaster from my castle! ^{^{so}} ^{^{mote}} ^{^{it}} ^{^{be!}}/

/Over by the Gryffindor table, Hermione Granger watched as her source of mon- her friend singlehandedly brought down years and years of manipulations set up by the greatest wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore. "Harry," she shrieked, "how could you accuse the headmaster of such a thing! He's the Leader of the Light©!"/

/Ron Weasley simply sat there, stuffing his face with food, as his brain was too small to comprehend listening and eating at the same time. "What did you say 'Mione? I couldn't understand you over this piece of chicken."/

/The newly crowned Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor turned to the two he once considered his best friends. "Granger! Weasley! Don't you dare talk to me anymore! I know Dumbles has been paying both of you with money from my trust vault, as well as giving you books written by my ancestors, and giving the Weasel food cooked by the Potter house-elves!" exclaimed Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor. He knew, however, that the books were sealed by blood by his ancestors and could only be opened by a Potter (disregarding all theories about DNA passed down from parent to child), and had also started to poison the food that was sent to the Weasel./

/The Great Hall gasped at these revelations, and many a child could be seen writing these facts down to send to the Daily Prophet. Unbeknownst to them, Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor was the majority shareholder of the Daily Prophet, as well as other Muggle companies such as Apple, Google, and the Trump Foundation./

/Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor smirked (as he was embracing his Slytherin qualities that had been dulled by his 'friends'), and proclaimed "I, Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor, through right of conquest, claim the Lordship of Slytherin, and cast out Tom Marvolo Riddle from the line of Slytherin! ^{^{^{so}}} ^{^{^{mote}}} ^{^{^{it}}} ^{^{^{fucking}}} ^{^{^{be!}}}/

/All the Slytherin males who were undoubtedly Dark and Evil (as opposed to Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin, who was Dark but not Evil), fell to the ground in pain while their arms with the Dark Mark shriveled up and their magic was torn from their body. Ronald Weasley also fell to the ground in pain, as he had recently been lured to the Dark with promises of Dark-magic-infused food. The Slytherin girls, seeing this, all turned their eyes to Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin hungrily, as he had started to exhibit Slytherin qualities./

/Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin then shouted "Hedwig!", and a Royal Phoenix who was more royal and more pure and more phoenixy than Fawkes burst into the Great Hall in an explosion of light that was wondrous and awe-inspiring (except for the first year Muggleborn in Hufflepuff who had undiagnosed epilepsy and fell to the ground convulsing). "Take me to Gringotts, where I can conveniently enact the many marriage contracts that none of my ancestors took up, so that I may form a harem!"/

/--Epilogue--/

/Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin lived in peace for the rest of his days, marrying over 15 women and taking their titles as well, for they did not have male heirs to continue their lines. Indeed, the only evil he had to fight was the tax office, as his name never fit on their documents, and so he was forced to deal with them year after year. ^{^{^{^{so}}}} ^{^{^{^{fucking}}}} ^{^{^{^{mote}}}} ^{^{^{^{it}}}} ^{^{^{^{fucking}}}} ^{^{^{^{be!}}}}/

***** It's still too few titles. Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Peverell-Emrys sounds about right. Only basilisk venom? Gotta throw some thestral tail hair and bones of a dragon in there too! Also the venom is liquid, so it should've dissolved his wand. It did not, clearly because he is so special. Great one-shot though!

****** There are so many tropes in HP fanfiction that a decent writer could probably bang out a 40k word fic about trope-bashing with ease; even in my attempt up there I missed out on themes like the magical core and how it is able to be bound, the blocking of wills, the manipulation of Tom Riddle into a dark lord by Dumbledore, and especially, the WBWL.

******* Yeah definitely. At Gringotts he greets the goblins with respect - of course he's the only one to do so in a few thousand years. Naturally the goblins now worship the ground he walks on. They see that evil!Dumbles blocked 90% of his magic and all of his 30 special abilities, like parseltongue, his phoenix animagus form, his elemental abilities and many more (I do so love these listings). After removing his magical block, his core grows three times the size and he spends 5 years training in a time-dilated room. Of course he finds out that his parents are still alive and that he has a twin brother that's apparently called the-boy-who-lived. Of course all three are absolute cockpunchers; and so he plans to enact his vengeance.

A lot of them are terrible, but that one speaks to the darkest most annoyed parts of my goddamned soul. Most of the time the big tropes get an eye roll but that one means I instantly close the tab.

******* Honestly, I might actually TRY to write a trope topia of fics - ever since I started taking a certain medication (that I cannot be off of) I've had...aphasia? of a sort. I used to write and write, but now words are like molasses, I can't find the right words for the right sentences, and my structure is frequently backwards. I sound like a ESL speaker sometimes, not there anything wrong with that. But maybe doing ALL THE TROPES or at least a lot could help me write again. And at least in a semi non parody way. Besides, those dumb fics are a guilty pleasure read of mine.

****** Where the hell does Emrys come from? I've seen it around, but it's not in canon. One story I read used it as a surname for Merlin, but they spelled his name with a bunch of extra Y's and D's (I think it was Myrddin or something), but I didn't get very far into it before giving up.

That's Latin, not English. The English translation would be Merlin the Divine (or Immortal, but I've seen Divine more often). Myrddin probably translates as something too, but I'm not even prepared to pretend I know anything about Welsh. Pretending to know Latin is easy by comparison.

It's from his perspective and is told mostly through flashbacks during the final battle, after Dumbledore (who's also manipulative) dies. Hermione stays loyal, though.
