I'm the kind of reader who always finds his way back to what are oft seen as pretty middle of the road action adventure fics, especially crossovers. The kind im sure we all know about, with a Harry trained in swordsmanship and battle magic, training in the courtyard in the early mornings, leaving Hogwarts post fourth/fifth year to fight in skirmishes, or even post Hogwarts fics where he ends up invading another series as a new protagonist. Sometimes even pre Hogwarts where he comes to the school AS another series protagonist new identity and personality in tow.

I just tend to prefer a Harry who looks at his abilities and sees adventure in his future rather than law enforcement or who is forced into it and finds hes just really good at it, especially when the magical world is played more fantastical and 'wild' where adventuring could be a legitimate profession.

Mystic Knight Online, Harry Potter: Geth, Magic Online, Harry potter and the Sun Source, The Witcher: Emerald Dragon, even Make A Wish though its more comedy focused than the others. These are all some of my favorite fics and have some of that spark im looking for. Harry in a new environment, with new skills and on a path of adventure not strictly leading solely towards his fight with Voldemort.

So please give me something to sink my teeth into. Battle Mage Harry, Swordsman, Shonen Anime protag, Devil May Care(Cry) Badass, New world:New Adventure, ANYTHING! Just so long as it's a fun romp with a competent combatant Harry!


** Some more recommendations:

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) features a Harry skilled at strategy and combat in an Enders-game scenario. There are political plays but they are very reasonable from what you'd expect teenagers in an Enders-game scenario to do. Fast-paced combat where Harry is the star of the show, with both internal psychological and physical real-life struggles to match. This Harry is less adventurous than you're looking for but always looking forward to his next challenge - a thirst for competition rather than adventure. There are a few moments here where he wavers and ponders whether it's all worth it, however. Might not be for you.

The linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) is the most beautiful HP AU I have ever read. Alexandra does not have the same combat prowess as the Harry's I've come across elsewhere here but this trilogy captures like no other the feeling of adventure I had when first reading the HP originals. Might not be what you're looking for exactly, but it has adventure in spades.

linkffn(Magics of the Arcane) features a mentor-Dumbledore guiding a Harry with a thirst for power and adventure. Some excellent combat here, and like others, goes far beyond the grounds of Hogwarts.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) features a competent protagonist with a flair for adventure, for it's all he knows how to do. The characterization in this fic is beyond top-notch and is one of the only ones that has brought me to tears in the most unexpected manner. It doesn't try to make you feel. It just does, and the combat and adventures are great. Might be less of what you're looking for, but it's similar to the Alexandra Quick series I mentioned earlier in kindling that hard-to-capture feeling of adventure.

----

linkffn(Emperor), however, deserves a special mention. This is a fic in which Harry starts from a lowly station in an attempt to reign supreme over all. And by god, it is believable. The politics in this fic are incredibly realistic, the political acrobatics even more so. This is a web of intrigue and combat and mystery, and it will draw you in. This is Harry going up against the most formidable of enemies, internally and externally, in politics and combat. The Harry here grows political acumen and uses amazing combat prowess to steamroll his enemies. It's great. I've never come across a fic so realistic. You really feel like there's no plot armor here, you feel like it's the real deal. This is a Harry that craves power and will do anything in his vast arsenal to overcome the massive challenges ahead of him to obtain it.

*** Ill have to give these a shot, though funnily enough most of these actually hit more of my turnoffs for fics aside from Magics of the Arcane.

Slytherin Harry, OC, OC, and Political, all aspects i tend to avoid in fanfiction. Not saying i wont be giving them their fair shake, but i got a chuckle from the Irony ya'know?

Though i will say D20 has been on my radar for a while now as a D&D player. Not having Harry as the main character was the only thing that made me hesitate.

It's a bit weird that some of these fics go recommended. A Slytherin and/or political Harry doesn't exactly scream "Lust for adventure" to me. Seeking out adventure is kinda the antithesis to a Slytherin mindset.

** You will absolutely love the following three trilogies:

linkffn(Sword of the Hero) is regarded by many as the most epic fic in all of HPFF, where the epicness really picks up in the second book

linkffn(Wastelands of Time) is very similar to the Harry in Sword of the Hero. The action here is a bit faster and leaner, closer to Earth, but still exhilarating.

linkffn(Denarian Renegade) is a fairly epic trilogy with a wide AU reaching into Dresden Files (but requires no knowledge of Dresden to get into, everything is explained from scratch). Has some of the most intriguing character ideas I've come across and has the same fast-paced combat with this “grunge” sort of feeling to it that you'll find in Wastelands.

All of these are excellent trilogies.

- I haven't found any book or movie, both in fanfiction or outside of it, that comes anywhere close to Sword of the Hero's sheer shock and awe scale. It's worth reading for anyone mildly interested in combat.

- Wastelands of Time has more of a mystery feeling to it and is quite a fun read.

- Denarian Renegade starts with an asshole-ish Harry whose personality becomes quite endearing once you recognize it for the defense mechanism it is

All of these feature a ridiculously competent combat Harry whose challenges scale to his abilities. He's no Gary Stu and will not stroll through his challenges. It's always close and he always suffers. It's really fun to read through.

*** Thanks for the leads! I definately wasn't expecting a trilogy let alone 3. And they all do look interesting just the introduction of Wastelands was enough to hook me. And though iv never been able to start reading the Dresden series i have always had an interest in it, partially because i play dnd (also why i adore fics like these) and that series gets thrown around so much in the community.

Definitely looking forward to binging these.

** I can't remember how it starts but I remember this one having tonnes of adventure. Harry joins Bill Weasley in South America to learn curse breaking and combat. It has a bit of a Tomb Raider vibe. I enjoyed it immensely but I haven't read it in a while so I can't remember a lot of the plot points but I know he gets trained by hit wizards while there.\\

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** linkffn(Identity by highbrass) I say this story is Make a Wish taken as seriously as you could take Harry Potter in the Mid to late 00's, some Harry Playing Butt Rock and dyeing his hair A LOT of dumb pop culture references or super dumb items popping up but it's adventuring for the sake of adventuring which is what your looking for.

Unfortunately the type of stories your looking for are seemingly rare, I should know I love the same kind of stories as well and have pitched a challenge that no one seems interested in, where Harry ends up in To Love Ru in what was his 'Vacation' in reality he had moved to Sainan to flee the English magical world (English Speaking as much as the island) he gets caught up in Rito and Lala's problems and ends up being told to act as Lala's Bodyguard by Gid and keep her from being taken by any of the other Suitors or earth will be destroyed. The joke being that none of Rito's Harem which makes up so much of the female cast of the show, ever entertain the thought of Harry as Boyfriend material so Harry spends the story kicking Suitors asses and trying to actually get a serious date that isn't secretly into Rito, looking to Kill him or Rito or is trying to make Lala Jealous.

  Secrets are discovered. Alliances are forged. Battle lines are drawn. Some friendships strengthen while others break. The war has started. A friend and a Godfather have already been taken away from him. No longer will he stand for the manipulations!

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

*** So, basically, Witcher Harry without his magic? OR as good as someone like Dumbledore? What's the point of a crossover, then?
