Dumbledore has tasked Filch with cleaning his office, but due to the many volatile magics on and in the room, the entire thing has to be cleaned the muggle way. No problem, Dumbledore thinks, Filch is a squib, who should know how to clean without any magic.

Except Filch is a lazy bastard who prefers to have the students do his job for him in 'detentions'.

This is how Draco Malfoy ends up having to clean Dumbledore's office with 'filthy muggle objects'. Knowing nothing about chemicals, Draco ends up mixing bleach and ammonia while trying to clean the floor. He doesn't know that he just made mustard gas, but he knows that the gas rapidly filling the room is making his eyes and throat burn, so he casts a bubblehead charm. Filch is not so lucky, and begins coughing up blood as he ingests the mustard gas.

After only a minute, the deadly chemicals have escaped Dumbledore's office and begin to funnel throughout the school.


** It is funny, just technical nitpick ... by mixing bleach with ammonia you get pure chlorine, which is poisonous of course (it was used for military purposes as well), but it is not a mustard gas (aka yperite) and it doesn't have the same blistering effects.

*** Fuck. My parents always told me bleach and ammonia made mustard gas. Sorry about that.

**** Yes, chlorine is poisonous too, and it has been used as the first [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I][poisonous battle gas]], because it is incredibly easy to procure, but it is very light, so it can be dispersed easily and it evaporates quite quickly. It is also lethal only in very high concentration.

So, the mustard gas (and even before that phosgene, which was actually more lethal) has been developed. Its fame is only because it is much more effective: it is quite heavier than air, so it doesn't get dispersed so easily, and even in small concentration, it is quite effective (although not that lethal, it more incapacitated enemy then killed them outright). However, it is much more complicated to create (and costly). Also, for long time its only use was a chemical weapon (comparing it to a chlorine which is used in zillion and one chemical compounds), and only recently somebody started to use it for a chemotherapy (but it says more about that treatment, that chemical weapons are used for that).

*** No you don't. Ammonia is a base. To get chlorine out of bleach, you need an acid. Ammonia reacts with the bleach to make chloramines, not chlorine.

Chloramines are toxic, but also if you're unlucky enough with the ratios you can make trichloramine, which is explosive. Pure chlorine is never explosive. If you mix ammonia and bleach in a fume hood, thinking it's safe because chlorine won't hurt you if it's made in a fume hood, the mixture might explode and embed glass shards in your hand.

**** OK, I made my explanation too simplistic (and possibly partially wrong), but my main point was that it is not a mustard gas (yperite).
