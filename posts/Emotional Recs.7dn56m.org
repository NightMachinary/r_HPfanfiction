Okay, I'm looking for lesser-known stories, yet amazing quality. I prefer dark and angst, but no romance unless it's het and an unusual pairing. I really want to read something that is poignant, that will give me feels. No major character deaths though. Thanks!


** A dark fic without romance, idk how well known it is though linkffn(2027554/1/In-Blood-Only) Does amazing and unknown fic exist, I wonder...

*** That depends entirely on what your definition of amazing is, even ignoring that people will exclude certain fics from that category due to genre or pairing. I mean, for example, linkffn(7413273) has a rather creative way of defeating Voldemort that I probably would have never thought of. But would I classify it as an amazing fic, or just an amazing one shot? No I personally wouldn't. But on the other hand the sheer amount of fiction written means there is bound to be stuff out there that I would enjoy that I am not aware of

**** What's the distinction here between fic and one-shot? I thought a one-shot was just a fic without chapters, usually less than 100K words. I never thought of one-shots as "just," as if they were somehow automatically less worthy as stories. Or am I misunderstanding what you mean in this context?

***** We have the same definition I think. I don't mean "just" as lesser necessarily, not in quality at least. But with the very rare exception, one-shots are a good deal shorter than full fics and as a consequence of this cover less territory, whether this be time, thematically, or even just less space to put jokes. So it is therefore necessary to recognize that a shorter piece is going to accomplish less, seem not quite as good even in some cases, to a piece that is of similar quality but is significantly longer, giving you more content that you like. The flip side of that is, in order to qualify as amazing, a full fic has to hold up to that standard for let's say 20/30 chapters maybe getting away with a few hiccups, while a one shot by definition only has to keep it up for one, though the margin of error is by consequence significantly smaller.

It's like a good poem vs a good novel, to some extent at least. Even if they both capture your mind, the novel will tend to capture it more so because there is so much more net

****** Ah, gotcha. I read far more one-shots than epic-length fic, partly because I incline toward ship fic and character studies rather than plotty adventure or rambling slice-of-life fics. Which is the opposite of my non-fannish tastes, where I rarely read short stories and usually have three or four novels going at once.

Apparently what I seek in fanfic is - at least most of the time - better condensed into a short form. Long works can be extremely detailed and absorbing, but the ones that satisfy me are few and far between. I haven't given a lot of thought to why, but it may be due to my preference for a more lyrical or language-conscious style. Long fics tend to have fairly straightforward prose as a general rule, and that sometimes wears down my interest. Also, characterization and pacing tend to suffer more in long works.

Anyway, sorry, I'm mumbling off on a tangent here. Thanks for the clarification.

******* I definitely appreciate fics that make consciousness and judicious use of language. Hell, right I have Romeo and Juliet on replay via audiobook not because of the plot (its a tale of lusty and ridiculously overemotional twats...I mean tweens) but because I absolutely fell in love with Romeo and Benvolio's discussion where Romeo waxes laconic about love and Rosaline.

While I tend to avoid ship-centric fics in general, my philosophy isn't really so much that short is bad. But more that if I like a work, I at least think it natural to want more of it. Take A Black Comedy for example. A fun romp that is a good length all on its own. But given the choice, would have say scenes of Riddlebottom and Harry at the Wizengamont or more interaction between Harry and his "alternate" relatives. Of course. Add in that at least half the time shorter length fics are just only partially completed and abandoned works rather than full works on their own, and my tendency is to avoid them as a rule unless the description really catches my eye or it is an author I recognize.

In regards to characterization and pacing, I mean intentionally limiting yourself to a one-short can be helpful as an author to reel you in sure, but bad characterization in a longer fic is because the author needs to work on that area, not because the work is longer. What /can/ happen is that characterization gets in the way of pacing and plot, and the longer the fic the more this disruption is magnified.

And maybe I'm a bit weird but I don't actually see that as a problem? The issue is most pronounced in SI or time travel fics and is especially prevalent in Naruto fics as well as Harry Potter (if you will excuse the digression) and the grandaddy of SI fics in that area is Dreaming of Sunshine. I supremely enjoy it, but it seems almost like clockwork you will get folks complaining either canon is being stuck to tpo closely, or it is sticking too long on content from filler episodes of the anime that many folks just skipped over because they don't actually change the plot of the main story. But to my mind, I like these characters, I like this world and I like seeing them interact. Why would I want to skip over some of it? I guess with fanfiction there is a little worry of a work being abandoned, and there are future events that I may look forward to sure, but given the choice of 20,000 words that I like and 50,000 words that I like, why wouldn't I take the latter? So to me pacing issues aren't not note-worthy so much as almost a benefit. Though again Im probably a bit off the reservation. I mean id be perfectly happy on a digression on way too in depth analysis like this bit I happened to write in a post a long time ago:

Despite the fact that Britain is a major power in the international community (admittedly mostly via Dumbledore, though the implied earlier magical history might contribute), Magical Britain was left on its own to almost break down into a condition not much better than the 90's Balkans with one side aiming to imitate 1994 Rwanda. Keep in mind that Magical Britain, via Dumbledore, essentially defeated the magical version of Hitler (in threat of taking over Europe, if not in policy) single-handedly, yet a couple of decades later this is how they are repaid? What happened that no one else offered aid, even in evacuation if not in military support? Keep in mind, even if you assume that Dumbledore didn't head up the ICW during the First Voldemort War, he would have been elected head less than 10 years after it had ended.

Sorry for the rambling. There's not exactly a lot of places to talk about this sort of thing

**** I'm in complete agreement with you. Fic amazing-ness is subjective. However what are the chances of someone reccing a fic they like - and that the OP will also like - being a hidden gem? Hahaha, to me the first sentence of the request sounds really funny.

And what's even going on with this post? People get downvoted left and right, the OP is nowhere in sight. Something is fishy here.

PS: the summary of 'The Power...' sounds really cracky.

** I really enjoyed linkffn(6782408)

It sorta has major character death? But it's within the first few chapters, not a huge build up to it. I would say here who it is so you can decide for yourself, but I'd rather not give any spoilers, even small ones. Pm me if you're interested and want to know who dies.

But it's based on recovering from child abuse, and is a Severitus.

Maybe it's not lesser known, exactly, but I don't see it recommended enough.

** Linkffn(Seeking Ginny be Casca) is probably the fic that evokes the most emotion in me. It's fantastic, and probably the best romance fic I've read in the HP genre. That said, it is Harry/Ginny, which you mentioned you didn't want. I will say that it was written before HBP, so Ginny's characterization is way different than in canon. She's basically an OC.

The other one I'd mention is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry by The Seeker]]. It's a story about caring for a child who suffered abuse in their past. It's actually quite touching. There's no romance in this at all.

Neither of these meet the specific details you requested, but both are extremely emotional and you would probably enjoy them if I read them. I think it's safe to say both of these fics make me cry every time. Hope you enjoy them.

** linkffn(1597664)

This is a Harry/Order drama. Although I'm not sure if drama is precise enough, it's closer to tragedy.

The basic premise is Harry being moved to Grimmauld place in the summer after fifth year; a deconstruction of the 'Harry barely lets earth shattering shit affect him' trope that is prevalent in canon. This Harry is /not/ okay after Sirius' death; he's angry, confused and sad almost to the point of the despair. The Order tries to help him; unfortunately they barely have a clue and continuously make things worse.

I don't normally like such stories, but this is unique, in that Harry isn't a doormat like usual and it's got /zing/. It pushes all my emotional buttons. And all the character voices have a twist of authenticity in them.

The author abandoned this before the Severitus part played any role in the plot - the last chapter is basically a summary of what she intended to do in later chapters. I think it's worth reading regardless - I read this back in 2004 and it's stayed with me to this day, one of those fics that for reason you never forget.
