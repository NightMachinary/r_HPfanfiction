I was wondering, what fan-fictions that take the books "serious" (as in: they don't do anything that contradicts them - maybe despite fixing world building flaws or contradictions) are the most well regarded? I'm curious as I just finished the books and I'm not ready yet to leave the HP-world ;)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]]: The first HP fanfic I finished reading. It's (obviously) Year 6 from Ginny's POV. I like it very much

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]: Another one from Ginny's POV, this time from Year 7. It's imho the most canon compliant fic about Hogwarts during that year

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]: Depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, from their Muggle neighbor's POV. It's my favorite postwar canon compliant fic. In fact, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][its author]] wrote a 85+ story series about the postwar world

*** I've started to read Strangers at Drakeshaugh about 5 times, because it's always recommended, but I hate, hate, hate first person POV. Every time I'm like "ok, maybe I can grit through it" but I just can't get over it.

** I read a really great one about Ron dying & leaving to go to Australia without telling anyone what was going on. It was the best Ron story I've ever read. It's probably among the highest rated post hogwarts Ron stories if you filter them that way.

Edited to add: it's on FanFiction.net

** I don't know if it's what you had in mind but here are 2 OC insert series that keep the plot the same for the most part with a few added extras

The Potter and black series linkffn(9349216) that's book 1 its a sirius black has a daughter oc insert

You were always there series linkffn(8634951) again link is for book one this time it's a muggleborn girl next door friend kind of story.

both are some of the earliest fanfics I ever read (at least for Harry Potter) and are a great way to stay in touch with the word and even introduce yourself to reading fanfics

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
