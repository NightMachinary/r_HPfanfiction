I'm looking for a HG/SS story sat post War. Severus has a apothecary in Knockturn Alley, Hermione married Ron and either divorces him in story or right before it starts, I can't remember. Severus ends up with a young daughter unexpectedly, when her mother dies. When I read it, it was on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and marked as complete. Thanks for any help provided.


** Oh, I know this one! The title has “corner” in it. I'll look around and get back to you.

Edit: found it with a quick google search. It's linkffn(5398887)
