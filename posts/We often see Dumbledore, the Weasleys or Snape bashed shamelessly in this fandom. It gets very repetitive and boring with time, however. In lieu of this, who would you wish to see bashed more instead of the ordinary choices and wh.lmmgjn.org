**** I should've explained myself much better. I don't mean the over the top bashing like you see with other characters, I wouldn't want to see them portrayed as monsters. What I meant isn't something I would consider bashing, but I've seen fics accused of bashing simply because they showed a character acting in a morally grey manner, and this would definitely be that.

What I'd like is a fic which covers one of the goblin wars. I always assumed the reason they were covered so thoroughly in History of Magic was because they wanted to ensure future generations didn't make the same mistake of angering the goblins. I think a story that showed them fighting wizards to a standstill would be compelling, where the wizards are the antagonists but don't realize it, where the goblins are vicious and bloodthirsty but not without provocation. It would need a delicate hand to ensure it didn't come across as bigotry though, that is very true. And I don't think I have the skill to write it in any case.

He could've easily done the boggart lesson where everyone waited outside the classroom in line and each kid would get a one-on-one session where there was no fear of being embarrassed in front of the class. It's not only that he embarrassed a colleague, he risked giving other kids ammunition to bully each other for their greatest fears. There might have also been kids in there whose greatest fear was a parent. How would the class have reacted, and most importantly, how would Lupin have been able to do damage control? One of his flaws is that he doesn't think too far ahead and doesn't necessarily think about the consequences of his actions.

The numbers make it easier for people facing a boggart the first time to cast the spell and neutralize the boggart. Imagine the kid and lupin alone in that room facing the boggart, chances are the kid would never learn how to dispel it and be traumatized by their fear.

Remember Molly Weasley - a trained adult witch - facing a boggart alone? Took her so many more tries to get rid of the boggart. And she couldn't until there were four more people in the room.

Suggesting to put Snape in funny clothing is the least humiliating thing to make Neville and the rest of the class find Snape funny.

The only McGonagall bashing I've ever seen is her written as "DUMBLEDORE CAN DO NO WRONG! HOW DARE YOU QUESTION THE GREAT MASTER DUMBLEDORE!" in Evil Dumbledore fics.

Most Hermione bashing (I don't read the slash fics though) is Hermione being a spy along with Ron for Dumbledore and being bribed with books.

I want to see bashing on their canon decisions. Dumbledore calling McGonagall out for the 150 points vs 20 or the Forest Detention, or how she's mostly useless as a Head of House.

Maybe a fic where Hermione actually reports Harry for "cheating" in HBP for using the annotated Potion's Book, or fics like Golden Bullets where Hermione is called out for going too far in attacking Ron with birds.

You can do the same with Mcgonagall, like why did she let him leave Harry at the Dursleys? She could've been more helpful, make criticism without making her a terrible person.

Make Ron's jealousy and Hermione's stuck up way flaws, not their main personality. The same thing with Luna's conspiracy theories.

** Hermione, if it's done well.

She's treated like a goddess in fanon, so it would be a nice change of pace to see a fic that shows two teenage boys reacting to being constantly nagged, shows her driving people away with her crusades such as SPEW, etc.

I like Hermione as a character, but all too often she's portrayed as perfect and genius and gorgeous in fics, so it would be interesting to see somebody take the opposite path.

** Hermione. I like her in canon, but some fanfics make her the pure goddess, super-genius, better than everyone else, the real hero of the series, and so on.

McGonagall. Like others have said, magic or not, leaving a kid on a doorstep in the middle of a winter night is nuts. Her just accepting that Dumbledore was doing so was -crazy-. The way she overcompensates (that's my reasoning for why she seems more harsh to Harry and Co in the first year than others) is annoying. She feels like she focuses on her Headmistress job and not Head of House job.

Dobby. Listen, I like Dobby. But a cracky story about a crazy, overprotective Dobby going around causing bad ends to people who hurt his Master Harry Potter Sir would be hilarious.

I would call it more of a character study than a bashing fic because while Remus was a shitty person throughout the fic the writing was mature enough to still make him a fully realized character rather than an evil caricature.

I really liked how the fic explores the mess that was Remus' insecurities and how they affected his relationships. There's so much potential to explore there because Remus canonically pushes away the people he loves because of his own hang-ups with his lycanthropy, but not many people go far enough into exploring how toxic that can be to the people around him.

** Honestly, Harry. Many fanfictions have made him a larger-than-life, all-knowing, all-powerful, rich god character who does no wrong. Boring!

Other fanfictions make him the rudest, most anger-issues asshole you've ever met who gets a free pass to be an absolute piece of shit to his ship mate, but they still get together in the end despite him never actually doing anything to make it up to them- he's just /so/ alluring and they've loved him for /so/ long, so they happily walk into what is clearly going to become an abusive relationship.

I dont mind the trope of making him powerful, but I hate it when he's so overboard powerful that he can do anything. I like the idea that he can brute-force many problems, but that being magically powerful doesn't actually help him much when he needs finesse and study and research to solve problems as well. He can be strong, snarky handsome, and sad but still functional without being a godlike, antagonistic, unstable Adonis-bodied lord of every house, king of the goblins freak

Third yeah get books and start reading and training at every opportunity, he did it for the third task.

** Personally I'd go with Hermione, Draco, Pettigrew, and perhaps Petunia Dursley. In reverse order here are my reasons. In many fics, even when the Dursley's are wildly abusive it's almost always Vernon doing the bulk of damage. It's almost universal to hate the Dursley's but Vernon's lard ass actually doing something other than yell unless Harry's five feet away is a bit tired. Everyone hates Wormyail and he deserves it. Hurt him more. Pour it on, seriously. My vindictiveness for a fictional character aside let's get into the real meat and potatoes. Draco's an annoying twat that can't back up a word he says. And yet tons tweenage girls fawn over him because of his bad guy status. He doesn't even have the balls to actually kill Dumbledore when he's defenseless. You can say that's because he's not a killer at heart, but he joined a gang of murderous terrorists and has championed their cause for years. The little shite acts too nasty too consistently for it to be faked. Draco just doesn't have the stones to do anything but talk about his imagined superiority. And finally Hermione. The fandom's immortal god queen of perfection. Beautiful, just, intelligent, clever, and ALWAYS RIGHT. I'm so fucking tired of the girl. Canonically she's a good and loyal friend if a bit nagging and wonked out in terms of priorities but she is consistently portrayed with few of any flaws. Fanon Hermione is boring, tired, and so hopped up on the Mary-sue juice of millions of little girls who think they're smart that she's as insufferable as Snape.
