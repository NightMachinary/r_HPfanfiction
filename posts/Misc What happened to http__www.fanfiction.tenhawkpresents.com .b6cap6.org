It went down and I cant find any reason anywhere. I saw on a page similar to isitdownrightnow that 1 month ago it was up... I'm looking for the last chapter of DOOM Day in particular - link at end - and the only thing I find besides the FFNet is the text file that's floating around, which is a chapter behind even the FFNet of the story - link is below too (the txt is the uncensored version so don't read if you don't want to see adult stuff or are under 18/legal age). If anyone can help me out, it would be appreciated.

The FFNet link for the story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966314/1/DOOM-Day]]

The Uncen .txt: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120802052602/http://onj1.andrelouis.com/hp/Department%20Of%20Mysteries%20Day.txt]]

The site in question: [[http://www.fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com]]

or perhaps may be:

[[http://www.tenhawkpresents.com]]

Google shows both of those and neither is up...


** It looks like the site wasn't updated for some years prior to going away. Websites take money and effort to keep going, when a person's interest is gone, the site can just disappear.

** I remember that site, I read some BtVS fics there a *long* time ago. When I last visited it was pretty much dead, with a chapter update no more than a handful of times per year if that.

That's wrong, it's definitely been a year at minimum since the archive disappeared.

The loss isn't very surprising. The owner (and author of quite a number of fanfics himself) has long focused on original materials and is in fact a quite successful self-published author. Look for Evan Currie on Amazon. In the past he sometimes posted links to his published works on the Tenhawk Presents Facebook page.
