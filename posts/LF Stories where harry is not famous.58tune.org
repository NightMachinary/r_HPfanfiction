** Most non-BWL/Big Brother Harry stories?

Here's some of my favorite & less known & unfortunately mostly incomplete non Famous Harry stories:

Linkffn(Death Before Dishonour by SuperNova26) - This one perhaps most fit in not famous Harry category.

Linkffn(Wit Beyond Measure by AntonXIV)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun by Lord umbrex) - A time travel story centered with Harry. But he is relatively unknown.

*** I don't like the brother plotline. I'm looking for fics where no one knows the role of the Potters in the downfall of Voldemort.

  Born two years before the prophecy, Tom Riddle does not mark Harry as his equal, but life has never been easy for Potters. How will an intelligent, and independent Harry, fit into the two dimensional wizarding world? Will he conform to the prescribed paths or will he resist the manipulations of the powers that be? Harry/Fleur eventually. OCs major part of the story. More inside.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.
