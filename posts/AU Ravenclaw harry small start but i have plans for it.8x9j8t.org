** Promising plot. However, the awkward sentence structure and lack of punctuation reduce the readability of the story greatly.

** I agree, it does have a promising plot and great potential, but the sentence structure and grammatical errors do make it harder to read. I would recommend you have someone beta it if possible. Good luck, with the story.

*** After sleeping on it is very sloppy and rushed, but what grammatical errors? Just missing punctuation, or Is it just that bad of a sentence structure?

** I don't read stories with chapter lengths <1k words out of principle. A short prologue chapter like this might be okay, but you'll have to put more work into your other chapters if you'd want to keep my interest.

I hate to agree with the other commentator, but the writing is a bit clumsy.

Keep at it though, learning by doing and all that.

** Sorry for the confusion, it's just the sentence structure.

** Well, this story already uses some very used up elements - for example replacing Ron and forcing Luna into it. The writing would have to be absolutely marvellous for it to catch my interest in any kind of way. So far, I would give it a pass.
