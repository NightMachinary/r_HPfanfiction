Basically, Harry is as powerful as those three wizards are/were at their prime, or as powerful as they were in their teenage years.

It'd be good if we see him earn that power, rather than just “yo, my ancestors were hella powerful, so it makes sense that I'm too”. Also good if there's no Dumbledore bashing.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** In /Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux/ along with its sequel, /Harry Potter and the Chrysalis/, Harry is said to be as powerful as Grindelwald/Dumbledore/Voldemort. The only thing really separating them is their varying degrees of genius.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  The goblin nearly fell off his chair in shock, "You remember me young one?"

  "Of course! Why wouldn't I?" Harry asked, confused.

  "Most wizards and witches don't take the time to remember our names. They deem themselves superior to us goblins."

  Harry frowned. He knew little of goblins but knew greatly of the arrogance of many magicals and their hatred for those inhuman. "I am not most wizards I suppose."

  "No, you are not, Honorable Potter." Griphook bowed his head slightly in respect, something Harry returned. He didn't see Sirius nearly faint from surprise behind him. "What can I help you with today?"
