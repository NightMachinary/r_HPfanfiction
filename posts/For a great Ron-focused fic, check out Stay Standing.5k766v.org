Stay Standing is an incredible fic focused on Ron. You should read it. Really, you should read it. And it just completed, so you never have to worry about it being abandoned. :)


** I was looking for a Ron-centric fic. Going to read this one :)

** I loved Stay Standing. I really liked the way the author portrayed Ron, but I also liked how some of the other characters were written, especially George and Harry. It's not perfect--sometimes the author used the wrong words in a way that almost made me think they were dictating to write it, and a few parts toward the end were a little unclear, but I think it's worth overlooking those things and staying with it. I recommend it as well.

*** I loved this one so so much and I'm now on the hunt for one similar to this and the way that the author portrayed Ron. Any suggestions?

**** Hmm, have you read Ron El Greco? Or Australia? Those are the first big Ron-centric fics that come to mind. There was one where Ron traveled to another dimension, but I believe it was abandoned.
