Basically, it starts in a completely destroyed London, and Harry is a badass. He kills a spanish/mexican necromancer, and somehow goes back in time. Later he somehow runs into Mab(the evil fairy) and there's something about lily potter Sr being from a dark pureblood family. Help, anyone? I'll pay in upvotes and digital chocolate.

  Torn from a hellish future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Juggling his violent past, Sidhe politics, and a questionable sanity, he fights to stay ahead of enemy intrigue. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
