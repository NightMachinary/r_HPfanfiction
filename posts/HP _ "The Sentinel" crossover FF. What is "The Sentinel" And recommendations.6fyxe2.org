So I just recently read a fan fiction called Duality by Keira Marcos. Now normally I am not super big into crossovers. I have pretty much only enjoyed Star Wars ones for the most part, and the odd other type like a HP/Twilight, or HP/LoTR. However Duality, which is a "The Sentinel" crossover had me intrigued. Its not very long, and I dont even know what "The Sentinel" is/was.

So... for starters.. can anyone educate me on "The Sentinel". A brief google search seemed to only turn up a Canadian TV show in the 90's which lasted all of 3 years, and provided very limited info, nor did it quite seem to fit with what was in the FF crossover i read. Any info you can provide would be appreciated.

Secondly... can anyone recommend other FF similar to Duality by Keira Marcos, or that is a HP/The Sentinel crossover.

Thanks!


** Yeah, it's the Canadian tv show. A sentinel/guide semi-coherent fanfic trope loosely inspired by that show has circulated slash fandom for a number of years. It's like the a/b/o fanfic trope or soulmark trope or other-fandoms-characters-in-Hogwarts trope - you can sort by it on AO3 and it transcends fandoms. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Sentinel_AU]]

Basically, the sentinel has hyperextended senses and in some fics super strength, but needs a guide to help him manage it. The guide also has super senses, other abilities vary, and sentinel/guide pairs bond specifically to each other like soulmates (the trope is usually used for romance) and sometimes fight evil. There's usually worldbuilding around the sociopolitical aspects of sentinel/guide relationships.

[[http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Sentinel]] is the original show's fandom description.

*** Thanks for the info. You say is heavily circulated in slash fandom... but sadly I have no interest in slash (for the main characters anyway). I am assuming there are non slash ones as well (like Duality) but are they super rare or something?

**** Well, part of the mythos is that since they're "protectors of the tribe", most are male. Usually upwards of 90%, depending on the story. So it would follow that when you pair them off, you get a lot of slash. Some stories make a point of having all or some platonic bonds, but most of the authors are basically treating it like a soulmate trope, but with extra abilities.

Tl;dr: most are slash, if you don't like, search for platonic.

** Keira runs a challenge site on which Sentinel crossovers are quite popular. In fact, one challenge was specifically for Sentinel crossovers - that's actually what Duality was written for. Many were reposted later: [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/littleblackdresscollection]]. There are at least a few HP ones.

Keira has another one, Ten Years After the War, on her site as well. It's linked on that page.

*** Thanks for the link... sadly there are only 10 HP ones it seems, and most are main character slash (which I'm not interested in) or just dont seem interesting. I found 1 i may read heh. Guess there are just not a ton of this crossover out there but ill have to keep my eyes open.

PS: Thanks for the stories though.. been enjoying them so far. Im saving Soulmate bond till last of hers heh.
