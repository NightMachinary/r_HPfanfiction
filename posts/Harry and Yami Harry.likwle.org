The part of Voldemort's soul inside Harry is purified and tamed by Harry's soul, and is no longer a Horcrux. Instead, this part of Voldemort's soul takes the form of Yami Harry (Yu-Gi-Oh fans rejoice), with the evil banished and the part of Voldemort's soul transforming into a part of Harry's soul, with Voldemort's darker tendencies. Harry is a kind boy with great magical power, slightly shy and friendly. Yami Harry is cold, cruel and vicious, but has a sense of justice. When Harry transforms into Yami Harry, his eyes turn red and he appears slightly taller, though nobody notices it. Essentially, Harry is Yugi and Yami Harry is Yami Yugi (albeit, more akin to Yami Yugi's season 0 counterpart for diehard Yu-Gi-Oh anime fans). Yami Harry will take possession of Harry's body when Harry or his friends are in danger.

Yami Harry is first awakened when Harry's Uncle Vernon attempts to smack him with a stick because a teapot levitated. Petunia and Dudley are not home.

"I've had it with your freakishness," Vernon bellowed as he raised a wooden stick. Harry cowered slightly as Vernon walked up. Vernon raised the stick, ready to whack Harry. As he made to smack Harry, Harry's eyes glowed red. Vernon was stunned but still swung at Harry. Harry caught the stick, before snapping it. Harry swiftly punched Vernon in the gut, sending Vernon flying across the living room.

Vernon landed with a thump. "What is this attitude brimming with confidence?" Vernon thought as he made to get up.

Harry had a cold smile on his face as he walked up to Vernon, and gazed at the evil man. Vernon soon convulsed and twitched in pain as a force that felt like a thousand hot knives stabbing at him in every angle hit him. He cried in agony.

Since that day, Harry would never be mistreated by his relatives. In fact, they were terrified of him. They called him monster, demon, Satan. Harry was confused, but he couldn't care less about the names, it beats being beaten into submission. Harry would sometimes have memory blanks. He thought that this was because his Aunt Petunia whacked him with a frying pan in the head a year ago.

So now, Harry would not be malnourished, he would be quite fit and his relative are utterly terrified o him. He prepares to go to Hogwarts for his first year after finding about. the world of magic, not knowing that he has already h=used magic, and that he possesses magic of the strongest kind.

Essentially, Harry is Yugi and he goes to Hogwarts, while having a dark but good spirit inside him that possesses his body whenever Harry or his friends are in danger. The spirit is near Voldemort level in magic and is a badass.


** Great idea, could make for an interesting story. Buuuut, saying once that Harry would be like Yugi would have been enough

*** Fair enough, though Harry and Yugi differ a bit, though that bit changes their personalities quite a bit.

******* /“Lucius”/ practically purred Harry with his eyes now red “did you just try casting /the killing curse/ at /me/” asked the boy to the now incoherently bumbling adult as he smiled with a coldness capable of freezing the sun itself “Oh, no, let's not be so rude as to discuss such /delicate/ topics right outside our dear headmaster's office. In fact, it has been so long since I last experienced your wonderful wife's hospitality, it would be only right that I paid your mansion a visit. Oh, do not worry about scheduling issues, I will talk it over with my... /good friend/ Draco to find the best moment to visit. You don't even need to wait for me, /I will wake you up when I arrive/”
