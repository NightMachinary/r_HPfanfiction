It's one fic that I was suddenly reminded of today and I can't seem to find it anywhere. It had Harry reborn as a female hobbit who ended up taking Bilbo's place in the story. I remember them killing Smaug by having him eat a bag of explosives filled with railway nails, and Harry (who I think is named Bella) ending the Battle of Five Armies by growing a forest using the arkenstone and Gandalf's staff. I get the feeling it may have been deleted, but I'm hoping someone here knows where I can find it.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466][Fate be Changed by Araciel]] is what you're looking for I think. Not Bella Baggins, but Willowyn Proudfoot, but everything else matches.

  PART 2: She slayed the dragon, reclaimed the Mountain, birthed a forest, and won a war. But that was just the beginning. The past has a funny way of coming back to haunt you. Horcruxes and Dark Lords and quests to destroy them both, this time though, she's not alone. She has a Fellowship at her side.
