Basically just looking for fics in which the wizarding culture around relationships is different. Could be that polyamory is accepted/expected or just different expectations for how a courtship is supposed to go. Maybe this adds to the Dursleys' view of the Potters as 'freakish'.

I know it's uncommon, but bonus points for sedoretu, that's my favorite dynamic

Please warn me if there's any character bashing/salt, especially main characters.


** The fic that first comes to mind (for me at least) is D_M_Nealey ([[https://archiveofourown.org/users/D_M_Nealey/pseuds/D_M_Nealey]])'s /Holly Potter and the Witching World/ (linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12861492]])), featuring a society that practices polygyny by necessity since wizards are so rare. There's interesting stuff in how gender politics and LGBT representation and views thereof fit into the context of that premise. It's been a while since I read the first 9 chapters, but I don't recall any bashing in this fic.

#+begin_quote
  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)
