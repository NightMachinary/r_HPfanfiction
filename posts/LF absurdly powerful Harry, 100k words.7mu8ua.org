**** Started out great, got increasingly convoluted, and beyond a point there were no stakes to the story at all.

I began counting the number of times the word "absently" appeared.

It appeared so many times, the story effectively had no Harry, he just did everything on autopilot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][Second Chance at Life]] and its two sequels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3078469/1/Changes-in-a-Time-of-War][Changes in a Time War]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5318075/1/A-Magical-World][A Magical World]] has a Harry with Basilisk and Thunderbird animagus forms and a shitload of blood magic but somehow remains a fun read. Sequels end up with Volde as a side threat to some sort of extra-dimensional invasion. Really fun fic. Very little of Britain in here. Mostly takes place America, Central America with occasional trips back to Magical Britain. It's starting to show it's age a little but it's held up remarkably well for an 11 year old fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11975368/1/The-Stormreaver][The Stormreaver]] Harry kidnapped into the Warcraft universe as a baby and is trained/raised by Gul'dan. Through some shit planning he gets tossed back into the Potterverse. So far the fic has mostly been him building a cult to summon "The Burning Legion," to eradicate their enemies and conquer all the worlds. It's okay. Not much Warcraft knowledge needed imo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Series.]] A whole series (700kish words) about Harry sort of unknowingly selling his soul to a fallen angel and acting as a tool of its will on the earth. Crossover with the Dresden Files. No knowledge necessary. Polarizing on whether people like this or not. If you don't like the Harry in the first few chapters. Don't bother reading the rest to see if he changes he doesn't. I read it mostly for the badass Dumbledore moments because my god this has some of the coolest mentor!Dumbledore moments I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] Death!Harry gets summoned by manipulative Dumbledore to kill Voldemort and shenanigans ensue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragon's Roar]] This one is stupid. It's unbelievably stupid. It's so stupid it somehow wraps right back around into being a fun read. My favorite part was when a /k/ommando killed a death eater, looted the body and uploaded pics of what the guy had on him.
