Hey everyone. Maybe some of you guys remember me under *ynmidk*. I'm back now under *StellaStarMagic*. I'm currently re-uploading a couple of my old fics:

A Different Perspective: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/story/story_preview.php?storyid=13512039]] || [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22953583]]

Lavender Brown: Hogwarts Champion Extraordinaire: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/story/story_preview.php?storyid=13514676]] || [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23003536]]

After everything that happened with my old accounts, I had a really hard time to get back to writing, but am slowly starting again, so I hope to see some of you guys reading my fics again. I'm not sure when I will re-upload my other fics. For now, I just want to get back into the swing of things.


** The rate at which you update your fics is quite impressive. I have subscribed to Lavender Brown: Hogwarts Champion extraordinaire ( I liked the fic btw) and it is quite impressive that you update your fics everyday.

*** Oh, those chaps were all written before. Back in mid-November, I had 14 chapters already written for A Different Perspective and 5 for Lavender Brown. I'm just re-uploading them right now on my new account.
