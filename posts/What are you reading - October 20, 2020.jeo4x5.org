Phoenix Insurgent

Summary:

Ousted from Hogwarts by a gang of corrupt, incompetent officials, Albus comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.

Impression:

I like reading about a more active and ruthless Dumbledore and also about the repercussions it has. In many fanfics we see a manipulative and ruthless Dumbledore - but seriously: Dumbledore is like a halfgod among humans with the power he has. If he really wanted power and was as powerhungry as these sort of fanfics suggests he could simply take it - there wouldn't be anybody who could stop him.

Thats what I like about this fanfic. It actually points out that Dumbledore hold back his whole live and tried to make the justice system working. And that is the impression I got from Canon-Dumbledore too. Could he have overthrown the ministry? Of course he could. He just didn't do it because it would have been the easy not the right path. Might doesn't make right and this fanfic deals with a Dumbledore who slowly loses his morals when faced with the corruption of the ministry.

What I also like is that the Order isn't a bunch of Yes-Men. In many fanfics we have a stupidly loyal Order - like the members aren't some of the brightest people in this world. In this fanfic the Order Members actually think for themselves so yeah! I guess.

Now to the bad parts. There are many things that doesn't make sense: There was no reason for Dumbledore to free Grindelwald. He hasn't done anything with him that he couldn't have done without him. The only reason to do it is to have somebody who corrupts Dumbledore. Than there is also Dumbledores inner thoughts. That aren't the thoughts of a men over 100 years. They sometimes sound like the thoughts of an angsty teenager.

Overall I would give it a 7/10. Even with his weaknesses it has a interesting and unused Plot, as well as some interesting side characters.

** I've only started reading Fanfic recently and I was drawn in by the Dramione shippers that I know, so I apologise if the fics I'm reading are old/cheesy or not what anyone else is after but I've found them to be a good introduction and am branching out of the Dramione angle. But the fics I've read so far that I've loved are:

Title: Remain Nameless Author: HeyJude19 Rating: so sorry but I don't know how you guys are raring - new to the sub and I've tried to check the rules but I may have missed something? Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23875939]]

Plot: Follows Draco in his mid 20s, trying to recover from the war, battling PTSD and addiction. He's just trying to live a normal life and then he bumps into Hermione and things start to progress from there.

The Good: I felt the portrayal of Draco dealing with PTSD and crumbling self esteem was very realistic, the romance side of things was lovely and the fic is fairly well written compared to others I've tried to read. Also interesting details about addiction and how that would look in the wizarding world. I also enjoyed the interactions between the Gryffindors and Draco - Ron's reactions toward Draco are very funny.

The Bad: Still a work in progress and some of the last chapters have felt a little bit redundant, just tying up some loose ends for some of the outer characters but not really adding much to the main plot.

Overall: I think it's worth giving this one a go if you like romance, if not then maybe don't bother as it's largely about the relationships between characters and there's not a lot of action. Although you do get some dementors about halfway through.

Title: The Auction Author: LovesBitca8 Rating: ?? Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19101535]]

Plot: Part of the Rights and Wrongs Series, The Auction is AU, Harry Potter is dead, Voldemort won the war in the UK and is expanding his forces prompting something to similar to WWII and many of the students of Hogwarts have been captured and sold into slavery, including Hermione who is purchased by... you guessed it Draco Malfoy.

The good: Detailed world building, suitably dark but still includes some dry humour and sweet moments, very well written to the point that the most recent chapter posted had me feeling physical anxiety as I tried to read it as quickly as I could just to find out if my favourite characters made it through their latest disaster. Interesting take on the Malfoy family, meshes well with the book versions of the characters although, I felt the way they abandon pureblood ideology was a little bit quick, then again maybe that's because I haven't read the rest of the series yet.

The Bad: Unfinished, chapters posted fortnightly. That being said there are only a couple of chapters to go.

Overall: I think this is the most well written FanFic I've read, I found it interesting, sophisticated and the author doesn't shy away from uncomfortable topics which helps to add to the realistic feel of what a wizarding world war might look like. Also, very interesting and original ideas about potions and possessive magic.

Title: Rebuilding Author: Colubrina Rating: ?? Link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11439594/1/Rebuilding]]

Plot: Some of the students return to Hogwarts to over the summer to help rebuild the castle and they then complete their final year of school together.

The Good: although it is another Dramione this Fic focuses on other minor characters from the original books as well and gives them a chance to shine. Addresses the loss of family members through the war, the different trauma each student faces, and gives you a couple of years of them as young adults out in the world. A realistic depiction of Narcissa and a different take on Molly and Ron. Very cute friendship between Draco and Harry - I have to admit I'm very partial to them becoming friends. Also a nice inclusion of Percy. Overall this fic just wants you to love all of the characters.

The bad: I think the ending was a bit rushed, and if you don't like the idea of Draco healing and becoming “soft” than this isn't for you. I didn't mind it at all as I think that this version of Draco is still believable after suffering the way he did during the war but I saw a few comments from people who felt it was unrealistic.

Other fics I've read that are good and maybe worth looking into but I don't have time to write about them in detail are: Apple Pies and Other Amends by ToEatAPeach on AO3: very cute and sweet Dramione, a bit short.

Wait and Hope by mightbewriting on AO3: Dramione. They are married and approaching their 30s. Hermione loses her memory in an accident and has to come to terms with the fact that she's married to Draco. I love the Slytherins in this.

Breath Mints / Battle Scars by Onyx_and_Elm on AO3: Dramione. Toxic relationship. Interesting ideas about the way the Ministry of Magic might abuse its power and discriminate against former Death Eaters and even those who were not Death Eaters but simply had connections to them. An epilogue was posted just over the weekend that was a real tear jerker.

Isolation by Bex-Chan on FanFic.Net: has had a lot of hype on TikTok recently. I did like it but I don't think it was the best thing I've ever read like some people do. To be honest the best thing about it was the dry humour that is included once the Slytherins (other than Draco) appear, which is about half way through. I did laugh out loud at some of the dialogue (in a good way) and shed a few tears over the battle of Hogwarts. Worth the read, I read it on Wattpad which is not where the author posts, it was reposted by someone else but I loved reading it on there as the comments left after each paragraph made me laugh just as much as the actual story did.

If anyone wants to recommend me any non Dramione fics to read I'd love it, I've already gone and saved some of the ones from this thread. I like the darker more grown up fics that focus on the characters as adults. I also have to be honest, I'm obsessed with the Malfoys and love a well written Narcissa and Lucius as well as Draco. Doesn't need to be a romance, but I've only really found fics that include Draco to be romantic? So it would be nice to find one that isn't.

I found that some of the long and detailed plot sections could be skimmed over without problems. Voldemort (not so evil and sometimes nice) merged w Harry (somewhat dark but in a smart way). Recommended. Really appreciate reading a more nuanced, believable, human, reasonable and fleshed out Voldemort character.

** *Title:* What's Her Name in Hufflepuff

*Author:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/12472/ashez2ashes][ashez2ashes]]

*Rating:* T

*Link:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]]

A self insert fic that captures the fun and wonder of going to Hogwarts and learning magic while avoiding most of the standard overused cliches.

It's genuinely well written, happy to deviate from cannon, snappy enough to not be boring while willing to take its time to describe a scene or establish mood.

A light hearted slice of life unburdened by edginess and angst is already incredibly rare, the fact that the author is also telling a proper story and a long one to boot makes this fic practically unique.

My one concern is that it won't get finished. The fic is at just shy of 200,000 words and is still currently in year 2. I'm really hoping this one goes all the way to the end of year 7 with the same tone and pacing as it has had so far but that's an awful lot of words to write.

That said, it's still being updated so... here's hoping.

*** I haven't caught up with this in a while for the same reason you're nervous. That would be an insane number of words to write, but maybe it will wrap up earlier given how she's changed canon.

Also, while I was catching up this section made me laugh like a crazy person.

But if they do, I'll be ready to save Christmas!" Oliver shouted and put his hands up in fake triumph. The thought must have inspired him, because he cast the spell again and then to our astonishment a silvery hummingbird emerged from the end of his wand.

We stared in gobsmacked astonishment as the tiny silver hummingbird flitted about the room curiously.

"Did you..." I opened my mouth. Closed it. Cleared my throat, and then tried again. "Did you manage to cast a Patronus from only the thought that you could someday maybe be called upon to save Christmas?"

My Impressions: At first I was hesitant because it was a raised by Tom Riddle thing, but it was actually not what I expected at all. Harry get's apprenticed by Grindelwald at a young age and has the whole Slytherin! Harry thing going. The main plot seems to be that, Harry is working with Grindelwald at the moment, but is trying to figure out which side to join. Harry is not as OP as most of the raised by a dark lord Harry fic, which is something I liked. It also doesn't bash Dumbledore or any other character in particular. It also doesn't have the grammar issues that most fics have now a days, and is relatively well written. It has a HP/DG pairing listed, but it's stated in an AN that there won't be actual romancey stuff until later. At first, the chapters were kinda short, but as the story went on I would estimate about 6k a chapter.

Only downside is that its a WIP. However the author updates like twice a week. I haven't seen the fic recommended that much so I'm just throwing it out there for people!

** *Title*: New Blood\\
*Author*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/494464/artemisgirl][artemisgirl]]\\
*Rating*: T\\
*Link*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood]]

*Summary*\\
Hermione discovers she is destined to found a new Noble House. She's told about magic almost a full year before entering Hogwarts, and uses the time to good advantage.

*The Good*\\
I've really enjoyed reading this. The setup made me suspect it would quickly descend into an overpowered character easily knocking problems out of her path on the way to brilliance, but it didn't. Things develop pretty sensibly, with characters displaying individuality, sub-plots being focused and interesting, and the underlying theme always to the fore. The writing is high-quality although a few Americanisms and typos do distract occasionally.

A story of this length typically has a few points where the author loses inspiration leading to a drop in quality, but I didn't notice that happening at all. Instead, I'm left eagerly awaiting more updates.

It's got pretty much everything. There's romance, although that's not very prominent so far because of the protagonists' ages; action, adventure, drama, and even the odd bit of humour - the latest chapter was particularly funny.

*The Bad*\\
I... can't really think of anything that stands out as being particularly bad. It's true that the characters are a bit advanced for 11-year-olds but that's pretty typical with fanfiction, and I'm past caring.

*Other*\\
You might be looking at the link and thinking "213 chapters?????". I know I did. The story is written pretty much scene-by-scene, which means the chapters are relatively short, although not excessively so. I rather liked that way of doing things as it kept things together and meant I didn't have to set aside a big chunk of time to get to a sensible stopping point.

*Verdict*\\
It's difficult to give a final judgment because the story is still a WIP, but what's there is excellent. I'll give it a 9/10.

*** I'm having difficulty getting into this. It's well written but I find it a little obnoxious when every interaction I've read is her setting records and being competent in an idealized perfect way. Specifically what bothered me the most was the presumption that Goblins don't know what loans are. Banks are built around loans, not around storing money. More annoying than the fact that goblins somehow don't know about loans is that they find out in a conversation with a ten year old rather than the multitude of other witches and wizards. I guess Gringotts doesn't converse with the muggle world at all? The story basically makes them a glorified storage unit company.

I suppose that's not too innacurate, but they wouldn't get a revaluation like that from a ten year old.

***** I think the story teters on the edge of being an Overpowered!Hermione but manages to stay on the right side of the line. The extra year she has is the first saving grace - being able to concentrate her study and go at her own place without waiting for slower classmates or having to do the busywork they give out for homework means she's better than a second year when starting her first.

Artemisgirl also manages to bring Hermione back down to earth, at least so far. The beating she took at the hands of the seven upper years is a case in point.

The banking thing... Yeah, I kind of agree. Also, once given the idea, surely the goblins would start loaning out *all* the gold (without necessarily telling its owners) for even bigger profits? But I can look past that.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] is one of the better fanfictions I've run through. It's a little HP&TBWL in that it's sort of an extended training montage, but the author manages to liven things up with Hermione's slow descent into something that looks a little like adulthood if you squint and her issues with identity. It's still very much a background issue, though, and I like the reason the story came up with for "Why you shouldn't speed run the plot" to her, even if it's a little looser toward the end when she realises she's made changes without meaning to. The story manages to blend the assorted elements - montage, guilt, identity problems, preparations for the future and the life of a pureblood girl from a good family during Voldemort's return - in a way that's really quite compelling. It hits a lot of little buttons for me: the prose is unique and a little bit left of centre, it's a canon rehash from a new viewpoint while still managing to come across as new and fresh. It's very absorbing and I wish there was more.

It also makes me want to strangle Ron Weasley the few times he pops up, and Potter himself in the short sequel, but that's most fanfictions where Potter isn't the main character and Weasley isn't given a personality transplant by the author. If you like it, try A Disarranged Marriage from the author and its sequel - I didn't think you'd ever find a way to make Marcus Flint into a believable romance, but here we are.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21584935][Strangler Fig's ever upwards]] has just entered Harry's first year. I'll be honest, I've set it aside - I really enjoyed the first few, but I think it works best if you put it aside once you finish Amid-the-Ever-Rushing-Future. I enjoyed the way he's handled things, and it's very definitely an AU, but I tend to put things down once they become slash or tumblrfics, and it's honestly showing signs of the former when Harry's older and it's definitely turned into the latter. If you can tolerate that sort of thing, give it a whirl.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13507192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Ashes-of-Chaos][the Ashes of Chaos series]] continues to have piles of child politicians. It honestly strikes me as part of an iterative beta, if you assume the Prince of Slytherin and the Secrets of Vipers series were the previous iterations. They're incredibly similar. I don't mind it, but any trouble suspending your disbelief about a pack of 11-12 year olds might put you off it. Nobody wants to read about kids that actual age, but still. It's actually managed to keep the foreshadowing of a lot of recently revealed plot traits to be only seen in hindsight, which is impressive. It's competently written - just nothing new. If you like that sort of thing, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][try Soul's Touch]], though there's a bit of Dumbledore bashing in there and more child politics. Manages to be a little more 'normal', however, than Ashes of Chaos or Malachite Path or similar.

Harry Potter and the Tracks of Time continues to impress. Just putting that out there. A 'realistic' time travel Harry, one who tries to keep things somewhat in place to avoid invalidating his knowledge while speed running everything else. Maybe give it a shot. Up to third year.

** I'm rereading the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series in order to populate the TVTropes page. It's also a really well done story, completely reinventing canon.

Pro: Canon magic system greatly expanded and explained, especially potions; excellent pranks, both from the Weasleys and others; higher stakes/danger than canon; heroes and villains are complex characters.

Con: Harry is arguably overpowered (YMMV); incomplete (last updated in May); some readers find it implausible that they get away with the ruse for so long.

  Leo Castor Black of Number 4, Privet Drive was happy to say that he was the furthest thing from normal, thank you very much. Most likely because that would make him like the Dursleys, whom he despised. Fortunately, he was more like his cousin, Harry. When a couple of letters appear and tell them they're wizards... well, the boy couldn't be more pleased. Rest of Summary in Prologue.

** Title: Whom the Gods Would Destroy\\

My impressions: I'm down to try any Charlie/Hermione romance story and there's an even bigger plus when the story actually has a plot (as opposed to Charlie and Hermione shagging each other senseless - which, in my opinion, is wildly out of character for Hermione to do in the first place). And while the story starts off incredibly slow (almost sluggish), I've never come across a post-apocalyptic Charlie/Hermione story before. Thus, it's new and refreshing in all the good ways a story can be new and refreshing.

The writing itself isn't bad though there are some mistakes scattered throughout it (but a majority of FanFiction has mistakes anyway) and the grammar is more than passable. The beginning and the middle are easy to read but when leading up to the final confrontation, the writing gets only a little muddled in that some parts are confusing (only a tad so). I think the author had a clear picture in her head of what exactly happened in the final confrontation but had difficulty phrasing it in a way that was completely coherent for the reader. However, with that being said, I understood the final confrontation at its core (it's not too confusing, just a little).

The biggest factor working in the story's favor is Charlie and Hermione. As I said above, they don't shag each other silly (even though there are scenes where they do shag), and what's more, they don't get together in the first couple of chapters. There's an actual buildup to their relationship, something that is rare with Charlie/Hermione romance stories (unfortunately). I like how Charlie was portrayed here and I like how Hermione was portrayed here. They had such good camaraderie that got me heavily involved in the progression of them being acquaintances to them being friends to them being lovers. I actually wanted to spend time with Charlie and Hermione in the story and the environment the author created that hemmed them in. And Charlie and Hermione's relationship is the story's strongest point. It's just something that one has to experience for him/herself.

*The only true negative I have against this story is only a personal preference of mine: Whenever I read Charlie/Hermione stories, most authors imagine Charlie with long hair. Was this even canon? I know Mrs Weasley cut Charlie's hair "brutally short" right before (or was it after?) the Triwizard Tournament, but that doesn't mean his hair was as long as Bill's (again, I could have missed the part in canon where JK Rowling did say that Charlie's hair was long). However, I always imagine that Charlie keeps his hair short (a couple of inches on the top, maybe less than that, while even shorter on the sides). A head canon of mine is that it's simply a hazard to have long hair while working with dragons.
