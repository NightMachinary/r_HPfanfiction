Canon seems elusive on the subject of the various magical creatures' lifespans (actually, you'd think /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ --- the textbook --- would mention something like that, but nope).

/Sapient Beings:/

It seems most fanfics hold Elves to be rather long-lived, with Kreacher being one hundred and fifty or the like and Dobby in his 60's in one particular story. From Hagrid's sturdiness I think we can infer Giants must be rather long-lived too provided they don't kill each other. Trolls might fall into that category, but maybe their lack of hygiene makes them fall prey to illness sooner? Either way, Acromantulas seem relatively short-lived, since Aragog, born in the early 1940's, was an "old man" in the 1990's. Presumably vampires are unaging but not invulnerable (so in practice there'd be few vampires over a few hundred years old), and Veela are probably on the same page as humans. Also, Dementors are unaging and basically unkillable short of starving them or dumping them through the Veil, and because the two are related in my headcanon I want to chuck Banshees in that category as well. I haven't a clue on Sphinxes, Dwarves, Gnomes, Manticores, Rougarous, Hags, Centaurs, Erklings or Merpeople, though (even if it'd be a fun nod to Hans Christian Andersen to have Merpeople be capable of living to be three hundred years).

/Other:/

Phoenixes are of course pretty much immortal as long you don't kick them through the Veil or burn them with Fiendfyre, and Unicorns, with their all-healing blood, must be rather resistant too. Basilisks can apparently live for a thousand years, though perhaps that number would have been cut down a bit if the snake had not been in hibernation for a significant part of that. Also, the Giant Squid either /is/ immortal, or might as well be. But what of Dragons? Augureys? Kappas? Swooping Evils? Runespoors?...


** my headcanon of variant ambient magic levels over large timescales implies that magically-prolonged creatures lifespans are constrained by the frequency of mundane eras.
