#+TITLE: Any fics where Harry is transported back to the Marauder's era, but as an adult with his child or/and wife? And doesn't care about "not messing the timeline" ? Preferably no H/Hr, but I'd understand if its unavoiadable.

**** Meh, I liked it. It's not exceptional but it's like a movie with Dwayne Johnson, you don't go see it for the plot, you go see it for the explosions and if the plot is there it's just added value.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
