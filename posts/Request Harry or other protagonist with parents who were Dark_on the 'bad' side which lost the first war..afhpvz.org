For example: - Lily and James as Death Eaters or followers of Grindlewald. - The Black family in 'Black Luminary' - Orphaned protagonist adopted by a family.

Etcetera.Hopefully you get the idea.

I am interested in how this would affect not only the world but also the main character, especially if they were still a prophesied individual in some way or had to interact with the person-who-lived or what have you.

Thanks in advance.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise)

Dark!Harry fic. Neville is the Boy Who Lived and Harry's father was a Death Eater. Very AU. I personally dropped it because some stuff seemed too unbelievable, but you might like it.

**** It's just AU, so I didn't care about deatheater!James. What I meant with unbelievable was that it had stuff like 19 years old Harry becoming the Minister Of Magic.

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU
