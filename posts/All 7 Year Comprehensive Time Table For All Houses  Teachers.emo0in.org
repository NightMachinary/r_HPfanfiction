**** Yeah! I also think on Friday was double Potions in the first year, not Potions and DADA as this schedule has.

** I know Harry never mentioned being in a classroom with Ravenclaws (at least not till NEWTs), but I'm still surprised by the lack of shared subjects between the two houses when every other combination exists. Also, this only follows Harry's year, right? I somehow remember that Ginny and Luna had transfiguration and herbology together for their year.

** I've been working on something like this for an AU, and let me tell you that it's a /lot/ of work to nail down anything comprehensible. Good on your friend for working it all out!

*** Yep, she went through each book and marked down the probable days and times of each class and then extrapolated to make usable and workable time tables.

There was a lot of frustrated cursing
