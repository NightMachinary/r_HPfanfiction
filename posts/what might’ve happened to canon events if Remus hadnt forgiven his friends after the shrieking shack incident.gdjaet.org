We know of course that Remus eventually forgives Sirius, and we know one of his biggest flaws is that he's a bit of a doormat owing to being so desperate (and grateful) for his friends to keep him around, but I've been thinking lately about what might've happened if Remus, for whatever reason, couldn't forgive Sirius. Almost making him a murderer, putting his life or at least education on the line, exposing his secret etc would all be reasons Remus might have found it impossible to forgive him.

So what might happen? I can't see the marauders carrying on as they were with Remus & Sirius not talking, so presumably there'd have to be some sort of split. And from what we know of them, it seems likely James would ‘pick' Sirius. Would Remus become closer to Peter? Might that affect Peter's story? Or would Remus become a bit of a loner, or find friends elsewhere? Remus is pretty likeable, so I don't imagine he'd have trouble at least finding casual friends.

And would that change the Snape's Worst Memory scene? (iirc that takes place after) If Remus has had some distance from the others and has less reason to turn a blind eye to their bullying, would he intervene as a prefect? I can't imagine Snape & Lily's friendship would last a long time anyway considering Snape was heading for the Death Eaters, but it's interesting what might've been changed if they parted in a different way.

And then later, there's the question of secret keepers. In canon I believe James & Lily & Sirius suspected Remus of being the spy, but if Remus isn't close to them anymore (or isn't in the Order?) who might they suspect? Is there a chance, knowing it to be someone close to them, that they'd suspect Peter instead?

& there's third year too. Would Remus still be selected as the DADA prof? & if so, he still might feel ashamed admitting it to Dumbledore, but I think this Remus would be more likely to disclose Sirius' animagus status, & the location of secret passageways.

My imagination runs out a bit there, but it's interesting to think what direction things might've gone without (or with a different) Remus in the picture.

& does anyone know any fics which explore this idea?


** Nothing really changes, tbh.

Remus is friendless for a time. He might have brought Peter into the fold (I think) but Peter is a coward and it was James and Sirius that made Peter 'cool.' He could make friends with Lily, I guess.

Remus still joins the Order because he's very loyal to Dumbledore. Someone on here asked what led people to believe Remus would side with Indy Harry and Sirius over Dumbledore and it was a very good question.

I doubt him ending on bad terms with Sirius 18 yrs prior would affect him so much to tell Dumbledore when he quite literally thought Sirius was a murderer and Death Eater in canon.

** I think changing werewolf incident and its aftermath might change who James and Lily picked as Secret Keeper.

Iniga explores the effect of the "Werewolf Incident" in her fic Darkness Dying. It essentially boils down to Remus being pissed at Sirius and thus acting distant, as a result Sirius suspects Remus being the spy. Remus in turn is disillusioned with Sirius, in a "how could he do that to me?" way and wonders what else Sirius is capable of. James and Lily are caught in the middle and with baby Harry they got other problems to worry about as well.

Personally I think that Sirius has such an ebullient nature that he goes to "business as usual" and treats the whole incident as no big deal. I doubt he ever really apologised to Remus. Remus can either go along with the "business as usual, no big deal" attitude or stand up and refuse to be friends with Sirius. Since Remus is still friends with James and shares a dorm with Sirius, this would be difficult to keep up, especially considering Remus placable nature.

** Remus tells Lily why he's pissed and she never gets with James. James gets fed up with Sirius and blames him for Lily refusing to talk to him. Peter sort of muddles along stealing Lily's underwear on occasion.

Remus tries to stop SWM like a good prefect, but it still happens more or less the same. Just faster.

Lily is impressed, eventually decides Remus could clean up good and tries to find out. She gets pregnant.

James grows up a bit and winds up actually being happy for them. Gets named godfather, and as far as the Order knows is their secret keeper after Remus and Lily go into hiding. (It's still Wormtail.)

Florian Lupin becomes known as TBWL.

A half-dead James Potter is thrown into Azkaban for his part in the murder of his former crush and friend. Sirius gets an OoM 3rd class for his part in capturing the maniac.

Lyall Lupin (Remus's Father) winds up with custody of his grandson. Dies shortly before Harry goes to Hogwarts, but makes arrangements for the lad to go to the Tonks's.

Three years into HW, a semi-reformed drunken playboy named Sirius Black is DADA instructor and openly feuding with the potions instructor. Snape is still a dick but doesn't have the full-blown hatred of Florian that he'd have had for Harry. Then James Potter escapes from Azkaban...

** James wouldnt pick sirius because he would be mad at sirius actions too

James would try to play peace maker, and if the group split James would divide his time between the two

maybe they take a few more years for them to become a friend group again Maybe bonding again during the war

** Estranging Remus from the other Marauders in the aftermath of Werewolf Prank would likely have the following effects, I think:

- It would indirectly delay the breakup of Severus and Lily's friendship by virtue of SWM being stopped prematurely (why would Remus let it happen this time around?), perhaps indefinitely if they're able to reconcile in the summer afterwards. I doubt they'd ever go beyond friendship though even if they reconcile despite possible feelings on both parts, due to the heavy strain on the existing friendship, even if it doesn't break down completely, however (I like the ship, but if the only change done is to change Remus' friendships, I still think he's too far gone just like canon for it to be a real possibility).
- Remus would probably get closer to the other Gryffindors in his year -- the girls, especially Lily (by virtue of sharing Prefect duties with her).
- Depending on exactly how far gone Severus is into Death Eater-dom and whether or not he's willing to forgive Remus for the perceived slights (complacancy in Marauder harassment and the whole werewolf thing), it's possible that Remus, Severus and Lily would develop a trio of friendship as a result of both being close to Lily, or Severus remains lost and in the end, only a friendship between Remus and Lily remains.
- I don't think James and Lily would happen, especially if Remus tells Lily his secret (personally I think Lily only started seeing James in a different light after he supposedly rescued Severus in circumstances she has no idea about. If Remus tells her the whole story, this would undo this change of view). Rather, if any romance at all would happen, I think it'd be between Lily and Remus.

** I actually found a fic a few days ago that kind of(?) explores this idea, although it focuses more on the Severus/Remus relationship as opposed to the Marauders' friendship, and I think Remus is going to forgive them (plus it only takes place in the immediate aftermath). I think the last chapter should be coming out today if you're interested, but it's not exactly what you're looking for: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23431564/chapters/56161324][Not Really Here - OwlWithFins]]

Hoping the link works, I'm on mobile lol. I've been enjoying it a lot

*** Ha, coincidentally that's what inspired this post! I'm reading it at the moment (I'm only on chapter 2 tho) and it made me think of what would happen if Remus didn't forgive them (tho, like you said, in this case it seems like he will). Thank you for the rec! Glad to hear the last chapter might be out in time for me to binge it, haha. Thanks!

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11619134/1/Harry-Potter-s-most-excellent-adventure][Harry Potter's most excellent adventure]], James didn't get there in time. Snape became a werewolf and Sirius got expelled. Sirius went back home and became a pureblood Lord person with a stick up his butt. Marauders broke up, and became super serous people. Minus Sirius, so it wasn't that serious. IIRC, suspicion was still on Remus, so Pettigrew became secret keeper. Harry died, Parents survived, and Dumbledore showed up and killed Voldemort. Forgot what happened to Pettigrew (Azkaban?), but Voldemort managed to be in stealth for years after canon events until the Main character Harry visited that universe (to have a backup universe that doesn't have a him alive in it in case his home universe goes to crap or he burns too many bridges). Oh, and Harry has sisters.

Besides the other universe stuff, this is exactly how I pictured it going.

** I was once sent an Ask on my blog about doing an AU where Moony actually managed to get to Severus and then writing how his death would affect things. Dumbles can pull all the strings he wants be he legally cannot keep the death of a student from their parents or the Ministry, and the cause behind that death can't be kept secret either. This would spiral everything downhill.

It was a fascinating idea. I might have taken it in a different direction than what was asked of me, but it felt right to do it that way.

I've never read a fic where Remus leaves the Marauders because of the 'prank' but the idea is nice. He's my fav Marauder and it feels most natural if it was him making distance. And now I want such a fic.
