Hi! I'm wondering if there's a fic out there where Draco is surprised that Hermione is a very cultured lady and it turns his views of muggles/muggle-borns upside down?

So many fics always write that Draco is from highclass pureblood society and Hermione is written as completely new to this and doesn't have a single training, yet Draco finds it refreshing, yada yada yada. It's all fun of course. But I was hoping for quite the opposite for once. Seeing how Hermione always gets annoyed with Ron's table manners, I imagine that she's more cultured than both Ron or Harry. And Harry just never notices or bothers to ask that's why we know so little about Hermione's family background. And the fact that both her parents are dentists who own their own practice... I figure she should be pretty well off at least and maybe she also played the piano since she was 4 (this, I got from the movies)? Maybe she can dance too? She also travelled to France on holiday with her parents in 3rd year so perhaps she even speaks several languages and is well travelled. It would be nice to find a fic where Draco encounters her post-hogwarts or during Hogwarts but in summer and he's completely baffled by how little he really knows her and suddenly finds her more fascinating, cultured, well-mannered, knowledgeable, and intelligent than any pureblood witch. It's summer holidays so maybe a light-hearted fic and a contented Hermione who's not too paranoid about him and his motives.

Has anybody read something similar to this? Or anybody willing to help me hunt down this type of story? I would really appreciate it! Thanks!


** I just read this lovely one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8981179/chapters/20533522]])

*** Oh, I already read A Counterfeit of Love series. I remember enjoying the Draco/Hermione but felt disappointed at Harry's lovelife. I was sad for him.

  When Harry helps Hermione find out the horrible truth - that Ron has been dosing her with love potions - she is furious. She is going to get her revenge on Ron in the most hurtful way she can think of -- dating the one man he hates above all others.

  There are fewer things more delightful than finding out how much you have in common with someone that surprises you. How much could Draco possibly have in common with Hermione Granger? EWE Dramione. One Shot. M for language
