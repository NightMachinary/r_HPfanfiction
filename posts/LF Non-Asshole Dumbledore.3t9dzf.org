Basically I'm looking for a story that doesn't demonize him by either making him literally an evil Merlin or a bumbling fool who got drugged and had an orgy with his staff or have a army if stormtroopers made from Lemon Drops.

Seeing as all those were actual examples from random fics my memory dredged, I'm looking for stories where he is actually a good guy, Not an evil, close-minded, fool. Just anything please. It doesn't have to be the main focus of the story ( though it probably should still be significant)

Thanks in advance for your help!

**** True. Though to be fair, Dumbledore doesn't really look competent in canon - outmaneuvred by Malfoy and Fudge, fooled by Crouch Jr. and Quirrell, unable to protect Harry from his relatives, isolating him after traumatic experiences, taking a year to teach him what could be learned in an afternoon... all in the name of plot.

** In most of my stories, Dumbledore is good, benevolent and powerful. Though he also is often ruthless when he thinks it's needed, I generally have him act ruthless towards the guilty to save innocents - not the other way around.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either.

** I'm currently reading linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7), linkffn(initiate by marauderlover7) and linkffn(identity by marauderlover7), which belong to the same series (part 1 & 2 complete, 3 in progress).

Part 1 is pre-hogwarts, 2 first year, 3 second year. Dumbledore is a powerful person who made mistakes and actually recognizes them as such once confronted about it.

He is definitely not a light wizard, but also not borderline dark. He acts like the sort of person who still believes in second chances, but had become more careful when deciding who has earned the privilige of such a chance, a politician who made questionable decisions, and didn't necessarily do a 180 on how he approaches certain problems, but trusts those close to him enough to listen to their suggestions.

All in all he (and pretty much all characters in this series) feel very human, great series so far, can really recommend.

** The problem with "evil Dumbledore" is that for many readers his actions in canon are evil. It's a matter of perspective, and personal opinion.

My favorite interpretation, from a story I can't remember, had Dumbledore suffering from "over a decade of Battle Fatigue" where he'd been on constant alert and wary for over a decade and as a result his mind had broken and he pretty much had dementia.

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) has a Dumbledore who isn't perfect, but learns from his mistakes and is definitely /not/ either a weak, stupid has-been or a cackling evil mastermind. The story overall is very good (told from Harry's perspective) and the reworked Triwizard Tournament makes it the best 4th-year fic I've read.

Warning: some very, /very/ crude language.

Sarcastic comment aside, yeah he does seem a bit manipulative in Canon but never to the extent or for the half assed reasoning I see in a lot of fics. And I honestly think he would have tried his damnedest to find another way besides killing Harry - I've seen a few fics where Harry finds a way to do so after looking for 5 minutes and use that as further evidence for Dumbledore's evilness

He actually seems to care for Harry in Canon and never sets him up to fall as he does in many fanfictions
