  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  An alternative version of Harry's 5th year, beginning over the Christmas break after Harry witnesses Nagini's attack on Arthur Weasley. The mechanations of many converge to create a harsh new reality that leaves Harry clinging to slim hope in an ever darkening world. Rated Mature to cover my bases.

*** I've read some Sorcerer's Muse! I read the beginning of their Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter series. I lost interest halfway through CoS though. Their AU Harry and his clique in this series are self-righteous and disrespectful to other people, which I never noticed when I was really into the series but became so obvious as I got older I couldn't manage to read more.

Do you find the Children of the Flame to have the same issue? I may give it a shot. I think I have read the first one before but I can't remember much.

** 3m words and all of it manages to tie together into something incredible. The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave, beginning with Saving Connor. It is 10 years old and was written before DH and manages to do some truly unique things. The characterization is well done and the plot is superbly outlined. I can't recommend it enough.

This is slash (it isn't graphic and only appears late Book 5), and I don't read slash and yet I devoured it in a week and regularly reread it. This speak volumes to my opinion of this series; one of the must reads in the fandom

** The Cupboard Series by Stargon1 was pretty good from what I remember. I /adored/ the first two; after that it gets pretty AU, which I don't always love, but I still enjoyed it.

Here's Book 1:

#+end_quote

I didn't mind the AU, but there was a *bit* of a tonal and thematic shift. As you said, I still enjoyed it, but it became very much about fighting a war and people dying left and right, which probably wouldn't have drawn me into the series in the first place. The first two stories had a very different appeal.

**** Same. I probably could have worded that better, but I didn't want to spoil anything. To be vague, once Diricawl comes into play, it gets into some trope territory. I've read a lot of stories with that kind of arc, and sometimes I like them. Other times, it's a little weird.

EDIT: Ugh! I tried to put in a spoiler and it just showed up as a hyperlink with the words I was trying to hide. Does anyone know the format for a black bar spoiler? Does it show up differently for me since I am the author?

#+end_quote

It depends on which spoiler format you were trying to use and how you view Reddit. AFAIK some spoilers like the formatting in the side bar depend on the subreddit CSS.

It should look like this: =[hidden text](/spoiler)=

[[/spoiler][hidden text]] (sometimes doesn't work for me either)

But without the CSS it won't show up correctly as you said.

The newest Reddit side-wide spoiler tag looks like this: =>!Spoiler here!<=and appears this way:

Spoiler here

This method should be most compatible.
