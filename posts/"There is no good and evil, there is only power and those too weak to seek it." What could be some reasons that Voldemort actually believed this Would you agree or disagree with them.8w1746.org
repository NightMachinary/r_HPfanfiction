I think it would have something to do with his obsession with power itself, or his opinion that only the powerful (being him) should lead the less powerful. Additionally, it shows that he may have had a black-white view of the world being the strong and the weak. What do you guys think?


** I think this is an effect of Voldemort being genuinely, medically, some sort of psychopath. He lacks empathy utterly; he has little in the way of emotions and never models /other/ people's emotions right (he thinks Snape just wanted to rape Lily, etc.). He's an amoral cynic with a vaguely hedonistic worldview: his goal is to maximize his own enjoyment, and doesn't see helping others as furthering this goal because he /doesn't/ feel anything from helping other people.

And he tends to project this same mindset in other people. He thinks (and while dark, it's not a crazy thing to think) that /everyone/ is secretly like him, amoral agents trying to further our own ends, but too weak-minded to go against other people in achieving them, and thus forced to share the planet with a bunch of idiots and /pretend/ that not killing them for your own convenience is an ultimate moral commandment.

For him, someone like Dumbledore or Harry /isn't/ good; /if/ they had the opportunity to seize absolute power and forego light and love, he really thinks they'd take it; but he thinks they're just too /weak/ to reject the made-up morality they've been taught from birth, and it holds them back.

*** Adding to this. It is possible that Dumbledore is "the only one he ever feared" because this logic about other people does /not/ seem to hold for him. He is obviousrly powerful, not weak. But he behaves horribly unpredictable to Voldermort.

There are two possibilities Voldermort could see there I guess. A) Dumbledore is fundamentally /different/, alien. How do you deal with somebody like that? - People tend to be scared of what they cannot understand.

B) Dumbledore is actually just like /him/ . Powerful, above others. He uses that /others/ believe in that morality to get them to do what he wants. Basically, scary "manipulative chess player" Dumbledore.

** So meta-ethics is a thing. There are people who claim that calling something “evil” is the equivalent of shouting “booo!” And calling something “good” is basically calling out “yay!” Part of the appeal of gods is that they can serve as an entity outside of the self to ground a system of morality. My head cannon is that Voldemort sees himself as above humanity and even above wizards, so the feelings and desires of other people don't merit any consideration. Just as humans don't really mind breaking a horse to get it to do what we want, Voldemort sees people as tools. Now given that, when someone does not recognize other people as having value and carelessly uses them and tosses them aside, possibly is even incapable of empathy, the only recourse we have left is to use force. So basically, Voldemort doesn't agree that human-wizard morality applies to him, he doesn't understand why other people limit themselves in that way, and he's at the point where arguments and explanations won't help so he's up against the combined might of the wizard of world and he's been able to stave them off solely through power.

My view is that morality is shaped by our evolutionary past, crafted by our desires for the type of world we want to live in, and ultimately it does come down to who has the power to enforce their norms.

** While I agree with the people who have already replied, they forget that he was born in 1926.

That means that he grew up in an orphanage in the middle of the great depression. Later, as he was 14/15 he was in that same orphanage during the Blitz where, according to Wikipedia there was "around 90,000 civilian casualties, 40,000 of them fatal" (with ~half of the dead being killed in London).

Imagine growing up like that, with the uncertainty of food and shelter. Imagine discovering a world where problems can be literally magicked away. Now imagine being thrust back into a magicless world, where you can die because you are powerless.

With that it isn't surprising to hate being powerless and by extension everyone and everything you deem powerless.

.

It is rather interesting though that he pursued power by joining the (politically at least) powerful rather than advocating an ideology similar to Social Darwinism (the path which, IMO, Grindelwald chose to follow)

** As we learn from the Books, Voldemort's definition of power is very narrow, as he only values destructive individual combat power. Power can come in many different forms, for example the power of persuasion and leadership. When Voldemort had his first setback, most of his followers chose to dump him. But when Harry's followed thought him dead, they chose to fight to the death. That's power! A long time ago, Tom Riddle seemed to have the power of persuasion too, but he seemed to have lost his way in his Horcrux induced stupidity.

By author's design, canon good guys were imbeciles in military and political matters. Had they been slightly more competent in this areas, they would have actually crushed Voldemort's sorry lot of sadistic genocidal maniacs. But that would make the story less interesting and emotional.

With respect to that statement, I would modify it as:

“Regardless of good or evil, you need power to get things done!”

*** Canon good guys were imbeciles in those things but /so was Voldemort./ JK wrote Voldemort as a progressively more flat villain as the book goes on.

In book 1 we are introduced to this overwhelmingly powerful and terrible Dark Lord so much so that no one will say his name even after his demise. In Book 2 we see how charismatic and persuasive he can be and was in his younger years.

And further on? This incredibly powerful Dark Lord loses his charisma, loses his power, and loses all common sense. (Only capable of casting the killing curse, the one thing that didn't work? C'mon now)

If anyone got the short end of the stick it was Voldemort. If he was even remotely competent Harry and Co would have stood no chance.

Whereas it makes sense that Harry and his friends aren't great at these things; they are young and lack experience and political and magical power the Dark Lord is far from lacking in those areas.

Any boost in competence benefits the Dark Lord more than anyone else in my opinion.

***** Let's say they do fight tooth and claw. Do they even have a chance then? I don't believe so. They are outnumbered and do not have the skill to match Voldemort and his followers. The Order of the Phoenix is not an army, not even a small special ops force. They would not do much against Voldemort.

Furthermore their willingness to kill and break laws although necessary, would not stop the ministry from falling. The ministry siding (which it essentially does at the end of book 4) with Voldemort is the nail in the coffin for any form of resistance. Aurors and ministry resources (floo network, under age magic detection) cannot be underestimated. This alone would make the war unwinnable.

And lastly /if/ Dumbledore falls no one can match Voldemort. No one can hope to best him in a duel, even when the numbers are not in his favour. Furthermore Voldemort has /nothing of value to defend./ The "light side" cannot simply ignore Hogwarts allowing the Dark Lord to pull them into an armed conflict they cannot ignore, whereas he never needs to take the field of battle and if he does it would only be on his terms.

However I still believe Voldemort is still less competent in military actions, for 3 big reasons.

They lost Hogwarts to a bunch of incompetent schoolteachers and children. Hogwarts was the one place that Voldemort had to keep control over and he failed to do so.

Harry and friends managed to evade Voldemort for almost a year. How does Voldemort not find them? How does Voldemort not easily crush the remaining resistance in this time? What exactly is he doing with his time and resources?

Even with overwhelming force, outnumbering and outclassing the enemy they lose the Battle of Hogwarts. This battle should have never taken place due to the above, Voldemort would have never lost Hogwarts in the first place.

The big difference here is the scale. Voldemort has tremendous power at his disposal and fails to make full use of it, whereas Harry and Co do not have anywhere near the resources so even making full use of what they have still puts them at a disadvantage.

****** Why do you assume that “good guys” only include Harry and the students?

Dumbledore was the leader of the “good guys”, and it's mostly him I'm accusing of being militarily and politically incompetent. He possessed personal combat power that rivaled or even exceeded Voldemort's, and the Ministry was nominally on his side during most of the War. And yet his Order got totally whacked in the first war and hardly put any meaningful Death Eaters (only Rosier, Wilkes) permanently out of business.

His treatment of the Sirius case illustrated that he even failed basic police investigative work 101.

** In purely technical terms he's right: Good and Evil are subjective. One man's good is another man's evil. The problem is that his definition of power is so very narrow. There are many kinds of power and many methods of achieving it. There is direct power and indirect power, mental and physical, magical and political, personal and interpersonal. Voldemort believes magical power is most important simply because it is the greatest of his skills as well as the most direct of them. What he wants, he takes, and few can stop him. Thus he thinks that only magical power truly matters.

** There is something you have to understand about people, whether they be magical or not: *rationalization*.

No matter what people do, they need to be able to square it with their other intrinsic beliefs. If you cannot, people experience what is referred to as cognitive dissonance, where one belief is directly challenged by another deeply held belief. Here are some examples: many of the Death Eaters (possibly all of them even) are aware that Voldemort is a half-blood, and thus it is utter hypocrisy to follow him on a "blood purity" agenda. Of course, most of them follow him for other reasons: fear, social or political status, wealth, etc. But they need to rationalize following Voldemort with the idea of purebloods serving a halfblood. SO they invent some falsehood or other to justify this; its all lies, Slytherin blood makes him good enough, his power is proof of the quality of his blood, etc.

Voldemort, for all his power and unique psychological orientation, is in much the same boat as they or any other person. He needs to justify his actions with his other beliefs.

Example: He believes himself (even apparently as a sixteen year old vis a vis the diary) to be the greatest sorcerer in the world, but everyone is more or less aware that Dumbledore can still probably defeat him and he has fled /at least/ once before him. So he justifies this with lines like "He was too weak to explore those magics, too weak to take what could be his." This is his rationalization for why he is not inferior to Dumbledore.

The line about good and evil is something that has been paraphrased numerous times throughout history, with early iterations dating perhaps even back to BCE Persia and the foundations of Zoroastrianism, as well as a few arguments of well known greek philosophers. Its not a new idea, and has existed essentially since the earliest iterations of the dichotomy of good and evil speculated by Democritus. The thing is, people who use or paraphrase this line are almost always trying to justify actions that fly in the face of what others consider right and wrong, /and they know it/.

You want a historical example of this? When the Tatars had called together a Kurultai following the death of Ögedei Khan (son of Ghengis Khan), a Christian missionary brought them a letter from the Pope following the defeat of the Hungarian and Bohemian armies. It told them that what they were doing was against God and they should recant (short version). In response, the Tatars (many of whom were [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_among_the_Mongols][actually Christians themselves]]) responded by saying that if God was against them, why were they /winning/?

Everyone needs to justify their actions, including Voldemort, regardless of the hypocrisy.

*** *Christianity among the Mongols*

In modern times the Mongols are primarily Tibetan Buddhists, but in previous eras, especially during the time of the Mongol empire (13th--14th centuries), they were primarily shamanist, and had a substantial minority of Christians, many of whom were in positions of considerable power. Overall, Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions, and typically sponsored several at the same time. Many Mongols had been proselytized by the Church of the East since about the seventh century, and some tribes' primary religion was Nestorian. In the time of Genghis Khan, his sons took Christian wives of the Keraites, and under the rule of Genghis Khan's grandson, Möngke Khan, the primary religious influence was Christian.

** I actually really like this statement, I think it does a great job of contrasting between the two titans. Voldemort's focus is on power, where as Dumbledore's is on emotions such as love.

However I do believe it has some merit. Ignoring the ethical side of things, the world is largely divided into those with power and the powerless. Do I think it should be that way? No. But does the world behave this way? To some extent.

Some will say Voldemort was like this because he was insane or some other reason. I believe he was like that /because magic makes right./ From his childhood experiences with bullies, to WW2, to the defeat of Grindelwald and the ascension of Dumbledore, nothing really contradicts this mantra in his younger years.

Overall the statement is first and foremost true /from a certain point of view./ Secondly it does a great job of remaining true to the character of Voldemort. I love this quote for those reasons.

** It's probably a product of his childhood where the only thing that mattered for his survival and well-being was whether he had power over other people or not. Conditions with scarce resources and children with hardly any oversight mean you're basically seeing the worst of human nature. Additionally, you're seeing human nature as it is when put under a lot of stress, at its most instinctive. so it would be easy to see it as "the way things really are".

Then when someone came along from a different world, a possible "escape" from this mentality from Tom, the first thing he did was set Tom's possessions on fire in a display of dominance to assert authority.

** If you want a proper answer you will have to dive neckdeep into philosophy.

Proper discussions on morals always lead nowhere, because there are tons of various philosophical views.On a rational level, yes, Voldemort is right. On a basic moral level? No, it's not right.Nietzsche would probably agree with Voldemorts claim, but at the same time disagree with his methods and vehemently disagree with the idea of ruling other people.Machiavelli would get a boner just thinking about that sentences.

After reading famous works of Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra / Ecce Homo) and Adornos (No Poetry after Auschwitz) aswell stuff I dont remember the name of by Kant and a few others back in school and university, I have found myself in a position in which it has become hard to agree or disagree on philosophical matters. Why? Because there is too much to think about. My opinion would change minutely and that is indeed exhausting.

tl;dr

I agree with Voldemort that in reality might makes right, because thats what the quote says. The mighty dictate their morals or the lack thereof on the people; they rewrite history if need be.I disagree with Voldemort about the fact that its how it should be. In my opinion all people inherently have the same needs. Nobody has any right to infringe on those needs.*shrugs* I could go on and disagree with myself later on, because philosophy and morals and ethics never are as clear as one want them to be.

But, as we know, the luxury of such thoughts is the decadence of our civilisation.
