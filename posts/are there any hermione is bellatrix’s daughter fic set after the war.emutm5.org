i actually hate the pureblood or even half blood hermione trope and avoid those fics altogether, but i've just gotten halfway through a really good fic that has just started exploring this trope but instead of it being dark hermione or has bellatrix taking her in as a child, she was still tortured by bellatrix who is still dead and i have yet to finish it but presumably she doesnt come to form an attachment to the idea of her as a mother, or grow to love her as one.

but i was wondering if any other fic has explored anything like that, like if bellatrix survived and was told about hermione being her daughter how would she react? would she care at all that she'd tortured her own daughter or that she'd branded her? is she so incapable of empathy or compassion that she still takes pleasure from the idea of torturing her? would she think hermione still deserved it but due to being a blood traitor instead of muggleborn? if hermione found out her mother was bellatrix post war post torture how might she react? would she ignore it altogether or would she try to get answers? how would she feel after being harassed and literally tortured for being muggleborn, and having it be such a big part of her identity and the having it be revealed that it was all a lie?

i firmly believe bellatrix is beyond redemption but the idea of a post war fic that would explore a connection between those two characters sounds interesting. i doubt there are any fic that do this but i'd be interested in any answers or thoughts anyone might have on how it might go about.


** It's a time travel fic with Hermione/Theodore Nott and there's some kinda weird sex scenes in it but if you can look past that it's pretty good.

*** this is actually the fic that inspired me to make this post, i'd just gotten to the part where they get introduced to the varinen family head and the stones reveal their bloodlines! and then i read the first chapter of the sequel just to see if it was going where i thought and it was.

i really like it so far, although weird sex scenes aren't my thing, is it worth it to push through anyway or are they super weird?

**** Honestly the actual sex scenes are fine, it's more the reason for the sex that I thought was weird but it is kinda important to the plot. You should definitely keep reading though if you can look past that lol
