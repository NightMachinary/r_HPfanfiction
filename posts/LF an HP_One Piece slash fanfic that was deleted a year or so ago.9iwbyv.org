i can't remember the title, except that it had something about Stars in it?

but i do mind on that Death and Gol D Roger ask Harry to go to the OP world and save Ace from dying. When he does that and heals Ace up he accidentally soul bonds Ace, Luffy and himself.

eventually the three of them get pulled back to the HP world where it's been like a year but only about 6 weeks have passed for them.

and harry almost dies in one of the more recent chapters after fighting a new Dark Lady that's running about

does anybody mind what fic this was, and have it saved to their phone/computer and are willing to share it over to me? i loved that fic and it guts me that i can't reread it anymore
