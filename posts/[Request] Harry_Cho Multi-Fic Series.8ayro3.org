I remember reading a Harry/Cho series years ago. All I can remember is that in the final book of the series, their youngest daughter meets the physical manifestation for magic, & is tasked to give the entire world magic. To accomplish this, They devise a plan to first give seminars around the world where people are given a potion that unlocks their magical core, & once a threshold has been reached, they decided to introduce that potion into the drinking water supply to turn every person on earth into a witch/wizard.

Thanks in Advance!


** Really wouldn't want to live in a world like this. There is a large amount of stupid infecting humanity, and the power of stupid multiplied by the power of magic wouldn't have a good ending.
