:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember details about the title, description, etc.

The main thing that stuck out to me was that in the very start, and I mean the first chapter starts with Hermione sleeping with Cormac McLaggen. There's a line about "hot and steamy vanilla sex" being the best, I believe.

It was on AO3. I know this is super minimal, but I literally can't remember anything else, and I can't seem to find it in my tabs. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

(Sorry if the format is weird. First post here.)

EDIT: Found the fic. Misremembered it, though. "You Got Me" by Frumpologist. Wasn't even Dramione. Here's a link for your effort, or anyone whomay have been curious: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23450140/chapters/56211253]]


** Is it this one? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12951273/1/Looking-Glass][Looking Glass by Kyonomiko]]

First paragraph is this: “It's ill advised, she knows, this thing Hermione has with Cormac McLaggen. Reckless and short-sighted and utterly against the grain of good advice.”

*** Unfortunately no. I thought it was for a moment, but I've fully read and bookmarked that one. Thank you though.

*** I found it. Completely misremembered, though. Not Dramione. Sirius/Hermione & Cormac/Hermione. It's You Got Me by Frumpologist, and I lost it because it ended up at the very top of all my tabs somehow. I'm really sorry, but thank you for all your help, regardless of my mistake. You reintroduced me to a good fanfic, at least. I just feel a bit bad that I remembered wrong. I hope I didn't waste your time.

**** Not at all! I had just read the one I suggested, so when I saw your question it's the one that popped into my head. Glad you found the one you were looking for!
