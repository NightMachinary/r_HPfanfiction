Are there stories where Harry is Lord Black that actually have meaning, other than lording it around a manipulative Dumbledore or having a big harem? I don't actually mind him lording it around a little, as long as he is actually a Lord. You know, like he takes care of his own family. All of the Black's. He is the lord of the House, everything has to go through him. He can cast Bellatrix out for not forfilling the marriage contract, or help Narcissa get away from Malfoy. Bonus if Draco leaves with her. Marriage contract, business deals, family conflicts, building up the family from the dark, the whole shebang!

Over 100k wording please...

Haven't read a HP story I loved in over a month, which is unusual so I'm hoping for new ones. And yes, I'm probably asking for a lot, but I'm hoping to get lucky!

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): being Lord Black allowed him to put serious damper in Voldemort's finances. He didn't cast Bellatrix out though, instead he married her.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.
