I know what they are. I just don't understand why so many fics use this word when it wasn't used in the books or movies.


** Same reason people use the word "wards" in Harry Potter fanfiction. It's a convenient term for a type of magic that's common in many genres of fantasy, regardless of whether canon acknowledges it as such. Most authors don't feel the need to beat arround the bush if the type of magic they are describing in their fics is clearly what anyone familiar with fantasy would recognise as a ward or recognise as a glamour.

*** And similar to the way "wards" conceals the actual way canonical wizards protect property, replacing it with generic fantasy forcefield, "glamours" presents disguise as primarily a matter of charms whereas in canon it is always effected via transfiguration or potions.

**** My headcanon is that glamours are like the disillusionment charm, meaning they're either not perfect or very very hard to get perfect and the better the glamour or illusion the more power and skill needed. I really enjoyed the way linkffn(the denarian renegade) series did it.

**** Just because people are lazy, doesn't mean the terms don't have merit.

There are a variety of charms that fit the way wards in other genres work and most of the Grimmauld place protections were primarily static charms. So long as they don't try to make it a singular topic, I can accept it.

Glamours on the other hand, I dislike heavily. While in canon appearance changes are done via transfiguration and potions, illusions seems like a more elegant solution, with a tiny basis in disillusionment charms. However, no one really does it well.

** Because there's no reason why they shouldn't exist in the Harry Potter universe. It's clear that they /don't,/ or at least that they're comparatively unreliable if they do, but it makes perfect sense that they would, and expanding or outright changing the magic system is part of the fun of reading/writing HP fics for a lot of people.

** For the same reason they mention notice-me-not charms, loyalty potions, grimoires, wards, and hundreds of other tropes.

Someone came up with it (often from another fandom) and people copy it because it's a good idea - or it's easier to use that idea than figuring out their own.

And you know what? That's ok. FF writers are amateurs. If they could come up with a ton of truly original content, they'd be professional writers.

** Probably it's people coming to Harry Potter from other fantasy worlds and assuming that in a world with so many other common fantasy tropes, they must exist there too.

On that note that is something I find personally interesting - how so many people for whom Harry Potter is their first, or only, fantasy text or series, I guess assume that JK Rowling invented /everything/ about the genre or that everything in the world of Harry Potter is completely original. (Not judging such people of course - everyone has their own background)

But in reality, so much of what we see in Harry Potter is influenced by, lifted from, or an ironic twist on some combination of either other fantasy literature, classic British children's literature, general classics of British literature (e.g. the words 'Hagrid' and 'Dumbledore' come from Thomas Hardy), and contemporary British society itself. I think, especially as the series has mainstreamed and the international audience has blossomed, those nuances and original sources and references are lost a little, or at least, aren't necessarily at the forefront of everyone's mind.

** In fanfiction canon is a springboard we use to tell a wider, deeper or entirely different story. The books hint heavily at a bigger magical society that treat magic like any other expanding technology. Exploring the magics we don't get to see in canon is a completely natural outcome here

To explain these newfound magical phenomena, an author would be smart to use words that already have a potential connection in her readers' mind.

Glamours, Oaths, Voodoo dolls, sympathetic or temporal connections, ley lines, Genius Loci and binding spirits are magical concepts that many readers will have /some/ idea of what it means, giving you another "springboard" to jump off of.

TL;DR. Using old words is easier than making up new ones

**** There is also the illusion cast over Hogwarts that makes muggles see a broken down ruin. One might make the leap that the crowd of people that always appears when someone is using the gateway to Platform 9 3/4 is another kind of illusion. As to why wizards would bother with charms and transfiguration when Glamours should cover their identity, there is a conceit that Glamours only affect muggles, so using them to sneak around in wizard places would be pointless.

***** During the Gringotts break-in? I thought he used polyjuice, but if not, I'd still argue that it was likely a combination of charms and transfiguration, as there doesn't seem to be illusion spells within the Harry Potter universe.

​

Edit: Let me correct that slightly, there doesn't seem to be wand magic illusions. Both creatures and concoctions seem capable of creating them.

*** The point they're trying to get at is all the fanfictions call it ‘glamour' instead of something else, even if ‘glamour' doesn't really fit it at all, since its definition is either something attractive or just magic itself.
