Like with Harry in a different house or more/other friends than just Ron and Hermione? Or anything that differs from how it happened in the books


** A complete rewrite of the HP series in a non-magical universe. Think super science and super spies. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]

** linkffn(13352687) This story actually features a Gryffindor Harry and will cover all seven years, which is something I've never seen before. In this story, he is actually driven and his introduction to the magical world comes in a very different way than in canon. This mixed with a more intense environment at Privet Drive changes his character quite a bit, and there is no golden trio in this fic. It's about to enter year 2 and will start uploading weekly every Sunday starting this one at least until the end of year 2.

linkffn(13507192) I know this story is super short currently, but it will also cover all seven years and features a Slytherin Harry who is more realistically effected by his home life, but not some dark lord in training either. This fic is a bit more heavy on the AU side. It will follow certain elements of canon, but Halloween, and more importantly, the events leading up to it in 1981 went very differently than they did in canon. This story updates every Saturday. Fair warning, it is a WBWL story and does contain a Female Voldemort, so if that's a turn off for you, there is that.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

** I dont have a link but there the r series. Like Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone retransmuted. It's good but a little to au for my tastes. To many ocs for instance. But really well written and has tonks being closet to Harry's age and going through school with him I think she was his age but cant remember
