I'm fairly new to the pairing and I'm struggling to find any decent ones. I've just read 'Unlike a Sister' only for it to turn out it's not completed ):

Anyway, looking for good quality Harmony fics. I prefer ones still set in school, but will read post-DH as well. I prefer long works though! :D

Thanks in advance


** linkffn(Vox Corporis) is one of my faves.

** linkffn(Screams Part One by clonserpents) is one of the best H/Hr series.

Stanrick tends to be verbose in a manner not usually found in fanfiction and this has some interesting effects on his characterizations, particularly where Harry is concerned. He's intelligent, but no more academically driven than his canon counterpart. In linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick) neither Harry nor Hermione are cursed with many of the faults brought on by adolescence, but I think the story is quite strong anyway. The characters make several references to important works in original fiction, which I think is quite satisfying, but others think breaks HP lore.

Lorien829 is frequently recommended on the subreddit, but I think linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) tends to put the romance a bit further ahead than the plot and the story is weaker than it should be. linkffn(Shadow Walks by Lorien829) does a better job of keeping the mystery and suspense separate from the will-they-or-won't-they cliche. It took me ages to read this one because I find song lyrics at the beginning of a story to be an instant turn off, but it's good despite this.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** Depends on what you like! I like the ones that make a conscious effort to stick close to canon---no bashing, no superpowers, no heavy-handed "correction" stuff. (I've always felt a weird, creepy vibe about robst, chemprof, and bobmin-type writers.)

My favorites are Full Pensieve's /The Last Horcrux/ (finished) and /The Years of Rebellion/ (huge and unfinished). They're on [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors]].

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is a great Book 6.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks) is a short, very unusual mystery with a weird metaphysical vibe.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Quest for Merlin's Blessing) is another one with a really unusual tone that I liked recently. It goes much farther than most H/Hr pics into all the reservations people have about the pairing---no romance, lots of anxiety and intensity, etc. The writing's a little rough but it has a very tight, interesting mystery at the center of it that's reminiscent of JKR.

/[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7149][Three Seasons to Closure]]/ is a nice, quiet romance fic set immediately post-war that gets overlooked because it's Portkey and FictionAlley only.

A guy named Gabilian wrote two pretty good Book 7s in the months before DH came out. The writing isn't quite as strong as some of my other favorites, but they're solid and under-read, because he was mostly an HPFF writer. linkffn(The Bottom of the Lake by Gabilian) and linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

** Just coming here to say if you restrict yourself to longer works, you'll miss out on some gems. Oneshots and short stories can have some of the best writing in fanfiction, and they tend to be completed since one chapter or 4 chapters is hard to stall out on and still post it.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

** Linkffn(Many Thanks) has Hermione traveling back to the Marauders Era and later has HPHG as told through James's eyes. It is one of my favourites.

 

Are you okay with AU? [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7325][Teacher's Pet]] has a Hermione that didn't grow up with Harry. I haven't finished it, but I really like it so far, and it is complete! Take note that is was written before DH came out. This is the summary: "After what both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger assume is only a one night stand, they are shocked to see each other at Auror Training- him as the instructor and her as the student. They decide to put what happened behind them and move forward, but will they be able to do that? Lavender Brown also struggles to show that she's not just a pretty face- but when Charlie Weasley shows up, will that put a stop to her plans? Ron Weasley deals with his long distance relationship with Luna Lovegood and pursuing a career path he's not sure will make him happy. Can everyone find a way to be happy, both in their personal and professional lives? Hermione went to Beauxbatons."

Surprised no one has mentioned [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/2119][Dirty Dancing]] yet. Its a good story, and morphs into one among the largest H/Hr sagas, spanning generations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4237967/1/Coming-To-Salem][Coming To Salem]] is also a good read, set in a totally A.U universe, and based on the movie "Coming to America"

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1601][Circle of Friends]] and its sequel [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1998][Sweet Home London]] are also good reads, again set in an AU universe, and based on movies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3255466][The List]] is a hilarious read, but can also get quite sentimental, and totally H/Hr.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A different halloween]] is an A.U take on how different Harry's life might have been if things had happened different that halloween. Other stories by this author are good as well, but after a while he can get repetitive.
