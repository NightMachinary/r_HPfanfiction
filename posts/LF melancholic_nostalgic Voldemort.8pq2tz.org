** linkffn(3766574) : Prince of the Dark Kingdom

Voldemort wins due to Harry's parents leaving the UK instead of fighting. They are killed by muggles, and Harry is sent back to live with the Dursleys. He ends up being taken to a orphanage for orphan witches/wizards and grows up in Voldermort's new kingdom whereupon Voldemort decides to make Harry his protege. Some of the better AU world building and scenes in HP fan fiction and has some "throne" scenes.

linkffn(11752324) : Limpieza De Sangre

Features a female Voldemort which is revealed to have different motivations, and personality, for why she did what she did than cannon Voldermort. So I don't know if this runs afoul of what you are interested in. But part of the story is devoted to her POV as she plots her rise post GOF resurrection and a large part of the overall story is devoted to Harry experiencing (a selectively edited) version of Voldemort's history via her repaired diary. In terms of believable character motivations and development, the use of foreshadowing, and original plot lines while avoiding contrivances this is the story to read.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
