Crossover Challenge: Karate Kid/HP

What if Miyagi had another student? An adult perhaps. In my thought process what if Remus had gone off to Okinawa where he meets Sato who trains him but then Sato sends Remus to Miyagi to learn more. After coming back into Harry's life Remus teaches him Miyagi-do karate. Harry then uses the meditative properties of Miyagi-do to improve his focus and occlumency. Oh and Harry has to deliver a crane kick to Voldemort's head.

Pairings: NO Ginny. Maybe Luna or Susan for Harry


** If we're talking bad 80s films with Rocky training motifs, one may as well have Connor Macleod of the Clan Macleod teach him sword fighting...

*** Clan MacLeod could be distant cousins of Clan McGonagall so yeah it would be possible.
