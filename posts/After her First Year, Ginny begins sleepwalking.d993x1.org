Nobody recognises that Ginny is sleepwalking at first because she seems fully aware of her surroundings, is having understandable but somewhat odd and concerning conversations with various people, and wakes up the next day without complaints. It's only when someone tries continuing a conversation that she started the night before that they realise something is off, because she can't remember it taking place.


** Followup - it is sleepwalking Ginny who tries out for and successfully earns a place on the Quidditch team as a Chaser. Ginny herself is desperately trying to hide the fact that she's only really good as a Beater.
