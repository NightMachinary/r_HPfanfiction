i got this idea by playing the game Nioh, but i dont have any idea how to transport it into the Present HP universe. One of the HP Characters somehow gets to Japan (or other Regions of the rising Sun) and gets to work together with the Agents/Ministry of them. If the Main character is male then maybe he would get teamed up with a Female agent and over time they become confidants....possibly even Lovers (with or without romantic aspects). A Female MC would also be fine.

But as i said, my Problem is that i can hardly imagine Death eaters in Japan, as i asociate them with Voldemort or more specific, British "Problems". Also i have the image of the Japanese People be more "trusted" with Magic, so they would even practise Wandless Magic (after all, in many Japanese Media magic is perform by scrolls and seals. They hardly have Wands).

Cho is so far the only asian Person we know.

If i imagine the Magical People join Japan and fight Yokai with Wands and spells....i think, they would have pretty easy Jobs, since Yokai/Oni are no Humans, so no Moral obstacle in using the Killing Curse....on the other Hand, if the HP People lose their Wands, they are helpless.

On the other Hand...als the Magical Creatures are basically the "Yokai" of the magical World.

​

Anyway, i wanted to know Fics from the HP universe cooperate with the Asian one. If for example Harry gets the order to join the eastern Forces for assistance and gets a female "Guidance" who might introduce him to the culture and rules. They would over time gain each others Trust and possibly become Lovers....but no requirement on that.

But somehow, i could really imagine Harry and Ginny (or other wife/Partner) getting intim with the Agent.

​

It can be vice-versa, so the Japanese join Britain, but since in Nioh, you play a British character who travels to Japan, i thought of something similar might happen in HP.

Except it is not. The Patil Twins, and Sue Li exists.

*** In the US, "Asian" means east Asian for some reason. Brown people don't exist /s

** Not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, but give Sun Source a try. Linkffn (The Sun Source). Harry gets raised in one of the koreas (I think north, but in secret, not as a part of the government or anything). So he's heavily influenced by that culture and is also fairly overpowered.

** If memory serves, there was a fic back on HPFanfiction.org waaay back in the day, I think it was called High Octane, which had Albus Potter competing in Japan for the Triwizard Tournament.

In the fic the Tournament was between different schools each year rather than always the three European ones.

** If you don't mind crossovers, this is really well written, and its still within the "realm" of magic from HP, but with more shit going on, multiple magical systems, both because of origin and race. linkffn(FILFY Teacher).

** There's much Harry x Harem buildup, and much of the team up is behind the scenes, but I think linkffn(HP & The Jade Dragon) qualifies.
