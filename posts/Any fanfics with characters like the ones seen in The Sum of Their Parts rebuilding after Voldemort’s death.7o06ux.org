Okay so I know it's impossible to find a fanfic like linkffn(Sum of Their Parts) but are there any fanfics with characters like the ones in the Sun of Their Parts?

Characters who are jaded and cynical and untrusting, all dealing with PTSD following Voldemort's reign and the Battle of Hogwarts. A Golden Trio who knows how to choose their battles when arguing together, who are still close and who deal with PTSD. I'd like to see the rebuild of the wizarding world of England with realistic characters.


** I can't think of anything that perfectly fits your request, but I'll give you a couple that hit a subset of your asks.

linkffn(The First Day by little0bird) - A truly excellent post-hogwarts, reconstruction fic centered primarily on Harry's experience with moving on with his life.

- Jaded, cynical, and untrusting - Mostly no
- PTSD following Voldemort - Mostly yes
- Golden Trio still close - Yes
- Rebuilding - Yes

linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin) isn't as good of a match, but is tonally similar, although much darker in atmosphere. Post-Hogwarts fic about Harry's life as an Auror after his wife, Luna, is killed. One of my favorites, and extremely well written.

- Jaded, cynical, and untrusting - YES
- PTSD following Voldemort - Mostly yes
- Golden Trio still close - 50/50
- Rebuilding - No

  Ten years later. All was well ... until Harry's wife dies under suspicious circumstances. Harry will not rest until he has vengeance. Neville is tasked by the Ministry with uncovering the truth before the Chosen One does something he will regret ...

** I like the post Voldemort political shenanigans in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994). It's strong AU though. As for your criteria:

Not trusting: yes, the situation was extremely volatile after Voldemort's defeat. The Minister was trying hard to undermine the Trio, extremists on both sides were trying to keep fighting, and hostile foreign powers were trying to carry out sabotage.

PTSD: Pretty bad for everyone involved in combat

The Trio was extremely close, especially after Voldemort went down.

Rebuilding: yes, as they significantly reformed Magical Britain's government.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
