Unfortunately, I wasn't aware HPFF had planned on shutting down until it shut down after I had finished this fic. Not quite sure if this is the right place to ask but does anyone by chance have the documents or maybe even an obscure link to the two sequels of "Running With Wolves: The Journals and Correspondences of Cerridwyn Lupin" by Aurora Dawn?


** Ive been looking for this for weeks! I had thought about downloading it but I just didn't get the time with finals. I heard that people are planning on resurrecting HPFF but until then we'll keep looking

*** I do have the first story in the series downloaded as I was reading it during commute and I'd be happy to share it with you, just missing the rest of the series which is such a shame because it was very well written!
