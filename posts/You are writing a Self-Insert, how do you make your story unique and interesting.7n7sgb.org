** A story with the SI/OC ignoring the magical world and simpy taking advantage of magic to do something in the real world. I don't care if he is an antiques repair man, a detective, or just a teenager abusin the mind arts to get laid and rich.

Seriously, it's like every SI/OC is obsessed with fixing the magic world or harry potter.

** This really depends on whether I am a child joining Harry in Hogwarts, an OC or an established character. As a child you would only be able to influence the events by befriending Harry and telling him about the coming events, pretending to be a seer.

OC depends on age and position so the question is too open for a general answer. Am I even in Harry's generation?

An established character has a similar problem. If I am Charlie Weasley I have different paths open to me compared to being Nymphadora Tonks or Hooch. But you bet your ass that I am reporting the Dursleys for child abuse (and if the timeline is past PoA the DMLE gets a note on Mrs Weasley concerning her accessory to child abuse because she did not report Harry's situation.)

But one thing you must not forget that any SI would try out all kinds of magical stuff before following their own agenda. Riding a broom for example. And I can guarantee you that 95% of all people here would take polyjuice to experience sex from the other gender's PoV.

** First you need to decide what the story's central theme is. Why is your character sent back? To fix things and be amazing is an answer, but it's kind of a boring one that's been done before. Stories without conflict are pretty boring, so you need to decide what the central conflict is and make sure the theme fits. For my own SI, the theme has to do with faith, fate, and family, and the central conflict is not in finding solutions to problems, but in having faith that solutions can be found and perceiving even when things don't go to plan.

Next, who is your SI? I am personally against the body hijacking trope, but some people like it. The fundamental problem of the body hijacking trope is that people have certain expectations for canon characters are you are just not as interesting as they are. You're better off doing time travel. I also find it boring to have an adult come back as a kid. I was a kid once, it wasn't fun. You also wouldn't act like a child and most of the time adults key into troubling unchildlike behavior and figure something is very wrong. Personally I think if you are doing an SI you should have yourself show up in some form.

Finally, you need to make sure that this isn't just a canon rehash. Go somewhere interesting. Meet new and exciting people. Have your SI (even unintentionally) radically alter the situation to the point where canon is utterly obliterated. You could off handedly mention splitting your soul makes you nuts, and convince Riddle to pursue a radically different approach to immortality. You could become Hermione's friend, and make it so she never befriends Harry and instead goes to you on the night of the troll. You could explain to Arthur Weasley how a rubber duck works, and accidentally lead him to discover how to make a kick ass rubber duck monstrosity that takes over the wizarding world. Just make it new and unique.

Oh, and figure out your tone. Some SIs should just be lighthearted romps, others SUPER SERIOUS drama pieces. Your tone should match the theme as a OP power fantasy shouldn't be taken all that seriously, but a lost and alone character that no one takes seriously could live out a serious mad prophet drama.

** I would read a SI story where you never see the inserted character's point of view. Instead, you get the POV of everyone around them. The whole "I'm a wizard, fuck me" is getting stale.

** As I said in the other SI thread, a main feature of an SI is to give an outside view of the world. With that in mind don't just make an SI who is friends with the main characters and interacts with canon events. Put them in a different year/different house/different generation and have them explore aspects of canon that are underdeveloped.

Give them their own motivations. "Help Harry", "defeat Voldemort" or "keep Sirius alive" aren't motivations for an actual living character in the HPverse. Those are the desires of a fan who wants to fix canon and give their characters a happy ending. Instead pick genuine aspirations for your SI.

Pick an interesting backstory. Canon has showed us the wizarding world from the point of view of an orphan, a muggleborn and a poor family, through Harry, Hermione and Ron respectively. We don't really need to see that again. What does the average pureblood or halfblood deal with as they grow up? What about someone who grew up in a different country, or someone whose family worked in the private sector of the wizarding world? There is so much to explore in the HPverse that restricting yourself to canon events is a waste.

Specialise your character. Being amazing at everything is unrealistic and painful to read. Being really good at one aspect of magic is much more believable and opens up pathways for your character. What would a potioneer do after Hogwarts? What about an enchanter, or a diviner, or a ward expert? If your problems get solved by casting a stronger Stupefy or some super spell that only you know, then you are wasting the writing potential of the HP world.

** Find a different conflict to focus on besides the Voldemort war. Change the world to be less like Rowling's.

At the end of the day, you're just an OC narrating in the first person.

** This is mostly what I would do if I was dropped into the harry potter world as a SI

I wouldn't interfere with harry and his friends and there adventures I would do my best to get into Ravenclaw were my Quirkiness from being a SI would be less noticeable. Then abuse the Room of Requirement for all its worth until harry and his Friends start using it in Fifth year.

I would be more interesting in magic than People and try to mimic magics from my favourite manga and cartoons. after all who doesn't want to fly like the People from Dragon ball Z or use Kurohitsugi from bleach on the giants in the battle of Hogwarts.

With the more benign things that I mimicked I would probably use the Room of Requirement to help Write Books that teaches how to do it so that I could sell them and have a constant source of income. and spend the rest of my life there Creating and selling as many magics from manga and cartoons as I could. Doing my best to trigger a magical renaissance.

The conflict would probably come from vested interests like The broom making company's Trying to take revenge on My SI after all he did just cost them a lot of money.

** Magical world is dumb. Voldemort had the right idea about controlling them. Canon events and different reactions showed that their world was utterly ripe for someone to grab it, control it and mold it in his shape.

SI should try to use it for his advantage. MoD Harry was a loyal lap dog. That guy was attached to a man who he spent only 1 month with during summer break. Use him.

Albus Dumbledore is a pretty passive sucker. Accidents shouldn't be that hard! How about something nasty 'accidentally' killing Albus during one of twins pranks?

Give me a human like character that isn't childishly right or wrong, morally rigid to core or obsessed to make 'good' side win. If I was in that world and had the foreknowledge I would manipulate everyone and everything for a Minister Sulmil003 era.
