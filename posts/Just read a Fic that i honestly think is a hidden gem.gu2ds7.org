​

While i don't usually like the harry heir or all bloodlines and all that nonsense, this fic is an interesting idea taking the history of the potter family from the start and shows you how it could happen through out the time that they affect the history of the wizarding world.

​

Many times while reading fics showing harry inheriting the vaults of his family and having journals of them, it isn't really improved upon, so it is a new way of presenting that i enjoyed, while also giving a good bit of world building that can fit in quite well, though i have to say the ending was a bit disappointing for me due to the gender thing, but i'd say it is negligible.

Tell me what you guys think of this one?
