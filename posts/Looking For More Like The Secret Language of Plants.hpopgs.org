I just finished the Secret Language of Plants series by Endrina and I absolutely loved it. I need more like that in my life! I'm not picky about pairings, or even which era it's in (Marauder's, pre-war, post-war, time travel, whatever! Any are welcome!)

For anyone who hasn't read it, the entire series is ah-mazing and you should definitely give it a chance if nothing else. It's a lot wholesome, occasional risque scenes that are brief but tasteful, and otherwise just very well written and wrapped up nicely.

** I love that series. And it's utterly unique, I think. The only fic I've read which remind me of it at all is the Boys of Crowhill series. It just gives me the same wholesome vibe, and has Harry be sort've raised by Remus. might be worth checking out! linkao3(5418194)

*** Thank you! It sounds pretty interesting, so I'm going to give it a shot today! I agree, that series was very different from what I've read before, and maybe the characters were all a little more silly than they normally would be, but I chalked that up to them being raised in more loving homes and growing with confidence and comfort in who they were as people. It was sweet and complex, yet still able to be set within the darkness of a war. The writer really did a great job!

** I was also going to rec The Boys of Crowhill. linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is a good Snape mentors/raises Harry fic. You might also enjoy linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) which is a similar vibe.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Is it her style you're interested in or the topics?

I've got a banging headache at the moment, but can have a look later if it's topic. I've not really found a match for style.

*** It's both. I do love the style in that she seems to keep cause and effect in mind while writing, and her characters seem believable in their development and resulting personalities. At the same time I also enjoyed the topic of Harry being spared the abusive upbringing and having a better situation than canon Harry. I think at this point in my fanfiction reading life I've just seen so much of the hurt/comfort and manipulation themes that something like this series has been a real breath of fresh air.
