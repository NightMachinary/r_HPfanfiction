** I personally like Nerves - a physical conduit for thought to be made manifest in reality. Also, nerves make a good control structure for your soul to use your body as a meat puppet (and I really like the idea of brains controlling flesh robots. It makes biology more awesome.)

** Blood's the classic answer, but I could also see bone as an interesting path to take, as it seems to follow naturally from the folklore around certain types of wood or certain stones being sources of magical powers. Muscle... I just don't /feel/ it, y'know? Seems more a sci-fi idea than a fantasy one, if I had to put it into words. As for bone marrow, there's little objective difference between that option and the "bone" one, save that the bone one is cooler because it allows for the bones of long-dead, but famously powerful, wizards to become much-sought-after treasures.

** Personally, none of them. I would argue that magic comes from the soul, in part as a way to explain why ghosts are only of wizards and witches that died, but not muggles.

** How about from the cells themselves? But from the ones you mention I personally like Bone marrow the best.

**** Ah yes. You are probably right about that...

â€‹

Like a cringe every time a story brings up a magical core that somehow gets stronger as one age, like this was Naruto or the alike.

** Sperm to make it interesting.

Men are magical batteries as soon as they go through puberty. Higher sperm count, more magic that they supply. So women have sex to get sperm in them and then use it to make spells.

It's a blatant excuse for smut.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
