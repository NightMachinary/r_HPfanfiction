I'm still here, still manages to leave me in awe, no matter how many times I re-read it again. IMO, iy is the best action adventure and OP harry fic I've ever read. The great theories and the way the action scenes were written. Too too good. I really really wish this gets and update soon. And hope Kathryn is doing good.

** Yes. She writes beautifully. I am currently hoping for an update on her HP/Star wars story.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** All the fics of Kathryn that I have read were amazing. "Powerfull Magical Artifact" is one of my all time favourite fics despite only having one chapter.
