Alternatively someone as Seamus or Lavender or whomever travel and they just hang around noticing what shenanigans Tom Riddle's up to.

Any fics about that?


** I wouldn't expect Tom Riddle to bully tbh. He seems like he's running around with a nice facade but keeps distance because he thinks of himself as superior.

*** Well you get the gist of it. I don't think Tom Riddle would come across as a bully but he'd be the brains behind the cruel pranks. Even as Voldemort he rarely does the dirty work when Harry isn't involved but instead allows the Death Eaters to be the bullies.
