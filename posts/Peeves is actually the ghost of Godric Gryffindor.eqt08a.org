Gryffindor was supposed to be brave and reckless and brilliant in battle. As a ghost he likes to train people to be alert and aware of their surroundings by constantly bombarding them with stink bombs, water balloons and other jokes.

He was a man that loved to explore and as a ghost he makes life hell for the care taker that hates kids having fun, this also makes Filch too busy to catch all the kids sneaking around at night.


** Very original!

** If so, then the Bloody Baron would need to be the ghost of Slytherin in this story because who else would Gfyffindor be afraid of?

**** Crossdressing ghost of delores umbridge.

I cannot think of anything more terrifying... except for a thing called DElores Filch. A hybrid of Filch and Umbridge.

*** I think I read that one too. Wasn't Mrs. Norris Ravenclaw, the hat Gryffindor, and Harry Slytherin? It was a bit surreal.

** Ok, but JKR said: "Peeves isn't a ghost; he was never a living person. He is an indestructible spirit of chaos, and solid enough to unscrew chandeliers, throw walking sticks and, yes, chew gum."

**** To be fair, JKR was clear from the start peeves was a poltergeist, not a ghost. Which funnily enough lines up with Paranormal theory, in that Poltergeists are classified as a psychic phenomenon; rather than a haunting.
