All I remember is that once a wizard or witch found their one true love, they could share thoughts and communicate in there minds. I think it was mostly about Luna. Does anyone have any idea what this was?


** I think you're gonna have to be more specific, that's most romance fics. Do you remember what website you read it on? Any main characters besides Luna? Hogwarts-based? So on and so forth .

*** Is communicating with your soul mate in your minds common in fanfic?

I think it was from Luna's point of view. It was after Hogwarts and it wasn't AU. I read it on fanfiction.net

**** I'm not sure about that specific communication, but there are loads of soul mate stuff so I don't know. Anyway, was it specifically romance or something like adventure cause if it was romance we can just use filters on FFN. You read it in English right? Also was it complete and what was the rating?
