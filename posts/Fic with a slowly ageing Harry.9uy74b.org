This has been bothering me for about a week but I can't find it in my history or in my FFN favourites (which possibly means this will be on AO3 but that isn't definite).

I remember that the fic opens with something (possibly a Death Eater attack) on Hogwarts, and Harry comes running to help repel them. However, he looks like a child despite being in his 6th or 7th year. He gets very frustrated that people don't treat him seriously because of how he looks. I can't remember why he ages so slowly, but it /might/ have been a Doctor Who crossover with him growing at the pace of a Time Lord rather than a human.

Normally I'd feel this description was completely inadequate, but I don't remember ever seeing a scene that was even remotely similar, so I hope it's enough.

*** If I come across it myself I'll definitely let you know~ it feels pretty unlikely I'll find it again by myself, though.

** This really does sound familiar. Did it have the Weasley twins as his friends? I seem to recall them joking about how by the time he was 20 or 30 or something that he'd finally look old enough to start dating.

*** That does sound very familiar, and I think we're talking about the same fic... I'm no closer to working out what the fic actually is, though!

*** From my quick skim he appears to be aging at the normal rate :( thanks, though!

**** Definitely wouldn't have been that, but you should read that if you haven't. It's great.

**** I can definitely say it wasn't /Oh God Not Again/, as I've read that fic several times.

** Might be linkffn(10552390). Harry doesn't age due to a magical mishap from being stuck in Sword Art Online.

*** I know which story you're talking about, but I'm quite certain they aren't the same one. Good idea, though! In the one I'm trying to find I'm quite sure that Harry is at school for the whole 7 years, only gets scars from his usual Hogwarts shenanigans and doesn't grow very quickly the whole time he is at school.

** It could be Fates Gamble, a crossover with FSN, I'm on mobile and have no idea how to link it

*** I'm quite certain it isn't this as I've read it before - the one I'm thinking of had better writing style. Don't get me wrong, Fate's Gamble is one of the few stories I really enjoyed despite issues with the writing - every chapter felt like the author had fun writing it. The one I'm looking for though didn't have this. Harry also looked relatively normal apart from the age thing.

** I'm writing a fic like this, but nothing like what you're talking about has become evident in the plot yet. Would be very interested to read it though.
