** Sorry for the late reply, the author has actually made a printable version of the first book [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1Aygebqhd5kqLFsB0YIr78c3zCob8vV/view][here.]]

[[https://inverarity.livejournal.com/379402.html][Here are his instructions]] on how you can print out a bound copy for yourself. It will cost you about $13 at the cheapest (none of this money goes to him, it just covers the printing service).

Some people are in the process of helping him prepare the second book, but due to its size that book is going to be extremely expensive and maybe impossible for individual people to print out. He's said he wants to avoid any sort of legal trouble, so these are apparently just going to his family and friends for free.

As other people have said he has epubs for all his books available on a google drive linked on his website. There are also PDF copies for his books and of course you can always download an epub from AO3.

** Epub versions here (the author's google drive): [[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9qcfTywE-ZeQXlfeWZXakE4R28]]

Or just print the website. Or use A03's download as a pdf function and print those

** I've seen people do this with fanfics they love. There are services online where you can supply the text and they'll print it as a book for you and ship it to you.

I think [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/aigrte/printing_a_fanfiction_in_book_form/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][this post]] might help you look at some options of doing that.

That's the easiest option I believe. I have seen crafty people print out their own copies and bind it themselves if you're interested in that.

Edit: if you are going to pay to have it printed I would recommend getting it printed as a book by one of those services because at least then it will be book sized and comfortable for reading. Printing 8.5x11 size pages of the fic is also going to cost you assuming you'll have to pay for all the paper and ink you go through, but it would be weird to take a giant stack of papers with you anywhere you want to read it. Just my opinion!
