Is there a ff where Hermione originally thinks someone calling her a mudblood is because she's black? It'd be a pretty funny scene to read Or She reacts like purebloods assume her mud is brown so she slits her wrists in the great hall or something to prove a point. Let me know if you know of a ff with either of these scenes or something similar!


** Not that I know; it's seem a little OOC for Hermione to make such a silly misunderstanding...

...However, there IS a scene in "Reign of the Serpent" (an AU where wizards are split into castes, with "Serpents" on top and the "Mudbloods" as the lowest of the low) where she, along with Dean and Justin, makes a plot to "come out" as Mudbloods before Malfoy can expose them, and so they make a grand spectacle of it by cutting themselves in the Great Hall and showing off that their blood is just as red as everyone else's. They even get Harry, Neville and Ron in on it to compare blood colours.

It's actually a pretty cool scene.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Isolation (a dramione fic) has Hermione cut herself and mix her blood with Draco's. Much to his disgust and dismay. Linkffn(Isolation)

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.
