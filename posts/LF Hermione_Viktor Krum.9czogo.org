** I have fond memories of Dominance by Guynelle, but you have to take it with a grain of salt. Concept was sweet and I liked the characterisation, but it suffers from certain grammatical problems which can detract from the story somewhat. ffnlink (4814915).

It's set post war but is not DH compliant. Hermione lives with only her young daughter, and is just friends with Harry and Ron. For some reason Viktor is obsessed with Turkish coffee, which I have since learned is delicious.

Having said the above, I'm sure there are better written H/V stories out there. I'd like to hear what they are too.
