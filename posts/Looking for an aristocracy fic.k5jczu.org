Looking for a high society/aristocracy fic preferably Jily but I'm happy with any (including OCs)

I love Petal in the Rain (set in 1940's, hogwarts students are lords and ladies, witch weekly writes gossip articles about them) and am looking for something similar to the second half of the fic.Really just want a fic about high society life where theres public speculation about relationships and their parties are photographed for tabloids and everything is dramatic.


** I have an idea for a fic like that.

First, you have Snape and Hermione, looking for a place to shag, catching Harry and Ginny shagging in an abandoned classroom. It later turns out that "Ginny" is actually Harry under Polyjuice and "Harry" is actually Draco. Hermione drinks a potion that gives her a [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], and she and Snape join in. Snape uses his wand to [[/spoiler][CENSORED]] her [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], but it turns out that Draco (disguised as Harry) is too [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], so they drink another potion to [[/spoiler][CENSORED]] their [[/spoiler][CENSORED]] and proceed to [[/spoiler][CENSORED]] instead. That's about when Ron comes in, with Ginny (the real one), who immediately goes for Hermione's [[/spoiler][CENSORED]], which would be a problem, but thanks to the Geminio Charm, there's enough for everyone, and while she is at it, Ron [[/spoiler][CENSORED]] Ginny right in the [[/spoiler][CENSORED]]. By then, the Polyjuice begins to wear off.

Now, Hagrid, Dumbledore, and Lucius Malfoy are watching all this...

Anyway, you know what I'm calling this fic? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats]["The Aristocrats."]] (link SFW).

**** Well, if you insist, my original outline had Dobby and Fluffy involved as well (because, hey, three mouths!). I had cut them because I thought it would be offensive, but I would be happy to put them back in.

*** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Aristocrats][The Aristocrats]]*

"The Aristocrats" is a taboo-defying off-color joke that has been told by numerous stand-up comedians since the vaudeville era. It relates the story of a family trying to get an agent to book their stage act, which is revealed to be remarkably vulgar and offensive in nature, with the punch line revealing that they incongruously bill themselves as "The Aristocrats". When told to audiences who know the punch line, the joke's humor depends on the described outrageousness of the family act.Because the objective of the joke is its transgressive content, it is most often told privately, but it came to wider public attention when it was told by Gilbert Gottfried during the Friars' Club roast of Hugh Hefner, a few days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. It was the subject of a 2005 documentary film of the same name by Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette.
