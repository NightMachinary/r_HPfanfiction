I have recently found a Fanfic That has Intrigued me [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27684620/chapters/67749614]]

the Pair seems to be Regulus Black/Harry Potter Of course since it's not complete I'm kinda in the mood for more. So I wondering if anybody Had any fics ( Completed obviously)

Preferably Time Travel but anything else is fine.

Also I found A Fanfic that was Supposed to be Slash Between Harry Potter/Gellert Grindelwald.

I think it was supposed to Be one of those like redo Fics (Kinda like Tomarry)

And Harry was supposed to Raise Gellert I lost the Fanfic But I am looking for more, Once again Completed fics.


** I would like to see more of Delphine riddle/Harry Potter. The fiction world needs more of these pairing.

** My favorite rare pair is Harry/Andromeda as seen in AppoApples linkffn(What We Lost by AppoApples). (It's being edited, archived completed [[https://web.archive.org/web/20201102175110/https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13724079/1/What-We-Lost][original.]] )

For unusual slash pairings the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Delphi/works?fandom_id=136512][Delphi]] is certainly up there. (Snape/Filch, Snape/Aberforth/McGonagall and so on).

**** Linkao3(face death in the hope by lullabyknell) is certainly headed in that direction and is a well written time travel fic. Not complete unfortunately. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][link]]

  Tucked under Regulus's arm was an old, hand bound book in a deep maroon. Embossed on the frayed leather were the words, 'The Purest Art of the Patronus: A guide to defending with Light'. Unlike the books in the Black Library, Sirius couldn't feel the oily oppressiveness of Dark Magic. If the title hadn't given it away, the Magic definitely would have.The book was pure Light Magic. Wherein Sirius questions the facts he thought he knew and Regulus fails to hate.
