I have yet to see a well-written fic about this but even from the less well-written ones I think it can see how it can be an interesting dynamic-both are outspoken characters and Ginny has an IDGAF attitude. In Draco/Hermione among their peers it seems like the main obstacle is Ron. If he dates Ginny Draco would have to deal with 6 brothers, at least 3 of whom hate him. Also I feel like Ginny would be less willing to put up with Draco's crap than other female characters. In the "Changeling" she develops a curiosity with Malfoy and it would have been interesting to see it develop into more-than-friends, not that they'd be endgame in that story.

I'm just saying it could make for interesting stories. Draco's still an asshole and in canon for some reason the "Weasley is our king" song bothers me more than almost anything else he does.


** It would depend how AU the story was for me. I don't think you can redeem draco well in a year or two. Even tho I'm mostly in the scare kid who didn't know how to deal with the situations he was in camp, I believe it would take big changes for him to break out of that.

** That is actually one of my favourite non-canon pairings to read! You need a lot of character development but the dynamic can be really interesting considering their family histories and mutual dislike of one another.

** You'd need a very AU Draco, canon Draco clearly considers the Weasley's not just blood traitors, but something much worse, poor people and certainly isn't dating any of them.\\
Then there's the fact that even outside of that he's a cowardly little arsehole with little in the way of redeeming qualities, so why would anyone ever like him.

Assuming Draco is sufficiently changed then I guess it could work, Ginny certainly wouldn't let the fact her entire family hates someone stop her dating them (might even consider a point in his favour).

** Idea here. What if, hear me out, Ginny was tired of having so many brothers? What does she do? Perhaps try to get disowned. How does she do it? Convince Draco to date her.

Think about it. Ginny is a stubborn Firebrand. The idea pops into her head, and she keeps up with it out of stubbornness, just to piss off her family. A family that doesn't disown her, but tries to get her away from him. After a while, they both actually fall for each other and don't realize it for months.

*** honestly reading this post I thought this could definitely be a legit motivation for both of them - dating each other to spite their families (for whatever reason). there have certainly been flimsier and less believable premises for fake relationship/relationship of convenience!

**** From relationship of convenience to a legit one. I've actually seen it work for twelve years and counting. They're married and the husband hasn't realized they're not pretending anymore.

*** True. Maybe they could have a FWB relationship where Ginny 'loves' and leaves him and Draco is left crying pathetically.

** Draco is a disgusting little piece of crap bully.

The probability of him getting together with Ginny(or Hermione or anyone he thought lesser of and hence bullied whenever he felt like it) is about the same as becoming first wizard on the moon purely by his own work.

**** Not sure. Most likely it's the whole Romeo/Juliet scenario. On the other hand there are very few stories in which I like Ginny in the first place. ðŸ˜… They exist but they are rare.

She's in my eyes too much of a 0815 fangirl that had the potential to be a great character but was too underused by JKR. (It's kinda of of the reasons why I'm a Harmony-fan besides being a sucker for the best-friends-turned-lovers scenarioðŸ˜…)

***** Agree, Ginny's good in fics until Harry shows up. She herself is a great character and her family provides plenty of interest
