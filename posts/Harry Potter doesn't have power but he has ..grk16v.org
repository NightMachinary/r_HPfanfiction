Harry is not as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort but he has the precision to make up for it. Power is the bruteforce way of making something happen, bruteforcing tranfiguration,for example, works and that is wat all students do. Using precision means less power usage and it is easier to do one you can master it. Dumbledore and voldemort have spent years cultivating their precission even if they dont know it but harry potter can do it almost prodigiously. He is more precise even though he does not have voldemort level power.

He cannot do spells like the Fedelius, or the water ball thing that dumbledore did, or any other really demanding magic that dumbledore can do. But he has a lot of controll over the things that he does


** so hes just really powerful

*** No he is not powerful, he is very precise . He cannot cast those spells like the fedelius or the spells which needs a lot power. he can control the spells he can do, better.

**** Like the fact that he can hit spells in midair with his own spells. Read a fic where he got sucked to another dimension and everyone was so impressed and awed by his skill.

** So he doesn't have the juice but his control is so good he can make many things happen because he's so efficient?

So he's a Water Dancer to Dumbledore's Mountain? Or Itachi to Dumbledore's Naruto?

This can be more OP than actually having superior "brute force", because against brute force you can at least /dodge./

** ABC kinda does this. Harry has mastered summoning and banishing to an insane degree of precision that he can poke someone's eye without blinding them.

He can do Fidelius, but not the other super powerful transfiguration or explosion stuff.

Another one is linkffn(Wind Shear). Harry is a transfiguration master specializing in animation. Doesn't do anything else. Just banishers, reductors, cutters, and animates the shit out of wood and stone.
