** The Hogwarts Letters are sent in envelopes, clearly enough. I /think/ this is mentioned at some point, but if nothing else, I don't think Muggle-raised Harry would so readily have recognized his as a letter when it first arrived otherwise.

It may be that /some/ letters in the Wizarding World are sent as scrolls, mind you. Could be that the Hogwarts Letters only look as they do in order not to endanger the Statute when they're delivered to Muggle-borns. But I think that's a fairly unlikely supposition in the absence of other evidence.

*** I ctrl-F'd for "scroll", "roll of parchment" and "envelope" in PDFs of the books and ran the numbers. Numbers might be off since these copies look like they were OCR'd and might be bolloxed up in places.

tl;dr: Everyone uses envelopes until around GoF/OotP. Then, personal mail gets sent as a scroll, official mail gets sent in envelopes. I only counted stuff sent by owl, but tons of people hand-deliver scrolls of parchment (Slug Club and Dumbles invitations) in HBP.

PS:

- Envelopes: *(1)* Harry's Hogwarts letters

CoS:

- Envelopes: *(5)* Dobby's intercepted letters, Hogwarts letters, Ron's Howler, Lockhart's fanmail, Filch's Kwikspell letter

PoA:

- Envelopes: *(5)* Ron's letter to Harry, Hogwarts letter, Neville's Howler, Hagrid's letter to Harry, Sirius's letter to Harry

GoF:

- Envelopes: *(3)* World Cup letter from Ron, Hermione's hate mail (incl. Bubotuber pus), Twins' blackmail to Bagman

- Scrolls: *(1)* Sirius's letter to Harry

OoTP:

- Envelopes: *(6)* Ministry letters to Harry, Dumbles's Howler to Petunia, Hogwarts letters, Lockhart's fanmail, Rita Skeeter's letter to Hermione, Harry's letters from Quibbler readers

- Scrolls: *(4)* Order letters to Harry (described as "roll of parchment"), Harry writing to Sirius/Ron/Hermione, Percy's letter to Ron, Sirius's intercepted letter to Harry

HBP:

- Envelopes: *(1)* Hogwarts letters

- Scrolls: *(1)* Dumbles's letter to Harry

DH:

- No relevant results! (RIP Hedwig)

*** It also provides a marketable method of protection for letters. Envelopes with basic protection against weather seem like any easy product to sell.

**** Good point. Though on the other hand, one could argue that a reason the Wizarding World might forego envelopes and just send bound scrolls is precisely that protection charms exist, and could be cast directly on the parchment.

***** Wasn't there a plot point in the fifth book about the Ministry hunting and stealing letters from Hedwig?

Yes, it's shown and discussed in Chapter 17: Educational decree 24 and continued throughout chapter 18: Dumbledores Army.

****** Sure, but are those letters described as being Muggle-style letters in envelopes? The question isn't whether letters are a thing. They obviously are. It's whether they come in the form of scrolls, or are basically identical to the things Muggles use.

******** Ah, I see. Well, when I and [[/u/MannOf87]] spoke of "protection", we didn't mean protection against being read by other people than the intended target; it was a much more prosaic matter of protecting it against damage from the elements.

*** I'm ~90% certain that the Howler Ron gets in /CoS/ came in a red envelope. I cannot think of a single other case (beyond the Howler, Hogwarts letters and letters from the Ministry) that talk about letters via owls coming in envelopes. I'm equally as certain we never see a letter delivered as a scroll.

​

Actually, even before posting this comment, I recalled and then looked up the following section from /CoS/

#+begin_quote
  “Have you been stopping my letters?”

  “Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.
#+end_quote

Ron and Hagrid both sent Harry letters during the summer that used envelopes.

Envelopes, not scrolls.

** It seems like letters are on flat pieces of parchment, and longer essays (and perhaps more traditional paperwork) is done on scrolls.

*** Well, any piece of parchment can become a scroll if it's long enough. A scrolls just means it's been rolled up instead of lying flat.

** From what I remember it's probably just a matter of formality. Hogwarts and ministry letters would come in official envelopes, while memos and casual messages would scrolls.

Length could also be a factor. Small papers or ones with multiple items would be harder to roll, thus the need for an envelope.

** Delta they are ENVELOPES! :) Yes it says so in Book 1!

#+begin_quote
  The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H .
