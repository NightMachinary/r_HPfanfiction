Looking for a clarification because I'm gonna write a fanfic set during PoA.

We know what Harry and Hermione did in order to save Sirius but how exactly did Hermione time travel during the school year?

For example in chapter 6 we have the trio going to Divination, then Trasfiguration and lunch. Once there Hermione says that Arithmancy was better but how and when did she time travel?


** Hermione basically slipped off when they weren't looking and came back at the same time she left. There's a few occurrences of her showing up looking breathless, or suddenly not being with them when they thought she was and showing up down the corridor

** People commenting here are totally right. It's the causality principle, you can't change the past with a time-turner, if you try, as Hermione said "terrible things happen".

The interesting thing is that the only way they knew to use the time-turner, is because they've already done it. Since the timeline in PoA is constant, immutable, they couldn't have even thought of using of the time turner if they haven't already time-turned into the past before. It's a self contained system and probably why time-turners are so regulated, if you tried to delve from the past's script, you are going to cause a paradox, which would cause the "terrible things" consequences.

Therefore she just went to classes, time turned in a corridor, went to another class and appeared the moment or not very long after she disappeared and near the same place, so as not to alarm anyone.

Of course it's full of plot holes and requires you to suspend your disbelief, but it's Prisoner of Azkaban, not a sci-fi story about time travel by a competent author who understands such issues.

** Canonical time travel in Harry Potter (at least before JKR forgot how her own universe works in Cursed Child) is not so much time travel as it is creating a temporary clone of yourself with future knowledge. You cannot use it to change the past, because your future self and your original past self exist within the same timeline. Any attempt to change the past will fail, because your future self already tried and failed, if not outright caused events to play out as they did for your past self.

This is how Harry was able to save himself from the Dementors with his Patronus; there exists no timeline in which his future self was not present to save him.

Within your example, Hermione 1 attended Divination and Transfiguration with the boys, time-turned when they weren't looking to become Hermione 2. An hour later by her perspective, Hermione 2 walked over to where she knew they would be and seamlessly slipped into the place Hermione 1 had occupied seconds before.

*** You can't change what you know has happened, but you can make sure things happened a certain way if it's possible but unlikely. It's a bit like a true prophecy, you can't prevent things from happening that you already witnessed but you can influence the way things happen.

****** Not really. Only difference is that the effect is moved to before the cause.

** She turned her time turner the required number of times and she did it where nobody could see her. Not even the reader.

** Agree with Slightly Too Heavy. Time travel in PoA follows Novikov's self consitancy principle. Thay means you can't create a paradox (which in this case means eliminating the reason why you traveled back in the first place). So had Harry and Hermione already known their plan had worked, they wouldn't have needed to travel back. Everything you do in the past has already happened, so you can't really have your characters change anything significant.

*** Your mention of that principle reminded me of a fic of Hermione travelling back into the past several decades (I don't remember if she traveled to Riddle-era or Marauder-era) and was pursued by DoM workers for suspicious activity, and was caught by reflexively rattling off the principle when asked about it -- several decades before it was invented.
