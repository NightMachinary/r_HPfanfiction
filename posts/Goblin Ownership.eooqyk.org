Another thread-raised-an-interesting-point thing here. Specifically, how far does the Goblin view on Ownership go? They believe, as I understand it, that anything made by a Goblin is owned by the Maker and no other.

But, like, does clothing count? Does your family have to return your jimjams after you die? Do restaurants exist, since the meal would be made by the chef and thus his property, or are all Goblin restaurants just buffets where you make your own food? Are they a Randian society akin to Rapture in Bioshock?

** I consider it that goblins cannot sell anything to anyone. Money cannot replace anything that was made with your own time and hands. Instead the internally use a barter and favor system. I can't buy a dinner from a goblin, I can trade something for it though.

They are not human, humans look at that and say "That's just selling things with extra steps" goblins don't see it that way though. It's more "I'm giving you something made by my hands for something made by yours".

At least that's my theory on the matter.

*** But then they becoming bankers makes little sense, since banks make money trough the interest of the money they lend.

**** Just a way for them to interact with those heathen strange wizard creatures that /shudder/ sell things. It's find a compromise or eternal war, bank was the compromise.

** I think that is just for goblin-made objects, I can't remember the quote from DH, but it said something about goblin-made objects specifically. Maybe they don't consider food an object, or maybe they're more willing to share their goblin-made food with only with other goblins.

I wonder if the goblins in Gringotts think the money they mint belongs to them? Like instead of money going out of circulation it just goes into the vaults of the goblins who made it.

*** Exactly! So, what if they make pajamas or sex toys or drinking mugs or print books or any other myriad things that we need as a society? As long as a Goblin made them, they'd still be theoretically under that rule, no?

** I'd figure that it probably only applies to durable goods, and they consider clothing and the like to be consumables because they're not the same used as new.

** If you grow food, it's your property. If you eat it then..... /what it becomes/ also must be your legal property since it certainly can't belong to anybody else. Even though you don't want to keep it and will most likely dispose of it in the usual manner.

Possibly the Goblins running a restaurant would view things in the same way. Certainly they view the food they prepare and serve is their property, and view it as forever being their property. But they're still perfectly happy never to see it again.

** They probably could take back any time they made after the owner dies, but only exercise it for important things. Why would they want back some old goblin's used pajamas?

**** I guess, but there's a big leap from used pajamas to a legendary sword with magical powers.

It also may only count for stuff that's magically crafted, since it has the individual goblin's magical signature and they've in a way put some of their self into it. It's much more personal than a goblin that makes a living by cutting parchment or whatever.

***** That would be a more sensible way of looking at it. But Rowling has only ever said that it's for 'Goblin-made objects' and that the 'rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser'. It's never been specified beyond that, as far as I know.

** I can't recall the fic, but I've read one where it turns out that goblins basically put a bit of their souls into the items that they craft, horcrux-style, so naturally they consider the maker of an item to always have ownership of it.

Presumably they don't actually put their souls into absolutely every item that they ever make, just the more significant pieces, but it would explain the maker-based cultural norm.

*** That's very interesting. It could've been a sort of 'magnum opus'-type deal where their 'greatest work' was what got the Horcrux effect. I remember a thing in an official D&D setting where Dwarves would go into a sort of trance and make their greatest craftwork (their Magnum Opus) before never making another thing again - the main reason why most of their dwarfhalls failed economically as their pool of working craftsmen got smaller and smaller.
