Excerpt from an idea I had, but I have too many stories going to write it myself.

Summary: Harry finds himself in a world where he's never existed, his mother is unhappily married to Snape, and his father is dead... Funny, how accepting an apology can change so many things. Can Harry save both the world and his mother from an abusive marriage?

Excerpt:

/Make no noise./

/Pretend you don't exist./

Lily repeated it like a mantra in her head, huddled as she was in the closet in their bedroom. She didn't think the Death Eaters were likely to enter the bedroom, but Severus said he didn't want to take any chances.

Sometimes she daydreamed what her life would be like if she hadn't accepted Severus' apology. She hoped she would have more freedom. Severus was always monitoring her, and she hadn't seen anyone but him in years, except for glimpses of Voldemort and, strangely, Peter Pettigrew. The latter one made her stomach almost heave. Lily remembered the day she heard that James Potter had been killed in battle. Severus had been gleeful as he described how he made James scream.

“I doubt he begged for mercy,” Lily had said quietly, interrupting the retelling.

Severus made her pay for that by ignoring her for days. He was always so irrationally jealous any time she even mentioned James Potter. The one time she accused him of it, though, he completely denied it. He did that with every argument: denying or diverting the conversation away from the truth. She should have expected it; he did it often enough in their youth, whether they were discussing the Dark Arts, Petunia, or James.


** After everything Snape did for Lily it's hard to see Snape doing anything less than perfect to keep Lily happy in marriage.

That guy played two big and dangerous players of magical world to keep Lily's memory and her legacy alive and have the vengeance.

Anyway, it's your story so you are free to imagine it however you like.

*** Can it be that you reported someone for spam or something similar? Reddit puts those on your personal ignore list.

***** I'm not sure if that is the case here, but after I reported one guy for spam, his comments and the replies to them became invisible to me. Maybe something similar happened to you.

** Who ever adopts this I hope they share it here, this is one story I would love to read. Not even hoping for Harry/Lily but to see more of a Lily who isn't perfectly perfect and happy in a perfect marriage
