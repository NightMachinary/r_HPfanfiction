Hi there, I'm having a weirdly hard time finding fics focusing on the Weasley family. They often are just a secondary aspect to fics with Harry as the main character or devolve into bashing. Alternatively, I will also take fics told from the perspective of a Weasley with some attention to the family dynamics.

I'm pretty chill with shipping as long as there isn't incest or pedophilia, and as already mentioned, I have no interest in bashing fics. I have already read linkffn(6919395) linkffn(7467796) linkffn(12141684) linkffn(12157282) and most of the angsty Ron-centered fics from Windschild8178


** This is fantastic -- linkffn(12157282)

*** Can second this, I found canon Percy distinctly unlikable but I love him to bits in this story. Pretty sure the author is active on this subreddit so be sure to let them know if u enjoy it.

*** Thanks! My fic linking didn't work in my original post, but I have already read Percy Take the Wheel and love it. The newest chapter actually inspired this post, since I wanted more Weasely feels.

FYI, the other fics I linked were the Red Knight and Choices (Ron-centric) and the Changeling (Ginny-centric)

** /Dinner With the Weasleys/ is a sweet one-shot with Luna musing what the family dinners at the Burrow are like after the War.

Linkffn(7227719)

Our brilliant [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] crafted a hilarious fic called /Like A Red-Headed Stepchild./ Harry has red hair and everyone keeps thinking he's a Weasley. The Weasleys don't mind.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Bad Mum has a lot of Weasley shorts. I especially like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4169818/1/Sharing]]

A classic is A'jes' Blue's Percy trilogy, which ends with a Percy/Oliver pairing. By far my favorite is the middle story, where Bill and Charlie drag Percy off to the dragon preserve to "fix" him, but I'll link to the first: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/219124/1/Catharsis]]
