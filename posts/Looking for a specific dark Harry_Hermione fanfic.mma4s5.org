:END:
Hello, I'm looking for a dark Harry/Hermione fic I read a while ago. The fic was not very long. I feel like it may have been on Ao3 but I'm not sure. It had a scene where a burnt out sounding Snape was surprised because someone else was recognizing that Dumbledore is dangerous. It had past abusive Dursleys and Harry had some sort of facial disfigurement from burning oil, pretty sure one eye was also damaged and he had been hiding it. I'm pretty sure it also involved Harry and Hermione having a fake relationship with Ginny and Ron respectively to hide their own.

Any ideas what fic it might have been? I know it's not a whole lot to go on.
