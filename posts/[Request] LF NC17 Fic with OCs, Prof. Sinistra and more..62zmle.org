Im looking for a fic I read a few months ago where Harry at the end of his 3rd year is visited by a 7th year Ravenclaw girl, loses his virginity, has a summer fling with a muggle girl, helps some OCs with their fashion business in exchange for sex, har sex with prof. Sinistra and there was a bunch of other smut as well.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

***** If you can stand a 11 years old Harry not acting his age (I mean horribly not his age), and kinda stereotypical characters then it's alright.

******* Yeah, kinda figure that out from OP's description, lol.

Dropped it after chapter 2 though. I can't stand out of age character.

****** Are we talking like a five your old, or more mature? If he's mature, I can handle that.

But unless it's Bellatrix, I can not handle a character losing his/her shit at every little thing.

******* Well, I'd say mature, but the attitude at the same time could be applied for a rather spoiled brat.

For example during his first Diagon Alley trip with McGonagall, he demanded access to the Potter vault since he's now the last Potter (which is true, but seeing that attitude on a 11 yo turned me off instantly, showing no respect for the professor). Well, plus point for the author at this part since he went out of his way to avoid the helpful goblins trope. Not very smooth or subtle, but it gets the job done.

In chapter 2, Harry demanded again, for him to be released from going to Potions, History and DADA.

Dropped after that, so I can't tell if he can easily lose his shit or not. If you find the above agreeable then by all mean try it out :D.

******** I have a thick skin, as long as it's grammatically sound. Will have a go now.

EDIT - Halfway through chapter 1, not that bad. Heck, I would have demanded control of the main vault if I was in Harry's place when I was eleven.

********* It's all good then. We all have things we can and can't tolerate. For me they're helpful goblins and bratty Harry, lol.

Wanting to control the vault is fine, but disrespect for a professor who went out of her way to help him, that I can't stand.

********** I can agree. You might think the authority figures are full of shit(and sometimes they are), but some of those authority figures can and will make life hard for you. Of course, super OP Harry crushes such authority figures beneath his boots via some unfortunate accident...
