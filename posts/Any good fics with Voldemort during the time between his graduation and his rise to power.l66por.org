This is one timeline I hardly ever manage to come by and the story to be good. So I post my request once again.

Ideally it's set in the 50s or the 60s or even early 70s when Tom still has to maintain a facade in order to achieve his goals. Also I'd prefer if the events from canon do not really play a central role... I'm kind of tired of reading over and over and over again about how he killed Hebzibah Smith or how Dumbledore rejected his application as DADA teacher. And I'd prefer if it were not a timetravel, but if it has to be then I'd like the romance to be in the background and between adults.

Thank you for your help.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

** There's an odd one called 'Rebirth' on fanfic.net, iirc. It features an OC who grew up in the orphanage with Tom Riddle, they grow up and go to Hogwarts together and such. They end up in a relationship together, and the OC and Tom both die, but because they became immortal together come back as children. The OC comes back as Harry Potter, and the story is abandoned shortly after that But before that there's quite a bit of story about Tom's time after hogwarts but before trying to get the DADA position.
