And why are people enamoured with her?


** She's mentioned once in the books, when Hermione and a few others are about to take their Charms O.W.L. However, nothing but her name is mentioned.

But if we go by Rowling's supplementary writing, then Daphne is the older sister of Astoria Greengrass (Draco's wife), and is a Slytherin:

#+begin_quote
  Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight', but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension.
#+end_quote

-- 'Draco Malfoy' page on the Wizarding World website (formerly Pottermore).

So, basically, if you prefer to stay close to the books and ignore some of JKR's other writings, Daphne Greengrass is a total blank slate, while the supplementary writings tell us a bit more about Daphne and her family, but not much.

Daphne's always been around since post-OotP or so (2003), though in the pre-HBP days her 'Slytherin female-love-interest for Harry' status was largely given to either Pansy Parkinson or, more likely, Blaise Zabini (whose canonical gender was still unknown at that point). It's worth noting that JKR's Original Forty students list had a 'Queenie Greengrass' on it, which is said to be the concept character for Daphne.

Anyway, Blaise was more likely to be written as Harry's love interest, due to also being a blank slate and often being written as attractive, while the other semi-popular Slytherin girl, Pansy, already had a defined personality and appearance in the books.

It's also worth noting that Blaise often had the one-up over Pansy due to the latter supposedly being 'ugly' in canon (Pansy's described as being 'hard faced' and having a 'face like a pug', though that doesn't necessarily mean that she's ugly), as well as the name itself (Blaise Zabini) sounding 'cooler' and more 'exotic' than 'Pansy Parkinson'. Hence the preference for which witch gets to be with Harry.

However, once Blaise was canonised as a boy, (s)he lost some popularity over time (but wasn't entirely gone), while Daphne Greengrass became even more popular, especially from fics such as 'Perfect Situations', by Jeconais (which is one of, if not /the/, earliest fics that wrote Daphne be an 'ice queen').

Daphne filled the Blaise void, so to speak.

Another reason why Daphne's always been a popular choice for Harry is due to the lure of shipping ice queen x naive/soft/sassy/Indy whatever else you want to make Harry. It's a trope that started many years ago, probably around the time of Jeconais's 'Perfect Situations' fic, and still persists.

People seem to enjoy seeing the 'Ice Queen' get melted by Harry, and all the political jazz that often (but not always) accompanies Daphne in fanfics. The Greengrasses tend to be one of the so-called 'neutral' factions in fanon (though some fics do make them lean towards supporting Voldemort). This 'Grey faction' thing is, by itself, something that's often loved in fanon. Now add Daphne onto that, and it's two big tropes which tend to attract loads of readers.

Female Blaise Zabini (who you could perhaps think of as being the pre-Daphne) also had some of these tropes applied to her. For example, she could also be the cold, calculating Slytherin with a good heart and an often-'neutral' family. And there was also that whole 'keep the relationship secret' thing going on from time to time in fem!Blaise/Harry fics, which is another reason why Haphne fics tend to attract readers.

Coming back to Pansy Parkinson, she did seem to get a boost in fanon fame after her appearance in the films (especially with regards to Genevieve Gaunt and, more recently, Scarlett Byrne), while fics such as 'White Knight, Grey Queen' by Jeconais also helped push the Hansy (Harry/Pansy) ship forward a bit. However, Pansy wasn't the only Slytherin pure-blood girl who got a boost from the films, as people seem to have accepted [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_blonde_Slytherin_girl][this]] girl as being Daphne Greengrass. This is especially true when considering the popular image of Daphne having blonde hair (and blue eyes).

Daphne's always been the more popular female-Slytherin option since Blaise became a boy in canon, with the other girls varying in popularity:

- Pansy? Still around, yes. Sure, she's got a less-than-favourable description in the books, but I guess people might prefer to ship her with Harry, instead of having to work with Millicent Bulstrode and her negative descriptions in canon.

- Tracey Davis? Well, not only is she never once mentioned in the books, but the fact that she's listed as being a half-blood on JKR's Original Forty list means that she's probably 'less appealing' to readers. People like seeing Harry/pureblood Slytherin 'hottie' (which partly explains the popularity of Drarry as well). Also, Tracey's often depicted as being Daphne's best (and only) friend, which often leads to her being little more than the cheerful pal on the sidelines.

- Millicent Bulstrode? Not that popular as a pairing partner for Harry. Not only is she a half-blood (I think), but canon also describes her in a really unfavorable manner, in that she's said to resemble a hag. Millicent's also made out to be large and brutish in canon (she's described as being large and square, wrestles with Hermione in book two, and pins Hermione against the wall in book five), which also decreases her popularity.

*** I ship Harry X Daphne because of her name. Love the name, love the OC-ness of her. Love all the alternative interpretations of her character, by which I mean the non Ice Queen ones.

I do think that if she wasn't named Queenie, shw wouldn't be as half as popular.

**** Besides what [[/u/Siusir98][u/Siusir98]] said, I've seen the following as explanations for the "pug-face" thing: 1) The description reflects Harry's bias against her looks due to her personality and association with Draco, it is not objectively accurate. 2) Her pug face was an "ugly duckling" phase she grew out of. 3) It was referring specifically to her upturned "pug" nose, which is something plenty of perfectly attractive women have. 4) She was taking active measures to avoid unwanted (male) attention and used cosmetic magic to deliberately look uglier.

***** Sure! linkao3(amid the ever rushing future by stranglerfig), Daphne is introduced in the 4th book of a 9 part series. It's such a good series, great writing. I like that the author didn't go “she was half Arab”, instead she dropped it in in bits like mentioning how Daphne got a letter in a different language and teaches Harry an Arab phrase, then mentioning how Daphne nearly got pulled out and sent to the Magus Institute in Iran with her cousins who live there. It really focused on culture rather than doing a skin deep description and I liked that. Daphne isn't the main character or love interest though so sorry if you were expecting that.

Blaise is an unusual name and therefore people might not know it is a boy's name and therefore give it to their daughter (although in England and Wales in 2019 it was ranked 3541 for girls [so probably about 4 total] and 1506 for boys - so even with a lot of people not knowing, it's heavily weighted towards boys) ... but it is still a boys name, it is no different than a girl called 'Henry' or a boy called 'Julia' - it's just lesser known.

****** You're using a spurious example. First of all, if girls are being called that name, then /yes,/ it is unisex. What the hell do you think unisex means? If girls started being called Samuel, it would become a unisex name.

More relevantly, both of those names have specific alternate gender names: Henrietta and Julio. By contrast, Blaise does not. How many girls were named Henry in that period? How many boys were named Julia?

5 seconds of googling shows that Blaise is derived from Latin word with a masculine and feminine form. If you follow the "boys' name" Blaise's example and cut off the end of the masculine form of the word (/blaesus/), then the feminine form of the name would cut off the end of the feminine form of the word (/blaesa/). Anglicanize it, and you'd get... Blaise.

Daphne smirked inwardly at the thought, because even it was just another silly drunken competition, Harry always ended up winning in the end.

** As it has been said before Daphne fills that void of potential love interest that exist in canon (sorry Ginny and not so sorry Cho). JK's writing leaves the whole of Slytherin house as a cesspool of blood prejudice and Death Eaters, so in Daphne, authors and readers are able to find that respite. You can also think it as a Romeo and Juliet type of relationship or even Lady and the Tramp kind of situation. Also it works in a away to expand on the world. As much as people like (or hate) the Weasleys the fact is that Harry is completely ignorant of the Wizarding World at large. So providing Harry with another point of view on the world that he inhabits is also a positive.

- he had an O in his potions OWL and at least an E in his DADA OWL - as he is in the NEWT-classes.

- he is kind of an rascist as he laughed with Draco each time Hermiones blood-status comes up in one of these classes in HBP.

- he is older than Harry (he takes the apparation-test in march meaning he already 17 then)

- he is "weedy" and "stringy" and has a "rabbity" appearance

We actually don't know that one. There were four Slytherins in potions. It were Theodore Nott, Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini and an unnamed one. It could have been her, it couldn't. Fact is - we don't know who the fourth Slytherin was (at least in the books). Although we can be pretty sure that it wasn't either Crabbe, Goyle or Pansy because Draco sat with Theodore in Potions when he nearly never talked to him outside that.

That leaves Tracy Davies, Millicent Bullstrode, Daphne Greengrass and the unnamed fourth Slytherin girl for that spot.
