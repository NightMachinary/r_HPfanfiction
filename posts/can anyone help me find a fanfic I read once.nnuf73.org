:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm sure it was on fanfic(.)net but I can't seem to find it.

It started with Griphook helping harry with his parents will.

During the story Harry, Hermione, Luna and Neville learn magic from some of the House-elves and Griphook.

I hope someone knows the fanfic as I really want to read it again. thanks in advance!
