** Let me make this very clear: attempting to advocate, defend or excuse transphobia, JKR's or otherwise, will not be tolerated.

*** Kind of a childish response to someone expressing how her views are hurtful to them...nobody said she must be “eliminated” it's just people feeling like JK isn't welcoming to the trans community and asking for recs including them

***** Nice of you to just confirm you're a piece of shit right away instead of pretending it's about “free speech” or something, at least. Saves time and exposes ideas like this for what they really are about

*** If her thoughts lead to her taking actions that significantly harm one of the most vulnerable groups in the western world, feeding a culture that leads to 1/2 of all trans teens attempting suicide, then yeah "Beep Fucking Boop" she desrves to lose the influence that makes her threatening

** Just wanna let you know I totally see where you're coming from. People have been tasing a lot of concerns about “separating the art from the artist” because her art is entangled with her ideas. Plenty of people have pointed out problematic aspects of Goblins as stereotypical, and House elves being “happy slaves.” I personally think it's ok to still enjoy her work while still keeping these things in mind. As for fic recs, I think Magical Metamorphosis is a great story that shows Harry discovering she's trans and how that affects her time at Hogwarts. It is a Harry/ Hermionie if you don't mind that.

**** Your welcome! Also I recommend if you want more recs about this to try [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] they're normally more open to LGBT recs and find more stuff

***** It's incredible considering the fact that the Harry Potter ao3 tag is so diverse and full of gay content that this subreddit is so steeped in homophobia and transphobia. It's like people are allowed to fetishise gay people but asking for any content featuring realistic lgbt stories is suddenly taboo. News flash guys, it's FAN fiction. Doesn't have to be canon.

****** It's so sad that the first two comments (now removed by mods) where openly transphobic. Oh - wait - sorry, they find being called transphobic for holding beliefs and taking actions that actively harm the lives of trans people as offensive. smh
