I'm my own worst enemy when it comes to reading. I want something new and fresh, but I dislike stories that make arbitrary changes to canon (ex. in HP, werewolves can't recognize loved ones and will harm them during the full moon - its part of the tragedy of the curse). I like MCs to be more independent, but I don't want them to be OP or obnoxiously capable. I don't want over religious themes but I also don't want religion to be hated on.

As a reader, it's time I acknowledge that until I start paying for material, writers are going to write what they want and they have little to no interest in my specific opinion... That's not actually going to happen, but the first step is to admit that I am the problem.

That bugs the heck out of me, and I wish authors would explain their changes in the story summary or preface notes. If the story's point of divergence is that Harry has Lily's hair and James' eyes (and no glasses), then establish that from the start.

What I hate more than anything is when the author adds arbitrary changes to the canon setting, and this /has no effect on the story/. The fic still follows the stations of canon, when the changes should cause butterfly divergences. Harry doesn't wear glasses, then he should win the Year 3 Gryff/Huff quidditch match where Cedric got the jump on him because of the rain, and never works up the courage to ask Lupin for Patronus lessons. He doesn't lose his Nimbus, so he never receives the Firebolt.

Ultimately, my annoyance doesn't come from new stuff, or not following canon. It comes from illogical writing, and this is something even commercially published fiction suffers from. See: "Dany kinda forgot about the Iron Fleet".

Even stories that are absolutely AU and have Harry befriend Hermione early... she still ends up in the bathroom with the Troll. On and on the list goes.

** I'm a lot more picky than you, since I no longer read:

- Canon rehashes, especially in time travels and “Harry raised by X” fics
- Blatant shipping fics, especially those that need to bash others
- Voldemort and Death Eater apologies, although I don't mind reading Voldemort centric fics that don't try to justify his actions.
- Anytime Hadrian or Ice Princess is mentioned
- Any fics that ship Harry or Hermione with Death Eater scums
- WBWL fics, with a couple exceptions
- Fics that manufacture lots of angst and drama

*** See I've never understood the whole 'Hadrian' crap. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if his name was actually Harold if he wasn't called up to the sorting hat using Harry. Why? Because there's the altogether true potential for that to be Lily's father's name, who she would want to name Harry after. Naturally, James would probably give her that considering I believe they were just married. Even if he didn't, that'd be stupid that pure-blood James who hates the whole pure-blood nonsense would name his son an old family name. I mean, really my grandfather Harold would've probably had Harry has a nickname if he a grown up in a few decades after his birth.

**** "Hadrian" is a way to give a properly aristocratic sounding name to Harry in a fic that wants to give him a hereditary position of power in Wizarding Society - and at the same time, typically have him distance himself from previous views and allegiances (eg, Dumbledore).

What never makes sense to me is when he finds out the name - and then instantly changes his name to it and insists on being called that all the time, without a second thought. I could see it being used in more ceremonial or official situations much more reasonably.

*** I totally agree with all of that -- except what's wrong with drama?! I mean, sure, I tire of teenage angst as readily as everyone else, but drama is essentially the most realistic thing to write about in fiction. Drama is, essentially, just tension between the characters and/or events.

Neither canon nor any other fantasy book can really withstand you removing the dramatic element: LotR without character interaction (Arwen-Aragorn/Frodo-Smeagol/Frodo-Sam/etc.).

The point about drama, and even angst -- I suppose -- is that it's absolutely necessary to a certain extend, but can really ruin a story if it's done badly or contrived.

** Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with your tastes. In all three cases, I think you're creating false dichotomies. It sounds like you want alterations to canon that are reasonably motivated (by contraints of plot, character, theme,...), MCs who get chances to make decisions that impact the story, and religious story elements--if present--to be treated tastefully. None of those are bad things. Hopefully, this isn't too gauche, but there's only so much you'll ever be able to read--it's makes sense to be discerning in what you spend your time on.

The issue with this one is that any story that uses religion even in the slightest as a plot point or for something to slingshot the plot or characters, you are going to experience conflict between religions because, in some sense, they cannot co-exist peacefully -- not in real life, of course. They can and do.

Example, in stories where Harry turns ‘dark' and learns all about pure-bloods and their culture, normally him saying ‘Christmas' and then having Draco or whatever butt in with a smirk stating that they celebrate Yule and that Yule is a banned holiday -- which makes no sense as a whole as you cannot police religion -- and that most pure-bloods are Pagans.

In this case, it is the authors hating on Christianity, despite the fact that in canon, it appears that everyone, even pure-bloods, willingly celebrate Christmas and Christian holidays. Draco Malfoy even says ‘God'.

*** Making pure-bloods Pagan doesn't hate on Christianity, it simply gives them a new religion that some authors think would be more logical for a magical world. Mainly because witch burnings were often done because of religion. And you say that it's not possible to police religion. Well go to Saudi-Arabia and openly celebrate christmas with a christmas tree and a bible, I don't think you'd be happy with the results lol

**** I agree, but my example was based around that trope, not in general. The authors paint Christianity in a bad light. Witch burnings and such are done by every religion. No one wants anyone to be more powerful than their God. People do not seem to understand this. Christianity just had it done 'publically' and documented it.

As for the second part, I was speaking for the fanfiction and fanon worlds, not real life. However, I know people that are best friends and they have different religions.

In history, Christians did wage war on Muslims, so religion is not peaceful, even in this day and age, hence me saying 'you are going to experience conflict between religions because, in some sense, they cannot co-exist peacefully. granted, the wording after it rendered it pointless, but you get the gist.

Don't forget, other religions may have also practised witch burning, but Christianity was the dominant religion in Europe at that era. The other religions don't matter that much because they are too far away geographically

*** Too true. I made that comment because I was reading a story that had a lot of Jewish themes and references, which is fine, except every mention of Christianity made in that story was about muggleborn children being abused. The writer did not explicitly state anything, but the implication was Jewish parents treated their children well even when they had magic while Christian parents rejected their magical children, often violently.

** Actually, funny you mentioned this considering I'm currently reading Whispers Through the Night. What bugs me is how the age difference is, compared to canon. Mainly because then it more or less creates problems further down the road. Wizarding legal age is 17, with the 2yr age difference when WTN and canon, that propels that to five year. I dislike this, because in all honesty I feel like then you have to explain how a twelve year old boy, slept in a cupboard among other things. In the story(canon) he seemed to be uncomfortable at ten, in two years wouldn't it be plausible for him to not fit any longer?

Edit: Saw only 18 and up allowed to put their name in the goblet of fire. In other words, majority has changed. Still the same situations though really.

** In your defense: it's fanfiction, something that is entirely based around wanting to see a fiction but in a way you would like. Its not /wrong/ to want certain things - you don't have to read them if you dislike it. So don't beat yourself up over that.

That said, I can understand some of how you feel. I don't mind changes to canon or AU entirely, I just wish the authors would follow through with that and not use it to just rehash canon. The problem is that is hard: it takes a lot more planning, and fanfiction is for most a hobby or enjoyment. When you have to plan and organize and think deeply, to many people that gets too close to work and a job. A job that doesn't pay.

So I guess what I am saying is its okay to want more from whatever fanfiction you are reading, but understand its /the authors/ fanfiction too. Its about as much of what they want as what you want.
