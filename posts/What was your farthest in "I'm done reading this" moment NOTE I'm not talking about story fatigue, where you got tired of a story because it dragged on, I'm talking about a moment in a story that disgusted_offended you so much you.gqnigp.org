For me, it was an incomplete fanfic called /Harry Potter and the Heir of Magic/. I honestly don't remember very much about it, except that at second to last chapter it said something so misogynistic I just stopped reading it then and there, even though there was only one chapter left.

My review of that moment?

** A Second Chance. Sirius gets out of Azkaban after only a few years thanks to McGonagall being relentless in her drive to get him a trial or something along those lines. He adopts Harry, gives him a much better chidlhood than anything the Dursleys could have done, even gets engaged eventually.

Then, 200 chapters in, he /still/ falls through the veil at the climax of fifth year.

It must be admitted that I have a huge soft spot for Sirius, and there were a few other factors at play as well, but that was the point where I lost all interest in seeing how things ended.

Three-quarters of the way in, suddenly a conversation between Ron and Dumbledore went something along these lines: "But how am I going to get at his inheritance now, with Harry cavorting with that Veela whore instead of my sister?" "Well, my boy, accidents can always be arranged..."

** Debt of Time.

Voldemort is beaten, and Hermione and Sirius seem to be on the verge of becoming a couple. Then Sirius (or was it Remus?) gives Hermione something that hurls her back in time, to when Voldemort is on the rise in the 70s.

FFS, why the hell would you do that? Even with the logic that "Mia" went through everything and came out fine, accidents and things that you don't expect can happen all the time! Why would you send someone you're fond of to a time-period like that, which is so violent and filled with uncertainity and without their consent?!

But still, I ploughed on. Then it gets to real weird territory - Hermione or Mia or whoever she is then, who has full knowledge of the horcruxes decides....to do /nothing/. She doesn't tell Albus anything, doesn't destroy the horcruxes she can, doesn't start something like the DA so that others have a better chance at survival. She doesn't even stop Peter from being a rat - which condemns her adopted brother and sister-in-law to die. There's not even an anonymous tip-off to Albus regarding Voldemort's horcruxes or anything similar.

She decides to "live" (according to Remus' words before the time travel/abduction) even though her inaction means several others don't get the chance to "live".

Noped the fuck out. This is without the ridiculous relationship dynamics between Hermione, Sirius and Remus, which is a completely different clusterfuck. I don't know why people like this shit so much, it's ludicrous in so many ways.

Also, Stages of Hope.

So Harry and co, who have overdosed with Felix Felicis, somehow travel to an AU where Lily marries Remus, and everyone is best friends with Snape. Okay, fine. Harry gets catatonic when AU-Lily says she has no son. Later on, when they meet James, Harry's like "I don't know you/I'm not interested in knowing you". That's an insta-close in my book.

It's like the author pictures James' only significance as some sort of sperm donor to Harry, nothing more, completely forgetting that canon-Harry looks up to James more than anything.

*** Oh man (or lady), I love DoT. I accept that the decision to 'do nothing' regarding your points is a big issue with the fic, but it's based on sci-fi time travel tropes. One is: You can't fight fate and another would be ontological inertia.

Basically, because Hermione is from the future, everything that happened before her time travel already happened and cannot be changed in any way without the risk of 'expanding ripples', aka you save a child from certain death and then an orphanage burns down. The one time she tried to change something the consequence was enough for her to keep to the 'rules of the tropes'.

Accepting those tropes (and probably more, I stopped scanning TV tropes after the second one, and probably misattributed them) is really important to enjoying the fic. If you can't, you will probably have a bad time.

Please don't take this as a personal attack, I just disagree and really like the story, but I'm a big sucker for some angsty goodness.

I disagree with this idea that the future is set in stone, and attempts to change it will cause similar events of different orders/magnitudes to happen.

When Harry and Hermione time travel in book 3, Dumbledore says something that negates this whole trope - he says that "If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight" - he's referring to Buckbeak's execution here. He's seen it happen, and wants to reverse it, which is why he emphasises it. It is only because he wants to reverse it that he gives Hermione the idea in the first place. If he just wanted Sirius to go free, he would tell Hermione to turn it back one hour and wait near the office where Sirius is being held - it would be a lot easier.

Besides, that bit of TV trope doesn't mean anything - it is fiction, and anything goes according to the author's prerogative. If someone where to travel back in time and kill a child Tom Riddle, then none of anything that's in the series will happen.

Other tragedies happening is generally independent of one person living or dying.

And to be frank, Hermione deciding to do nothing is a lot like the BS that happens in Cursed Child when HP decides to be a eunuch and watch his parents get murdered.

If there is a version of history where they didn't go back then Harry wouldn't have saved himself with the patronus, thereby making them unable to go back in time in the first place. The structure of those events necessitates predestination.

** I don't even remember the name on this one, but Hermione got stuck as a cat in second year and got orgasmic from Harry stroking her tail and scratching her ears. And madam Pomphrey even encouraged it and explained to Harry about animals being "in heat". I closed the tab, deleted the browser cache and just... drank. I hope I'm not on some sort of list after reading this trash.

There was another fic that I really loved initially. Hermione was some sort of a math genius and that tied in nicely with arithmancy. The plot was good and Hermione had great character development. Until Year 5 when Umbridge arrived and everyone just kind of... rolled over and let themselves be terrorised. Umbridge just got away with unbelievably a lot and the author's only explanation was "BuT sHe'S fRiEnDs WiTh ThE mInIsTeR". It got to the point that she was about to whip Fred in the middle of the Great Hall and I just noped out. I'm not squeamish or anything but literally all other characters just stood and watched. No one took any action against Umbridge in Year 5 and it honestly turned me off completely from an otherwise great fic. To all authors out there: You don't have to wait until the end of the school year for a big showdown/ action sequence. Feel completely free to deal with or even kill characters in the middle of the fic.

Any fics with bad BDSM etiquette and abusive dom/ sub relationships are instantly closed. Which means most of them. Good BDSM stories with adult characters and no rape/ abuse are hard to find.

Edit: Ooh, just remembered another one. Tonks fell in one of those clocks during the battle in the Department of Mysteries and got sent a year back in time. So she enrolled in Hogwarts and befriended Harry and Hermione. Only to let Harry walk right in the trap in the Department a year later. All that story and character development were wasted. The only difference was that Harry went only with Hermione and Tonks so they were even more outnumbered than before. I didn't even bother reading any further since it just invalidated everything that happened. What's the point of time travel if you make the same mistakes again?

***** It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9628704/1/Misplaced][/Misplaced/]], and it's a crossover between /Naruto/ and /Mass Effect/ that managed to impress me in scope and detail. A lot of /Mass Effect/ crossovers I've read either replace Shepard with whatever crossover character is part of the crossover, or have the crossover character join the team, but little outside the sphere of that character's influence changes.

The author of /Misplaced/, however, basically rewrites the Mass Effect universe to fit within /Naruto/'s continuity, complete with an Earth that is unique to the fanfic, with its own history, conveyed through “Codex” entries peppered throughout the story.

The main one I read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2053520/1/Latias-Journey][Latias' Journey]] and it's sequel. Although, keep in mind that in the sequel, the big confrontation that the whole story was building up to, was never written. You can still read the first one as a stand alone. But you'll probably need the first one to read the second one as it won't make much sense otherwise.

So the idea of copies of the Potters' will being stored at Gringotts isn't even a mild stretch, it's something I'd actually expect to see, were Gringotts a real life institution.

The emancipation stuff could logically just be goblins being sneaky with Ministry paperwork, or justified through treaty(many fanfics depict Gringotts as a sovereign nation).

Wand tracing is flat out weird, though, since in the books, Goblins are legally barred from owning any by treaty.

** I was reading this Harmony soulmate fic with a sympathetic Snape. It wasn't the best, especially with the soulmate trope (it was one of those fics where soulmates override everything including free will, proper romance development, etc), and it was one of those Light-bashing fics. At this point in time, my current opinions on LESS (in it basically being my OTP) was almost brand new, and I didn't take alternatives very well. Then, over halfway of the fic (which was rather long), Snape inadvertly got a bunch of Obliviated memories unlocked. Turns out that he actually got along, kind of, with the Marauders, and would have been Harry's guardian after the Potter deaths had everything gone as it should have but was Obliviated before it could go through. Oh, and he got screwed over from a fully (naturally) developed relationship with Lily due to a soulbond between her and James. So here we have 3-4 things that I wasn't happy about at all, in one go:

- Light Side-bashing
- Obliviation abuse (!), which always disturbed me a lot
- Free will-overriding soulbonds. Twice (once with Harmony, once with Jily)
- Jily, at a time where I couldn't stand the ship at all

I didn't read any further than that. In fact, this fic is a major reason as to why I tend to stay away from soulmate fics in general nowdays -- 99% of the time it's just an excuse to force people together without having to bother with stuff like actual relationship development. The other longfic I read with them (Debt of Time) had the exact same problem -- it had a rather cute HGRL portrayal but it didn't work -- not because of fundamental incompatibility, but because soulbonds override everything.

One of the characters was getting quite bitter about being surrounded by people with lifebonds, but being unable to find such a bond himself.

Another character confronts him on this explains he would actually reject such bonds, in order to figure out if there was a connection there based on more than just a lifebond, and explains that such relationships can be even more difficult than normal ones, as seperation and disagreements hurt lifebonded couples more than couples that aren't bonded.

** Dignity in Fear was one of my favourite stories right up to Chapter 24. It is an OotP story centred around a bubbling Hermione/Tonks relationship. It did not change canon events, but the author really had a way with words and she wrote some of the best depictions of emotions I've read.

And then chapter 24 came along and it became a mess with undisguised author inserts about LGTB issues. Sirius and Lupin were a thing and Lupin is grieving. He butts into the story, is a complete asshole, but that's ok because he's gay. Hermione puts up with so much of his bullshit and does not even care about her best friend, who has lost his last family member. I asked the author about this and she said that she doesn't care about Harry because he is straight.

Perhaps not the furthest I got before ditching a fic, but certainly the most disappointing.

** - Polygamy ... sometime it is like the red light, I stop immediately (linkffn(The Ilvermorny Champion by Vance McGill) started as one of the few original Harmony stories, but in the moment a goblin (!) read the arranged marriage contracts, I just stopped, and I have never touched that story again). Then I really really tried with linkffn(11123742) and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gohv5s/harems/][I failed again]]. Some idiot was self-centric enough to sign such contract and suddenly everybody throw away all their morals and roll over to sleep with five girls they don't particularly like? Just give me one GOOD reason why.

- I have read linkffn(7254667) to the end, and I am truly sorry I haven't stopped. You know that story where Hermione and Ron give up on Harry claiming that Sirius is going to destroy his character, and they are right (except, I guess, the author hasn't meant it like that)? Where Harry and Sirius join Death Eaters to rule over the Britain? And no there is no any turning to right, they just don't think about it and do it just to screw Dumbledore.

- Time travels protecting Voldemort rebirth. I am just reading linkffn(Harry Potter And The Bonds Of Time by Vance McGill), which looks reasonably nice, so far so good, but almost the first thing Ginny says to Harry is that they have to protect Voldemort to be reborn, otherwise he cannot be defeated. No, you don't, you dolt! Canonically, Horcruxes (or whatever is the plural) were called “anchors tethering the soul to the Earth” meaning that without the soul would go wherever it is intended to go. Destroy the anchors, the soul is gone. Of course, the real reason is that the author wants to protect The Stations of Canon, but that is very lame reasoning (and the bad reason). What would happen if the story was different, perhaps it wouldn't be that long, but we wouldn't have to plod through the same story again and again and again.

** The most frustrating was a sequel to The Black Heir where Harry gets involved in some love triangle while it was a very good ship fic from the start and a lot already happened between the ship, why would he look at anyone else at all. The way it was described was also quite appalling.

** One weird fic I read went on for chapters and chapters with Harry wetting the bed after being sent to live with Snape. Snape suddenly turns into a nice person, but despite this 360 I kept going.

I had assumed the bedwetting would be a minor plot point, but the further it got into the story the more frequent the wetting became until it was any time of day, 3 or 4 times a chapter.

Harry acted unrealistically 3 in the story, yet was going into third year. Honestly, I don't know why I was reading because the characterisations were flat, there was no discernible plot and the wetting thing became downright weird because it became clear the writer was writing it for enjoyment.

Around that point, it turned out that Ron (and possibly Fred and George?) still wet themselves too. Snape had until a late age or possibly still did - I can't recall. Anyway, it was too much for me.

I had assumed, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the writer would deal with the issue delicately and either resolve the issue or find a solution so it faded out, but it became the only plot and they called out reviewers that brought up the issues.

I had absolutely no idea why I'd ended up reading that far. I had assumed it was a plot point, or a take on reactions to Dursley abuse. Instead despite zero element about anything it being sexual, I quit with the distinct feeling they should have just written about consenting adults into adult/baby stuff.

** Several fics have driven me out late in the game with an abrupt dark swerve. A story that's been light and upbeat for a couple dozen chapters suddenly killing off a central character (or in some cases multiple important characters) is way too much of a tonal bait-and-switch for me.

The other thing that can leave me noping away late in a fic is discovering the "Complete" fic I've been reading is actually part one of a series, and said series is incomplete and hasn't been updated in years. Seriously people, announce up front if you're breaking the story up into multiple fics!

** When I first got into fanfiction it was with RobSt, up to the point where you have 14 year olds getting pregnant on purpose and deciding that they're ooey-gooey in love after knowing each other for 5 minutes. I got that far, sticking with the bashing and everything, but his relationships are just so cringe.

** I eventually picked it back up, but I stopped reading one of the sequels to the pureblood pretence because the character started eating meat and her justification really annoyed me.

She's pretending to be a teenage boy so obviously she has to bulk up, but the vegetarian character having to secretly eat meat was stupid. You're magical! Eat magical plant food, not dead muggle animals! But also you're at Hogwarts, eating the worlds best food, and you want me to believe you're not getting all the nutrients you need? And the author clearly didn't realise that women carry weight differently to men; she should've explicitly tried to maintain a boyish figure because extra weight on girls goes straight to the hips and thighs.

This annoyed me so much more than it should have. I feel like the author randomly threw some weird science about vegetarians dying from lack of nutrients into an otherwise great fic.

** The Silver Flame series. It has an interesting premise with Harry finding a book of magic before Hogwarts, becomes a Necromancer, and precedes to set the wizarding world. The thing that made me stop was when, out of a 50K word chapter, 40k is about a 5 minute quickie. Three books in, and hoping he would cut back on the amount of sex, and I had enough.

** The Nietzsche Classes

I had to drop it (about 8 chapters in) when it was clear that the main characters were being portrayed as utterly just, incredibly merciful even for not sending people to Azkaban for wrong think, and giving them a chance to be re-educated instead (under constant threat of Azkaban if they fail). Not only that, but they must actively /prove/ their innocence, rather than prosecution proving their guilt. It's a complete abomination to human rights and what I in my first-world country call justice, and I couldn't stand a fic where these actions and laws are portrayed as a /good/ thing.

** I've got a few.

1. I abandoned a fic during the epilogue. It was a rather long epilogue (14.3K words), nearly as long as the fic itself (18.4K words), with many non-linear time skips. It's like the author was just writing things as they thought of them --- a very valid writing process, mind you --- but then couldn't be bothered to put them into sequential order before posting. There's even a note at the end about a potential companion piece because it "didn't really fit into the flow" of the epilogue.
2. One series, I abandoned in chapter 23/31 of the THIRD book. The characters were just being too self-righteously stupid. Harry is hiding out in an undisclosed location. His friends don't know where he is, but they are all being repeatedly tagged with tracking charms, that they constantly are checking each other for and removing, just in case. Then Colin accidentally finds him by taking a picture while on a motorcoach tour, and the ENTIRE GROUP of them decide to go visit Harry because they can totally keep his location secret, talking about him the whole way because we can totally say Harry Potter over and over and nobody will notice.
3. There's an unfinished story that I stopped reading after chapter 14/18, because I knew it was unfinished and it was such a good story that I just knew I'd hate coming to the end of posted chapters. For some reason, my psyche is less traumatized by voluntarily stopping a wonderful story than coming to an unresolved end and knowing that there wasn't any more.
4. +One story with very many, usually short chapters, my last review was on chapter 239, stating that I didn't know how much further I'd read... but that's less than half of the currently 552 chapters (still in progress).+
5. +For famous works, I tapped out of Core Threads at chapter 70. Too much city infrastructure, not enough plot. I'd already been having problems because I really hated that 11-year-old Tracey and her YOUNGER sister were portrayed as absolutely sex-obsessed.+

ETA, okay, I realized I only really answered your question (non-story fatigue) in two of these. So I've expanded on one of them and crossed out the rest.

** The Problem of Potions sequel. I loved the first one and sure a sequel would be nice, but that Snape has a child thing (was it with Bellatrix? I can't remember) was absolute bs. Even if the author had good justification or plot points and reasons and what not, I wouldn't want to read it because I don't like reading about children in general. I don't like childfics or for the matter adultfics bc I like Hogwarts.
