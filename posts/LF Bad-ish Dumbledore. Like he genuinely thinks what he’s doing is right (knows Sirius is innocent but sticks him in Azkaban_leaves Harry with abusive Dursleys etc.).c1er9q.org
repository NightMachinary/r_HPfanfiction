Doesn't need to be bad Dumbledore / good Tom. I'm not too fussy so long as it's either complete or a high word count.


** This one is brilliant and fits your description: linkao3(The meaning of Mistletoe by Endrina)

It's part of a larger series called The Language of Plants.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** linkffn(Basilisk-born) portrays Dumbledore as rather intentionally blind to any possibilities but those he sees. Essentially, people told him he was the second Merlin so many times he started to believe he was infallible. In other words, exactly what you asked for, a classic 'Greater Good' Dumbledore. (Seriously, Basilisk-born has some of everything doesn't it?)

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

I tried to get through this, I made it almost 30 chapters, but the writing just isn't doing it for me. It's shaping up to be a story where Dumbledore knows exactly what he's doing (purposely imprisoning Sirius, purposely lying to Minerva and Remus about Harry's location), hell, even some theivery. Intentional placement with the dursleys /knowing/ it would be a bad situation but that situation has a purpose) but I couldn't finish it so that's tbd
