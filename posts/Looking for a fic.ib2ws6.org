:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I was reading a Female Harry/Tom Riddle fic a couple days ago on ao3, but when I happened to refresh the page, it was gone, as if it had never existed. Couldn't find it in my browser history and can't remember the name for the life of me. (Also, can't remember if she was called Harry or Harri, but I'm just going to call her Harry here.)

Basically, the horcrux inside of Harry was self-aware. It could speak to her in her mind and could manifest itself outside of her body, though only she could see him. He could also draw on her magic when she allowed him to.

First Year: When she got to Hogwarts, she was sorted into Slytherin and Draco was her best friend. She saw Tom and herself in the Mirror of Erised. When the Quirrell confrontation happened at the end of Year 1, Tom took control of her body to burn him.

Second Year: I can't remember everything that happened, but at the Chamber of Secrets scene, Harry's Tom told Diary Tom about their situation and convinced him to come live in Harry's head too? Oh and the summoned snake from the dueling club, she kept it and named her Basil.

Third Year: When they find out that Sirius was the secret keeper and Harry's godfather, all three are furious, and Harry's Tom promises to kill him. They spend the summer between third and fourth year picking up horcruxes. Harry's Tom makes Harry drink the potion in the cave. She passes out. He is somewhat remorseful. When they find the ring, Harry's Tom tries to make her put it on without checking for any curses, she panics, and Diary Tom protects her.

Fourth Year: Harry and Hermione start dating. Hermione. Harry gets burnt by the dragon. It leaves a scar on her face. Hermione kinda breaks up with her sometime after the first task because Skeeter writes about them in the Daily Prophet. Draco is her lake hostage. Fred takes her to the Yule Ball. They start dating. Summer between fourth and fifth, she finds locket in Grimmauld Place, her Tom hangs it around her neck. Locket Tom terrorises her dreams basically. Diary Tom has a crush on her (at the very least) and kisses her a couple of times. Oh! She let Dudley get kissed by the dementor.

Fifth Year: School had started and she got an aim bridge detention right away. The fic was ended sometime in fifth year.

#+begin_quote
  Eliza Potter was abandoned in an orphanage by the Dursely's and so 11 years later she refuses to be the Light Golden girl everyone wants. Eliza Potter is more a force of nature than a girl and she refuses to let anything stand in her way to greatness, and that includes meddling old headmasters[starts in first year]

** I'm fairly certain you're looking for "i give you all of me (all of you)" by amjnyard.

I happened to have the link saved as a bookmark, but now it just redirects me to the ao3 homepage. Seems like the author took the story down.

*** Yes! This is it!! Thank you! I found this comment from the author (thanks for the name!) on one of their other works where someone else asked about the fic:

“i actually took down the fic because it was brought to my attention that there are pretty transphobic connotations with genderbends & i didn't want to contribute to that! i will be re-writing & re-uploading it however. it'll be sans genderbend so it'll be a little different obviously, but a lot of it will stay the same.” - amjnyard
