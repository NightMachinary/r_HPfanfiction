Been playing around with some FF ideas while writing some stories, and today thought of something.

I was curious as to whether or not there are many or any good HPFF where Harry Potter attends a school outside of Hogwarts. For example, he goes to Beauxbatons, and perhaps winds up with Fleur/Gabriel in the romance department. Or maybe Hermione goes as well since her family is familiar with France.

If not Beauxbatons, then what about Durmstrangs, or perhaps the American Academy of Magic?

No slash links if possible as they dont interest me at all. But beyond that I am open to any suggestions on this front, either for research purposes or simply personal reading.


** Beyond the omnipresent "harry potter and the boy who lived" which literally everyone in the world knows about by this point in time, there's really no others worth recommending.

*** Well that's disappointing if true, although I guess it means my concept is worth trying out. You say "worth" recommending. Does that mean there are some that are either mediocre quality, or lacking plot and more about other aspects? If so, I would appreciate at least a few links. Or do you literally not know of any?

** The writing in this story isn't too good, and it hasn't aged all that well, but I kind of like and will recommend Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life)

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

*** I am not super anal when it comes to good writing. Is it preferred... sure... but a good plot or interesting characters and the like, can help me ignore the writing quality. I know for some thats not the case, but it is for me. Thanks for the suggestion.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

**** Thanks for the suggest.... but god i hope its not as boring as it sounds. No pairings, rated teen, the description just implies he transfers to an Irish school or something and goes about his merry way.

***** It's not really action-oriented, though there is a plot to assassinate him. The amusing part is that he doesn't tell Dumbledore what he's doing, setting off a multi-year effort to find him and get him back under control.

** linkffn(The Magnate by Halt.CPM) is very well written. Harry attends Durmstrang in this fic. WARNING THOUGH. It's very, very abandoned.

  Voldemort's mastery of dark power was unrivaled in history. Grindelwald's legendary charisma came a hairsbreadth from bringing Europe to its knees. "Now, which one will it be for you, Mr. Potter?" Massive AU, Durmstrang Harry
