** Reading your post I thought it's about sentient volcanoes. Which I now want a fic about.

** I have no idea if this has all those elements because I currently have it next up to read, but it's about a volcano at Hogwarts and based on the reviews, I think something happens to Draco.

*** Much as I love a good volcano story---and I truly do, even the silly ones like Dante's Peak (Pierce Brosnan/Linda Hamilton) and Volcano (Tommy Lee Jones)---I don't know if I can suspend enough geology belief (and I never even TOOK a geology course) to accept an active volcano in northern Scotland.

A little Google-fu reveals that the Glencoe area, where some posit Hogwarts to be, is in fact [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Coe#Geology][the remnants of a supervolcano]]... that last erupted *420 million years* ago. That's some extreme time-travelling.

Scotland currently has [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Volcanoes_of_Scotland][ZERO volcanoes]], only the leftovers of ancient lava flows---so ancient that the one under Edinburgh Castle has had a building on top of it since the Iron Age---so we don't even have the Mt. Saint Helens "OMG we thought it was dormant but it wasn't" scenario to work with.
