** There was a really rough fic where Harry ends up sleeping on Tonks' sofa and can here her being beaten up and hurt by Lupin who is a domestic abuser. Harrytries to get Tonks to realise the relationship is a mistake but she thinks she can fix Lupin or that he is nice to her sometimes. It was scarily close to a real domestic abuse situation but I can't remember the fic for the life of me.

*** That sounds pretty interesting and im all for exploring realistic potrayals of domestic abuse ill probably check it out sometime.

But I kinda am looking more for how the relationship wouldnt have worked because Lupin didnt really want the commitment of one at the time. Or at least not one with Tonks. And that doesnt necessarily mean having them in a relationship and then breaking up it could also mean just him rejecting her advances. I mean theoretically Lupin could be abusive so could Tonks anyone could be but seems more likely hed just run away and leave like he did in canon

** Most Honks has this to some degree or another. They range from shallow excuses to justify the pairing to some nice commentary.

One of the better ones is Teddy's Excellent Adventure linkffn(13021745).

(I do with that one was a bit less "Teddy planned this" and more "misunderstanding", but)

Teddy hates Lupin for his behavior and, in his view, getting his mother killed. He considers Harry his father. Lupin does handle it poorly, but it doesn't quite enter bashing territory.

Also, any Tonks based fic without some casual gender bending is a wasted oppertunity...

Edit: I think I am conflating this one with the one that Harry/Teddy/Audi travel back in time and Harry blood-adopts Teddy
