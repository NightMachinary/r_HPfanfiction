Id like opinions of those who may have read more than me.


** Yes. All depends on the skill of the author.

** Linkffn(9622073) has a demension traveler MoD!Harry, and while the story hasn't been updated in a year, it is a good story. While powerfull, Harry and his magic isn't OP (I think, its been a while).

So in answer to your question, yes I think it could work, but it would depend on the wroter and how you wanted the different magics to interact.

*** Tbh it's kinda crappy. The author doesn't really portray Harry well.

***** It's not horrible. There are so few crossovers that it's probably one of the best ones tho.

** Anything is possible. It usually helps to have good source material to work with though, which Eragon doesn't have. I imagine a crossover of the two will run into all the same quality issues that HP/PJO crossovers tend to have.

** Why the hell not? - Depends on the author and how it's set up!

I mean it could be that Harry actually is Eragon (as in: He appears in that world and story happens from there!) or that he just meets and helps Eragon (and gets help in return with his dark lord problem)...

GO WILD MAN, GO WILD :) (I'll give it a read as long as it's not slash!)

** I would argue that any crossover can work if the author has basic writing skills and creativity. Go for it!

** Yeah- any crossover can be done. Some just need more skill than others.

If you just wanna take Harry and drop him into Eragon like the fic someone else has already suggested, then it wouldn't really be difficult at all.

When you start trying to merge entire universes worth of lore it gets far more difficult. But I also find that, if pulled off properly, those are the /best/ fics. linkffn(Child Of The Storm) is honestly my favorite fic, and it's a full blown merger-crossover.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
