** Well first off, theres not a ton out there like A Black Comedy that I have seen. Secondly, what exactly are you looking for apart from what seems to be Comedy? Any other stipulations?

Without knowing more, for now all I could recommend is "Oh God Not Again!"

linkffn(4536005)

*Edit:* Oh and for a more perverted take, you could try "Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor"

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry Potter goes back in time and has to start everything again. Do you think he will be careful not to screw the timeline up? No, he doesn't even think about it! A story featuring a loony Harry and a Magical World that seems willing to adapt to him.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
