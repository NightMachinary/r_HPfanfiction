Okay, okay, don't kill me.

I'm looking for a fic where he buys/starts a town and runs it. I'm in that sort of mood.

Over 70k+ words.


** Well, there's the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]["Island of Fire"]] series by Esama. Harry and others found Atlantis. Sort of.

**** There will be references that assume you know what they are talking about but there are a fair number of context xlues that can be used to fill yourself in.

Overall I would say it is helpful to have the knowledge of the series, but not required. And the amount of knowledge you need is relatively small. Reading a summary of Got would give you enough.

** /The Stars Alone/, linkffn(12040341), is pretty good. He, Hermione, and Luna were basically building up new civilization from the scratch to take on the Goa'ulds.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
