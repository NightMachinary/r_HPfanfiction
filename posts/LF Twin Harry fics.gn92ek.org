I need fics in which Harry has either a twin Brother/Sister. The parents are not alive, they still live with the dursleys, everything before Hogwarts era is mostly same, except now he has someone to share all this with.

Alternatively, if Harry has a year younger sister/brother with him, that's good too. Like the parents gave birth and then died on Halloween.

I repeat! I don't want James and Lily to be alive! So no abandoned!Harry fics.

Thank you!

**** Gosh, same. Love it to pieces, coming close to the end and I'm already getting sad about it being finished. Not just an epic novel length, but really well written (when you look past early typo/grammatical errors) plus you get to really see the author's evolution in writing as the chapters progress. Can't recommend this fic enough, it's such a fun read. The whole scope: witty, heart wrenching, angsty, scattered fluff. All the goods while still staying true and on course. All the thumbs up, upvotes, favs, and kudos for this one :)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Brothers Divided by jeleania.

Oneshot, WBWL

The author note says: "picked a cliche prompt out of a proverbial hat - got "twins".

As fun as the prompt can be, I didn't want to write multi-chapter works of each Hogwarts year in the twins' lives. Instead, I made this oneshot that covers the changes in several of the major events."
