As the title suggests I'm looking for fics in which Harry goes back in time to the Marauder Era. I hope you guys will help me out on this. If at all possible I'd like to know the pairings of the fics in question.


** Since you're not looking for a specific fic, this should be a Request.

I found linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) to be a lot more interesting than I expected.

Harry finds himself in the past and tries to just hide away out of fear of changing the timeline - this attitude does change though. He pretends to be a squib for a couple of reasons, and has to deal with discrimination that's waaaay worse than he thought, though this also comes to an end. He's paired with one of the Prewett twins, but it's only in the latest couple of chapters that this has become any kind of relevant.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** linkffn(Delenda Est)

Though, in this story, Harry becomes their Potions professor rather than a classmate.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** These are a few that popped to mind:

â€‹

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways]] Is one of my all time favorites on getting sent back into the past.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]] Is also amazing, but is very divisive on this site about whether it's good or not (it is :) )

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12877625/1/Through-the-Looking-Glass]] Has an interesting premise and sounds like something that could possibly happen

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8821847/1/All-Was-Not-Well]] Harry wins, wins harder, and then actually gets to have a life

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel]] Is a more... subtle take on it? Kinda?

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

** Although many of my favourites have been mentioned already. One that actually stands out is "Stepping Back" by "TheBlack'sResurgence".

Has a lot of elements that I truly like in a HP fanfic. Family magic; Black,Potter and Peverell family.

To be clear the pairing is a little out there but works amazingly (Harry/Bellatrix). The story sadly like all good things is about to come to an end and only the last chapter remains. The word count is also pretty good.

All in all a perfect match for what you're looking for.

P.S.Sorry don't know how to link the story. P.P.S. Hope you like it.
