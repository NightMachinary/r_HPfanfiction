Harry, Ron, and Hermione are dubbed as the Golden Trio in fanon, but upon numerous rereads of the canon books, Hermione is often not present when Harry and Ron have conversations and hang out. In SS, she (likely) spent her birthday all alone since she wasn't yet friends with Harry and Ron. There are many scenes in the books where Hermione simply isn't there, from Christmas breaks to Quidditch conversations to being Petrified and also summer breaks in the beginning books. Given that Hermione seems to be usually helping Neville in Potions, and that Neville wanted to go to the Yule Ball with her, it doesn't seem far-fetched that they became friends offscreen. In Harry's dorm, he and Ron are closer friends, as are Dean and Seamus. This leaves us with Neville, who probably wasn't friendless even if he wasn't popular or gifted. This would also explain how Hermione knows so much about the Wizarding World (compared to Harry) other than just reading books. In the summers that she didn't spend with Harry and Ron, she may have visited Neville and his Gran and learned stuff from how they lived.


** Not a bad idea at all, but I've never encountered it before. Sorry.

** NL/HG is a common pairing when authors who don't want to ship Harmony but aren't a fan of Ron. I could totally see HG and NL hanging out. Their idea of a good Friday night is probably popping some popcorn and watching confusing period BBC murder mysteries.
