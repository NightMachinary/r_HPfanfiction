There was a fic, possibly more than one where Harry, at the end of the first year, asks if his Punishment is over and he can stop playing Quidditch. Quidditch is pretty generic, and you can't really do it much different to canon anyway. That, and Wood being a Quidditch Extremist, and the ridiculous amounts of training involved (And everyone being dicks about it after the Dragon incident)


** Harry the Hufflepuff? Maybe?I know I've read this fic too....

*** Well, it rather doesn't have Wood as Harry's quidditch captain, so likely not that one. But it's a good fic anyway so whatevs.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

** Harry Potter and The Daft Morons?

*** Daft Morons was way too slow paced for my liking. It was at the end of first year, he asks McGonagall if his punishment is over, or something like that. 63 Chapters - about 4-500k words from the First Task to the Third. That and the whole "Hermione is gorgeous and Harry is whipped" cliche.

Fic I'm after, it was at the end of first year, Harry asks if the Punishment has finished, and if he can stop playing Quidditch.
