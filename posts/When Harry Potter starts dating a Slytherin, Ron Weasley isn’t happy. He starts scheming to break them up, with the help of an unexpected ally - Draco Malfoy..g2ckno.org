It's a fairly common trope in fanfiction for Harry to befriend or date Slytherins, and for both Ron and Draco to be angry about it.

Without naming names, I was reading one such fanfiction, and noticed that Ron and Draco are portrayed /very/ similarly, and both have essentially the same goal - stopping Harry and the Slytherin(s) from associating with one another.

What I've never seen, however, is Ron and Draco working together towards their shared goal. I feel like that could be a fun story to read - either from a comedy perspective, or a more serious one where Ron and Draco end up as close friends/dating after their shared experiences.

** I can see their plan failing and then someone(probably Hermione) calling out on their hypocrisy since they both proved a Slytherin and a Griffindor can work together.

I like Harry/Slytherin stories because it's a very good opportunity for conflict and studies in prejudice and nurture, unlike the black and white that was canon.

** Daphne/Tracey (used these since they're the most commonly used, though I'd like to see a well-written OC or one of the Carrows as a change of pace?) and Harry know all about their oft self-foiling attempts, thanks to Hermione and Daphne/Tracey or another of the girlfriend's besties.

Ron and Malfoy ending up as frenemies would be hilarious... which is why Harry/Hermione, and his GF/her BF let them try their schemes.

His girlfriend being Hestia or Flora, with the other twin disapproving, could add a nice dynamic.
