******* It doesn't sound so outlandish to me, there's precedent for mental connections between people (legilimency, harry's horcrux-scar) and people easily accept things like shared dreams, which are basically the same.

An expanded space on the other hand would mean that either the spatial size of memories is limited, or the expanded space of the pensieve reconfigures itself to match the memory (for which we do have precedent with the RoR) but both of these just don't feel right to me.

I don't remember how it was in the movies, but the descriptions in the books always seemed to me like you would only dip your head in the pensieve, and not get sucked in with your whole body. I might have just misunderstood them though.

***** And this is what's going too far? Having Fudge capable of being convinced via pensieve? How is any AU element /ever/ considered realistic?

If there's even one single person in the fandom who has enjoyed several stories but hasn't found and enjoyed one with something less realistic, I would be amazed. Not to mention canon itself.

Besides... who cares what standards each individual holds fics to? Nothing wrong with that, but it's irrelevant here. OP is making a request. If s/he wanted a fic where everybody spontaneously turns into a kryptonian, then that's the request. It doesn't have to make sense.

***** Because that's not what OP wants. They want the pensieve involved, for whatever reason. Why cares why?

A request is being made, why try to change/ignore it, or say that it /can't/ happen? That defeats the point of making one.

"LF fics where Harry and Snape become friendly, any recommendations?"

"Snape hates Harry! In the books Snape hated James, which passed onto the son. There's also the mess with his guilt about Lily's death, and probably led to him blaming Harry as well. If you're going to change Snape's character to make befriending him possibly, why not just change it so Snape thinks well of him from the start?"

It's silly.
