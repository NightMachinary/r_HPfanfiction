I mean sure. It's /interesting/ ; hell, timetravel is one of /my/ favourite genres. But why? There's nothing to indicate its even possible in Canon (and I'm not sure what element the flawed time turner's include) but somehow this genre thrives. Is it something that's prominent in every fanfiction fandom? Or is it because we have a lot of knowledge of the past, and we want to explore it with our protag + knowledge of the future?


** Personally, I really like happy endings. And a lot of people I cared about died in canon. Plus, the usual characterization of someone who intended to travel back in time to fix stuff is my cup of tea. Plus, I just really like people actually being punished. I dunno man its good stuff

** It is a prominent theme in many fandoms. For me, it's because most 'problems' faced by MC's have their roots in the past. Using Star Wars as an example, Luke has to undo a government that came to power in his parents' generation. Instead of using an OC, you just bring a future canon character to the past.

** It's very prominent in a lot of fandoms. Especially ones that have it happen or can realistically lend to the possibility of it. Lots of times stories will have things happen that people don't agree with/like/make them sad. While you could just change those thing and write a story straight up with those changes. Some people do do that, others want to not just change those things, but "fix" them so it was never a thing in the first place though.

A good way to fix those issues is time-travel. A character who's experienced the canon stuff and the knowledge of it can make sure it doesn't happen and make it better if they go back in time.

** At its core, I think time travel scratches an itch about having a more informed/competent MC - and more than that, one that is /strangely/ more competent to everyone around them, while having to be somewhat secretive.

I'd lump time travel and dimension hopping into the same general category of fics, as well - they often act the same way in giving the time traveler a chance to interact with deceased characters, change the plotline, and have some capabilities no one expects, while relying heavily on themselves.

Time travel is also very versatile - it lets you pick a point in canon and see it changing, without needing to build up to a reasonable way that they decide to act that way. It's also quite prominent in other fandoms. There's varying forms it can take - the classic 'wake up in a younger body', a time loop, physical time travel, and taking someone else's body over are all very different in effect!

For me, I do think that the canon Harry Potter universe is unfortunately not the best for such time travel fics - though it's my favorite sub-genre. The reason is that so much of the plot hangs by a thread - so a time traveling Harry changing everything up is almost /too/ easy, at least for the main series. An AU approach to it, even just to simply increase Voldermort/the Death Eater's competence, definitely helps in my opinion.

Oh, and of course, I shouldn't forget that for some it's just an easy way to power up the MC - it lets them explain why Harry might know everything, and make it unnecessary to explain how he picked up all these super-special-awesome unique abilities. That's not really my type of time travel fics, so I almost forgot ><

You have all of those broken time turners. That sand could be used for something. And the magic system in HP? There is no magic system. There's some loosely worded rules and what is shown. As long as you don't disprove anything already said, anything you make can fit in. Don't even discount the fact that in the Magical world (the british one at least) they have a "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach, so rules can be broken if in a not bullshity way. Used a malfunctioning (or it breaks as you use it) time turner? How about a ritual to place your consciousness in your past body? Or send your memories back? Yeah, that's believable. It works, because it's the HP magic "system" or lack of a system.

And for me, the last few books were a dumpster fire for me. Not only did our favorite characters die, they died off-screen. That's insulting. A POV change could have fixed this. Sure, we were told a battle happened, but we didn't see it until the second "wave" if you will. And even then, it was the ass end of it. And then you see the results.

I like happy endings, I can even deal with some tragedy, but deaths that did happen felt like they were tacked on to me. I mean, Sirius' death felt too overly dramatic. Like JKR said "Oh. Also, Sirius dies." Like it was done to remove all hope of escaping the Dursleys. And even then, Dumbledore's death, Harry all of a sudden became the most inaccurate person ever, where in the previous book he was a certified badass in the ministry? Tragedy in HP wasn't handled very well. Sure, rage/sorrow has a place in it, but it's Harry we are talking about. He operates on rage/anger most of the time.

And another point of a lot of time travel fics is to give Harry freedom. From my perspective, the only thing he truly decided for himself was to come back from "death". Everything else was another party's planning, opinions, and being otherwise forced. Especially for a child to teenager.

** With this fandom, and I assume a lot of others as well, writing a fanfiction story can be very limiting, you're locked into a lot of things and you HAVE to address some situations otherwise people will wonder what the hell is going on.

Time travel fics let you play with your favourite characters but still ignore all of the stuff you don't want to deal with as an author. Don't want Sirius in Azakaban? Time travel can fix that. Don't want Harry's parents to die, there's time travel for that. Want Harry and Bellatrix together? Gonna need some time travel and some anti-lunatic potion for that.

It's a way of warping the plot to fit your vision without having to shoehorn those plot points around your own plot.

** In canon, Harry survives almost entirely by luck, someone else's preparations, and author fiat. On the face of it, there's very little 'traditional hero' skill or competence in any of his successes. He runs in, does some yelling and panicking, then lucks into a solution (his mother's protection in book one, the aid of Fawkes in book two, a time turner in book three, he basically just stays in a task long enough to not die and ends up succeeding them all in book four, etc etc) and doesn't really show much of the development into the hero figure most stories write.

I guess the logic of having Harry go back in time is that it gives him a chance to not just be a patsy charging headstrong into every situation and only surviving because he's too stubborn and full of passive suicidal ideation to back down like typical people would and sticks it out until he gets lucky and wins. It lets him be a more traditional boy-turns-hero monomyth type.

And it generally serves to let him go through the plot again with some 'new knowledge' about how terrible the state of the wizarding world/dumbledore/the weasleys/chocolate frog cards these days/snape/the dursleys/fudge and malfoy, etc are and that lets authors fix the societal ills that they see the Wizarding World as having.

Plus there's the usual fix-it desire we all have. Rowling killed a lot of characters we liked, so we want to change things so they can live. Hilariously counter to the whole 'forgive and forget and accept you'll die someday' message of the series, but yeah.

** It's already shown in Canon so you can sorta wiggle any further time shenanigans easily, and it's a very straight forward way to shake up a setting with few other changes or consequences (which aren't explored in the ff itself).

** For me, a huge part of it is that I've been in this fandom for two decades so I've grown tired of seeing the characters react to the same twists in the same way. Like, 10 years ago, someone rewriting the books with a Slytherin Harry/raised by someone else/etc. was an intriguing premise and I'd read the whole thing. Now, a repeat of the books has become boring, I want to see people shaking things up - new types of magic, new bonds with characters, intrigue and so on. Time travel is the #1 way to accomplish that. It also helps that time travel fics' protagonists are generally adults or young adults, which entertains me more than ‘weirdly mature genius eleven year olds who act nothing like kids'.

** The only thing I hate about stories like this is how easy he integrates into the past. Except for him being massively OP, there is very rarely any other effect of him being an adult stuck in a child's body. This is even worse when he comes from a desolate, post-apocalypse future where most of his friends died. Beyond the regular culprits like PTSD, survivor guilt, depression, anxiety, etc, even the day to day stuff are so woefully ignored.

How will a war veteran relate in any way, shape or form with a bunch of immature kids? There is no way to form a real friendship with them, at least not for many years to come. He could be faking it, yeah, but when does time-traveller Harry ever do that in fics? How will he put up any kind of effort or interest in school when he could probably duel Dumbledore himself out of Hogwarts right at the Sorting Ceremony?

And then, consider romance. You have this grizzled man anywhere from his mid 20s to his 40s, and you think he will fall in love with 10 year old Ginny Weasley, or 11 year old Granger? Even if he ignores the disturbing option of grooming them, they would never be /his/ lovers. And he would probably do his utmost to remove the events that made them his lovers in the first place. Imagine how interesting a side plot of him falling in love with Amelia Bones would be, or any of his teachers. Because the guy /is/ an adult, if he feels romance, it's definitely going to be towards someone his real age, not a kid. No stupid smut or soul bond, just a man falling in love while being stuck in a situation where any partner he goes for would instantly shut him down.

​

Very few time travel stories actually take their setting seriously. Unless there is a very specific set of events, or we are talking about a self-insert, this kind of adult-stuck-in-child-body ought to always be a drama, imo.

** Fanfic is general is a redo/fix-it for things one doesn't like. Time travel is the ultimate, easy way to change anything.

Also, revenge fantasies are on occasion very satisfying.
