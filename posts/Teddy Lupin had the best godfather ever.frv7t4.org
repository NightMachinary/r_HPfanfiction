On the day of Teddy's birth Uncle Harry and Aunt Hermione would take him into The bowels of a Ministry, And into a hallway with many doors, Each one leading to a different chamber, The most welcoming of which was the Hall of Family , It was a special place where wizards and witches If they knew the right rituals could summon Their ancestors temporarily, For up to 24 hours. Every year on Teddy's birthday Uncle Harry would call Up some old friends.

And every year Teddy got to spend a few hours With him Parents and His uncle Harry's own Godfather , his Cousin Sirius. It was the best present ever! Teddy got to find out first hand that his mum gave the best hugs in the universe better the Grandma Andy's even!

And. His Da Remus, taught his how to make his eyes flash gold even When it wasn't the full moon.

Uncle Harry made sure Teddy got to meet his parents, while Aunt ‘ Mione always stood guard, something about ,” Constant vigilance!” And a few other words Uncle Harry Refused to teach him, “ Until he was older!”

But that didn't matter, Teddy got to show his mum his chocolate frog card collection, and his dad taught him to play gobstones on his seventh birthday day that year.

** Always imagined Harry taking Teddy to a quidditch game and after the game introducing him to the teams and his good friend, "Viktor Krum, best flyer in the world." Viktor grins, "I don't know about that. I don't remember ever out flying a dragon."

** Man I really wish we got to see more Teddy and Harry. Like, c'mon Harry is his Godfather. There's so much potential there! And your post made it all the sweeter too.

** This is so wonderful in a bittersweet way.
