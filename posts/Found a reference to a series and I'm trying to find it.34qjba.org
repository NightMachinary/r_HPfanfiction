Hey all, Was messing about on some trivia sites and I came across a really detailed world about some "Dark Destiny Series" The 3 names are: Birth of Darkness The Unbound Seals The Rule of Darkness I was hoping someone has a link or maybe ha them saved?


** It seems to have definitely existed:

  Harry Potter in the Dark Destiny Series is a lot similar to his original self from the original series for most part however come differences have some apparent, his Gryffindor persona is only one side of the coin that hides his other more shadowed side, this side would be his hidden Slytherin persona and his affinity for the Dark Arts. Despite being called Harry Potter, he changed his middle name to Harry James Florentine Potter, he is the Patriarch of the New Potter Family.

and its fan-art is pretty on-point. I'm super curious now; if you find it, please let me know.

** My google-fu has failed me. I've concluded they either don't currently exist or never did.
