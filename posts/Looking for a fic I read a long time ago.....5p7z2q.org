I /almost/ want to say it was either on FF.net or AFF before the domain changed and changed hands....

I /want/ to say it was called "The Lady of Slytherin" but the results on google are inconclusive and don't match what I remember ...

At some point, maybe ~15-17, harry turns into a girl (can't remember the name used) and turns out to be the heiress of slytherin at some point - and a rather powerful one too.

I explicitly remember a conversation between ron and her where ron is asking is that really you harry, and harry as a girl responds along the lines of 'yes yes, i'm harry, blah blah blah ' "hairy arse " - i do outright remember this phrase

At some point femharry gets very, very angry and screams something along the lines of "I am the lady of slytherin!" .... I believe that may have taken place in diagon alley, but i'm not sure. I think at this point access to the slytherin vaults/title had already been gained.

This would have been anywhere from 3-4 up to 8 years ago that i read this.

This is highly vauge and it's what i can remember.... not very helpful, but it might jog /someone's/ memory. I'll add more if i can remember!

note: it is definitely NOT this one - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10962500/1/The-Lady-of-Slytherin-Dark-Beginnings]] because harry starts out as a boy

It was rather lengthy .. wanna say over 50k words easily
