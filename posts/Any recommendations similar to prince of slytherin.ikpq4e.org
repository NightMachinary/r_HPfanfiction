I'm looking for what the title says. I'm okay with any pairing except for snarry. I would prefer not hinny but if it's well written then it's ok. The longer the better.


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) and sequels are extremely similar. linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) is probably the closest in overall tone, but it's incomplete. linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is longer, a little different but still the same general sort of fic. I
