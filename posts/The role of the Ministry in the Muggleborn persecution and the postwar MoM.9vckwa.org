While we know that Umbridge was one of the driving forces behind the Muggleborn persecution, she was by no means the only one. She did not run Azkaban when it was turned into a concentration camp, she did not hunt down people, she just sat in the courtroom and did some administrative work.

This, however, means that there was a not insignificant number of people helping to carry out a small-scale genocide. And given the size of the Ministry, quite a lot of its employees would be involved.

So what happens after the war? We know that Justice was not served since people like Draco Malfoy avoided prison despite an overwhelming amount of evidence against him and the invalidity of the "coercion" and "underage" excuses as explained by [[/u/taure]] the other day. But did the Ministry actually fire one quarter of their employees (guessed number) or did these people who just recently were carrying out a genocide remained in their government positions? Was there some kind of compensation for those who have been wronged/killed? Was there some kind of vetting process afterwards or at least an attempt to prevent something similar from happening again? How many people were punished, how many got away?

Did Rowling say anything on the issue, and if not, what is your headcanon?


** I imagine it was similar to post-war Germany. The high-ranking perpetrators got heavy sentences, but the middle and low ranks got away with mild punishments, if any.

I a post-war situation, reconstruction and reconciliation often take priority over serving justice, and the lenient punishment for Draco Malfoy is a hint that it was similar in magical Britain.

Also, a totalitarian system like Voldemort requires the participation of a significant part of the population. Entire ministry departments were involved, also pure-blood supremacist volunteers and snatchers. Probably more than a quarter of wizards and witches shared, if not support for Voldemort, then at least the supremacist and authoritarian beliefs his regime was founded on.

Those probably had no problem accepting to "sacrifice" the Death Eaters and high-ranking officials, but would have resisted the new government if there had been an effort to thoroughly persecute everyone involved in the crimes committed under Voldemort's rule. Many probably didn't want to face the fact that their own parents, spouses or children were involved. WW2 ended over 70 years ago, and my grandma still struggles to acknowledge that her father was a Nazi.

**** Realistically, I feel like the wizarding world would have devolved into all out civil war instead of everyone getting along civilly. There's often amnesty in these type of horrible situations as it is near impossible to prosecute 1/4 of the population, but major players still got off. Draco arguably didn't deserve life in Azkaban, but he didn't deserve to get off scott free, either. Same with Narcissa.

Israelis assassinated some nazis who were given clemency, and supposedly some of the figures in Pinochet's regime were also assassinated. My head canon is that something like that happens, or civil war breaks out.

That's something many here seem to ignore: There's a wide range between "Guilty, off with his head" and "Not guilty, set free". Saying "Draco's circumstances aren't enough to declare him innocent" won't lead to "Draco's treated like a fanatical, eager Death Eater". He'll be judged more leniently - but he's still guilty.

** I am flabbergasted at the amount of people who staunchly believe that children threatened with torture and death deserve Azkaban. If I was a member of a jury on Malfoy's case, I'd nullify any guilty verdict in a heartbeat, assuming it carried such a harsh sentence. Rehabilitation, not schadenfreude, should be the basis of jurisprudence.

Regarding your question: I think most crimes would be swept under the rug, or uncovered after only a loooooooong period of investigations (talking years, here). Why? Because all of this has happened before, and so all of this will happen again.

No, seriously. When Voldemort fell the first time, what happened? The only death eaters that went to Azkaban were the fundamentalists (the Lestranges), but anyone with a dose of common sense was able to get away. Hell, as far as we know, even the Crabbe and Goyle patriarchs didn't do any prison time. In addition, Wizarding law was more than happy to let innocent men rot (Sirius). What all of this points to is that sources of obtaining trustworthy confessions/convictions (like Veritaserum) are so rare that we can discount them as trial aids. Therefore, we're left with a bunch of people who may or may not have committed or abetted crimes, and there's really no way to find out immediately. All this while, the community needs to be rebuilt, the Ministry needs to run, and wounds need to be healed. In the face of such insurmountable circumstances, I highly doubt there would be any un-obvious convictions (like captured on battlefield in full DE regalia). Any truly guilty parties would probably use this moment to run far away, and good luck catching them, unless, of course, Harry becomes a bounty hunter, chasing rogue dark wizards across the globe.

What my main point was is that most crimes (from, let's say Ministry workers who abetted DE atrocities, but didn't actually get their hands dirty or snatchers) would go either undiscovered or be brought to light only after a long time.

I mean, think of how there are still stories about Nazis -- some of them 90+ years old -- being put on trial /today/. I think something similar would happen in HP post-war.

The fact that he was not the worst-off person in Magical Britain does not mean that his situation was not significantly worse than the majority of the nation and a mitigating factor in regards to his sentencing.

#+begin_quote
  it is not a valid legal excuse since coercion does not apply to crimes against the life and gangs are generally excluded either way.
#+end_quote

Magical Britain is a fantasy country, we have no idea what their laws say about coercion. The presence of the imperius curse would likely have a significant impact on the law. If we assume they have similar laws to nonmagical Britain, though, my understanding is that the reason gangs are excluded is because the defendant placed themselves in the situation which led to duress; Malfoy could make a reasonable argument that he did not choose to be born to a Death Eater, and his very entrance to the gang itself was under duress.

I think I should also reiterate the statement which opened this conversation, from Boris:

The issue is not with punishing Malfoy, the issue is with sentencing him to time in an absolutely brutal prison. I've also seen many people claim that it would be an injustice if he faced anything but /life/ in Azkaban.

That was Boris idea, the OP does not specifies facilities. It could be anything, from some cells in the Ministry up to a random Gulag in the Siberian Wastelands.

We know that postwar Azkaban is a different place than before/during the war. There are no soul sucking demons for one. You could ship the whole lot to Numengrad, or install some isolation and fix the roof. Point is, Boris is against any form of punitive justice, instead favouring to keep a war criminal for just as long as it takes to "rehabilitate" him.

#+begin_quote
  life in Azkaban
#+end_quote

You could even make a case for capital punishment, which was relatively common before the war when no one batted an eye at summary executions. Then again, Draco pleas guilty, gives a few names and that sentence is transformed into life in prison.

#+begin_quote
  and his very entrance to the gang itself was under duress.
#+end_quote

But his choice to attack civilians was not part of that. He's should not be punished for membership, but for what he did after joining. He could have stabbed Dumbledore with a cursed dagger, but no, lets hide between civilians, attack them, attempt several assassinations of the head of Parliament and lead a group of fascist terrorists into a school full of children.

This isn't true. The likes of Bellatrix Lestrange didn't receive capital punishment despite gleefully declaring their loyalty to Voldemort in court. Unless I'm missing something, the only instance of capital punishment we see is Sirius Black, in a case of extreme executive overreach (most likely simply a case of JKR comically misrepresenting government for the sake of plot, but if we choose to take it seriously) regarding a supposed mass murderer who had proven to be able to escape the most secure prison in the country.

He may not have had the gun to his head at Hogwarts, but he knew it was waiting for him at home. His mother was also being held hostage (and father, but he got himself into that mess).

**** I don't think anyone is claiming Malfoy deserved life in Azkaban, but he should have served some time in jail. He let death eaters into a school full of students, nearly murdered multiple people with poisioned/cursed objects, etc. Narcissa, however, got off way too easy just for helping Harry. She was a full on bigot, complicit in her husband's crimes, and only objected when Draco was involved.

TLDR: There's an argument that he should have been in the wizarding equivalent of juvie until the age of 21 and then on house arrest/heavily monitored for several years afterwards.
