So I wrote this up for fun - it's totally subjective, of course. With the sheer number and varied nature of HP fanfiction, there's no way you can boil it down to a standard Top 20 List... but it was pretty fun to try. I thought it would be a great list to nitpick and argue about, in a friendly way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Elaneanasazi][Lane Anasazi's Profile]]

There are also links to all 20 stories in my favorites list.

I tried to post the text here, but it's too long. Here's the introduction; the actual reviews and top 20 list are in my profile.

"One of the challenges of Harry Potter fanfiction -- or any fanfiction, really -- is that when you're just getting into it, it's easy to be overwhelmed by sheer volume, and when you're a veteran, it's hard to find new, compelling works that fit your particular tastes.

Naturally, we turn to word-of-mouth. We look at great authors' favorites lists, we trawl Reddit/HP Fanfic, we browse the various TVTropes pages dedicated to the subject. But too often, we only see lists of recommended works in the context of a list with no other information -- we know they're recommended, but not why.

So here's my contribution to making it just a little bit easier to find amazing, profoundly moving, truly excellent Harry Potter fanfiction. My completely arbitrary rules of the game are that I'm limited to 20 pieces, which to me represent the very best of what's out there. They're ranked from 20 to 1, and if I ever add one to the list, someone will have to get bumped off it.

With each entry, I will endeavor to explain exactly why the work merits inclusion. Each work can be found in my own favorites list, which is a copy of this list.

Nitpicking about exact ranking, certain works being excluded, and anything else is heartily encouraged. It wouldn't be a completely subjective list without healthy and vigorous debate."


** The lack of Prince Of The Dark Kingdom and The Prince That Was Promised are both conspicuous and wrong.

I kid, I kid, but no really, no Dark Kingdom? It's got to be the most epic fic in the entire fandom, followed shortly by Emperor.

That said, something does actually rankle me. I've honestly never understood the love that Stages Of Hope gets. It's a competent fic, even interesting at parts. That said, I've always found it far too short, and with too little characterization and not nearly enough plot to merit the absolute adoration it gets in the fandom.

*** Prince That Was Promised would definitely go on there, but it's a crossover, and my completely arbitrary rules limited it strictly to HP. It's really damn good, though. Love that one.

Dark Kingdom... I think I'm in the minority on that one, actually. It's compelling, and it definitely hooked me for a while, but around the time Voldemort was courting the queen of France, and Harry was getting addicted to chewing leaves (it's been a while since I read it, so this might be slightly off), I just lost the thread. Kind of like with the later Firebird books, everything was cloudy and grey enough that I lost track of what I even wanted for the characters.

**** I'm still getting the hang of how reddit stacks replies, so if this wasn't to me, apologies.

Anyway, when I put the top 20 together, I started with a big list and made cuts. Here are a few I cut for various reasons:

/The Very Secret Diary/ - Arabella

(pretty much a must-read classic, but more of an /experience/ than an actual story. The later sections are some of the most creeped-out I've ever been by Riddle in a fanfic.)

/Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince/ - RRFang

(I'm not a huge fan of Ginny, or at least how most stories use her, and as I've read more fanfic I've also stopped being very interested in "Day in the limelight" stories that retell canon from a different perspective, but this story shows you how a likeable Ginny that's faithful to what we know about her in canon can work, and if you're into Original Flavor, it really, really /really/ reads like Rowling. Dumbledore, in particular, is a character that's really tough to write (the canon version, I mean), and this absolutely nails it.)

/Aucune Defense Pour Toi/ - D. Geheimnis

(Not a fan of Fleur's decision making abilities in this, and though I am a sucker for a love story I like a little bit more plot and comedy and a little less angst, but Fleur as a /character/ really shines in this one)

/Oh God Not Again/ - Sarah1281

(comfort food)

/Knowledge is Power/ - Fettucini

(The guiltiest of guilty pleasures, and you have to /really/ just grin and bear it through some parts, but because of my own personal tastes, the "super Harry as a jerkass Dr. House-type" thing tickles my fancy. I could never defend this as a paragon of literary virtue, but I will admit I enjoyed it.)

/Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ - TheSanti

(One of the best of its kind, and a classic if you're into nonBWL Dark Harry.)

/Ananke/ - Eunike

(Almost brings me around on Snape; good characterization and dialogue.)

Alexandra Quick series - Inverarity

(Would easily make the list, but I decided to limit it to HP-centric, so no crossovers and no Alexandra Quick.)

*** Haven't read the first two, so there's another to add to the "get to it at some point" list.

Hogwarts Battle School was considered, and it is quite good, but my own personal tastes tend to shy away from stories where Harry is the subject of some vast plot he can barely comprehend. It's why I could never really get into the X-Files... very well done, and I really, really like certain aspects of both, but it's not my cup of tea to have the heroes be that much in the dark.

Wastelands of Time I've read, and it does "epic scope" pretty damn well, but the magic, the locations, the characters all felt extremely non-HP. It's great for a change of pace, but reading HP fanfic, at least for me, is about seeing what you can make of the pieces already on the table, not sweeping them off the table completely and saying, "yeah all of that is kid stuff, I'm going 5 levels higher."

It's well written, and doesn't spend much time on things it doesn't need to spend time on - book 1 is covered in a single (long) chapter, book 2 in 2 (long) chapters, book 3 in 3 (long chapters), and so on, with the chapter length generally increasing throughout the story. IMHO, it's among the, if not the, best Slytherin!Harry story you will find.

** Interesting list. What I find most interesting about it is its inconsistency... you've got fics like Cauterize on there, which don't really have much in the way of substance, but are stylistically great, and you've also got fics like The Merging, which are stylistically bad but have a good amount of substance.

(And then there's Bungle in the Jungle, which has neither good style or substance).

My own preference is for a Harry who is more talented than canon but still within reason, maintaining Harry's essential canon character, strengths and weaknesses. Because of that my top 5 looks like this:

1. Ectomancer by RustyRed
2. Forging the Sword by MystShadow
3. What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin
4. The Weapon by Qtuani7\\
5. Stranger in an Unholy Land by serpent-sorcerer

These all tick "all the boxes". I feel like a lot of fics on your list are compromises that may have some single great element but let you down on other areas like technical writing or pacing. I can help but think that only fics that are "all round greats" should make a "top #" list, even if that ends up in the exclusion of some classics.

*** Now /that's/ a great comment! Incisive thoughts, plus a list of your own.

I'm curious what your definition of style and substance is, as I can't quite match it up with my own to make it fit your comments. I think of style as essentially the author's ability to consistently convey a specific voice - in which case I'd argue that Bungle packs a lot of style. You might not be particularly /fond/ of that particular voice, which is fine, but I'd argue that Bungle has a solid hold on who the characters are and how they come across on the page.

Or is your conception of "style" something different altogether?

As far as substance goes, it sounds like you're equating that with plot. Am I getting that right? Substance is what happens to the characters, style is how it happens, to boil it down to something snappy?

If that's the case, then yeah, one-shots will by definition be short on substance. But I don't look for substance on its own - I'm interested in a words:substance ratio. What really fascinates me about Cauterize, for example, is how much it actually does manage to say with so few words.

I'm also really excited to check out your list, as I haven't read a single one of those. That's another great thing about HP fanfic... there are so many, that it always feels plausible that you haven't found a handful of absolutely wonderful stories.

**** To put it in a pithy way, I'd say substance is what happens, style is how that's communicated.

Good style would be, essentially, conformity to the accepted standard of good writing as exhibited by mainstream published fiction.

This includes correct spelling, punctuation and grammar, but goes beyond that to include principles such as brevity, dynamic dialogue which feels real without including the inefficiency of real conversation (story dialogue has to move towards a point, unlike real conversation), development of unique character voices in dialogue, efficient description, minimal info-dump, separation of authorial voice from narrative voice, consistent PoV, exciting action, show/tell balance, and the absence of immersion destroying elements like FLASHBACK.

Good substance is significantly more subjective (essentially accordance with preferences), though there are some general rules that can be established, especially with regards to pacing. For example, a romance fic that starts with the pairing being established at the start of the story and which only provides said romance with trivial/token conflict/development is not paced correctly. Another general rule of substance is consistency: you can't have a character able to do something one chapter, then unable to do it the next chapter in order for your plot to go in the direction you desire. A third general rule of substance is that creating cardboard cut-out cartoonish villains for the protagonist to knock down does not make the protagonist look impressive (aka the problem with bashing).

***** Really, really good stuff. You've obviously put a lot of thought into this. I think I'm on board with what you're saying about Bungle now. In terms of style, it's pretty rough around the edges, and obviously then the substance doesn't fit your personal preferences. For me, the substance of Bungle that elevates it to a top pick for me is the Harry/Bill/Fleur dynamic, but then I've always been a sucker for banter-y, buddy-buddy machismo bonding.

And yes, it makes me wince every time an author actually types out the word FLASHBACK to start a scene. It's... so inelegant.

I mean I'm finding a typo or grammar issue seemingly every 3rd or 4th paragraph, enough that it's taking me out of the story. Am I reading the first draft and there's an edited version somewhere, or something? I'm reading this one:

****** Stranger is in there mostly for historical reasons (as you can see, it's quite old). Before Stranger, all fanfics just had Voldemort going around attacking Diagon alley, Hogsmeade, kidnapping Harry's friends then a final battle at Hogwarts. The formula was just repeated again and again, despite there being no strategic gain for Voldemort in any of it.

Then along came Stranger, which had Voldemort actually have strategic goals and methods. He was performing a coup, not a terrorist campaign. It was a complete revelation and anticipated Deathly Hallows by several years.

I loved Tamora Pierce's works dearly when I was in middle school. Still do, actually, but when I went back to try to read it perhaps two years ago I just couldn't find the same magic that I felt the first time around. And I'm a big believer in re-reading.

I think the series spins an enchanting tale for its demographic. Just because it was a little corny and more than a little unbelievable to the adult mind just means we've lost that precious ability to 'suspend disbelief' as well as we once have.

*** Yeah, I definitely thought about both those first two; they kinda demand attention with how popular they are.

Methods of Rationality I picked up when I was first getting into the whole scene, and Harry seemed so wildly out of character (before I realized this could, in fact, be a good thing) that I dropped it around Chapter 15 or so when Harry and Draco have that long, never-ending, impossibly long talk about genetics and inherited traits. With a little more seasoning, I've recently picked it up again and found that the hype may be justified. I'll know more when I finish, but it could bump something for sure.

Nightmares would be #21, I think. It's been forever since I read it, and I certainly don't have anything against it.

**** yeah, just beweare Innocent is a little slow (for some i found it perfect), but has tons of good stuff. its a classic Sirius escapes azkaban and raises harry, it has some sideplots, and fleshes all the side characters rather well. also it's kind of AU as Draco has a older (?) brother and some other details, a fact that isn't relevant until the sequel which updates weekly.

Northrumbrian Work is wonderful canon compilant, Grave Days takes places the day after the Battle of Hogwarts, Aurors and Schoolgirls takes places after that and Strangers at Drakenhaug takes places several years latter after Harry and Ginny are already married and with 3 childrend, I would recomend reading them in order or if you have little time skip to Stranger which for me was the better of the 3.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is just fantasic, it's funny and heartwarming, has mistery and one or two surprises. at first i was a litte bit eceptical about a HP x D&D crossover but i can say that it is one of my favorites fics out there. the MC (Milo, an OC) is weird in the same way Harry from HPMOR is but he is way funnier. a recomended read.

Now if you are into Star Gate, Crumpets is by far the only (finished) fic i could recomend to someone who likes both fandoms, the wirtter knows how to write conflict. it's a freaking roallercoaster when you think things are going well for the heroes the author throwns a curve ball that is logical but somehow didn't occur to you.

**** There is a good reason Harry is the way he is, that was recently revealed. If you can get up to date in the next ~40 hours, there's something very interesting going on (I don't want to spoil it, but it's similar to what happens in the author's original fiction, Three Worlds Collide).

  I'm surprised you didn't include HPMOR and NOFP, one is written very smartly and the other is the ur-example of peggy-sue fics
#+end_quote

Any list like this is going to be incredibly subjective. For instance, I'd rank both of those high up there on the list of most overrated fanfics of all time.

**** I think HPMOR is only overrated because it is rated so highly. Take away the hype, and you're still left with an incredibly written story.

It is true that it's not god's gift to fanfiction, but I think it's silly how people bash the story. Few are its equal.

***** MOR is a story that I can't enjoy because the author and his prior antics are so in-your-face repellant. I have the same problem with stories by Perfect Lionheart and Joe Hundredaire.

*** Like you, I find A Black Comedy to be pretty much everything I could want in an HP fic. I already like the general premise of Peggy Sue and related plot devices, the characters are competent, and the narrative doesn't take itself too seriously and leaves plenty of room for light-hearted humor and decidedly-not-PG innuendos and suggestive situations. (I find it really hard to appreciate grimdark or piles of angst. That's just not what I read for.)

Sorry, that was just me gushing a little bit. Carry on.

*** Yeah, I'll admit the Hadrian thing bugged me more than it had any right to. It was quickly overshadowed by the sheer quality of the storytelling, though. What I appreciated most was that it was a break from fics that try to make everything so HUGE and IMPORTANT and EPIC. Harry just kind of goes about his business, and there's a quiet, almost contemplative tone to the fic without ever seeming like it's boring or dragging.

Browncoat, Green Eyes would have probably made it onto the the list if I included crossovers.

** Thanks for the list. Couple I read and also found to be great stories. I also noticed a few never saw. I'm going to read your #1 black. It sounds like the stuff I try to find but often miss

** Thank you very much for the recommendation of A Long Journey Home. I had never even heard of that story before, and it is truly wonderful. The scene between Dumbledore and 'May' and the scene where Muirgen confronts Morgause are now two of my all time favorites. I have to check out most of these other fics, because clearly you know your stuff!

I can agree with most of these, though I'm still not sold on /The Lie I've Lived/. Thanks for the list.
