Am I the only one who upon realizing a Time/Dimension Travel fic is describing a deviation from canon (or anything other than an immediate "commence time jump") skips down the chapter until they find Harry waking up elsewhere or elsewhen?

What are things that will cause you to start skimming forward to the next scene, but not abandon reading the fic?

**** It all has to do with how the characters are treated in the scene. If the girls are anonymized and then used like porn dolls, then there's no reason to think the writer will be kind to them outside the bedroom. If the scene is just poorly-executed but I still care about the characters... then Page Down gets to play.

** I too skip pretty much the first chapter of every dimension hopping story.

Also, all sorting songs. Actually, sorting scenes in general right up until Harry's "Better be..." They almost always add nothing.

Very long fight scenes where it feels like nothing's going on (pretty much all of Shezza's fight scenes, e.g., are about twice as long as they should be, so I just skim).

Shopping.

Erotic scenes in general; it's just not something I enjoy reading about, particularly given how much bad erotica there is in the fandom.

** Personally, I skip:

- a lot of dream sequences
- lengthy head musing/introspection
- long descriptions of room decor or clothing
- excessive smut (if there are too many sex acts too close together in the story, like 2+ a chapter for several chapters, some of them will get skimmed/skipped)\\
- lyrics to all songs
- chunks of text that is heavily borrowed or copied directly from the book for the sake of the fic plot (I already know what happened in canon and I will skip ahead to where the original story picks up)

*** That kind of sums up perfectly what I'm skipping too :D

Although with dream sequences it heavily depends on what the dream consists of and if it in fact has any importance for the story. Because sometimes it can be very well done.

Same for the canon stuff... Especially at the beginning most FFs get more leeway with that as they need to establish at which point in canon they set off. But afterwards I really don't want to see a lot of the original plot in the fanfic, because if I wanted to read the original plot I'd read the books...

** It's a tricky question, because it's a fine line between skimming and simply hitting the close button.

A lot of post-OotP/GoF fics start with Harry moping about Sirius/Cedric being dead, and using his angst as the jumping off point for their divergence, but many of them spend multiple thousands of words establishing how sad/angry Harry is. I get it, I've read the books, I know that already. Establish it, sure, but you need maybe 200 words for that, not 2,000. Get to the interesting part.

Harry inherits a bunch of stuff from the Black vault, or discovers that his vault is merely a "trust" vault and finds a bunch of stuff in the "real" Potter vault: I'll skim this hard. It's usually clear that the author is going absolutely nowhere with the laundry list of properties, valuable relics, and detailed descriptions of investments or companies or whatever: it's just the literary equivalent of masturbation. If I've been enjoying the story up to that point, I'll skim all that and just mentally note "okay, Harry's rich, got it." Chances are 99% of all that rot will never come up again anyway.

Dream sequences are a big one. A lot of authors try to make them really descriptive and heavy on the metaphor, and not many have the writing chops to pull it off, so any lengthy blocks of dream-description, unless I'm really sold on the writing I'll usually just skim to get the gist of. Most of the time, Harry will have a lengthy conversation with Hermione right afterwards to discuss what it means, anyway.

** I always like the deviation part, I feel it helps with the set up. I almost always skip the sex scenes unless the main pairing went back together. Because sometimes it's like "Harry James Potter!!! You are 150 years old, why the hell are you lusting after 13 year old [inset pairing here]!!"

** Descriptions of the minutiae that doesn't add anything whatsoever to the story - and if there's a lot of it...

Excessive and repeated uses of certain facial expressions such as "His eye twitched", or "Emerald orbs", this can lead me to skim-read if descriptions are often thus.

Terrible magical theory can often lead me to quitting a fic immediately, as I can often just /see/ the plot unveiling in such a way as a proposed "impossible magic" is possible for MC, and all too often this great secret is revealed near the end, and I feel like I've wasted a lot of my time because MC is all "This is /just/ the thing I need to kill blahblahblah!"

** Absolutely nothing. I have a thing about reading fics, and real books, completely. Even though I'm completely straight and it makes me uncomfortable to read such things, I read a slash bdsm lemon just because I could not force myself to skip something. It's a struggle to skip author notes I know contain spoilers to something I've not yet caught up to. There's nothing that could possibly make be skip part of a fic, but not abandon it.

I also skip parts where a character is about to/has just been caught doing something stupid (ex dark magic in the astronomy tower). I just can't handle it, it feels like /'ve been caught doing something stupid

Also flashbacks/long paragraphs in italics (my brain just can't focus on these) and the parts in the perspective of characters I don't care about, in perspective-switching fics.

** Time Travel: I skim up until THE EVENT/RITUAL, to get the general gist of the situation on why, and how. Skip the rest.

Clothing: I don't care. I'll imagine what I would like the characters to wear, and your descriptions will not be remembered even if I did read them.

Sorting Songs: Read first and last line. If they sound ok I'll read the whole thing. If cannon or nonsensical, skip.

Sorting: Only read harry, and maybe any interesting characters who may have been introduced, mostly to see if they are going cannon or not.

Shopping/wand crafting. urgh. Yes, very rare wand, this wand you will use is from the tree Yggdrasil with multiple cores from dementor cloak washed in basilisk venom diluted by phoenix tears, and little bit of random mambo jumbo. Fuck off. I don't mind the custom wands, but the common portrayal (walking around and feeling tugs) sucks ass. Just have the crafter cast some analysis spells, take some notes, and use his skill to match the best wood/core for what his analysis shows. Just come back in a week for the finished product.
