In where magic is treated like a supernatural entity, a gift from old times, or anything in between. Bonus points for muggleborns not understanding this. Minus points for "The death eaters are right".

(If ppssible completed or with regular updates, please?)


** The Black Queen series by Silently Watches has something that works very much like this, and is nearly complete. First story in the series is linkffn(8233291) - Princess of the Blacks.

Be warned, it's pretty grim stuff throughout.

** Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has this. All centered around the soul. Druids, werewolves, and Voldemort with his horcruxes have all dedicated their souls to the Earth (mother magic) whereas traditional life after death “light magic” is dedicating your soul to God. One of the greatest fics to ever be abandoned.
