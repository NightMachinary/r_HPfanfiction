Maybe I've been reading too much fanfiction, but was Dumbledore really that gung-ho against killing? Did he really give second, third, fourth etc chances to some didn't deserve it? Or did fanon - like with many aspects - take it too far?


** “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed. “Above such brutality, are you?” “We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly. “Merely taking your life would not satisfy me”

One thing that a lot of people forget is that Dumbledores stance on death had nothing to do with mercy.

I would say that anything past second chances is fanon after all when Snape went to Dumbeldore to beg him to save Lily, the dumbledore that we see in that scene is nothing like the weak dumbledore we see in a lot of fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud.

****** *Woooow!* Is that hinted at in the books at all or a Pottermore original?! I'm always surprised how canon makes Dumbledore into an even bigger asshole than even I could expect (and I am usually called out for bashing Dumbledore too much on this sub).

Is Rowling/Pottermore really saying that Dumbledore abused his headmaster position to expose a fraud, sacrificing 7 years of DADA education? I can't even think about the OWLs and the NEWTs of students in that year. Oh, and relying on an incompetent fraudster of a teacher almost cost Harry and Ron their lives.

This is good stuff. The whole Lockheart incident nails the dichotomy between Dumbledore being either a moron/senile (didn't know) or evil (didn't care) pretty well.

** For the second chances, I think others in the wizarding world see Dumbledore as being too willing to give second chances based almost entirely on misunderstanding why he is giving the second chance in the first place. Neither he nor Snape share why Dumbledore trusts him, so naturally enough people may consider that Snape hasn't earned it and that Dumbledore hands out his second chances too freely. This is exactly what Harry does for years and only stops thinking this when Snape lays out the reason in his memories.

Before we have the full story, the impression is that Dumbledore gives them out too easily, when I think in actuality, Dumbledore's second chances are incredibly hard won. Snape earned his second chance. And he continued to earn it.

I don't think that Dumbledore manipulated Snape's feeling into being a spy, because that goes against everything I feel the series stands for, and also because it seems extremely strategically weak.

** Dumbledore himself seems to have the luxury of being merciful, in that he's such a great wizard that he can incapacitate people just as easily as he could kill them. And certainly we never see him go in for the kill on anyone.

However, we know that the policy of the Order of the Phoenix was to kill, and Dumbledore led the Order, so it does not appear the be a combat philosophy he considers universal. In the books, it's very much Harry who is the proponent of mercy and the Order members who are trying to persuade him to be more ruthless.

** Its often taken too far. A lot of fanfiction writers are young. They think killing is easy, that it would make all the problems go away. They wish Harry was more pro-active. When they insert their more pro-active Harry into the world one of the ways you can demonstrate how bad-arse he is, is to contrast him against Dumbledore and therefore canon Harry. There are plenty of examples in the books of people being forgiven when they perhaps shouldn't have been. There are times people avoided punishment when they deserved it. Sometimes people's lives were endangered as part of some redemption plan. Its easy to be frustrated with this and so people in fanon often go too extreme in order to show how much they disagree and how much better it would be if Harry was brutal.

It would be very different for wizards, who can see the people they are fighting close up.

We don't know what the laws were in the wizarding world at the time of the first war. Maybe they just generally didn't execute people. This would also explain why grindlewald was imprisoned. Wizarding laws in general seem to be pretty different.

Not true.

High treason here is (and always has been) against the Crown, not against the country - and petty treason (now defunct as a charge and not separate to murder) was simply aggravated murder ie of a master by a servant.

And since he was fighting wizards and attempting to overthrow the wizard ministry, which seems to be totally separate from the laws and governance of the Crown, then Voldemort never committed treason under British law...

However equally some pottermore writings discuss wizards in early royal courts, so maybe it's less clear cut than that.

However strictly in terms of high treason, acting against the ministry doesn't seem to fit the bill.

Also make fake trunk with duplicate dead bodies put under stasis spells, and also uhhh the real trunk is in the Mirror of Erised, which is confirmed to at least temporarily stump Voldy, and to get to it you need to want to go to the prisoners, but not free them (Presumably Dumbledore can unenchant it somehow. If not, make is so the person has to want to find them, but not want to allow them to go back to Voldemort.) Sounds good?

Although, maybe it would be better to petrify them, then put draught of living death into their mouths(wait that wouldnt make then choke would it?). Also put the fidelius on Nurmengard.

******* People didn't escape from Azkaban before Sirius came along either. And the idea of a prison is to keep people away from society and reform them. If they spend 20 years asleep or in stasis they'll have little chance to learn or reform. If they are in stasis for life then they might aswell be dead.

If you just want them kept away from society forever then petrify them and stick them in a grave. Same effect but I'd argue killing them would be more humane.

My idea wasn't to keep them Petrified /forever/. I first thought up this idea as an alternative to killing Death Eaters /during the war/, when there's still others at large who'd break them out of a conventional prison. Once the war was won they'd be Mandraked. But even then, if what I'm talking about were to be used in times of peace, it wouldn't be /forever/ --- just until the world is finally a peaceful utopia and dealing with those criminals won't be a problem.

Perhaps the adult of the series could have been more heavy handed but lets be honest, there is a lot the adults could have done differently. Its not dealt with in the correct way, it often feels like it was written by edgy teenagers with little concept of mortality. Some people are fine with killing, others are deeply effected by it.

1. Helping Snape avoid punishment and having him teach at the school.
2. Not eliminating danger coming from Draco.

Ad. 2. He needed to die in an inconspicuous manner, Draco was useful to this goal.

#+begin_quote
  The first question that I have never been asked---it has probably been asked in a chatroom but no one has ever asked me---is, “Why didn't Voldemort die?” Not, “Why did Harry live?” but, “Why didn't Voldemort die?” The killing curse rebounded, so he should have died. Why didn't he? At the end of Goblet of Fire he says that one or more of the steps that he took enabled him to survive. You should be wondering what he did to make sure that he did not die---I will put it that way. I don't think that it is guessable. It may be---someone could guess it---but you should be asking yourself that question, particularly now that you know about the prophesy. I'd better stop there or I will really incriminate myself. The other question that I am surprised no one has asked me since Phoenix came out---I thought that people would---is why Dumbledore did not kill or try to kill Voldemort in the scene in the ministry. I know that I am giving a lot away to people who have not read the book. Although Dumbledore gives a kind of reason to Voldemort, it is not the real reason. When I mentioned that question to my husband---I told Neil that I was going to mention it to you---he said that it was because Dumbledore knows that there are two more books to come. As you can see, we are on the same literary wavelength. [Laughter]. That is not the answer; Dumbledore knows something slightly more profound than that.

Snape is just as guilty in that incident as Sirius.

It was not a smart thing of Sirius to do, but certainly not attempted murder. If I tell you how to disarm a mine and you get blown up in a minefield, it is not my fault that you took that risk.

Same reason that protections on precious things (be they Dumbledore's; Voldemort's or Hermione's) are solvable challenges as opposed to actual protections. The Wizarding World seems to have a strange approach to protections in general. Thank Merlin the goblins are a bit (a /bit/) more reasonable about such things.

More seriously, though, there's also the possibility that the /Marauders/ came up with the whole Whomping Willow ruse themselves, and Dumbledore just agreed with it because it was already half-done by the time they told him.

Lily, his best friend, certainly seems to think he's obsessed, and he just happens to know they sneak out all the time.

They are /vastly/ different scenarios, but yeah, Snape probably wouldn't intend to come face-to-face with a werewolf. What he'd want is probably what he got; just enough of a view to know that Remus is a werewolf, without dying.

Not at all, I'm speculating and making theories based on my understanding of the characters.

I'm merely explaining the situation as I believe it most likely occurred.

#+begin_quote

Sirius claims that Snape tried to get them expelled, and Remus supported his claim.

But considering you're discrediting one (and by extension two) of the three sources of information we have, our "canon" information is remarkably small, so we have to make assumptions, such as 'someone commenting on a oft-repeated theory is more likely to be bored of it, and so seem "cold" towards it', '"the other night" probably refers to a couple of days ago', and 'Snape, a character shown to hold a grudge and use Remus' condition against him, quite possibly didn't have the best of reasons to follow him at night'.

I doubt he relished killing and while he has the power to do it, he often takes a step back from those big moments of using his power. Like he says when he was talking to Harry at King's cross, he didn't trust himself with power over death so I'm sure that plays a part too.

With Snape, Dumbledore doesn't just accept his apology. He makes him his spy, plays on his feelings for Lily to make him an asset to the order. And when she dies, he plays on those same feelings to basically commit Snape's life to Dumbledore.

But first we have to convince ourselves that they /could/ have prevented the problem, and /chose/ not to because they either don't care about our feelings or maybe even hate us. If we acknowledged that our parents or our bosses cared and did their best, then there's little emotional reward in blaming them. While I still think that a person who places himself in an authority position should be held responsible, I think many fans take it too far when they hold Dumbledore responsible for everyone else's actions too, and for almost any injustice. The fact he didn't fix a problem couldn't possibly mean he's less /able/, so it /must instead/ mean he /chose/ not to fix it. I have seen Dumbledore's "inability" to care for or understand other people's emotions explained as the character flaw that proves he is just a human just like we all are. But I don't think that version of Dumbledore is human, regardless of the thesis statement the author thinks they are supporting.

And of course, a lot of people believe Aberforth's account.

**** I don't think Dumbledore forced him to do anything. I am really not one of those Dumbledore is an evil master manipulator crowd lol. But snape came to Dumbledore to ask him to protect Lily and Dumbledore asks him what Snape can give him in return when he was full well going to protect her anyway. Snape replies, 'Anything.' That is using Snape's feeling for Lily to turn him into a spy.

I have no doubt that what you said is true too. He does want to give Snape that chance. I don't think it has to be either or the other. Dumbledore was a war leader, but also a compassionate person.

***** Then why do you say "commit Snape's life to Dumbledore"? Your phrasing seems to think differently than you do...?

****** I mean Snape sort of does. He spends the rest of his life as one of Dumbledore's most trusted and from what we see, doesn't really interact with anyone else in a meaningful way. He dedicates his life to stopping Voldemort and protecting Harry in Lily's memory, and he does that through his service to Dumbledore. I'm not meaning that in some sort of sinister way like he was a slave or something. Dumbledore gave a broken and hurting young man with no direction, a purpose in life.

******* I agree with everything you just said here! This is much more of a linguistic interest to me than a Harry Potter one at this point, so feel free to stop responding at any time. I feel that saying "he plays on those same feelings to basically commit Snape's life to Dumbledore" connotes something slightly different than "Snape spends the rest of his life as one of Dumbledore's most trusted". The first Dumbledore is the actor while Snape is being acted upon, and in the second sentence, Snape is the actor. I find it so interesting how phrasing can say so much more than each individual word. :)

******** Cheers for the reply. Yeah you're right that there is a difference there. I went a bit too far trying to highlight Dumbledore in the situation.

** I'm not going to comment on Dumbledore much because that has been covered by others, but he definitely didn't stop the Order from killing...

“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!” ~Remus Lupin, Chapter 5 of Deathly Hallows.

As far as canon goes those people obviously don't care much about staying with canon, and while that isn't intrinsically bad, it is when they insist that they /are/ following canon and also generally have a terrible plot.
