I'm sorry if this is bothersome, but for quite some time now I've been looking for a fanfiction that I remember reading a couple of years back. I don't remember the time frame for when it was published, but I do remember it being about 500,000 words long and the author was working on a sequel that was even longer than that.

It revolved around an affair Harry and Hermione were having behind Ron's back, poor guy. It happened during the school year, though I don't know which one, and in front of the all the students in the great hall Ron asked Hermione to marry him, to which she agreed to. Later in private she rebuffed his proposal, saying she wasn't prepared for marriage while trying to keep the affair a secret. I remember there being two sexual encounters between her and Harry, one resulting in Hermione becoming pregnant, though she kept the real father's identity a secret from Ron up until the baby came with a mop of raven hair on it's head. Her only confidant during this whole ordeal was Ginny, who was beginning to develop feelings for Draco, if I remember correctly. Sorry if that recounting was scatter-brained but, like I said, it's been a while.

I believe the sequel revolved around Harry and Hermione's daughter entering Hogwarts, as well as Ginny's murder, though I don't know if the author finished it or not. I understand there was a massive purge a few years ago, and many stories were deleted. I hope I can find it regardless.

I have no idea whether I'll still think the story is good or not, but it did get me into reading long form fanfiction and I'd like to at least check up on the author. Any help would be much appreciated.


** Sounds like a very interesting story. Hope somebody can post a link.
