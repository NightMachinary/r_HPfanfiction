Hey I finally got to worthy of magic on my to read list, and noticed it was deleted. Does anyone have a copy they can pm or post here?


** Do you know when it was finished? Also it's FFnet# and do you swear to god you'll read it? I have 350gb of fanfiction backed up and it will take days of making my HDD thrash yo find it.

**** A lot. I don't know if OP uses a Kindle or a Nook, but assuming all in epub format, that'd be around 350 million pages (if 1000 pages is a MB). I don't know about Mobi format, but from what I've observed, they take up even more space.

***** Lets say a ff is 1000 pages. 35.000.000/1000 is equal to 35000 fanfiction. WTF?

****** Just realized I was off a 0 in my calculations (1000 x 1000 x 350), so that would be 350,000 fanfics instead, with your assumptions.

***** Not OP but I'd guess they've got one of the two archives that have been made of FFN, in which case it's txt files. I've got one that's 315GB and it has 6,719,890 files in it.
