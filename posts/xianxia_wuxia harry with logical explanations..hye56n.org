So, a lot of the literature involving harry potter has muggles/squibs/wizards. Wizards tend to have varying levels of power which has large growths in power in younger years. This is similar to what would happen in cultivation novels. Those with innate talent would be at varying levels of power simply based on the passive amount of energy they took in.

Those with little to no talent would be a normal muggle.

Those with mild/middling talent would find their physical prowess increase drastically compared to their counterparts, leading to some of the best minds/athletes in the world, as the distribution of energy isn't consciously controlled it tends to go to the most used organs, minds in the case of intellectuals and muscles in the case of athletes.

Using the mechanic up to this point could also explain the appearance of squibs, in the event of middling talent to those who had enough to push them into the boundaries of magical they would become "squibs."

As passive cultivation is the only available method currently in use this would also explain the appearance of magicals in magical parents. The fathers biology and proximity to the child would give off ambient Qi, higher than the levels normally found throughout the world, resulting in more magical children from magicals. This would also explain talent differences between muggleborn and pureblood children. In order for muggleborns to reach the threshhold needed for accidental magic they would need to be much more talented than their counterparts.

​

Now that all that has been explained I'd also like to point out that implementation of this could be as simple as learning to actively absorb qi to quicken growth. As the story progresses this could turn into the slowing of aging when breakthroughs are reached.

​

Qi condensation - is typically where physical and mental prowess are slowly increased, resulting in people having stength and weaknesses slightly above and below the norm. This would be the passive absorption ceiling for those with little to no talent.

Foundation establishment - This would be the stopping point for those who have surpassed normalcy, at this point of passive absorption the person would show up weakly magical, as in a squib. Drastic increases physically and mentally.

Core Formation - This would be where there is enough power available that without direction could be blasted out to have an effect on the surrounding world, hence accidental magic.

Nascent Soul - This is actually the thing that brought this about, copy and paste from a website about wuxia

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/nascent-soul/][*Nascent Soul*]] (元婴 yuányīng) -- sometimes left untranslated as “Yuanying”. Literally translates as “Origin Infant”. The stage after Core Formation (in some novels). The Nascent Soul resembles an infant or miniature person and resides in the Dantian, typically sitting in a meditative position. In some novels, the Nascent Soul can travel outside the body and is like a second life for cultivators -- if their main body dies, their consciousness can continue to exist in the Nascent Soul.

This seems incredibly close to what voldemort has done, the use of rituals and "evil magic" have allowed him to reach half-step to nascent soul, while not being a complete breakthrough hence why he needs horcruxes, horcruxes would be changed to simple anchors for the original soul, not an actual soul. This would also explain why he showed up as a fetus. Essentially he was unable to truly step into the realm or did so with a shaky foundation.

Breakthrough to nascent soul would allow you to survive death in a similar way to voldemort without using a horcrux. Voldemort would be considered half-step nascent soul, meaning he has a foot in the door without stepping through the threshold.

​

Theres a lot that can be done with this as the premise. I've been a fan of dozens of different genres and with how many fanfics have equated power to lifespan it made me think of xianxia stories, when looking into the fanfics and with how people generally see squibs as having been saturated with magic but not able to use it I just wanted to put forward this idea into your heads, to put it into simpler terms.

​

Qi condensation is when you use Qi to improve your body to the limits of your current mind and/or body.

Foundation Establishment would steeping your body in condensed Qi until you reach a certain density

Core formation is when magic reeaches a tipping point andd begins to gather at your core, at the moment of core creation it would gather all of the magic currently residing in your body to create the core. This would also explain why magic may be problematic whenever a witch is pregnant, the core may be forming due to having sufficient resources to be created.

​

I would really like to see a story incorporating this but hopefully this idea manages to get out there and someone picks it up. If someone already has something like this I would also appreciate a link to said story.

Any thoughts that anyone would like to add would also be appreciated.

Also, there are number crunchers who suggest that wizards account for roughly 0.00089% (48k in 1991 when world population was around 5.3B) of the population which would roughly be 9 people in 10,000 having the talent required to become a wizard, which a large portion of those only becoming wizards because of being born in a Qi drenched environment. Likely the actual percentage of acceptable talent is far less.


** Thanks for posting this. I feel like there's a lot that can be done with what you've laid out here.
