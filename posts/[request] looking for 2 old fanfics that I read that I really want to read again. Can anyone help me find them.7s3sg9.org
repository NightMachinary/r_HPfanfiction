I'm looking for 2 fics.

The first is a harry/hermione AU where Neville is the arrogant BWL. I remember that Harry is a loner and is respected by the younger years for stopping bullies, that Neville and Harry were friends when they were very little and are now at odds, that Hermione was accidentally thrown down stairs by Neville and lost a lot of her memory. She had the choice whether to take a potion (that would give her memory of spending time with Harry back) or not.

the second is a post-world AU where Harry's locked himself away in Grimmauld Place. Lady Luck herself confronts him and sends him to an alternate reality where he's named "Harold Evans" and Lilly and James (maybe it was just Lilly) were alive. Harry from that universe was a spoiled brat (they were still at Hogwarts). I also remember that Harry had sat on the floor in an effort to get close to a member of the Black family, Sirius' nephew or some such.

Any links or hints as to where to look would be great.


** The second is definitely C'est La Vie. It's on ao3. Google it, and it shall be yours.
