So, I just finished reading this work of art and wanted to share it.

Deathly Scream by Flora Winters is beautiful. Harry meets his true love, Cedric. The way this story has been written gives a view of before and after tragedy has struck. Each chapter shows past and present. It's an emotional rollercoaster that is still being updated but has over 148k words.

There are a lot of dark themes around the half way point and beyond, so, If you aren't a fan of a little gore, swearing, and lots of tears, then perhaps this isn't the fic for you.

Summary: Harry snaps and his screams can be quite deadly.

This fic contains slash, language, and violence. Rated M. Romance and Adventure
