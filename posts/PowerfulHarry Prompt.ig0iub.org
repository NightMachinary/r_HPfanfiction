Over the top, all powerful, strong Harry Potter, from day one. I want that kind of fic, where he flies in on a Pegasus in year two, when the car seemed like a scary option and he hadn't felt like reworking wards to the platform. I want him to decimate in fourth year. Like annihilate his competition, in a friendly and overdone manner. Fly in on a dragon and let the two speak, calmly and gently while he gets his prize. He casts some spell that even Dumbledore doesn't recognize, shouts down to the bottom of the lake, and comes back with all of those kidnapped. Because all seemed to mean something to him, except Ms. Delacour, but he didn't think it right to leave her alone. He shouts out of the water, and lands gracefully next to the judges on dry lands, dries himself and his prizes, smiles serenely, and heads back to the castle. Just looking at Moody in the last one and going, "Oh! That's why you wanted me in this. I was waiting you out, see what your plan was, Crouch, but really? All year to get me to grab the trophy that's no doubt a portkey? Really? Why didn't you just enchant a quill, and toss it to me? I would have tried to catch it, you know? Seeker reflexes. Your plans just dumb." He looks around for aurors. "Anyone gonna arrest him?" I mean on and on, through every year, just over the top. Please, I need this.


** I don't know how to make it particularly interesting but I've had this thought. I hesitate to call it an idea. Harry Potter is literally God. Not /a/ god, but the big G-O-D himself. He's sort of just Magooing about, thawting evil plans and being sparky. Super chill story, you know.

*** OMG, the Chuck idea! I love it. Supernatural threw EVERYONE for a loop with that one. Ooh, but /a/ god isn't a bad idea either. The God of Mischief, just there to mess up everyone's lives. Which story to write first?! OMG I love you.
