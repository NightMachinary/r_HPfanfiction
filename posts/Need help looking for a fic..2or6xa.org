I've been searching for the better part of an hour looking for it and I can't seem to find it and I'm hoping somebody here knows it.

From what I can remember of the fic is that harry goes to an alternate universe where I think Neville is the boy who lived. I also remember Harry giving everything up for the power to defeat Voldy and in return he ends up getting the elements and they each have their own spirit.

I hope that this is enough information on the fic, thanks in advance for any help that's given.

Edit*

Just remembered that there is a spider that Harry transfigured from I think a button and it could weave wards.


** oooh... I vaguely remember something like that...

Harry realizes that Dumbledore is planning to force Harry to leave Hogwarts to prevent Harry from messing with his plans for Neville so Harry forces himself into the TWT replacing Cedric?

I think that the 'air' spirit suffocates Fleur when she comes onto him, mistaking her aura for an attack. The elements were rather possessive IIRC.

/Grumbles Dorfishly/

The upshot is I've found a few fics that /aren't/ what you want but that I haven't read yet. /yay.../

** I'm not sure about the whole BWL aspect, but I remember one where Harry works on knowing the names of the elements. Each element has a three different levels, each giving you stronger power in that element. Dumbledore knew the names of the fire elements, and that was connected with Fawkes. Maybe this will help you find the story. Please post a link if you find it.

*** The fic you are talking about it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966314/1/DOOM-Day]] , which was found by ThisIsForYouSir. Great fic from what I'm reading now but it's not the one I'm thinking about. I'm starting to think that I just dreamt up the entire fic since I sill can't find it.

**** My bad. I saw the link to it, but I just remembered DOOM-Day as a groundhog-day story, not the special names. Thank-you for the correction.
