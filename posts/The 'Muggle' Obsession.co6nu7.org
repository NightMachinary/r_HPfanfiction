I've noticed a lot of fics seem to put 'Muggle' in front of every word/term that isn't magical, even when it's obvious. Like if some character brings up television, the authours go out of their way to say 'Muggle' television or 'Muggle' Prime Minister or 'Muggle' pencil/pen. If there's no wizarding equivalent why add it? If it was something like radio, pictures/portraits, candy, or even a car then okay, it makes sense to differentiate it. Otherwise it's redundant and annoying to read, in my opinion.

Thoughts?


** JKR uses it in PoA:

  Fudge has been criticised by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.

** For prime minister you need it. For stuff like television, you really don't. Technically does not work in the magical world, so saying it's muggle is kknd of redundant.

*** Doesn't Harry describe a gaming console to Sirius as like a Muggle computer you play games on at one point?

** If you're talking to a pureblood like Malfoy who probably never left the magical world in his life, it makes sense to specify that you're talking about muggle things. When talking to people who frequently visit both worlds, they already know that television is a muggle thing.

*** Good point, but a pureblood would already know TV is a muggle thing because they don't have it in the (British) magical world.

**** Not necessarily.

"on the tv" --> "on the what?"

"on the muggle tv" --> "ah so it's a muggle thing"

** In my head, the way the term, 'Muggle' is used in majority of fics and in Canon, I assumed it's a racial epithet, not so blatantly a slur as mudblood, but still a word that's meant to demean an ethnicity (In this case people with no magic considered as inferior blood). I think JKR was trying to convey this, that's probably why she came up with a word "Muggle" which in itself sounds silly, to denote the people it's referencing to as silly, or ignorant. I think affixing Muggle to non-magical people or things, has very much to do with this reasoning.

I like "/nomaj/" - simple, blunt and straight to the point.

Yup, my sentiments exactly.
