** There's a reason JK and fanfic authors present Harry as being much more well adjusted than he should be: reading about the consequences of child abuse is pretty horrific.

For the majority of readers there is little pleasure to be had in such a thing. As well, I feel very, very few authors have the ability to put the situation in the fanfic properly. Maybe a trained professional would, or a child abuse survivor, but few others.

It's an ugly subject. Noone wants to acknowledge it. I even remember myself while reading the HP books 16 years ago and seeing the shit the Dursleys were pulling, I was thinking "There's no way his family treats him so bad." No one wants to believe this shit is happening. Even in fiction.

*** Although... different children react to abuse differently. Harry doesn't show many of the usual, obvious signs of abuse, but he does show some of the more subtle ones - lack of faith in authority, completely no desire to follow the rules (not because he thinks he is above them, but because he's so used to having unreasonable rules enforced upon him that he disregards all rules out of habit), and so on.

  Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.

*** Ehh, that story goes against the 2nd point, Harry does absolutely not act in character or reasonable for a timid abuse victim. He is more the stereotypical frat boy.

It relies heavily on cheap, lazy, repetetetive and immature humor. Doesn't seem like OP's taste, and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone in general.

** Child abuse isn't fun to read about, and I usually only see it touched on in detail when that's the point of the story.

But I've been convinced on Ron. He's just an average kid dragged into danger. Children are selfish, mean, lazy little snot rags pretty much of the time. Ron is an exemplar of that.

Here's the thing: I'd like to see a story where the other students act pretty much like in canon, but the reason is explicitly given that it's because /Harry and Hermione (and by association Ron) often act like they're in a street gang, not like normal kids/.

One more. Know who really should have the affectionate nickname "pup"? Hermione. In an ^{as-of-yet} ^{unreleased} chapter of a story of mine, I've got her dad calling her that.

Think about it.

** One you might enjoy is actually one that was recommended me on here that I have yet to finish but is off to a great start! Sirius is definitely more in character and Harry does show signs of trauma from his abuse at the Dursley's hands. linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Sirius is definitely more gruff/godfatherly as opposed to parental in this fic (up until the point I am at right now) so no signs of any "pups" or "cubs".

Also, not quite sure if this is up your alley but linkffn(Starting From Scratch by JadeSullivan) is pretty good. It details the relationship between Sirius and Harry if Sirius had gained custody of Harry after third year. As far as I can recall, Sirius does not address Harry as "cub" or "pup" but don't quote me on that. Harry definitely does not call him "dad". As for Harry reflecting any of his past...not so much. I am just a sucker guardian fics though.

Beware, I don't know how you feel about corporal punishment but it is present in two chapters (Chapters 1 & 13) of the fic but if you skim over those parts, you're not missing anything crucial to the plot and can still enjoy and experience the story in a positive way.
