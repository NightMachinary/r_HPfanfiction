  This story was quite a treat! However, I have one small quibble: After reading this story, I do not feel that I am ready to convert to Christianity. You promised in one of your author's notes that all non-believers would surely be converted by the end! However, I just don't feel God within me, no matter how hard I try. I am disappointed that I spent my time reading this when I expected to be converted by the end. You have let me down, Grace Ann.

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann

** linkffn(not go gently by cloneserpents) - the author set out to torment Harry into becoming demonic.

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=270][Enter the Silver Flame]] by SamStone - formerly called Harry & Kiki: Tales of the Boy Necromancer, it isn't a humour fic nor is it related at all to Kiki's Delivery Service (probably one reason for the rename). Harry discovers a book on necromancy, uses it to supercharge his body and then builds a prepubescent harem. Writing is literate but exceedingly verbose, and sometimes takes purple prose towards the ultraviolet spectrum.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

She used to work there and kept them out of the radar of the police, which she continues to do after she leaves. If I recall correctly she genuinely believes she's doing a good thing, because... it's better than going hungry on the streets? I don't remember her reasoning.

Also, *it's not a big part of the story*. Not trying to defend her, but your description might put new readers off and it is a relatively entertaining story (series of stories? not sure what the right word is), though I personally disliked the last couple of chapters.

Finally, if anyone is looking to read it for the Jen/Luna, don't bother, though I'd still recommend the story.
