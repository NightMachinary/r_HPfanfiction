Hi everyone! I lost all my links and unable to share some of my faves because of it. Because the story is located in a One-Shot Hold-all on FF.Net and unable to remember the Author (wasnt slick enough to fav him/her) I'v been unable to find it after an exhaustive 4 day search.

This short story starts with a partially obliviated Lockheart starting his stint at Hogwarts unbelieving of his past but willing to fill his obligations as the new DADA professor. Ends with him questioning the choices of those around him, makes things better off for everyone, and ends up in a heroic death tangling with the bassilisk with just his wand and a hand held mirror. The end Imagery, especially the remains of the battle are quite Picturesque.

I know finding this story is difficult because Google has no refs and Iv found no hide nor hair within the FF.net search engine. Therefore hope someone remembers who wrote it or where it can be located?

Thanks everyone!


** If you reviewed it, it should be in your review history on FF.net.

I can't think of any story that fits your description fully, but was it maybe one of these two?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3312486/1/Battles-with-Basilisks][Battles with Basilisks]] by SnorkackCatcher, features a Lockhart who is actually as good as he writes he is.

Or possibly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]] (formerly 'Gilding the Son of Lily') by Publicola, an author self-insert as Lockhart but that's not a one-shot.

*** Both of those are great stories, and recently read through Magical Me. Unfortunately I made no review, which means I get to ask around and perhaps find people with similar interests in stories.

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/145/Odd-Ideas][this]] is it. Author Rorschach's Blot, he has a ton of great oneshots here, bunch of great longer stuff too.

*** This, my friend IS exactly what I had lost! THANKS!

I hadn't even favorited the Author and yet I'v read everything he's posted! Major Crime and slip on my part.

** While you've already found the story you're looking for, I'd mention that, Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4289379/1/Detention-in-Defense][Detention in Defense]] is a one-shot that also features a competent Lockhart.
