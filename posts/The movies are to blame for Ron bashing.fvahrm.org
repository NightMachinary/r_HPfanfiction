wow I really didn't realize how much the movies poison us to Ron's character until I saw this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzxwcBZFuI]]


** Movies definitely played a huge part. But I think what really screwed Ron was Goblet of Fire. Still to this day I cannot believe Ron wouldn't trust Harry.

Harry too, has been screwed by movies. Not nearly to the extent of Ron, but still. The fact that movies never revealed that Harry beats Hermione in Defense Against Dark Arts fair and square, makes many people question why he was the teacher in Order of the Phoenix and not Hermione.

** If they ever remake the films (I personally think it should be done as a TV show) the biggest change should be just giving Ron back all his lines that they gave to Hermione.

*** Ron-bashing in fics was a thing before most of the movies came out, however. I remember people bashing Ron back when only Chamber of Secrets was out.

**** The movies made it MUCH more prominent. And CoS the movie, or CoS the book? The book came out in July '98 and FFN in October '98. I'm pretty sure the earliest HP fanfic was posted in September '99, POA book came out in July '99. PoA movie came out in '04.

***** The CoS movie. By the time the CoS film came out, Ron abandoning Harry in the GoF book had already occurred. I got into Harry Potter when the Philosopher's Stone film came out, and read the first four books very shortly after, and turned to fanfiction while waiting for OoTP. Ron-bashing was a thing.

*** Fucking THIS. I didn't bother watching past GoF and I almost didn't bother with that one. Giving Hermione the scene where Ron originally stands between Harry and an alleged mass murderer enraged me beyond the capacity for rational thought. Despite his dumb kid moments from time to time, Ron was a good dude and deserves way better than Rupert Grint was given.

*** I'll say in his defense though, that in book 4 he was just a teenager with an inferiority complex and however convoluted the method he did try to make sure Harry survived the ordeal and in book 7, I think the books didn't frame well enough how the whole situation was affecting him more than the other 2, then come to the movie and adds even more poor framing and stressed-worried Ron gets turned into jealous-asshole Ron

** I disagree most of the Books give plenty of grounds for Bashing Ron. His jealousy, his bullying, his laziness and his lack of belief in harry. Hell the fact that he was more concerned that Harry's Firebolt was being checked versus Harry's safety (especially when you have in the first book Quirrell trying to jinx his broom) and you just had Harry falling from his broom due to dementors would have me breaking off any friendship.

His actions in GoF would've been the last straw and the first task confirm that he wasn't a friend.

**** Well I wouldn't say that either. I would say she is a better friend than Ron but she still has her own issues. Going behind Harry's back on the firebolt being one of them.

And i would agree on the Harmony as the first 4 books easily setup for a Harry/Hermione romance. I could never see Harry with Ginny and absolutely can never see Hermione with Ron.
