I was always somewhat surprised JK didn't do more with their name. I was expecting more puns and references to Draco the ferret and the Weasels, given how closely related ferrets and weasels are. And I wouldn't think it'd be too far-fetched for immunity to the basilisk to be genetic, much the same as parseltongue is. And why were they called Weasleys? We know the origins of some surnames, like JK having friends with a surname, so she liked it, etc, but I don't recall a reason for their name. I'm guessing she came across it somewhere and liked it?

So yeah, any fics that go into this sort of thing? The closest I've found is the twins being weasel animagus.


** Maybe basilisk gaze is soul magic, and Weasleys are all just soulless?

** Mm, I'm fascinated by this possibility. I've seen fics here and there that have parseltongue granting immunity to the basilisk's gaze, but I haven't thought about a separate genetic immunity to it.

The thing is, it's the /smell/ of weasels that's supposed to be deadly to basilisks. I suppose you could make like Roald Dahl and have a notion like in The Witches where the cleaner a Weasley is, the worse they smell to basilisk and other nasty things.

**** Now there's a thought. What if Tom Riddle chose to possess Ginny because having a Weasley's bloodline (proof against snakes) and being a 7th child (magical number, the same as Tom's horcruxes), her innate magical potential posed one of the greatest threats to his plans?

**** Well, that's partly what I thought, with a Basilisk, and a Weasley controlling it, and nothing ever came of it. I can just imagine Tom getting sick of Percy's nosiness and solicitude, and trying to petrify him, and failing. Or him getting worried about the twins, and failing to deal with them. Or trying to petrify Ron, because he's Harry's best friend.

Charlie being a Basilisk tamer rather than a Dragon tamer.

*** I just looked it up, you're right. It's the cockatrice that weasels are immune to, and die when they hear the cock crow. Trouble is, legendary monsters sorta blur together, especially when the one creature comes from several different cultures. As I understand it, JK's basilisk is actually closer to the traditional cockatrice, just without the wings.

Given that the weasel usually dies when killing the basilisk with their smell, I prefer the cockatrice version, where they are not only the only immune ones, but also the only animal that dares attack it.

It would fit in nicely with the whole 'Weasleys always go to Gryffindor' thing, to have Weasleys always be anti-snake. Could be they're descended from a less famous archnemesis of Herpo the foul, or maybe Paracelsus, in addition to 'discovering' Parseltongue (I don't know how, since both Herpo and Salazar were much older than him) so maybe he did lots of alchemical stuff and who knows what magic he made.
