** Evans is one of the most common last names in the UK. Which could lead to the hilarious situation where another Evans comes to Hogwarts and everyone assumes that they are related to Lily and Harry while there is absolutely no shared ancestry.

*** The more common spelling 'Patel' is a remarkably common surname among families with Indian roots in Britain. It's from an old job title that roughly corresponds to the old feudal manor bailiffs (from whom we get the modern english surname 'Bailey'.) and, yes, in Hindu areas that job would go to someone of those castes. It also turns up as a surname in muslim and sikh areas, though, and caste isn't a thing there.

**** Spellings are generally irrelevant, seeing as they vary from region to region. In some cases (mine included), the same caste will go by wildly differing nanes. Caste titles mean little in post-independence India (culturally, they mean a lot), unless you're an OBC/SC/ST. I imagine they mean absolutely nothing in England.

Also, a name turning up in a predominantly muslim or sikh area does not necessarily mean that the person is muslim or sikh.

***** Yep, caste means nothing in Britain. We do have a lot of Patels and Patils, though, and I've made the acquaintance of both muslim and hindu ones.

And the Patil family's most recent roots might not be anywhere in India/Pakistan/Bangladesh at all; there was a big migration out of East Africa in the 60s and 70s, a major part of which was Idi Amin kicking all the asians out of Uganda for reasons that doubtless seemed good to him, being madder than a hatful of arseholes as he was.

*** Not terribly surprising to those of us who grew up in Lancashire and Yorkshire where Longbottom and Sidebottom are, while not common, still entirely unremarkable names.

(They're toponyms, meaning 'of the long valley' and 'of the side (of the) valley'. 'Bottom' is still a dialect word for 'valley' where I live, and Samlesbury Bottom, Hoghton Bottom and Brock Bottom are all three lovely places for a picnic and a walk of the dog on a summer's afternoon.)
