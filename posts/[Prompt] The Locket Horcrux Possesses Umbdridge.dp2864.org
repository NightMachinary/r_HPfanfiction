  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

** There is at least one. Locket!Crux latched onto Umbridge, was utterly repulsed by her, and noped right out.

Unfortunately, a bad case of Ficnesia prevents me from coming up with the title.

*** That username looks kinda familiar, can it be that you write fanfiction? I think I read a story years ago by an author with a similar username.

**** Yeah, I write. My most popular stories are either Invincible Technomage or Triwizard Tales, depending on who you ask.
