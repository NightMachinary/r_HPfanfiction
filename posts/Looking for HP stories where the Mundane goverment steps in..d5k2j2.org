Looking for HP stories where the regular British government gets fed up with the wizard's there stupidity, ineptitude, and corruption, that they revoked the Wizards right to self govern and clean house round up the death much.

​

and Also any purger style story where the muggle government goes guns blazing?

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** Excuse my ignorance but what's up with the mundane thing? I've seen it used in a few fics instead of say Muggles.

I'm not trying to be controversial, I'm just curious.

*** Because to mug means to rob someone. So a Muggle is implied to mug people. I wasn't really convinced by that explanation, but that's what I got from a few ANs.

**** This is the explanation I've seen for it " *mug* is london slang probably cockney. as it is used mostly by londoners and people from essex. it *means* a stupid, gullible *person*. *someone* easily taken advantage of. "

*** I personally don't like it becuase it sounds like an insult. JKR literally says it means "lovable fool" or a "clueless fool", so make of that as you will.

Since it means "non-magical", I use non-magical instead of mundane to keep the Muggle-lovers happy.
