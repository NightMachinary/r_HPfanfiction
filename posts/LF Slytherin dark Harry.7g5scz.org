*** Yeah just about all of these would make me avoid the story without even opening it, together they would be a horrendous mess of all the worst cliches that infest the fandom.

**** Why ? Hermione is a know it al that finally know nothing of the world she wish to be a member (customs) and endangers with hers parent the statute of secrecy just like the dursleys. Purebloods are right when they say it is the new witchs and wizards raised by muggles that corrupt the traditions and old ways. Dumbledore basically to mold Harry into his mindless follower sentenced him to the same childhood as Tom Marvolo Riddle, same mistakes same results .

***** I disagree basically absolutely, you are removing all the complexity from the universe that Rowling created, one that is mainly targeted at children and teenagers, but the richness of that world is why there is so many fan fiction stories. Hermione struggles fitting in with her intellect but partway into the first story she settles down a fair bit making friends with Harry and Ron, though she does not lose any of her personal thirst to learn. She is still young and idealistic, and the only 2 house elves we really meet are both treated horrendously, its hardly surprising that she would attempt an admittedly ill planned crusade to free them.

The pure blood culture, at least in canon, seems to have a rather large problem with nepotism, corruption, sweeping acts of racism and threats or acts of violence to further their own agenda. The fact that the muggle born wish to change this is hardly surprising, especially given that many pure bloods consider them second class citizens at best.

While Dumbledores decisions have a few decent gaps in canon to completely explain his actions, the pure evil Dumbledore that most of the terrible bash-fest stories have is complete rubbish. He obviously didn't want him to suffer, considering his displeasure with the Dursley family in the start of HBP, and but they are technically his closest relatives. Opening up his adoption to the wizarding world at the end of the war was certainly dangerous, with many of the death eaters escaping sentencing, as well as many of the others potentially spoiling him because of his status, and we can see where that left people like Dudley and Draco. He did the best he could to keep Harry with family he hoped would care for him as well as keep him safe, so compromises had to be made.

****** You are of corse free of your opinion but I will atempt to refute your arguments :

- Someone with an intellect as hers should have understand immediately the consequence of a bosy tone and a compulsion to answers all the questions as if she is the only one to known the answers. She is the only one to have been allowed the use of the Time turner for all electives. Her intellect might have been of Ravenclaw but she is lacking the ability to seen past the apparences as the slavery of house-elves. And that is why the Hat decided finally forthe house of folishnes bravery and lazines.

- Same as the hypocritic act "FOR THE GREATER GOOD" of Albus Dumbledore and Gellert that can be found on Nurmergard. Year 1 is a set up of Dumbledore to test the allegience of Harry Potter, the Mirror of Erised, Hagrid and the stone, the manipulation is obvious. And for the corruption I found normal that Nobility confer political power. Second class citizen are not fact for racisim.

- I don't say that Dumbledore is evil and wish Harry to suffer, only he didn't have a choice if he wanted Harry to be a sacrificial lamb whithout any self respect. As much as he didn't him to suffer he is convinced that this the only path possible. the ends justify the means as Machiaveli said. He dind't even consider that maybe Harry would chose another path and another end.

For Harry Potter custody, whitout the will of Lord and Lady Potter, we can assume :

- Sirius Orion Black, godfather/ Dumbledore should know as caster of the fidelius of the indentity of the secret keeper. The arrest to Azkaban whitout trial is a big hint of manipulation even in martial law.
- Lady Dowagger Longbottom as proxy for Alice Longbottom. Simple
- If we eleminate Narcissa and Bellatrix for obvious reason, Andromeda Tonks is possible.
- And why not any other Light or neutral of the most noble and ancient houses.

******* You seem to be trying to show all the main characters in the absolute worst possible context, overdoing even the more questionable actions to a ridiculous degree. I'm not sure if you are really young or if English isn't your first language. It is at the end of the day just a story for young people, if all the adults were doing their jobs completely competently the series would just be a boarding school story where they happen to have magic, hardly the most thrilling narrative.

******** When you read Harry Potter books, you have seen a story of an abused child discovering a new world while I have seen what is hidden between the words : a philosophical debate on what is acceptable for the greater good like Machiaveli. In reality that reading paradigm is hinted in the last book when we discover the real Albus Dumbledore.
