  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** That's one of many reasons I hate this damn fic. The problem is that in terms of grammar and action, it's not bad. Everything else is shit though imo. If you are ok w/ bashing, knock yourself out.

***** While I value your opinion the way you worded it made me slightly agitated. Its not as bashing as many fics that are recommended here. Independent harry is nearly always bashing people. in fact I cant think of one that doesnt bash.

  The Wizarding World believes Harry Potter murdered by the notorious Sirius Black. In reality he has been raised by his godfather who has sent him to Durmstrang Institute away from Dumbledore's influence. However, his friendship with Draco Malfoy leads to Harry questioning his godfather's morals, delving into the Dark Arts, and what needs to be done For the Greater Good.
