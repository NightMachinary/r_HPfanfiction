Is there a fanfic about Ron's favorite Quidditch team (and perpetual losers) the Chudly Cannons? There was a random throwaway comment on Pottermore from Rowling that suggested the team really is legitimately cursed and it piqued my curiosity.

Bonus points if Ron joins after Hogwarts and its an underdog sports story of a ragtag group of misfits.
