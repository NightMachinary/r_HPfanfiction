Just got off of reading a work that I won't post here as I am unsure if the mods would allow as it was /very/ NSFW, but the underlying story of a seemingly background/OC character getting together with a Fem!Harry during the Triwizard tournament was actually pretty good. Anyone have any recommendations for a few similar OC x FemHarry stories?

** I know /exactly/ which one you're talking about, and unfortunately for you, it seems like there's no other fanfic quite like that. The Harry Potter fandom is rather poor in self-inserts - at least in male self-inserts - and they're almost never paired with a fem!Harry.

Anyhow, if there is another, I don't know it.
