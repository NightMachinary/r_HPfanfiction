Looking for a Harry Potter story where if Harry is a drastically different person, then when he does go/go back to Hogwarts the sitiuation is different. If he knows Occulmancy than the dementors shouldn't effect him as much, same if he had a somewhat happy couple of years etc...

Only requirements is Harry can perform wandless magic, is decently powerful, the story gets to fifth year at least, and different Harry means different Harry.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), obviously. Even though some canon stations still happened, they happened in a way that's logical and utterly hilarious. The Graveyard Resurrection Scheme was a total blast!

Other fics that have Harry growing up differently and the canon plots completely shot:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Lily met Mrs Granger on Halloween 1981 and everything changed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Harry grew up in a loving Muggle family, and things quickly escalated in Year 1. I have begun to appreciate this story a lot more recently, despite some blemishes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]], linkffn(5782108): Not necessarily good, but this fic is a prime example of a different Harry doing things very differently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): Only Year 2 more or less repeated canon stations, but otherwise, things turned out to be quite different.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Apart from Harry being raised by Sirius, the entire setting is extreme AU. He, Neville, and Weasleys all went to Beauxbaton, for a very good reason. Dumbledore kicked ass in this story and did the heavy lifting, although Hermione and Ron's contributions were enormous too.

"The Pureblood Pretense Series", linkffn(7613196;8239413;10041727;11911497): Fem!Harry in an extreme AU, but only reaches Year 4 so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Lockhart found and raised Harry. He was sorted into Slytherin, and things heated up already in Year 1. [[/spoiler][Voldemort got neutralized quickly, and Draco somehow got the Diary]].

--------------

Finally, my favorite 'James and Lily raising Harry' fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), where he had never gone to Hogwarts and Ginny Weasley had been his main rival for many years.

We know that there must be some way of resisting the effects of the Dementors because Dumbledore says he could break out of Azkaban easily (and is not an animagus as far as we know). Occlumency is a pretty good candidate for this.

******** Occlumency is generally intended to guard against Legilimency--the penetration of the mind by an outside source. The dementors are not performing Legilimency as such. They are not reading anyone's mind, trying to identify their emotions, or attempting to force a particular thought on them. Yes, they force people to relive their negative emotions, but this is a side effect of their overall desire to feed on positive emotion. The dementors want food, not a way inside someone else's mind, which is the goal of a Legilimens. A Patronus Charm succeeds by providing the dementors with something else to feed on.

If they dementors do not recognize human emotion in something, they know that it cannot offer them a food source, and so they will generally leave it alone. Sirius took advantage of this tendency by using his Animagus form in Azkaban. The only way Occlumency might succeed in warding off a dementor is if an Occlumens manages to block all his human emotions to the point that the dementor cannot sense any of them. But I am inclined to think that such a total block would be difficult, if not impossible. Patronus Charms are complicated enough, considering that Hogwarts does not teach them until students are at the N.E.W.T. level. And few students bother to become Anamagi, as the national register reflects: only the most advanced Hogwarts pupils seem to be offered this opportunity to learn how (i.e., Professor McGonagall). Occlumency is not taught at Hogwarts at all. For most wizards, Patronus Charms are the only familiar option.

Again, Occlumency was invented as a counter to Legilimency, not as a protection against dementors. Bellatrix Lestrange was skilled enough at Occlumency to instruct Draco, but the books imply that she was affected by the Dementors in Azkaban, just like all the other prisoners. Although Occlumency might be able to ward off dementors in theory, as a practical matter, using it in this non-traditional way would require an impossibly high level of skill.

********* You're over thinking this. Occlumency is mental defense. Dementors seem to attack your mind.

If Dumbledore put up a protego shield and had his fellow teachers pound away at it, he would fail eventually.

Bellatrix was being assaulted by Dementors for over a decade.

The Dementor's Kiss is entirely different from their standard mental attack.

  Occlumency is mental defense. Dementors seem to attack your mind. Therefore, being skilled in occlumency allows some level of defense against Dementors. This isn't a hard leap to make.

All cats have four legs. My dog has four legs. Therefore, my dog is a cat. Association fallacy if two things share a property they are the same.

***** Sorry the whole image trick was how Harry learned it even if only a little, but occulmency can suppress thoughts, emotion, and memories. If anything I think this actually makes it more effective against Dementors.

Here's a link on occulmency: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Occlumency]]

****** I mean, I know what Occlumency is, but that still doesn't answer my questions. My impression, even after reading the link, is that Occlumency guards against someone deliberately searching your mind for thoughts and memories. But do Dementors deliberately search victims' minds for bad memories, or is it a side effect of attempting to Kiss them?

******* If it's a side effect it still doesn't matter, because Occulmency is something you can use whenever you want. I mean the site stated that Voldemort used it against Harry, and Harry wasn't using Legilimency. It is a study to close your mind. So if your mind is being invaded in anyway by magic then Occulmency should at least help.

**** He'd have to be pretty good at Occlumency for that to work though. The basic form of clearing ones mind is not good enough.

*** It may be fanon or just my headcanon, but I think training in Occlumency makes the wizard more aware of his mental state by separating from his emotions. By doing so, the Occlumens can detect and resist the effect of Dementors and Boggarts... for a time. An Occlumens visiting Azkaban would be able to function without fear, but one stuck there would eventually lose focus and fall victim to the effect.

Dumbledore seemed unconcerned with being put in Azkaban, as he said he would be able to break out in short order. We know Bellatrix is an Occlumens since she taught Draco, but she also succumbed to madness while imprisoned (or maybe that's just her winning personality).

For my own stories, I add that an Occlumens tends to become sociopathic and because of their magic-aided self-awareness they have trouble becoming an animagus.
