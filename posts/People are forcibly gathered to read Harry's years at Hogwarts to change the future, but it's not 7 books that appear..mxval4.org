** Sorry if I'm not following everything you said after your title. I'm going to ignore anything you typed other than this:

"People are forcibly gathered to read Harry's years at Hogwarts to change the future"

The young pureblood Lord looked at his friends and shook his head in dismay. He had seen a beautiful girl that would make a wonderful wife and mother of his children. But she had rejected him, in favor of her greasy haired friend.

"I have a mother who is a member of the Black family. She is a strong woman who does what she wants, provided it benefits our family. She has told me many tales of how she cursed suitors that stepped over their bounds. I do want Lily to pay attention to me, but if she doesn't care about me, than that is her choice."

James shrugged in amusement. He was only a first year in Hogwarts. How could something like marriage be decided so early? They had seven years to determine that kind of thing.

XX

"Please, take me and not Harry!"

Voldemort was annoyed a the damned muggle-born woman's whining that she wanted him to ignore the child of prophecy. How dare she!? He was Lord Voldemort! He decided who lived and died! Not some muggleborn bitch!

"Avada Kedavra!"

The muggleborn bitch was dead. Now he just needed to do the same to her little spawn.

"Avada Kedavra!"

PAIN!

Rip, torn, the body he had was shredded as he felt the pain that he intended to inflict on others!

Riddle fled in the shape of a spectre.

James woke up. Looking around, he was confused about where he was. Everything looked quite blury, even thought it was bleached white. Obviously he was in a healers location of some kind.

A number of other spirits were bound up as well. They were hovering over his shoulder as he revealed the next book in the series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

The group of spirits were livid that they couldn't immediately fly down and bombard the various assholes who were making their descendent's life hell.

If only they could attack the Dursley's and remind them that the wizarding world doesn't forget. Nor does it forgive, despite the namby pamby bullshit that Albus Dumbledore peddled.

No one wants Dumbledore to interfere with their lives or families, so they have created a shield of fake "Caring" in order to fool the damned bastard.

​

XX

He could see that there was a bed on either side of him. Those beds were empty; he felt quite tired. Succumbing to potions, he slept once more.

XX

"Ah, Mister Potter. It's good that you are awake. What can you tell me about what happened?"

"Who 're 'u?" James slurred, looking at the long beard that he could totally swing along to get to the next island.

Obviously the silver rabbit bouncing in his head would help him understand just what kind of bad ideas were being presented to him. Look, they wanted to pull all the vines and pieces of earth and push them into the fire. They were obviously not up to his standards when defending the floatin islands of Tirismasu.

XX

Third year: James and Sirius have been relatively mild. They don't attack anyone, they don't hurt anyone. But they've been keeping an eye on people, and interceding where they could.

Suddenly the two realize that the amount of attention that the random people pay to the young girls has gone off the charts.

They realize that they must be much more proactive to stop the sudden sexual interest the assholes have in the people.
