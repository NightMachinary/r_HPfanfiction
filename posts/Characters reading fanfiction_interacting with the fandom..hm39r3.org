Sorta like the 'characters react to the source material' thing, but with a twist- they're reacting to fanfiction, or the fandom as a whole. Ships, crossovers, fanart, headcannons, clich√©s, the good, the bad, the cringe, everything.

What do you think would happen? Feel free to share any of your personal favorite fics/headcannons/art/whatever. I just want to see what others think.


** This one is fun if you're ok with slash.
