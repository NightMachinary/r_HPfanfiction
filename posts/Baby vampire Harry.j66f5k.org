I had a dream involving Snape raising a baby vampire Harry who's baby vampire teeth fall out like once a week. Snape keeps them, bc potion ingredients. Sometimes he powders half a tooth and adds it to his coffee (with a few counter clockwise stirs to counteract the toxicity).

Shits better then cocaine.


** That's random, but so is this: linkao3(23391646)

(It's not actually that random)

  The most aggravating aspect of Harry's appearance is that he is skinny, excessively and unhealthily so. Severus intends to find out why. Creaturefic & oneshot.
