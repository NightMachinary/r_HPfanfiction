*** As rohan62442 said (thanks again!), it's a one-shot from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362319/13/Bolts-from-the-Blue]].

I don't remember about the other one-shots, but the only bashing (and not even real bashing) in this one was about the incompetence of those responsible for the safety at the first task.

** Probably this? It's a story from a one-shot collection, I believe.

** How could that happen with the Killing Curse existing?

*** How many of the people present would have known how to cast it?

And while we do know that a single killing curse instantly kills a human, I'm can't remember any mention about how well it works against magically resistant creatures like dragons. If it takes five stunners on average to take down a dragon, while it only takes one for a human, maybe it also takes more killing curses, cast simultaneously, to kill a dragon.

Reportedly, it also takes a hundred wizards to kill a nundu. So a single killing curse is probably not enough there either.

**** Nothing can shield against the Killing Curse, so it's again one of these overpowered but underused elements.

***** True, but shielding isn't quite the same as resistance. Shielding is preventing the spell from reaching its target. Resistance is when the target itself prevents the spell from working. For example the dragon's (nundu's) own magic could fight back against the spell. Like the difference between an ABC suit (which prevents an airborne virus from getting to your body) and your own immune system (which hopefully prevents a virus, that has already gotten to your body, from taking hold and killing you).
