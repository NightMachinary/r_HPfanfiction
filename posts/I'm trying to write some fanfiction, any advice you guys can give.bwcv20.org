** First: Don't give up. Good writing is a skill like any other; you might be pleased with your first fic only to look back after a few months and cringe: persevere and try to improve as you go.

​

2: Try to set reasonable goals. Don't start out trying to write a +500k word epic. Getting creative with your vocabulary is good, but try not to use overly complex words too often. It is really easy to overuse commas and semicolons. Don't go overboard with scenery or character descriptions, set the stage and move along.

​

3: Think about what you are trying to accomplish with your story. Do you want to do a character study on how so-and-so reacts to some big event? Do you want a fix-it-fic where everything gets neatly tied in a bow? Do you want to have a fun OP romp with Harry getting some new power? Determine what your goal is and then try to accomplish that.

​

4: Think about where conflict is coming from in the story. Your characters should never be cruising through every obstacle: do they get in fights with each other? Is OP!Harry countered by an even more OP!Voldemort, or some other even greater threat? We need to feel the struggle, the overcoming, the difficulty the characters face in order to get invested in them.

​

5: Read more. Reread the original books, refresh yourself on how the characters talk to each other, how the setting is described, get ideas on how the world is put together. Read other fandoms; learning by example is a good bet and it can show you how to do writing things like describe characters or settings, how to write characters with conflicting opinions and desires, how to structure larger plots. Read things other fanfiction writers have done with a deliberate eye to what you feel works and doesn't work. Read other books (I would recommend, simply for flavor, *older* books. Pride and Prejudice, the Portrait of Dorian Gray, the War of the Worlds, the Great Gatsby, all that jazz. While not strictly 'good' depending on your tastes, they do offer useful perspectives for what 'real' writing looks like, and interesting grammar and vocabulary.)

Tastes are a thing. However, consider that a lot fewer people were reading books back then, and those who did had higher standards (they tended to be more educated).

Aside from this, the books from those times which are still well known nowadays have been filtered.

Choosing one of these books, you're almost garanteed they are solidly written, and quite excellent from a technical point of view.

It doesn't mean newer books can't compare or do as good, but finding the good ones is more tricky.

**** That's about my perspective. I'll admit, I'm mostly into scifi and fantasy, but even given that I can respect the sort of language they use in the Great Gatsby. Nobody is expecting fanfiction to be a significant contribution to the literary canon (though it can be on occasion) but I feel a lot of prospective writers are severely handicapped by having very little experience with what actual literature looks like. I think a significant number of writers of HP fanfiction may have only seen the movies. The argument about whether the books or movies was better is secondary to the fact that the general trend of only consuming media in the form of video limits your understanding of the language and its uses. I think a lot of common spelling and grammatical errors come about because people have only heard a certain word or phrase rather than seen it written down correctly. Reading Pride and Prejudice, to me, would be more of an exercise rather than entertainment, a deliberate exposure to styles of writing I'm unfamiliar with, the end goal being becoming a better writer for having seen how a master of the craft goes about it. The fact some of the language and character perspectives can be quite archaic is honestly a bit of a bonus, additional stretching of the muscles as it were.

For more modern books which qualify as being something like 'literature': Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlen The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan Sabriel by Garth Nix The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett The Atrocity Archives by Charles Stross American Gods by Neil Gaiman

Much like fanfiction, when there are a lot of things it can be hard to find the ones which are good.

***** True, but I'd argue that following a rule without trying to understand the reasoning behind it makes it just as likely that you misuse said rule. I'm not trying to be nit-picky, really, and you're advice is more than decent, but I've seen many fics that fail horribly simply because the author got lost in convoluted, extensive, and boring depictions that most likely had their roots in this innocent bit of advice.

** Have consequences for actions that follow logically.

Dont do friendly goblins unless it is a front to take advantage of the characters and take them for all they are worth

Give the villians agency and intelligence. Your hero is only as great as the villians. The more competent they are, the more able your hero will have to be to beat them. Unless it is a comedy, there things change a bit Rorsachs Make A Wish is a good example for that.

Make the hero struggle for growth. That way when he shows up at the end with the game winning skills we can buy it, or have his amazing skills come at some kind of personal cost either in the moment, blood magic/body destroying at highest levels, or in the past, he jas given up something or is in some way injured to get superpowers.

Try to make others three dimensional. If the character is around a lot give them their own goals, hopes, fears, and values that are different from the heroes.

For example, Harry is a gun slinging desperado, having been trapped un an alternate dimension for ten years. Now returned he is with qualms about bushwacking and killing the villians. Moody is willing to work with him, but draws the line at killing unarmed opponents. Harry doesn't.

** Avoid analysis paralysis. I'm not saying start writing without knowing how your story ends, but don't spend all your time planning every little plot point. You'll get so caught up in planning that you'll never actually put prose on page.

Perhaps you could consider writing a two or three sentence summary of where you want the story to go: the initial change from canon, how this change challenges your protagonist, and how the protagonist resolves their challenges.

Beyond that...just start writing. You can always tweak later if necessary, but if you never actually start you're just out of luck

I would also urge you to start the story where it's exciting to start. If you're writing an AU, for example, but the bulk of the plot happens after Harry's 16th birthday, don't feel like you have to go through years 1-5 just to get all your world building in.

Start when the story actually starts and trickle in background info as needed

*** Can't support this bit of advice. The methodology of the author depends heavily on the person in question. Some have decent results letting the words flow and the story unfold, but you'll never really get any amount of depth or thematic discourse. Many stories without some kind of rough script tend to get lost somewhere along the way or forget about some of their earlier themes, and -- frankly -- you always kind of get that impression that the story is slipping away from the author. This is mostly a problem for longer fics, but even for a 15k one-shot, I'd probably write down at least 2-3 pages of notes before I start to write more than maybe a core scene that made me want to write that fic in the first place. You just don't get the sense of completeness with a story if you haven't thought about the ending before you start the very beginning.

***** We know by the same extended movie canon that Dippet was pushing 300 when he retired from the very job of Hogwarts Headmaster, though. He was going a bit senile by /then/, but a whole two centuries sooner would seem a bit early to be worrying about your Headmaster getting a little too creaky for the job.

Besides, it's not like being Headperson entails /that/ much responsibility, that we know of; it's the Deputy Headperson doing most of the work; the Headperson themselves basically just makes speeches and presides over staff meetings, of which one imagines there are very few, because you don't want to put Professor Snape, Professor Trelawney and Professor McGonagall in a room together for too long if you can at all avoid it.

So if there really were suspicions that Dumbledore was going senile, it would surely be one his most responsibility-laden jobs that he'd be kindly invited to drop, like, say, Chief Mugwump. Not the honorable but largely honorific Headpersonship of Hogwarts.

** -Finish writing a least 5-6 chapters (or half of it) before posting. That way you have backups and you can keep a schedule (if you desire).

-Write something everyday. Whether it's chapters, summaries, character traits, chapter outlines, whatever. Just write down something. It'll keep you motivated.

-Keep your characters consistent, whether you choose to stay IC or not. There's nothing worse than a consistently inconsistent character.

-Plot your story. It doesn't have to be rigid (in fact, it's best if it's not), but know where you want to go with it. Beginning, middle and end.

-Invest in a good beta who can tell you what you're going wrong and where you can do better. They will also help you keep your tenses correct, punctuation steady, words spelt correctly (spellcheck won't get everything), etc. They are also good feedback and fresh eyes always helps.

** Make the story have consequences. If the major characters end up exactly where they began, or near enough too, and unharmed, your story likely has little to no character development, as next to nothing happened that could change your characters.

Character development is great when it's pulled off right. Don't be afraid to utilize it.

It's also a good way to avoid rehashing canon or writing stories with endings that might as well be the canon one (I.e. everyone lived happily ever after, the end).
