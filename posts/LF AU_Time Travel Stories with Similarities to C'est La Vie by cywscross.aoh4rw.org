Any recommendations to stories similar to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est La Vie]]? I've read a lot of fics where Harry time travels to an AU universe and I love these. In C'est La Vie, Harry meets Orion Black (the son of Sirius Black) and befriends him / whoa he's also a werewolf. I enjoyed reading this friendship play out, and I was looking for similar fics with this type of development. Where Harry time travels and befriends a new non-canon character, i.e Sirius or Lupin's kids, his siblings, etc.

â€‹

Thanks!


** I'd personally love anything where Harry is either a little over-powered or has some special knowledge like time travelling- and he's nice, like in C'est La Vie, he helps people, protects them and lifts them up without being snotty, sarcastic, and training 24/7.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

***** Yep, I think it's mostly dealt with in the sequels but has been a while, so didn't want to link to the wrong one and figured it'd be easier to just reference the trilogy since it's pretty well known in these parts. And on mobile :(
