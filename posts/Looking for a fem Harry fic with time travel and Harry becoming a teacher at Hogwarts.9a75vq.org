Hello! I've been looking for this fic for a while it was sort of a time travel fic to fix the problems the idiots in charge of the series committed. It starts with an angry jaded old Harry who at the end of his life casts a spell to send him back in time. And it ends with a female Harry Potter being a teacher at Hogwarts with a wife and an adoptive Patsy Perkins for a daughter. If anyone knows which fic I'm talking about I'll be forever grateful if you can help me find it.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
