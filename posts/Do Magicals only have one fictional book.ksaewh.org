So, the only real fiction novel we get to hear about in HP is Beedle the Bard - far as I can tell from a brief google, everything else is either a textbook or an autobiography (even Lockhart's books were technically true, making them non-fiction: and I know the Mad Muggle thing exists, but I'm not counting it since it's a comic book and not a novel) - and I was curious what people thought about this.

Do we think this dearth of in-world fiction is just Rowling's worldbuilding and/or Harry's obliviousness striking again and there actually are a tonne of other novels out there? Or is this a case of Doylism and Watsonianism aligning and Magicals just don't really have any interest in reading stories as adults?

If there are other stories, do we think they follow similar patterns to Muggle interests? Would they have fads like us? - the early 1900s had a tonne of cowboy stories, now we're buried in superheroes, etc.

If there aren't, why?

And hell, there are probably a tonne of things about this that I haven't thought of, so please do add any other thoughts that aren't covered by the questions. I'm hella curious to know what you all think!


** Almost the whole series is filtered through Harry's POV. Harry doesn't show any interest in fiction, or have time to read it, so there wasn't much opportunity for Rowling to show us fiction in her world.

In one of my fics, werewolf erotica is a popular genre. I figure that a group of people that's oppressed and shunned might also be fetishized. Humans who know nothing about real werewolves profit off stories about how excitingly dangerous they are.

*** I know - I did say that I wasn't counting it, since it was a comic and not a novel. :)

My point was more about the lack of fiction novels for adults. Like, we never see Molly scrambling to put away a Harlequin Romance Novel, and no teacher's bookshelf is ever mentioned as having fiction stuff written for adults (or even young adults) on it - there's no Flitwick or McG reading whatever the Brandon Sanderson or Terry Pratchett or even Twilight/Hunger Games equivalent is in the Magical World. We even have our main character bookworm, but she never seems to sit down with an actual novel, not even offhandedly mentioned as putting one down when Harry storms in due to that years drama.

Fiction exists and is mentioned, sure, but in small numbers and only really for younger people (I forgot to mention Babbity Rabbity). That I acknowledge. But there's no classic literature, or genre fiction, or whatever else mentioned even once that I can find.

**** Well, our sole source PoV is Harry. Harry is... irregularly observant. I doubt that he cares about what other people are reading. So, call it one vote for Harry's obliviousness.

Beyond that, I hate to say it, but that's what editors are for. There may very well have been a draft of some book where the contents of McGonagall's bookshelf was examined in detail, only to fall victim to the Red Pen and Blue Pencil.

** I think it's likely they have fiction in the Wizarding World, I just don't think Harry was all that interested in it so we never hear about it in the books.

I'm actually having a lot of fun writing about a series I call Horath Bogtrotter, which is the tale of an auror hunting a dark wizard. In my series I have a Horath Bogtrotter book come out every Christmas, which gives my protagonist the opportunity to read and comment on it.

** I honestly think the lack of presence of fictional books has more to do with JKR not investing time towards that particular avenue as it didn't really push the plot forward.

I personally like to think there would be a whole world's worth of fiction and other things related to lifestyle, not just in terms of books but entertainment as well and they would all experience fads and trends.

Witches and Wizards would have to do something for their entertainment and I doubt, contrary to popular belief in the fanfic community, that all they do is devote their time to dancing, duelling, flying, studying to become super powerful edge lords etc.

Fiction and stories have been around for a very long time, gathering a good bit of steam by the time the Victorian Era came around. So yeah, I think fiction would exist.

Also a lot of fiction reflects the norms and problems of society of the day it was written in. Take a Christmas Carol, or even the Harry Potter series. They reflect problems of the day in which they were written, but take adopt a different approach.

I feel if you go along those lines of thinking, you'll find that trends and fads would exist as well.

JKR covered all she could without deviating from the plot too much. Unlike Fanfic authors, she didn't have the luxury of a pre-existing and set world, so the extent to which she could develop the world is limited.

Personally I'd consider this an opportunity to expand the HP verse along my own lines of imagination rather than limit myself to what has been set in stone.

*** It might be more lovecraftian than gothic- I could imagine a novel about some unspeakable doing research on the veil of death calling up something that he couldn't put down.

On the other hand, I could see Dracula being more of a comedy of errors from the magical perspective- this vampire just wants to immigrate to Britain and “raise” a family of his own, but his lack of familiarity with the statute of secrecy ends up getting him killed by a superstitious muggle, of all people!

** Mechanically, it's like because fiction stories have little relevance to the plot.

In situ, I find it difficult to decide what kind of fiction there actually is, because they live in a magical world, so that means fantasy/ sci fi would not be as relevant an option. I suppose there might crime stories, Historical fiction and things, but i think the folk stories would have more prevalence. Beedle occupies the sort of ‘Grimm's Fairy Tales' niche but there might be prosaic retellings of the Táin Bó Cuailnge, but the Tuatha Dè Danann are powerful wizards. The Iliad, Aeneid and the Odyssey seem ripe for the plundering, same with the stories of Arthur and his Knights. The problem is these wouldn't necessarily be seen as ‘fictional' more Legendary accounts of history.

I reckon their might be more an emphasis placed on Poetic traditions, as the recounting of Stories through prose was a ‘relatively' new thing at the time of the Statute of Secrecy. Think 1500s ish Don quixote.

There is probably a niche market for muggle stuff. Though given the propensity for Muggleborns and half-bloods to forget about muggles, and the nature of magic and secrecy I don't know.

*** I mean, sure, but we literally have an obsessive bookworm as a deuteragonist, and she's not mentioned as reading a novel even once, even offhandedly. Like, I could totally see her putting down her novel when Harry storms in after some drama goes down. Even Flourish and Blotts seems to lack a fiction section altogether.

That's what brought the question about. Sure, them not being plot relevant is probably the answer, but there's not even a trace of them existing and I'm curious what people think about that. Does it mean anything, is it just Rowling, etc.

*** To be fair, plenty of people dream about someday finally sitting down and writing a novel. Most just never get very far because writing is hard. But with longer lifespans and magic simplifying everything, more witches and wizards might actually get around to writing. And with less competition from good writers, more of them might actually get their books published.

80% of the books would still be trashy romance novels though.

** My headcanon is that from the Watsonian perspective, Tolkien was a squib from a more liberal branch of the Lestrange family (they exiled him with a falsified backstory instead of killing him). Here's my evidence:

Lestrange means “the strange” or “the mad” in medieval French, while Tolkien was thought to mean “foolishly clever” in medieval German. (Modern linguists dispute this claim, but Tolkien himself used it as a pun by having Gandalf say “fool of a took”.) The meanings are quite similar to each other, which shows an interesting connection.

I also saw a Lestrange house crest that was composed of the letters in “Lestrange” in the same way that Tolkien's personal seal is composed of his initials. (I don't think the Lestrange crest I saw was the official version, but it's what gave me the headcanon in the first place.)

Combine all of this with, among other things, the whole resemblance between Acromantulas and the giant spiders in Tolkien's legendarium, and it would make sense for Tolkien to be an exile from the wizarding world.

IRL, this is all just a coincidence, and Tolkien's stuff came way before Rowling's. It still makes a good headcanon.

TLDR: I imagine that witches and wizards would be familiar with Tolkien's books because he'd be a Lestrange squib.
