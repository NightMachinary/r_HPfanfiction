I've been thinking about the fact that the Harry Potter series is a novelization of several typical tropes we identify in traditional fairy tales and legends. The few that I've identified are

- The journey to the underworld - which also appears in the Odyssey and Orpheus's legend, as well as other legends around the world. As an aside, it's quite nice how the first book mirrors the last one. In the first book Harry has to get past a Cerberus (the traditional guardian of the underworld) and in the last book he actually meets the dead;

- The slaying of the monster who abducted the damsel in distress using an enchanted sword - this is a common trope in fairy tales around the world;

- The hero's labors - most famous are Hercules's labors, but the theme also appears in multiple folk tales around the world and they are typically three just like the Triwizard Tournament tasks;

- The creature who saves the hero in a moment of distress because the hero showed kindness to it in the past - in the books it's Dobby, but we often encounter this trope in the form of the golden fish, the queen bee or the queen of birds;

- The enchanted item that makes the hero invisible - not much to talk about in here, invisibility helmets, armors and cloaks are quite common in fairy tales.

So I was wondering what other similar tropes tied to legends, mythology and folk tales have you identified in the story. Also if you know of any fics that explore lesser known themes from these media, I would be extremely grateful for your recommendation.


** The idea of a chosen one. This ones pretty self explanatory

The heroes Journey. Harry grows from a young orphan to a hero over the course of a 7 year ordeal.

Horcruxes are basically watered down phylacteries.

** The Hallows are akin to the grail quest Ritually significant numbers e.g. 3 and 7. 3 brothers, 3 hallows, 3 powerful Half Bloods either Harry, Voldemort, Snape, or Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore. Three trios of friends, seven horcruxes. By and large, Harry uses a fair amount of cunning and trickery to solve problems, a trait encouraged in Greek Heroes.
