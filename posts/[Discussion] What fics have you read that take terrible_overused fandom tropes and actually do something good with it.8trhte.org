Basically what it says in the title, what fics have you read that take an over used trope or one that's very rarely written well (Powerful! Intelligent! Dark! Special! Harry, Harem, Wrong boy Who Lived, etc etc) and make it an actually good and entertaining read? For me a prime example (and the One that inspired this post) is Deprived linkffn(7402590). Off the top of my head it has Dark!, Powerful!, and Special! Harry, Wrong Boy Who lived, and seems to have the beginning of a Harem going (it is, alas, unfinished and almost certainly dead). It remains one of my favorite HP fics, it's just that looking back on it, if someone described it to me it would sound like a list of what not to do in a HP fanfic.


** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). Its got everything:

- WBWL
- slytherin!Harry
- magically bonded house elves
- noble houses (and all that entails)
- "seer" luna (not really, but she isn't just crazy)
- "family" magics
- Hadrian Potter

But as the fic progresses, the layers peel apart, and you begin to see the nuance and amazing subversion of the tropes. Who is really responsible for Harry being separated, and why? What causes the muggle hatred towards Harry? And more recently, why is Remus different from the other werewolves (this is possibly the only fic that has genuinely good reasoning for hating werewolves).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** No worries. WBWL = Wrong Boy Who Lived. In other words, for some reason everyone thinks someone besides Harry (or whoever) is the one to defeat Voldemort and saved them all. These are usually twin fics, though their are a number that have alternate BWL like Neville. A lot of these have similar beats too:

- Living parents
- Harry sent to Dursleys, where they are often more abusive than in canon
- Mean or narcissistic fake Boy Who Lived (often Harry's brother/twin)
- Manipulative Dumbledore (surprisingly less in these fics than you would think)
- Slytherin!Harry, mostly to separate him if they are brothers
- Harry is more talented/gifted/intelligent than his brother, and most people who know them actually are aware of this fact

Its relatively common, though there are a number of fics with good WBWL plots. Examples include:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): talented Harry sent to another school
- linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes): basically the same premise as PoS, but it plays the tropes straight
- linkffn(Deprived): has basically a WBWL-style plot (even though its not completely clear who is who), though its somewhat tropey and cliche
- linkffn(Antithesis): a more recent dark WBWL, won't spoil it

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

But it's a really fun fic.

*** This is recommended everywhere but I tried reading it and found it kinda bad. The writing style is not too good for the first couple chapters, does it get better?

**** It's not good. It essentially a bunch of tropes from 10+ years ago but with recency bias. None of them are done particularly well either. I think it just hits all the right notes with the people who secretly love those kind of stories but have to deal with people telling them their taste sucks.

**** I think so. The author has brought in far more betas and commenters on a discord server for later chapters. I at least notice a significant improvement in writing quality since then.

**** I'm convinced that someone could ask for a fic in which Dumbledore is actually a hippogriff with a human animagus form and someone would recommend this fic. I swear it's linked in every thread on this subreddit.

*** I remembered reading a bit of this and not liking it at all. But, I continually see it recommended, so I figured I'd give it another go. It turns out I was thinking of a totally different fic.

This definitely tics all the boxes for horrible tropes, ESPECIALLY dying and meeting Fate which I hate with a passion. But I somehow plowed through the first few chapters and am now enjoying it.

I think the hook of 2 time travelers waring with each other is good. I've not read anything quite like that before. The whole summary should just be, 2 time travelers try to muck each other's plans. I'd have been MUCH more willing to give the story a chance.
