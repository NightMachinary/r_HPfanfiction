hello friends! so I've heard loud and clear from some comments on my work as well as from peeps here that we're all sick and tired of Ron bashing.

I want to write a Ron who isn't a brat or villain, but I'm actually finding it hard to think of how to write him because my brain just isn't working in that department right now, so I was wondering for those of you who love Ron if you campus help me with talking about a) why you like him as a character and b) some things you think he can bring to the table.

I want him to be. Bit of a mom friend, I think. He's the only one in their circle who have a big family, and who has older siblings, which are different to having parents. I'm thinking that while a lot of people have picked up on the strategy thing, maybe Ron can actually show Harry and Hermione how to be a team/work together and also how to share, as Hermione might not be used to sharing her things, and Harry has never been told he's allowed to have things/deserves a part or share of his own

I do know I don't like the way Rowling wrote Ron in the later books, but I need some help working out how to write him differently. I'm hoping some discussion will help with that

edit just to clarify, I'm not needing help with plot or asking for recs, but if you can tell me what you like about Ron, or some potential you see in the character or how you wish he was, I'd be greatly appreciative


** The thing to remember is at first, Ron was the really loyal friend who had a big mouth. He didn't think before speaking, so he tended to be abrasive, but he was absolutely loyal. This is the kid who, to get Harry through the challenges in book one, willingly took himself out. The kid who was totally willing to charge a basilisk to save his sister. Too bad for the ponce Lockhart.

Issue is, Rowling increased this up to eleven as time went on, using Ron as a conflict maker. Yes, fanfic exacerbates it, but it's still frustrating.

I'd actually let him start /growing up/ around book two to three, keep his loyalty and have his tendency to stick his foot in it slowly end, and have him start taking life a bit seriously.

I'd make him the nurturer, the heart. Hermione is the organizer and big brain. Harry is the leader and if you ignore Rowling making him an Everyman later on, the power of the team.

*** yeah that's the goal. Someone said it so well a while ago that with Ron Rowling kept sending him back to zero while everyone else developed. I think you sad it really well that Ron is a conflict maker in canon, and that's perhaps why I'm finding it hard to shift him in my mind. I think looking at canon from that perspective that helps a lot, so thank you

** It all depends on what you want to do. Personally Ron should be the one to give Harry and Hermione the inside scoop on how things work in the Wizarding world, as he was intended before Hermione took that role away from him.

There has to be a turning point for his character, an event where something happens to Ron and he makes a change for himself for the better. What event from the books (or something that happens/will happen in your AU) do you want to work on?

Book 2 can be a good starting point--Harry's outed as a Parselmouth, his wand is messed up, the Polyjuice fiasco, elective selection. Maybe something happens w/his wand during class or when brewing Polyjuice and he says, "Bugger this, I'll learn non-verbal magic." (Canonically weaker than verbal magic, and hey, he's done it before ("Eat slugs, Malfoy!"). Plus he's had to have seen Bill/Charlie/Percy do it/talk about it, so it'd make sense that he knows about it before Harry and Hermione.)) Maybe he's seen Bill work with fanon!Runes during one of his visits home and wants to emulate him and Bill teaches him a bit over the over after first/second year and he becomes a savant at it.

Book 3--Ron gets his own wand. Maybe that motivates him. Maybe he joins Harry for Anti-Dementor lessons. Or he can be more proactive in trying to find out why Chrookshanks wants Scabbers so badly (and protecting Scabbers by keeping him in a cage or something).

Book 4--Triwizard Tournament. The standard canon feelings of being left out/jealously occur, but Ron tries harder to repair things before or after the first task, working w/Harry and Hermione in training Harry for the events. For the events surrounding the Yule Ball, maybe he doesn't get jealous of Hermione and Krum, and treats Padma better, leading to a good friendship/relationship later down the line. Maybe he does get jealous and works to make it up to Padma afterwards. Maybe he doesn't work it out with either of them and him and Fleur become a thing after the Second Task. Who knows?

Book 5--O.W.Ls and Prefectcy and Voldemort returns. This could be the kick in the arse that he needs to raise above "slightly above average". He could motivate Harry (since Harry leans more towards Ron's opinions than Hermione's) to work harder, keep his head down around Umbridge, and ignore his dreams.

And so on and so forth. There's dozens of pathways any event could take.

**** I like these :) i would like to add some things.

Book 2: after a year where Harry gets bullied, and hermione and Ginny getting attacked his inner Molly awakens: fiercly protective and nurturing Ron. He would focus less on himself and more on others. He could be a protector of the outsiders against bullies (Luna, Neville, maybe some muggleborn/halfblood snakes) and mentor for the younger years when he becomes prefect. He shows signs of these behaviors troughout canon like eat slugs malfoy and thinking of the houseelves during the battle of hogwards. I think het would be an amazing and caring prefect focussing on helping and nurturing the firsties vs a Percy who is only focust on the status of being one.

** The bit that I always think of for Ron, for me, is I think in OotP. Ron and Hermione are having an argument about freeing house elves. Hermione has been knitting clothes and then hiding them. After Hermione storms off Ron uncovers the clothes but leaves them, saying that the house-elves should at least have the choice. He might disagree with Hermione, but he respects both her and the house elves to find a compromise rather than just taking advantage of her absence. He has a very keen sense of fairness.

Ron values choice. Ron chooses repeatedly to endanger himself for Harry, for his family. Ron and Harry's fall-out in book 4 could also be viewed through this lens. Harry and Ron had discussed entering, they both said they would if they could and then Harry is entered but never gave Ron the chance. I believe that had they both found a way to enter and Harry had been selected, Ron would have supported him best he could. The issue was related to how Ron never had the option.

When people see Ron as lazy and demotivated I can see that through his perceived lack of choice. Bill was Head Boy, Charlie was Quidditch Captain, Percy was Head Boy, the twins have been on the quidditch team for years and also have their own brilliance and popularity. What can Ron choose? What options does he have that can be his rather than following in the footsteps of his brothers? Ron doesn't have options that he can see as his own, so he just gets by.

If I wanted Ron to take a bigger role in the story I would introduce a goal for him. A large part of Ron's character is his lack of a goal, something many of us face in our own lives. It means that Ron doesn't ever work towards something. I believe you have a real opportunity for character growth if Ron confronts something that causes him to have an ambition. Maybe it is teaching/coaching, maybe it is through helping others, I don't know. I think Ron could become more if he had something that was truly his that he earned through his own hard work and that he wanted enough he worked for it.

** Well, in my mind, one of the best characteristics of Ron, from Harry's POV, is the fact that he is the loyal, cool, sometimes a little loud-mouthed friend that any friendless boy who just stepped into a new world wants. He knows enough people and enough of the said world in order to make Harry's transition easier. Furthermore, while I'm not going to list the so often quoted examples around here, he is shown to be willing to give his life for his friends. Even if they bicker constantly, he is the only one who truly stands up for Hermione even against Harry when he is mean to her (Harry doesn't do the same). He has his friends over all the time and even goes to check up on them when he thinks something doesn't seem right. Sure, he gradually falls in Harry's shadow and he has some moments of jealousy, but what teenager who has a bunch of accomplished siblings wouldn't, especially in their formation years?

And, for reference, I am going to compare him to Hermione. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love book-canon Hermione but I hate the Mary Sue Hermione from the movies and most Harmony fics (seems like she often is a projection of a female writer in those, hell, even JK said that she's her projection). Hermione is a very smart, knowledgeable and empathetic girl. But at the same time, I think she can be quite a bore with her tendency to only talk about schoolwork (unless situation arises), can be (to quote Snape) "an insufferable know-it-all", can be quite nagging and, downright, ignorant about some things. Even when Harry and Ron have their first fight in GoF, it's stated that Harry didn't really enjoy Hermione's company as much as Ron's. Harry also acts quite shitty towards her in DH after she breaks his wand and it's quite clear he is making an effort not to bring up Ron in order not to upset her. So all those fics making Harry and Hermione best friends without Ron as the bridge always seem quite OOC for me.

The reason why those fics exist is because Hermione-lovers feel like she deserves everything in the world because she's a hard-worker and gets excellent marks. Ron's out of the running for "Hermione's soulmate" for a number of reasons, either canonically-backed or not, so Harry's the next best thing. He's the Chosen One, and only the Chosen One will do for Princess Hermione, so they force the two together like someone trying to fit into jeans that are three sizes too small. They all hate Harry and Ron for being bad friends to her (Ron more so, in their opinion, because he was a bad friend to Harry in Book 4 and 7) so they kick him to the curb and make Hermione mold Harry into her ideal partner.

I will say that not every Harmony fic is like that. In Harem!Harry fics Harry molds Hermione.

**** Agreed.

To me Hermione seems to be one of those people who, while they themselves feel deeply, logics her way through other people 's feelings. This leads to her being able to disregard those feelings she sees as silly or unimportant (WHY would they not see feeling like this is stupid? Come on!), while at the same time being pretty good at realising /what/ somebody is feeling.

***** This is a really good insight into something that seems quite paradoxical in Hermione. She clearly understands the feelings people have, but on a logical level, not because she empathises.

In fact, if we think about the pets, it's Ron who shows empathy to Lavender, while Hermione repeatedly sticks her foot in her mouth.

** Ron is a pretty awesome character in canon, at least early on in the series. For the most part he's a likable kid. If Harry hadn't befriended him I get the sense that he would have spent a lot of time hanging out with Dean and the other boys doing teen guy stuff and focusing on quidditch.

Anyhow, in canon he had a lot more in the way of witty lines and was a lot more compassionate and protective of his friends. He was dumbed down quite a bit for the movies and some of his best lines were given to Hermione since the writer was a Hermione fan. Also I think because the movies were being made before the series was finished, and the screenwriter shipped Harry/Hermione so didn't nurture those nice Ron moments.

Example: When Draco called Hermione a mudblood in the books, she was like "Whatevs I don't know what that even is." It was Ron who was furious on her behalf and tried to defend her. In the movies, poor poor movie-Hermione got all teary eyed as she explained to all the wizards in the room how she was called mudblood and it means dirty blood, poor poor movie-Hermione.

Or when Hermione got the Tales of Beedle the Bard from Dumbledore. Ron explained to them what those were because he knew Harry had a muggle upbringing and wouldn't be familiar with wizarding children's stories. In the movie he had a "hurr durr I like Babbity Rabbity" moment then acted confused when the others looked at him blankly.

In short, write some witty lines. Give those witty lines to Ron. When characters have important insights, give some of those insights to Ron too. If there are things his friends wouldn't understand about wizarding culture due to growing up with muggles, have Ron be aware of that and ready to help them.

Ron needs an overarching goal. You can give him a new goal. Or go with the canon one which was to be recognized as an individual by his family and the wizarding community. As Harry's sidekick/bestfriend, that role is at odds with his goal sometimes and I think that's where some of the conflicts came in. But it has a lot of potential that wasn't really explored to its fullest in canon.

** First and foremost, Ron in book 4 and 7 is out of character. Especially book 4. I don't care what anyone says, there is no way in the world Ron would even think Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire.

So just don't write that conflict, at all. Ron believes in Harry from the very start, he never has any doubt and there is no "jealous streak".

Other main thing is, all practical knowledge and how the wizarding world works should come from Ron. He's the only one of the trio who has actually lived his entire life there since he was born.

This may sound unpopular, but I think he should be the second best duelist and second best in DADA after Harry in his year. He should easily beat Hermione when it comes to quick and practical use of magic.

If you want to write Romione then don't do the Yule Ball fiasco with Krum. And if you don't want to write Romione, then /definitely/ don't do the Yule Ball fiasco.

*** That actually makes some sense, the dueling thing.

Hermione is great academically, but we see right from the first book with the Devil's Snare (in the book, not the movie which gave a lot of Ron's stuff to her) that she panics in emergencies. Which is fine, not everyone is good at everything. I see her as the sort who in a conflict would think of so many things that could happen that she'd lock down. Eventually she'd be able to train out of it, but she just wouldn't be as good as someone who can focus on the now as much.

So many fanfics take 'She is smart' and turn her into 'she is a dueling genius'. It boggles my mind, knowledge of spells doesn't equate to combat or all the people testing students for OWLs would be badass uber-warriors.

Frankly, a broad knowledge of spells is probably not required to fight effectively. I saw this once in a fanfic, I don't recall the name. It's likely better to know a few spells that fill the various combat niches REALLY WELL. Then you can expand to have more options for those niches, but ability to fight well (nerve, reflexes, experience) is better than having an encyclopedia of knowledge.

** I'm working on a fic where Ron is fairly minor. Originally I was going the idiot/vicious route but changed my mind. So he's impulsive with a quick mouth and still jealous at times, but by 5th year can be talked down before a public explosion (it helps that Hermione points out that he'll draw attention from Draco's tantrum and become the new disruption in the hall). You may have to talk fast, but it can be done--and he wants a full explanation soon. He's also loyal to Harry and genuinely wants to stay friends; in the scene Sirius comes up in discussion and while most of the students still have a negative impression, Ron is very much "Harry says he's a good guy and I trust Harry." That loyalty wins out even over some of Molly's demands. And his strategic mind does eventually accept why Harry was being cagey with his secrets.

I think it's a matter of emphasizing his more positive traits while acknowledging at least some of the negative, but also dropping the fanon notion that he's stupid or slow.

****** If you're a Hermione/Harmony fan that is indifferent towards/mildly dislikes Ron you'll like the fic. Ron's basically a cheerleader for Harmony after he gets over Hermione's months-long callousness towards him and Lavender.

If you hate Ron, there's won't be enough bashing for your tastes.

If you like Ron (like I do) the fic reads like so many other "Harmony fic, no Ron bashing!" fics do: Harry is basically Hermione's bitch, Hermione thinks she's better than everyone else while behaving worse, and together they can do anything. Ron's his canon self but still a cheerleader for the ship and everyone falls over themselves saying "I knew you and Harry were perfect for each other!!1!" Hermione makes it very clear in her thoughts and actions that she thinks she's superior to Ron and Lavender but still thinks she's being fair.

Lol, I see what you're doing. I insulted one of your favorite fics so you're asking to see /my/ work so that you can judge it by some arbitrary metric. Well, if you want to take a gander, here's my profile pages for [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/StarsandSunkissed/works][AO3]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3794507/SolarSolstice][FFN]].

As I said in my original post, you don't have to take solely my word for it. Even some objective Harmony fans have said it's a "decent time waster" and "Readable but bland", "amateurish" and, one of my favourites, "Want a H/Hr story with zero stakes and recycled story-lines from over 20 years of fanfic with a coat of polish? This is the story for you."

More can be found [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/hermione-granger-and-the-paradigm-shift-by-petrificus-somewhatus-t.39364/][here]].

Also, I'd expect this sort of story defence from the author, not some random fan. It's an average fic, both in terms of plot and from a technical standpoint--too many verbs and -lys, eg "she muttered unthinkingly", "he began calmly", "she replied angrily", "she replied sadly", "he muttered quietly", "she asked tentatively", "he tiredly replied"--see what I mean? It makes the writing feel dry, and this is all in the first chapter!

There's also the overuse of (...) and spelling out every single thought and emotion for the readers, because the author seems to think we're children that can't understand subtleties.

I will check out the links. And I don't leave negative reviews for amateur work, so don't expect any flames. It's incredibly shortsighted to attack authors that volunteer their time for our collective enjoyment.

As for Paradigm, I don't find it offputting to have "-ly" words, as you put it, it helps me understand the tone and speech of the comments. What I liked most about it was what you didn't - namely, that it felt like I was reading a believable POV of Hr during Book 6. No one was super-powered, their solutions to conflicts were within the range of possibility, adults generally acted like adults with knowledge and experience greater than children, etc. Perhaps it is a statment about HP fanfics overall, but Paradigm was standout IMO.
