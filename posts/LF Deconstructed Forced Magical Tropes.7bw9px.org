Some of the tropes used in the more lighthearted fics are downright horrifying if you spend too much time thinking about them (particularly about the consent/free will/agency problems involved). I'm looking for fics that explore this.

Thinking Soul Bonds, Marriage Laws, Magical Contracts, Fate and Prophecy, or to a lesser extent, Dark Magic / Time Travel.

Examples of what I am looking for:

Soul Bond, where instead of it being a wondrous thing, we get to see the character watch their own personality slowly get killed off to be replaced with the new, magically enforced personality.

I've read Escape linkffn(11916243), which is a good "Reject the Marriage Law" Fic. I also read linkffn(11961978) from a thread earlier today, where the muggle takeover of the wizarding world was triggered by these problems. Which is what brought this to mind. Although these are more of the 'fight against these tropes' rather than exploring why these tropes can be horrifying.

As much as I would like to throw the stupid Harem fics in there, they are usually /cough/ written as consensual thing so it doesn't quite fit.


** Marriage law is one big fucking human rights violation that even Nazis, Stalinists, and Maoists didn't dare to implement.

Those who came up with that stupid idea had no clue about how real people would respond to that kind of shit, not withstanding our heroes who had trashed Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

Therefore, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), remains my top (anti)marriage law fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450), is far less violent, but in a way very satisfying too.

--------------

As for other tropes, we had many discussions here.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/61y4fu/any_fics_where_harry_tries_to_go_independent_but/dfikifv/][This]] was my take on indy!Harry, and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/708lla/request_give_me_prompts_like/dn1hg2j/][here]] was my take on a botched time travel.

*** Yes the Marriage Law one seems to be the most commonly subverted one. I suspect it is because "Evil Government" is more common than "nature/magic is a bitch".

I had read Marriage Law Revolution before. It certainly fits but the characters were OOC enough that it went below escape on my list.

Thx for the other links, I will read through them

***** Ehh, matter of degree I suppose.

I'm not against OOC (I mean I liked "Playmate" below, even though I thought that was horribly out of OOC for Harry. Now if it had been Hermione who lost her freedom...), but for the question of "Deconstruct Marriage Law fics", I do put a premium on at least the primary characters effected being as in character as possible. After all, the goal of Marriage Law fics is usually to thrust two characters (usually without redefining them) together that would not fit otherwise, so a good deconstruction would be those characters overcoming a Marriage Law challenge.

Stray too much from the characters, it becomes less fit for the question i asked here. Don't get me wrong, I love Starfox5's stuff, including Marriage Law Revolution and Patron :).

*** "at the beginning" kinda worries me. If they just resist initially but eventually the bond wins out it isn't really a subversion, just a 'darker and edgier' take. Now if they 'beat' the bond and then decide to get together, or find a way to live with it 'not as advertised', it would still qualify as subversion...

*** Never could stand this story. Harry reads like a annoying brat. Ginny reads like an even /more/ annoying brat.

The general feeling I got out of this, is that the author wrote this under the guidance of the explicit purpose of being able to say, "look at how unique and non-tropey my soul bond fic is!" and then pat himself on the back for that 'remarkable' achievement. It just feels forced and unnatural, from start to finish.

** Error of Soul, linkffn(8490518). Harry and Hermione have a soul bond, and everyone treats it like a terminal illness because they slowly lose their sense of self. Sadly abandoned.

Escape and Marriage Law Revolution are the only really good Marriage Law fics I've seen. You can find fics that explore the dark side of marriage laws a little, and a little more so for marriage contracts, but they turn back into regular romances pretty quickly.

I don't think I've ever seen a marriage contract fic where the protagonist either believably fights against it or truly winds up trapped in a loveless and/or abusive marriage, and I'd also like to know if one exists.

**** Both fun fics, but Contractual Invalidation isn't really a deconstruction or subversion of marriage contracts. It really just swaps who normally has the power in that situation.

** The popularity of marriage law fics is basically down to the old Marriage Law Challenge. I think it took off the way it did because it's a useful plot device to get two characters who might not know each other well in a situation where they are forced to keep company and see how they mesh.

A good example is Hermione and Snape, who are very popular MLC candidates - well-matched but unlikely to ever see each other in that way without outside intervention. A more natural way of developing their relationship (which I frankly prefer) is the Secret Occlumency/BtS Book 6 and 7 trope, which has the added benefit of usually filling in a few çanon plot holes in HBP and DH (like why Bellatrix didn't just use Legilimency on Hermione at Malfoy Manor) and usually ending with a living Snape.

As for soul bonds: like ML fics there is an enormous margin for horror here and I'd quite like to see it explored, but in general I believe most people just use it as a device to make the characters recognise their compatibility.

As for the character reactions I prefer MLC fics that take place postwar like Denial and His Draught of Delicate Poison because a war-weary population might acquiesce to something that regular people and people who are actively fighting would probably not.

*** Don't mistake wanting to see something deconstructed as a dislike of the trope. I'm pretty sure a lot of magical girl fans loved Madoka. In fact, a certain exposure (ie, reading) to the trope is required to really enjoy a deconstruction, otherwise it is simply an unrelated story :P.
