I love those stories where Harry ends up in another world/alternate universe whatever you want to call it, they're my guilty pleasure. I was wondering if anyone knew any really good ones?

Any rating is fine, if a multi-chapter would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Would rather not be Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but if it's well written/believable I'll allow it.

No crossovers

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
