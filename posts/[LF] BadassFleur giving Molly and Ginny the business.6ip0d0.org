** I think the Canon Fleur was the true badass in staying above the hostilities from Molly, Ginny, and Hermione.

Harry wasn't kind to her either as he had kept a long grudge at being called "leetle boy" by her.

*** I won't defend Molly and Hermione but Ginny was pissed that Fleur treated her like a child, which is Ginny's biggest pet peeve. Not the best look to act immature when someone treats you like a child, but she is somewhat justified.

**** I think as a Veela, Fleur should get used to being treated poorly by heterosexual females.

***** You think that had something to do with them not liking her? Moreso than her personality? I could see Hermione not liking her because ron fawned over her. I could see Molly not liking her because she is protective of Bill and thinks Fleur's social standing and background won't mesh with the down-to-earth Weasleys, and as mentioned, Ginny hates being treated like a child.

*** She was beautiful and she knew it (not in an arrogant way), but she also didn't seem to place much value on it personally, and knew that Bill loved her for herself, he wasn't just blindsided by her magnificent rack or anything. That probably gave her the confidence to ignore and/or steamroller over the catty behaviour. Bill was probably wise to keep out of it - he knew his family would come around, as long as they thought it was their own idea. Also, if they didn't, it wasn't like he was home very often before. They could just fuck off to another, less bitchy, country.

** There are elements of this in linkffn(A Boon for Bill by canoncansodoff). Fleur's treatment of Molly towards the end of the story is quite vicious.

  Extreme measures are taken to distract Molly long enough for Bill to both neutralize a love potion and ask Harry to help make his engagement to Fleur possible. A kinder, smuttier alternative to Book Six's "An Excess of Phlegm" chapter. H/Hr, Bill/Fleur.
