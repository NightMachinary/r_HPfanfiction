*** I mean, that was a real thing in the USSR; people would do something un-Soviet, and then they were erased from photos and records, and their friends and families were wise enough to not talk about them.

So I guess you can say, In Soviet Russia, memory erases you.

Let me see...Obliviators with their memory charms, Men in Black with their neuralisers, the X-Men with Xavier's telepathy, the shinigami with their...kiokuchikan? The Digimon data squad with whatever they use, whatever guys clean up after the superheroes (in The Incredibles), the SCP Foundation with their amnestics...

So, let's say, a magical beast, an alien, a creature from another dimension, and a poltergeist all get into a tussle with each other, with a superhero, a wizard, and a member of a doubly-secret earth species get involved, with the superhero's secret identity being exposed in the process. That should get a good dozen top-secret memory wiping groups to the scene.

** "This sounds like the setup of a joke. Four memory-erasing government agents walk into a bar. Sorry, I don't remember the punchline."

One of the group, a dark-skinned man in a suit and sunglasses, gave a barking laugh.

"I wonder if we're all using the same methods, though. I mean, mine and renissance fair man over there look similar enough, but knockoff SWAT and waistcoat over there use something completely different, just based on how he is fiddling with that watch and the obvious syringe on her belt."

"I take offense to that, SWAT are amateurs compared to me." said the sole woman of the group, wearing heavy body armor and wielding a rifle.

"Whatever you say, soldier girl." all of them laughed.

"So how do we do this? We can't just walk away, I at least am literally compelled to report this to my superiors." said the oddest of the group, wearing a flowing blue robe with silver accents, nervously fingering a long wooden stick.

"Ay, hands off the damn stick. You don't see me gripping my Neuralyzer like it's an epi pen and I just walked into a peanut factory."

The robed man looked down self-consciously and the stick slid into his sleeve.

"Let's start from the beginning. Why are all of us here? Who even are you?"

"I guess I'll start. I- My, uuuh, 'agency' detected something that fell under our purview, so I was sent to clean it up and make sure nobody knows. My name is Deftley."

"Same here, though we recieved intelligence from one of our contacts that a... 'person of interest' was present here, in full view of the public. So I was sent to encourage them to leave, and make sure nobody knows. I'm Agent G."

"Same thing. We detected an anomaly in this area, so my MTF was dispatched to contain it. Call me Blueberry."

"One of our operatives was scouting the area and requested backup, so they sent me. I go by Lancelot while on the job."

All four of them looked at the others uneasily. Finally, G broke the silence.

"Hang on, so where are your team members, Blueberry and Lancelot?"

"I have no bloody idea. Percival wasn't present when I arrived. Why are you laughing, Deftley?"
