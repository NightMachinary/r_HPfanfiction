So you're doing a story where there are lords of the wizarding world, and it turns out Harry is one. You want to give him something snazzy to set him apart from the lesser masses, that he can always wear. Like a piece of jewelry! Perhaps a ring. Come up with some cool designs. Now google a signet ring. Use that instead. The signet ring goes on pinkie of the left hand, next to wear the wedding band would be placed. Why so much left hand symbology? I have no fucking clue. If you're going to have Harry need two of the damn things for some reason, it should go on the next available finger of the left hand. On this signet ring, you will want to place a crest. You might have thought to place a gem.You thought wrong. Signet rings usually have either a crest OR a gem, not both. As this is a family ring, it should be a crest. Congratulations. You now have a family ring that doesn't look like your uncles class ring.

** I went the opposite route and made the Black family ring gaudy af, and the first thing Harry does after discovering it's unremovable is find a charm to conceal it.

  The ring was hideous---heavy gold, with a gaudy, emerald-studded snake coiled around a large faceted onyx. If this really were a prank, Sirius couldn't have chosen a more godawful ring. With a grimace, Harry pulled it onto his left middle finger.

  The ring momentarily glowed blue and adjusted slightly to fit Harry's finger. /Merlin, I think it just got bigger,/ thought Harry with a shudder.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** To be fair about gemstones, a fair number of signet rings do have the crest engraved on a semiprecious stone, such as carnelian, bloodstone, onyx, or the like. That said, separate gemstones are rare, as are precious gems like diamond, ruby, emerald, sapphire, &c.

** YES. Signet rings were often used to put their crest in a wax seal, the ones with gems are more like a badge of office(though often they had to have some other stuff to make a crest in the wax seal too)

** The tradition of signet rings on the left hand is cultural. In the UK, the signet ring is traditionally worn on the little finger of the opposite hand to the dominant. This is because historically, when signets came into fashion across Britain, it was deemed to be of easiest access for its intended purpose; Sealing wax on documents.

To put this in an example; To this day, the word for the pinkie finger in Scots Gaelic is 'LÃ¹dag-bheag an airgid' which translates as 'Little finger of silver' and is so called because Scots signet rings were traditionally made of silver and placed on the little finger.

As a matter of heraldic practice, it is uncommon for an armiger (Someone who bears a grant of arms) to have a 'crest' (decoration atop the helm) on their ring but to have the escutcheon (shield) of arms engraved instead as it is the escutcheon that is specifically unique to the armiger.

It is also not uncommon for ancient signet rings to have some form of semi-precious stone upon the face, with the design cut into the stone, though these were generally simpler than modern rings, examples of stones that may be used include Amber and Cairngorm Stone.

If you have someone inheriting multiple lordships, with associated coats of arms, the practice is generally to 'marshal' or combine said arms into one via quartering, and this would theoretically be the resultant design on the signet ring.\\
So for example if Lord Sir Harry Potter, 15th Earl Potter, 25th Knight Peverell of Camelot inherited the 'Earldom of Black' to become the 17th Earl Black of <insert place>, he would marshal arms in the following general scheme:

1st Quarter: Arms of the Earl Potter\\
2nd Quarter: Arms of Sir Peverell/ the Peverell Seal or sign of the Deathly Hallows\\
3rd Quarter: Arms of the Earl Black\\
4th Quarter: Arms of the Earl Potter again or other peerage

Process repeats per Lordship until the person has 'Seize Quartiers' (Scotland) or ad infinitum (England) See Stowe Armorial.

Here's a fun link to book that explains heraldic practice.

**** I thank you. I have also had thoughts about magical properties associated with said rings. Though these, I believe would probably be quite limited.

1) Assuming that 'family magic' is a thing, it will notify you that it is being used.\\
2) Something incredibly specific to do with family magic or an inherited task\\
3) Portkey to the family estate. (It could be hilarious if the owner or an ancestor has sold said estate or something and transports the bearer into a ruin or a council estate or something.)\\
4) Perhaps in a duelling context it will provide a physical shield of arms to defend the bearer.\\
5) Most importantly as it is primarily a means of identification most of its function will be based around that.

**** I can see some enchantments as an alarm spell for mind-affecting spells being cast in the area. "Heads up, someone was just obliviated, check if you have signs of it"-type effects.

If you could stick major mental defense systems on a ring, then things would be a bit different book-wise.

Or hell, maybe it DOES prevent mind magic. Of a method from the 1200s. Then a new avenue of attack was developed to bypass those defenses, and became the standard for mind magic to the current day. Nobody can figure out how to create enchantments that automatically block those attacks. But don't worry! You're completely protected from the mind magic equivalent of being hacked by an ENIAC computer.

***** Actually, you could run this idea in total reverse for a laugh. New rings protect against modern mind magics, but no one remembered to put in protections against stuff that went out of fashion a thousand years ago.

Not sure where you'd take that idea, but it could be fun for a one shot or something.

****** That's sort of how I envision a lot of "ancient forgotten magic" working. It isn't stupidly overpowered, but people tend not to design protections around it. It's rather like stealing a bike by unbolting the entire bike rack and hauling the entire thing off in a truck. Sure, people's locks are designed on the assumption that thieves WON'T steal the entire bike rack, but it's an awful lot more work than walking up with a pair of bolt cutters.
