I only read first chapter where they are paired up and told to get pregnant as soon as possible and give birth by next year.

It had Harry Ginny, Ron Hermione, Neville Luna(probably), also some mixed couples too

The story might be years old. I remember reading it a long time ago

*** That's basically another form of marriage law. Those who beat Voldemort and his sadistic genocidal terrorists are going to react very violently to this nefarious scheme cooked up by a weak government.

Unless, of course, it's a total AU in which a very strong Ministry or Order defeated Voldemort by itself, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]], linkffn(4269983). Now, that government would have the power and perhaps enough popular support to push through something similar.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

It would be better ettiquette to make a seperate post for your question with a discussion flair rather than hijack a fic request.
