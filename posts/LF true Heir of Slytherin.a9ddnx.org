No, not Voldermort or Harry.

Are there any fics that use Morfin Gaunt other than time travel?

As we know from HBP, he was alive rotting in Azkaban until Harry's 5th or 6th year. Maybe Sirius meets him there, realizes he's Voldermort's uncle and the changes go from there. Or somebody does better research during CoS events. Or maybe even young Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw decides to pay him a visit when he realizes that defeating Voldie 3 times didn't give him the Slytherin Lordship, and he needs a complete Founder set?
