I don't know how to link the FF story but I'm looking for fics where Harry grows up embracing pureblood culture. Maybe he's raised by Sirius or doesn't embrace the culture until Hogwarts, I don't care.

I'm cool with bashing and slashing as long as Harry doesn't become the heir to 1500 families and is the lost bastard child of Merlin.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** Have you tried "The Begile and Devotion of a Black Heir"? It's one of my favourites, but not to everyone's tastes. linkffn(10710981)

  A chance meeting for Harry sets him on a path he wasn't meant to travel. With his eyes opened, he struggles to control the furious anger after finding all of the lies and hidden agendas. A sudden adoption and unlikely allies work to split him from Dumbledore. With two Lordships and a betrothal, how will the world react to Lord Potter-Black when he refuses to fight in their war?
