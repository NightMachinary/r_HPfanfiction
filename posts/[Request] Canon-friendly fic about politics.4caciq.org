Hi, I'm looking for fic about politics that stay relatively close to canon as far as setting is concerned (plot can go wild). So no Wizengamot Lords and things like that.


** My favorite political fic is linkffn(6733750), and takes place during the first rise of Voldemort.

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
