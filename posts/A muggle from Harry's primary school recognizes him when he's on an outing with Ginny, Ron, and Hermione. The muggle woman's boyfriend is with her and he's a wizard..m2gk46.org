:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reminded of this fic by a prompt that was posted recently.

The wizard boyfriend feels incredibly uncomfortable with the casual interaction with what are basically huge celebrities (he doesn't know them personally at all). He had recently told the girlfriend that he's a wizard, but not enough to have any idea who Harry and friends are.

"Wait... You know Harry too?"

"Uhhh... Everyone knows Harry Potter. Everyone knows all of them, actually."

"So they're - I mean, you guys are celebrities or something?"

"... Uh. Or something."

 

Something like that.

Anybody know the fic?
