Characters: Draco and Astoria, along with a supporting cast

Synopsis: After the war, Draco is angry, depressed and his life is spiraling out of control until a chance encounter with Astoria Greengrass gives him a reason to turn it all around... if he can.

Length: Novel, 8 chapters and 43,000 words so far.

Caveats: It's a work in progress. I expect to finish it before the end of the summer, but it's slow going sometimes. Rated M according to the HPFF rules, which is roughly equivalent to Rated T on FF.net.
