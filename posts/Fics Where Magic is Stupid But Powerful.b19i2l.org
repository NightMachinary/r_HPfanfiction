Not stupid OP character stories. I'm talking about crap like casting spells improperly or at an unorthodox target which you'd think would fail but produces powerful effects. You thought /Tarantallegra/ was just an annoying dancing spell, but that's only because you never thought to cast it on a volcano:

#+begin_quote
  The "Dancing Feet" spell has its origins in ancient Italy, but is best remembered for its improper usage by Warlock Zaccaria Innocenti who is credited with conjuring a 'dance' within Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD.

Arrivederci~

"Hey Ron, I'm practising the Horn-Tongue Hex."\\
"On the ground? Harry, it's meant to be used on living people."\\
"Precisely, that's why I'm casting it at the ground so I don't accidentally hurt anyone if I get it wrong."

Voldemort slowly, leisurely approached Hogwarts Castle...and was promptly ripped to shreds when the ground under his feet inexplicably came alive, with chomping biting teeth and several spiralling tongues each covered in sharp horns.

Up in the castle, Ron glanced over at Harry.\\
"Mate, I think your Horn-Tongue Hex practice had some side effects."
