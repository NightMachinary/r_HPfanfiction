I hate the constant asking for specific things even if the author has already stated it will not be included.


** I notice different frustrating comments on either AO3 or Ff.net.

On AO3 there seems to be more moral policing in the comments, like for example I have a fleur/hermione fic where several people said that gay women didn't have sex that way, and to portray it like that is problematic for other gay women. We kind of have sex lots of ways? So I pretty much phase that out.

Another one shot, someone complained that an assault scene was glorifying, and it really wasn't, it was brief, and used conservative, clinical language, not gratuitous at all. I made the one shot as a piece to highlight how assault in a very popular pairing (death eater/hermione) is actually not erotic, not lovely, and also that most people in such situations don't default into ‚Äúmy goodness, my body wants this!‚Äù but more ‚Äúwhat is happening, I'm going into shock, this is horrifying‚Äù.

Ff.net I definitely have had more complaints that they don't like the premise, or they want faster updates, or choices I made weren't to their taste (like f/f pairings), which - yeah, is interesting. That same one shot with an assault, people complained it was not erotic enough (hmmmmm). Different cohorts on different platforms are picky about different things, I've noticed that a lot.

On the other hand, my favourite reviews are when people compliment me on something I've been working really really hard on, like recently I've been working on pacing and tension, and the few comments that pick that up just make my heart sing. Shout out to reviewers! We love you :)

*** Ffnet isn't the best with their category adds. Ao3 is better that way. You can add anything to the genre and isn't surprised. I hate that Ffnet don't have the option to separate genderbender, homosexual stories by genre. Or tags. Then many don't even add it in they summary so naturally people get angry and disgusted when they enter a story without those warnings or genre tags üò´ it's frustrating!

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** When a fic that doesn't portray their favourite character in the best light is "bashing". To be fair, I'm guilty of this to a degree but some people take it to 11. Like seriously, one of my fics had Ron call out Hermione's behaviour in 6th year after he was poisoned and he uses HERMIONE'S CANON QUOTES in a self-deprecating manner ("Why do you even like me, Hermione?" Ron finally said. "You've made it clear that you fancy the smart, brainy types---or /really good/ Quidditch players. Why bother with me?") and yet the fic is linked by the Shippers-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named as a "Hermione-bashing fic", never mind that Ron verbally beat himself up just as much. And apparently, according to one reviewer, Ron was "hateful", towards who they didn't specify but I'm 99.9% sure they meant Hermione.

** Those people who just comment the same thing EVERY chapter. Doesn't matter if its a positive thing, a negative thing, or whatever. I'm on mobile and in longer stories this shit CLOGS up the reviews like nothing else, and it's so damn worthless.

Also, reviews which just say 'Great' or 'Shit' or other 1 word responses. It literally says nothing. I've seen too many shitfics get praised to heaven, and good fics get dragged through the dumps to give a duck about anyone's personal 'opinion' on fanfic.net, reviews should hopefully describe /what/ they liked or didn't like, and not just the fact that they had an emotional response, whatever it may be.
