I prefer if romance isn't the main focus but I'm open to anything. Even if it isn't my cup of tea, it might appeal to other Herimone fans feel free to rec anything!


** linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13843116/1/aberration]] ): a decent Slytherin!Hermione fic; romance is a significant component, but most of the fic is Hermione interacting with other people.

linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28045281/chapters/68705625]] ): my self-promotion; I don't know how often I'll be able to update it, but I intend to keep each chapter individually entertaining enough that even if I don't finish it, it'll still be worth reading.

  Hermione Granger hates Harry Potter just as much as the next Slytherin. Until she doesn't. [Slytherin!Hermione Granger x canonically noble & sarcastic Harry Potter rivals to lovers]

  In October of 1992, Hermione asks an odd question during the Transfiguration class. The answer has consequences. Cross-posting to Archive Of Our Own, Space Battles, and Sufficient Velocity.

** Now that you ask for it, the number of non-romantic Hermione fics is troublingly low even though canon!Hermione doesn't show much romantic inclination.

The latest installment from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is nothing to fear]] series is from Hermione's POV. A unique Voldemort Wins AU.

Linkffn(New Blood) is still going strong. Somewhat OP Slytherin!Hermione in the style of Riddle.

Linkao3(Six Pomogranate Seeds) Is probably the closest you will get to an aromantic Hermione. This one is just too pragmatic.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25272307][There is a List for That]] by GatherYourStrength is a very recently completed Hermione-centric fic. It is a time travel fic to the Marauders Era. No romance whatsoever.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27530344][Dancing with Darkness]] by TheSword is an ongoing fic. No romance thus far, and the author assures that any romance will be minimal and not the focus. It is another time travel fic to the Marauders Era. It has just started but it looks pretty promising.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31242809][Professor Granger, Occupation; Defence Against the Dark Arts Post.]] by Camk475 has an alternate universe Hermione Granger coming to teach DADA. It is an exploration of duelling, and pretty much exists to show off a competent Hermione. It is ongoing.

There is also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30109236][Coming of Age]] by Cernuns which is pretty much a retelling of the Hogwarts Years from Hermione's POV. It is a character study primarily and focuses on Hermione's friendships and such. It is ongoing is on 4th year right now.

If you don't mind femslash, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28159545][Hermione Granger: Tomb Raider]] by Artistia is an Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider AU. It is marked as Fleur/Hermione, but aside from sexual tension, it is pretty devoid of romance. There is a kiss due to spy stuff but not much else. The focus is on the action and plot. Pretty good world-building.

Lastly, if you don't mind crossovers, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20618525][Uncle Bobby]] by GatherYourStrength is another good Hermione-centric fic. It is a crossover with Supernatural, but you don't need to know anything about Supernatural to follow it. It deals with the fallout of Hermione removing her parents memories.

I hope you find something you enjoy!

#+begin_quote
  Redirected and rebranded, the Death Eaters have dismantled and destroyed everything the Light holds dear. With their society on the verge of extinction, Hermione is the only one who can fix the future. At least, that's what she keeps telling herself. Armed with plans, lists, books, and a house elf, she won't stop until things have been set right. But what will happen when she doesn't arrive at her intended destination? Will her plans to work alone still hold water? Or will she sink among the endless waves of memory and regret?

  Bobby and Hermione finally meet. Secrets will be revealed. Relationships will be built.And a trip to Australia is definitely in order.This work is meant to follow a series of letters between (primarily) Richard Granger and Bobby Singer. It may help to read at least the last few from 1997 and 1998 to get an idea of where this is starting.

  Less than a year after the battle of Hogwarts Draco Malfoy disappeared. 6 years later, Hermione finds him again in South London having completely abandoned the wizarding world. But he's not the boy she remembers: Long hair and covered in tattoos, he appears to have developed a penchant for drugs and heavy metal music. And why on earth is he running a muggle bicycle shop?
