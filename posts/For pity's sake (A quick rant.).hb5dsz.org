If you are going to write about a will (be it the Potters' or otherwise), for pity's sake can you please bother to /get the basic terminology right?!?!?!/

- *Bequeath* is a verb. You bequeath your belongings to somebody. This lamp was bequeathed to me.
- *Bequest* is a noun. It is what somebody has left to somebody else. The lamp was a bequest from my grandmother.

If I have to read one more fic where somebody talks about "the bequeaths in the will" I shall... taunt you a second time, I guess.

This rant brought to you by "/In it we detail our true bequeaths to our dear loved ones..."/

That inheritance through magic points at it being an inherently magical language.

Since they have no hands, snakes must write in parseltongue using eitter their fangs, and you'll have the symbols look like a bunch of points, or their tongue, and the script would look simillar to cuneiform, I guess. That's just me having fun, anyway.

When surnames reached british culture a couple of hundred years later they assumed it was his surname (they had no idea that Salazar was a family name) and mangled it badly in the way that was regrettably common in medieval times so it came out as 'Slytherin'

But, just as occidental wizards steered clear of Christianism, Arabic wizards probably did the same with Islam. After all, Islam isn't any kinder to magic than Christianism. Wizards don't seem a religious bunch, and the beliefs they have are tied to magic rather than gods. That said, Abd Al Salazar Ziauddin becoming Salazar Slytherin is pretty good.

******** Well, he was alive at the back end of the tenth century, from a part of the world then under the rule of what by then had become the Caliphate of Cordoba since the mid 8th century. He was from a high enough status family to actually have a surname - surnames were far from universal back then, even in the lands where they were a thing - and the opposition of religion to magic was even less universal back then than it would be at the height of the witch-panics of the 15th-17th centuries. It's by no means certain that he was a muslim, but it /would/ give a convincing back-story to a name like "Slytherin" /and/ an origin story for the values of Slytherin house. It's quite easy for the 'greater jihad' - ie self-improvement, to put it in modern, non-theological terms - to be read by later, non-muslim minds as 'ambition' and a chap from a minority people wracked by conventional and guerilla warfare with the caliphate going one way and the Franks coming the other would certainly value guile over brute power.

**** Or, like, their tails?

I'd say if parselscript exists, then it was a human invention by Parselmouths in the past. And if so, then it either isn't part of the gift or a weaker part of the gift, as snakes don't write.

A Parselmouth might be able to learn it quicker, but I don't like it when it's an equal part of the language. Additionally, I like it when Parseltongue has words that don't have a true meaning in human languages, which humans can't really understand because of the species difference, but parselmouths can, that makes the "parselscript as encodings" more plausible, as any learned parselreader wouldn't be able to get the true nuance of the thing they are reading. Additionally, that would add an element of "first language" to parselmouths (the notion that every parselmouth's first language is parseltongue, to the point that they think in it), which I like.

** Even with the proper verbiage that's an awkward sentence. A tip to all beginning writers, read what you write out loud. It might make sense in your head but if you stumble when you say it others will likely stumble when they read it.

** TBH, in the UK (so, where most of these fics are set...) we don't tend to talk about "bequests" or "bequeathing." It might be said once in the will - as in "I Sirius Orion Black leave the following bequests to Harry James Potter/bequeath the following to Harry James Potter."

But Harry wouldn't then talk about his "bequests" or what he was "bequeathed." If you're speaking colloquially about getting something in a will, you'd say it was "left to me" or "I inherited it." So it really gets on my tits when Harry is saying to Hermione or Ron or whoever "Sirius bequeathed (or bequested, if the person writing is particularly irritating) me Grimauld Place." No, he'd say "Sirius left me Grimauld Place" or "I inherited Grimauld Place from Sirius."
