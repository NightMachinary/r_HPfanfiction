  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** Well, I could offer my WIP:

linkao3(23003536)

linkffn(13514676)

It hasn't been uploaded in a while though, because first, I didn't have time and secondly, once I finally had some time to write I focused on my other fics. I obviously will continue it though -- just not sure when.

Outlined up to year six.

  When Lavender Brown's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion, no one quite knows what to make of it. Except for Harry, who firmly believes that it should have been his name coming out of the Goblet and thus vows to help her get through the tournament alive...at all costs.

** I'm not sure what you'd consider 'rare', but Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider has Petunia-Sirius and Crazy Little Things has Hermione-Luna (that actually works and is well developed!). Links below.

** linkao3(Petunia's Letter by mzzbee) and its sequels, but I don't think it would be appreciated by the standard teenage readership of fanfiction, it is more mature (and I don't mean excessively smutty) reading, because it is about infidelity and people who do bad things and they know it.

  Seven years after the fall of Voldemort Harry doesn't know what to do with his life. His love life, and everything else, is an absolute mess. Everyone around him seems to be moving ahead with their lives but he isn't moving. Eventually he finds someone to remind him of things he has forgotten and things he treasures. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
