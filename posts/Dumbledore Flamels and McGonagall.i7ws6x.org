Is there a fanfiction where Harry is raised by either Dumbledore, Nicholas Flamel or McGonagall? I have already read Home, The Lady Thief and Harry McGonagall, but I didn't find what I was looking for even though I loved the concept. It should also end with Harmony Harry/Hermione. Thanks in Advance. Every recommendation is highly appreciated.


** Raised by the Flamels: Birth of a Phoenix (no pairings)

Mentored by the Flamels: House of Potter Rebuilt (no pairings).

A mix of the two (because time travel): I'm Still Here (Abandoned before pairings iirc). From Ruin (I don't remember if there's a pairing)

  Complete. No pairings. Twin:Harry. Fatally ill Harry runs away for years only to return when his twin brother needs him the most. Being discovered he starts to crumble to his illness. Includes Character Death but that isn't the end for him.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

*** Thank you so much for the recommendations. I just wish that one of them at least was Harmony. I just hope From Ruin by GraeFoxx is not Harem. I just can't imagine it that way. I will add them to my list straight away for sure.

  AU Lily and James Potter give up their eldest son Harry in favor of their youngest son, Jamie Potter, the supposed boy-who-lived. They come back to get him from Petunia years later but to find that Harry Potter was far away, living another life. They want him back but will Harry (Cadmus) come to accept his real parents who left him?

** The Flamels become mentors in the Travel Secrets series by E4mj (cleverly called Travel Secrets: First, Travel Secrets: Second, and the unfinished Travel Secrets: Third). linkffn(9622538)

It's a time-travel, so Harry doesn't really have a relationship because he's mentally older than the children around him, but he had one with Luna before he went back.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
