** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Daft-Morons]])

Your title should be the description of this fic. At least for the 50% (way too much) of it that i've read. I'm not sure whether the author is cognizant of this fact though.

***** I knew a guy who was exactly like the MC of that story. Except he didnt try to justify it like the author tries.

The whole Lord-trope and acting high and mighty based on blood is the type of bullcrap that gets me raving mad.\\
It reflects on the fact that apparently the "Magical World" of the HPU never went through anything similar to the Enlightenment.

Or it reflects on the fact that Britain is a shithole full of Snobs :D

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Skitterleap linkffn(Skitterleap): Harry is generally abrasive and not all that good, but he keeps charging through tanking everything in his way.

The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): Harry has totally been changed by the future in this fic, such that he is more brutal than in any other fic I can think of. He blows off Voldemort's hand at one point, and when he comes back with a silver hand like Pettigrew, Harry says "I liked your hand the other way: it was more satisfying to look at."

The Darkness Within linkffn(The Darkness Within): Harry is pretty much rude and assholish to everyone except maybe Voldemort. Even by the the third book, he never really gets along with anyone except maybe his brother, and nobody is shocked when he might do something really evil (or they believe it so easily).

Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?
