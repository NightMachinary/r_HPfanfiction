Looking for Dumbledore/male character fics. Grindelwald is fair game as long as it isn't smut where he shoves his massive dick up Dumbledore's ass. And please, I beg you, not Albus/Aberforth goat sex.

The only slash fics I've ever are Harry/Voldemort. Read pretty much all the good ones.


** The only one I've ever read is Partially Kissed Hero. I'd... not recommend it.

** Kinda post-relationship but you might enjoy [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]; it's a long term correspondence between Albus and Gellert during the latter's incarceration at Nurmengard.

  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

  Harry finds himself in 1957 with new powers. With a job at Hogwarts, he makes friends the with adults from his youth like Albus and Minerva, and deals with old enemies. This story has action, adventure, humor and romance! Slash scenes are well marked.
