I think it was a one-shot meant as a setup for a longer story. Lily was a parselmouth, but hadn't let anyone know. She left Harry a bunch of vials containing memories of her reciting bedtime stories in parseltongue that were, IIRC, stories of her family history.

*** It's a good story, but not the one I'm looking for. Thanks, though.

*** Does this one have an evil Dumbledore or Dumbledore bashing? Because I'm absolutely sick to death of those two tropes and I absolutely refuse to read a single word of those kinds of fics!

**** Unfortunately yes the fic I linked has the evil Dumbledore trope but that was the only one I knew of that applied to OP's request for the most part. I can't remember what fic it was but Dumbledore & Snape both had horcruxes so they can abuse Harry it was so bad it isn't even funny.
