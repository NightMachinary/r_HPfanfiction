** If the Ministry had responded competently to Harry's news, instead of sliding into bumbling fascism that tied the Order's hands while enabling the Death Eaters', there wouldn't have been much to write three more books about. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4487319/1/The-Greatest-Minister-of-Magic][Here is a short fic]] that shows what might have happened. linkffn(4487319)

*** Pretty nice. Good ending, makes you wonder how many times fudge has tried. I liked it despite only reading for a minute XD

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11645676][Divided and Entwined]] linkao3(11645676) Fudge believes Harry, though his response is arguably worse than it was in canon. There's no bashing, slash, or overpowered Harry.

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** So...in order:\\
1. Fudge brings an Auror escort instead of a dementor, to take (the alleged) Barty Crouch Jr. into custody and also to investigate the suspicious death of Cedric Diggory.\\
2. Questioning reveals what Harry Potter experienced; Cedric Diggory was killed by a killing curse from a man Harry identified as (allegedly) Peter Pettigrew, whom he had encountered once before, one year ago. Said man performed a ritual to create a creature identifying itself as Voldemort, who then summoned several people dressed in Death Eater robes and masks, et-cetera et-cetera...\\
3. It's a tall tale (especially where Harry duels Voldemort and survives), but Prior Incantato on Harry's wand reveals the Priori Incantatem's occurrence, there's a corroborating witness in Barty Crouch Jr, and Cedric's autopsy can confirm that he was killed by a killing curse. Plus, optionally, veritaserum and pensive memories.\\
4. Fudge doesn't necessarily believe that Voldemort has returned, but he's convinced that the homunculus claiming to be Voldemort (and the man who created it) are dangerous enough as is; the DMLE sets out to investigate who Cedric's mysterious killer really is, and whether several high-standing members of society really did Apparate to that graveyard that night (and if so, if they were under some form of mind control similar to the Imperius as claimed in the last war).\\
5. Subsequently, Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts, instead of being marred by Umbridge, is a mystery much like his second year, where an unknown attacker is preying on the student body, threatening the school and distracting Dumbledore and co. from Death Eater activities. Harry himself is drawn into investigating the assailant behind the attacks, possibly finding proof of the Death Eaters going to recruit the giants or the dementors or Fenrir's werewolves or et-cetera.

** Something I always find odd is Crouch Sr. says, in Dumbledore's memory of Crouch Jr's trial, that the Ministry knew Voldemort survived (presumably because the lack of a corpse). In which case I have no clue how anyone went along with Fudge's quackery. There were Ministry wizards looking for him abroad in Albania...

** It sorta happens in linkffn(8045114)

NB: The writing gets a lot better as the fic progresses. The Dumbledore characterisation is sub-par, but it's not bashing (Just sometimes needlessly withholding information).
