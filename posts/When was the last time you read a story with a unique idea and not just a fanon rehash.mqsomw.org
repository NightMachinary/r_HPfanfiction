A few recent posts have me thinking about this and i genuinely can't remember a story that caught my attention properly. Someone said that hpfanfic is now mostly fanfanfiction or just the same plot points reused constantly. I almost exclusively stick to crossovers now as they have to be different by their very nature. I understand it's all down to personal taste but i am curious about others opinions on this.


** For me, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). It's practically an original story

*** I second it, the Pureblood Pretense and its sequels are excellent. Though notably, it does draw a /lot/ of inspiration from another series of books (Alanna the Lioness, as the description states). Not having read that series, it does feel quite original - but I don't know how people who've read that would feel originality wise, at least at first ;)

**** It stills feels very original even if you have read the Alanna series. Though a number of aspects are clearly inspired by characters and/or general plot lines from the Alanna series, it never feels like an Alanna rehash in a Harry Potter world.

****** They probably don't link it because it's an actual book series by Tamara Pierce, and not a fic. I suppose you can probably find a bootleg of it somewhere, or just the library. But Alanna (IMO) is basic when compares to the Protector of the Small quartet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30091791/chapters/74116098][Dream of Hades]] linkao3(30091791) - 10k, ongoing - post-war, Ginny accompanies her family to a party at Malfoy Manor and gets mysteriously trapped there

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

I had already read /Professor C. Binns: A Personal History/ but the others were new.

I didn't much like /Still Standing/. I started it but it never clicked with me.

That said, /Bindings, Bindings/ was really good and I am caught up and subscribed to it and am eagerly awaiting new chapters.

/Bad Education/ was hilariously fantastic and I also subscribed to it and can't wait to see where the story goes next.

I will start /Dream of Hades/ later today. I've not read Draco/Ginny before so this could be interesting.

** I think my vote would go to linkao3(Sing a requiem) where Hermione realises that Harry is a horcrux in 6th year and horrified that he's so accepting of martyrdom, kidnaps him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore with Ron's help.

Harry's journey from a groomed child martyr to finding self-love and discovering that life is worth living and fighting for, /that he's worth it/, his friends' horror and anger on his behalf is very very touching.

Especially in a fandom that fetishizes child soldiers and martyrdom and that what happened to Harry in canon was not only good but necessary, this story is a breath of fresh air. I haven't read its like before except /Stages of Hope./

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

  Hermione Granger and Daphne Greengrass go head-to-head in this courtroom drama exploring the complex realities of a post-war wizarding world grappling with the best way to prevent the rise of another Dark Lord. Join these advocates as they fight for and against the Protection of Children Act (POCA) - a law that seeks to separate muggleborns from their muggle families. #Experimental

My other fic, Boy Who Lived, ended up getting a lot of attention from the get-go, so I decided to make that one the priority and I know how that's going to end, so it's easier to write for.

MvM is a messy one because while I have the next two chapters mapped out up to the end of the Prosecution's witnesses, I'm still not quite crystal clear on what exactly I want to do from there on. I have a few ideas but nothing is quite right and tbh, I haven't devoted as much time to it as I should have. *ducks for cover*

** linkffn(7713063) *Elizium for the Sleepless Souls* - One of my all time favorites. Captivating, keeps you guessing and keeps you wanting more.

That out of the way, we have all to agree that after all these fanfics all these years, people who want to write something new, get inspired from already written fics. Most of what we call "tropes" and "cliches" today were innovative some years ago. I have read over 1000 fics, read almost every cliche and trope a lot times and i enjoyed them all. You can read a cliche from 10 different authors and you can still like the cliche. Ofcourse when you read something out of the ordinary is a great and enjoyable happening BUT you can't ask for much from an old fanfiction community. Imagine if you were following LOTR or SW fanfiction things there are worse far worse. We need to be happy for what we have gotten from all these people and stop "nitpicking". When the majority of us read a fic for the first time, we most probably read a H/G indie op and we enjoyed every last bit of it (I use that just as an example think nothing more on the pair/genre), but after a long time you get bored you search for the next thing and the next thing, until there is no more the next thing. To conclude and sorry for the long post, HP fiction is old, oversaturated and we should be thankful to people who keep writing fics for this community so that we can keep "scratching" our fiction spots.

** linkao3(17541269) is fascinating. After the Battle at Hogwarts the world has ended and reconstructed anew. There are no more wizards - there are mutants. Every mutant has one special power. Hermione makes fires. Tom Riddle is an empath. Grindelwald can stop the aging. Harry has the Imperius Curse.

People (only those who were at the Battle) start remembering their past lives but not at the same time. Harry is the first one to remember - he was around 10 when he did. The story starts in a facility - normal people caught Harry (he's 14) and other mutants and hold them there. Tom (he's 17) kills Umbridge and gets them out of there. Tom doesn't remember much because of horcruxes.

The whole story is just wow. Amazing. Gripping. Their duo is brilliant. I love it.

** Are you looking for a story that completely abandons the school year structure and goes off on a different journey?

I feel like I might be shilling this one a bit much, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist]]) is very good.

In a somewhat similar vein, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]) is also nice.

I really liked linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy]]) once it stopped being so angsty, but it hasn't been updated since 2017.

That's just off the top of my head, but if I went over my favourites list on ff.net, I could find 20 more original stories.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][Living with Danger]]

AU, first in the main Dangerverse series, now complete. Lone wolf. Dream-seer. Bright child. Scarred child. Singer. Prisoner. Dancer child. Dragon child. Eight semi-ordinary people. One extraordinary family, and how they became one. Pre-Hogwarts story.

It's the first in a series that is honestly absolutely brilliant. A definite favourite of mine that I have gone back and read multiple times.

Starts pre Hogwarts but the series takes them all the way through Hogwarts and the war but in a way I have never read similar since.

** Looking through fics that came to my attention relatively recently...

linkffn(13260989) is an alternate tournament.

linkffn(12352826) also tries something new.

linkffn(12285319) is a quick one-shot resolution to the Battle of Hogwarts.

I don't know how linkffn(7069833) came to be, but I'm glad I found it.

linkffn(13331054) is not actually a cross-over, but it's novel.

linkffn(13052802) is the sort of crossover that doesn't require TR background from the reader, which is good because I don't have any.

linkffn(5766648)

linkffn(13828136)

linkffn(13504635) has an unusual choice of protagonist.

That might be (one of) the reason why. I read almost exclusively rare-ish Hermione pairings and I'm a sucker for enemies to lovers tropes, so I enjoy those stories and they don't feel rehashed since (good) authors will have to find a convincing plot to force the characters to interract enough for feelings to developp and situations to change :)

  Cast out by the Dursleys during a horrible childhood, Harry washes up on an unknown island. Stranded with another who had been thrown away by her family, the two of them build a new family with a small group of intelligent creatures. How long can they stay alone on the island with so many unknown threats and people that are out looking for them?

Also on the same site is debstheslytherinsnapefan story The contract as well as her other stories. Just be aware I am not a fan of dumbledore because I couldn't get past the fact he left a toddler on the porch in November and didn't talk to petunia face to face about her sister. As well as other issues with him in the books so my favorite stories do reflect that.

** I know what you mean but I often also discover new unique fics which I absolutely adore. I mainly read slash though. But here are one of my favorites. I highly rec them

I loved Death of Today Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]]) Full version is on ffn. The one posted on ao3 (wip) is the edited version. Very interesting premise. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics. You have to get a bit used to the name at first bc Harry is called Izar in this. Basically Lily had an affair with Regulus Black (to gain knowledge for the order) and Harry is the product of this. He was raised in an orphanage. A brilliant plot.

Summary: Orphaned and having no tolerance for Muggles, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by both the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. His loyalty, however, is not to the Ministry nor to the Death Eaters, but to the cause of bettering himself and becoming his own force in the Wizarding world. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment

Of course, the Second String by Eider_Down is also brilliant and very unique. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]])

I absolutely loved this fic. I can't even describe how much. Worldbuilding is brilliant, I love how much depth is brought to the characters - OC's and canon. I simply adore it. story is really engaging, I read it in one go - in other words I started it in the afternoon and it was six in the morning and the sun came up when I decided that I'd have to at least sleep a little bit and as soon as I woke up I finished it.

Brilliant fic in which Dudley moves in with Harry bc his parents want him to work for Grunnings and he needs a place to stay bc he wants to go to culinary school instead

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23036404]])

Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle. Time travel. Shouldn't work. But works perfectly. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278]]) If thems the rules

While not complete yet, one if the best fics I've ever read in terms of worldbuilding and political aspects as well as characterizations of (OC's and known characters alike)

summary: Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

Drarry, Running on Air Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550]]) Summary: Draco Malfoy has been missing for three years. Harry is assigned the cold case and finds himself slowly falling in love with the memories he collects.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816]]) Away childish things.

So fucking good. Great characterizations

Also Drarry Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19903207]]) Very very unique. Cool take on indian!Harry

Summary Seven years out from the war, Hermione comes to Harry with a way to undo the lasting damage done to the Wizarding World, and save those once lost. The catch is, only Harry will remember anything differently. When Harry wakes up in the world where Voldemort never came to be, he'll have to navigate the life he never lived as if he'd been there all along. Except, a version of Harry was there all along---and he may not be so easily overridden.

  “What do you say? Are you in?”A brief moment passed as Dudley looked down at the mug of tea- and then, smile widening, he looked up. “Yeah. Yeah, I am.”A small hand met a large one, and Harry and Dudley shook hands for the second time. Harry felt the same swooping excitement he'd felt when he'd handed off the money to Fred and George for their joke shop. This might be a disaster, but it would most certainly be interesting. “I hope you like Indian!” A clatter on the steps, and Hermione entered the kitchen. She frowned, looking between them. “Is there something going on?”“Dudley's moving in,” said Harry. “Did you get samosas?”

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19264552?view_adult=true][Play me like a lovesong]] was the most recent one I read that felt completely fresh. It's Minerva McGonagall/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, spanning a few decades and with a lot of queer history thrown in. Don't bother with the first two stories in the series, they're nowhere near as amazing an you don't need them to understand what's happening - although you may find yourself reading them afterwards because you just want more.

In general I find that fics with adult characters feel more fresh, because they move away from the Hogwarts years we all know so well. Saras_girl has some great Drarry ones that explore different (non-Auror) careers, I really enjoyed the Restaurations series (and Turn is a classic of course). Grow Young With Me also has adult Harry with a very different plot than most other fics I know (it's long, bu tnot finished). These are not quite as different and new as Play me like a lovesong, but maybe still interesting enough for you.

It follows an SI who spent her life trying to stay the hell away from the clusterfuck that is magical Britain, and had her own offscreen adventures in the background. Now it's 1991 and she is being dragged into the plot of the books, but bringing her own mess with her. I have high hopes for this one.

  After a few too many hard knocks in early childhood, magic has turned Harry into a tough, twisted, somewhat impaired and very ugly version of himself with a severe speech defect.Magic is also going to help him learn how to kick everybody's backside.This is the tale of a Harry who has learned the hard way that adults are fallible and that he will have to rely only on himself, and his long, slow journey to a very different life than the one Dumbledore had in store for him. The lessons he learns are not the ones most adults wanted to teach him and the family he ends up with is not the one Dumbledore set him with.This story is written in a very sparse style and chapters are very short. The longest chapter is still less than one thousand, five hundred words long and the beginning chapters tend towards five hundred words.

  Mess with power and you get what you deserve. Bilia Stevens had nothing left to lose when she took the wand, stone and cloak, so if she could meddle with time and space and gain eternal protection from death, why wouldn't she?"Send me where I can do the Wizarding World the most good," she said, as a sop to Fate, but it was Death that laughed in her ears as she tumbled into the nasty little bedroom of a nasty little man.Well, Bilia Stevens wasn't all that nice herself, if it came to it.This is the tale of a paperwork marriage that turns only slowly into romance, and of conversations held over tea and home-made jam while the war rages on outside of Bilia's new home. It is a tale of manipulation, plotting, and trying to change time to the advantage of the Snapes above all other people. It is the tale of Severus Snape finally finding a witch who knows who and what he really is, and who is entirely on his side, always.

** Two of my favorite series are:

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, by The Carnivorous Muffin. “As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.” [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]]

Incredibly detailed. Lily is an amazing OC, and I love this series. The author is incredibly talented. She's also written several spin-offs and AUs of this book, and some with crossovers into other worlds. Some are of Lily and some are of Male!Harry and Canon!Harry, and some are centered on other side characters in the series.

The Pureblood Pretense, by Murkybluematter. “Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.” [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

So far, there have been four books, with a fifth soon on it's way. The writing gets stronger and stronger with each book and the series is incredibly detailed, with a lot of world-building. It suits both audiences, both male and female, and is acceptable for all ages, but has a very serious take on HP and the world. Several people have written fanfiction about Murkybluematter's series, and that's a very powerful thing in itself and a show of how well loved the series is.

Both stories are about “Fem!Harry,” but the main protagonists are more of an OC than an extension of Harry Potter himself. They both have their own take, and the writers are very professional and devoted to their work. And they're very, very creative.

Some other good fics I enjoy:

Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux, by the Imaginizer. “In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.” [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux]]

This goes into a little more depth of why Harry survived the Killing Curse, and offers an explanation other than just “love.” In an effort to save her son and in an act of desperation, a totally sneaky, powerful, clever and BAMF Lily Potter experimented on Harry to keep him alive, messing with soul magic and paving the way to Harry becoming an accidental Horcrux. Harry begins to dream of Tom Riddle's memories and eventually the dormant piece of Tom Riddle sleeping inside his head awakens. Tom is completely dark and totally in character with how I see him, and incredibly selfish, but his bond with Harry and his mentorship of him is something I love to see and it's written very, very well here. I love this fic because it's about a well-meaning but morally grey Harry Potter, and there is no Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, or Weasley bashing. Harry is neither completely light nor dark, and it's written very tastefully. It's rather hard to find a good and well-written fic like this that doesn't bash Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys or Dumbledore, and I love it all the more for it. The story acknowledges both the flaws of the characters as well as their strengths, and it's not OOC at all. Very well-written, and very in-character with how I see everybody.

Bullseye, by Ohyeah100. “Astoria Greengrass's war was never black and white. Sometimes you can make them love you, but you can't ever make them fear you. Political drama and Slytherin hijinks abound. Draco/Astoria.” [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11247748/1/Bullseye]]

This is an Astoria Greengrass centric fic. We never really got to hear about her in canon, and all we ever knew her as was Daphne's little sister and Draco's eventual wife. Despite the story having a romantic pairing, it focuses mainly on friends and family, and the mindsets and thought processes of Astoria and those around her. It's very well-written and a completely original take on Astoria. After reading this piece, I don't think I could see or imagine Astoria any other way. Also, Belladonna Lestrange is a treat and she totally deserved to be canon.

Renatus, by frozenbeans. “His name is Professor Riddle, and at least for now, no matter who you ask, nobody knows anything more. Professor Riddle, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher.” Golden Trio Era Professor Riddle AU] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14655447/chapters/33857754]]

The story is private and you have to have an account on AO3 to read it. It has a Hermione/Tom pairing, and it's a Tomione story, but it's very good. Voldemort sends his younger self to teach at Hogwarts during the events of fourth year and in light of the Triwizard Tournament. Tom takes the Golden Trio under his wing, particularly Harry and Hermione. Using logic, he slowly corrupts some of their morals and we get grey/neutral Harry and Hermione. All of the golden trio are written well here, and so is Tom, and we eventually see Tom turn his back on Voldemort despite only being “an extension of himself” and a Horcrux.

I haven't read this story yet (though I plan to), but I've heard only good things about it and maybe you should give it a try:

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, by Less Wrong. “Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.” [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]]

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** The reason everything feels rehashed is because almost every possible idea for how Harry's seven years could go has been done. There's tons of original and unique stuff, but most of it is either PostWar or hard AU. Or a crossover of some sort. It's basically impossible to do a fan fiction of the actual, core story of Harry Potter that feels original, and part of the problem is because people have been writing AUs and divergences for it since before the series was even finished. You can't make Harry an animagius, no matter what you have him turn into, because it's all been done, often multiple times. And even if you come up with a unique animal, good luck including it into the story in a way that hasn't been done before. Harry's been paired with literally everyone, and also no one, so any romance feels cliché. You can't involve time travel in any way, or freeing Sirius early, or having Voldemort come back different or early or even never, because it's all been done. That's why I don't really care about originality anymore, because the novelty is less valuable than the quality. I would absolutely read a cliche-filled rewrite or soft AU that was well-written.

If anything, the fanfanfiction has some of the funnier and better quality content in it, because we've reached the point of parodying ourselves and being meta-aware of the meta-awareness. At this point, it's just half the fandom indirectly arguing with the other half of the fandom via stories about whether or not Alan Rickman and Tom Felton are handsome enough to overlook the fact that Snape and Draco should both be set on fire and thrown nuts-first through the veil. And I'm honestly okay with that, because it's a pretty funny conversation. And because it's obvious that they do, half of you are completely delusional. And that's okay. It's okay to be */objectively wrong./*

And even that's really just speaking to the broader division of "The People Who Read The Books From The Start" and "The People Who Watched The Movies First."

Sorry, Tom's a great guy I'm sure, and Rickman was a great actor, but Snape isn't redeemable and Malfoy tortured people with the Unforgivables and literally hung out in a rape dungeon in the last book. Severus Snape doesn't canonically look like Alan Rickman, he looks like Rasputin from /Anastasia/, and all the mountains of soggy romance and Postwar-Hermione-As-A-Self-Insert-Banging-Snape won't change that. He also wasn't nearly that even-tempered. I'm half-convinced that some people have literally never even read the books at all.

Besides, at the end of the day, it comes down to this. We all know Rowling completely screwed up the series, and most of us are pretty clear on the obvious problem points. What Rowling did wrong is pretty well agreed upon at this point. Who else is there left to criticize and lambast at this point but */ourselves?/*

** Let's see, a long time ago I read the "Unbroken Universe" - at least part of the way - which was intreresting.

Another was an interesting stable time loop fanfic series. I forget a lot of it now, but what I mostly recall was that Remus Lupin was involved and it might've been Lupin/Snape? I also recall the author took it down from a lot of places, /but/ the fic had been on the author's Yahoo Group in PDF form and I had long since downloaded the files, so they're stashed somewhere on one of my hard drives.

There was another big fic-verse, centering around Harry encountering Sirius as a dog, dubbing him "Midnight". IIRC this ended up going the distance through Seventh Year.

A good post-HBP fic I read once involved Harry, Hermione and Ron portraying themselves as the "Trinity"; it's the fic by the same name written by Katling. The big twist here was that Dumbledore faked his death

Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** I've been really enjoying linkffn(Loose Cannon) , still ongoing, a post-Battle fic, which really explores the character growth, larger society and new (?) forms of magic.

Definitely a fun read!

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** "to be human". The MC is an OC (Lena lestrange, daughter of Bellatrix) the plot of the book happens, but it's more in the background, and the writer expands the lore with original ideas and new themes. It's more of a story about the characters interaction and I'm all for it. Voldemort is much better character here, more compelling than just "the bad guy". Another thing that enhancing the story is the writing. It's just so much better than most fanfictions it's astounding. It's my favorite fanfiction ever, and I recommend it whenever someone asks here.

** I'd like to think that the fic I'm currently writing is unique. I wouldn't say it's a unique idea, and that it doesn't have tropes in it---because that's kinda the whole point of my fic---but I've been told a few times that my fic is original. It's basically a time travel fix-it fic with a crap ton of tropes in it (Slytherin!Harry, Independent!Powerful!Harry, Lordships, and Grey/Dark!Harry are some of them) but so far I've managed to twist the tropes and cliches into something new and different.

whilst it's based off lord potter it is a very unique story with great world-building and is unlike any other lord potter!

linkao3(The Lost Horcrux)

also another great and unique story

  Harry Potter is thought dead, killed at the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione suffers the horrors of a forced marriage, to a Ron seduced by the lure of power. Trapped in this dystopian nightmare, Hermione's last fading hope is to somehow ask Harry to rescue her on his Deathday. Finally, after 5 years away, a hideously scarred - but beautifully alive - Harry returns to grant her wish.

** Here are some I like that are not rehash, hope you like them.

This one is Remus/Tonks but goes fairly out of canon and it's honestly my favorite HP fic, has really good worldbuilding. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13033279/1/Human]]

McGonagall/Elphinstone Urquart. Love this one, has Harry raised by McGonagall and her husband. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14741748/chapters/34080912]]

McGonagall steals Harry and seeks help from her family. I love, love, love this one, it's incredibly funny. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10870578]]

Muggle-borns freaking out Prof. Lupin with movie monsters. Very, very funny. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12663362/1/Boggarts-and-monsters]]

HP/Sherlock, I don't even watch Sherlock but I really love this one. Has Harry raised by others trope and he goes to Hogwarts but he solves everything differently thanks to John's and Sherlock's influence. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic]]

DADA teacher Harry. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531]]

This one is out of this world, really knocked me out, left me wanting more. Has time-travel. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

This is a sweet one. Snape and Hufflepuff House. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11062798/1/Snape-Head-of-Hufflepuff]]

Dudley realizes how shitty he and his parents treat Harry. Harry and the Dursleys. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero]]

Muggle AU, Deaf Remus/Sirius. Very sweet. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25351300]]

** If you have run out of originality in fanfic, I hope I can endeavour to mitigate that. Let me give you some recommendations.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom - recently updated - is an AU of Voldemort winning the First War and him having a relationship with Harry other than mortal enemies. It's perhaps one of the best fanfics to ever be written. Highly recommend.

Limpieza de Sangre - complete - is a fascinating AU with a Female Voldemort that is a little bit of a tragedy, but it's amazing anyway. Quite original with Voldemort's backstory. Highly recommend.

Victoria Potter - not abandoned, but updated very slowly - has all-around great world-building, magic, and characters. Even if you've not read fem!Harry before, you'll still love it, I promise. There is a ton of originality here.

The Slow and Silent Ways of Fish - seems abandoned but I hold out hope - is a wild AU of Voldemort kind of winning the First War and Harry being taken in by some sort of Goddess-like figure. Not everyone's cup of tea, probably, but I highly recommend.
