Okay, so the prophecy says "and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.". What if the similarities between Harry and Voldemort were more than skin deep? It is said that Tom Riddle was a remarkable, well liked student with a silver tongue and good marks all around. It's also implied that he was magically powerful for his age; Dumbledore notes that he was already practicing wandless magic at the age of 10 if not younger.

On the flip side, Harry only has what, 2 friends, does the bare minimum to succeed, and hasn't even tried to deliberately do wandless magic. The "But he had to deal with Voldemort every year! He couldn't focus on his studies on that hanging over his head!" excuse only really works if you ignore the fact that Tom Riddle was going to school during WWII; that's got to be at least as distracting as a magical terrorist.


** Unpopular opinion, but I've actually always appreciated the fact that unlike Riddle, Harry wasn't an especially gifted child in any particular way. He was inferior to his destined foe in every single manner, from magical talent to willpower and wit. But it was his large circle of friends and mentors, who loved him, supported him, and were willing to lay down their lives for him, that ultimately helped him defeat Voldemort. Cliched as it is, it was indeed due to his ability to love (and also his unwitting charisma and strength of character) that he was able to build this powerful support network. I think that's wayyy more fascinating (and probably realistic) than the idea of an overpowered caricature of a young protagonist going against another overpowered caricature of a villain. Just my two cents.

EDIT: Also, echoing what has been said in this thread, I don't necessarily view this as a “moral” stance either (although Rowling most probably did), but rather a more mature discussion on the sources and manifestations of power. Harry was prophesied to be Voldemort's equal, but power comes in many forms. Harry was able to defeat Voldemort because he was able to amass powerful allies whom he didn't have to intimidate, threaten, or make false promises to ensure their loyalty. He befriended the outcasts, lay down his lives for people he barely knew, and charmed the asses off of his teachers. It's a bit crass to say this, but kid was out there (unwittingly) networking, and damn was he good at it. Brute strength is overrated, anyways.

*** I'm afraid to say that Harry defeated Voldemort by sheer dumb luck, as McGonagall says. Harry scaped Voldemort over and over again because he's the protagonist and due to Deus ex Machina, not because he has good mentors or friends...

Moreover, what allows him to do with the ability to love?

Spoiler: Nothing. And his network was the friends of his father, the Weasley family and Hermione (basically)

** It's worth remembering that prophecies are notoriously open to interpretation, and it's just as likely the line "and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal" means that Voldemort will view Harry as his Worthy Advesary, or something of that nature, rather than Harry being able to stand on an equal footing to Voldemort when it comes to magical combat.

** I think it's cause JK wanted the "power he knows not" to be love. Or at least moral superiority. Voldemort has decades more experience, more intelligence, more supporters etc. Heck voldemort was probably more powerful than harry when he was the same age simply due to how much time he spent studying and growing as a wizard.

Harry is still an impressive wizard on his own, being able to fight off experienced adult death eaters. But, they are nowhere near Voldemort's level. The one thing harry had that Voldemort didn't was a good heart which was the source of his love that allowed him to beat Voldemort. He had absolutley no chance from any logical standpoint. So JK capitalized on his goodness (Dumbledore stating the power he knows not being love something voldy does not have).

** The 'moral take aways' of HP kinda rub me the wrong way through out the entire series, honestly. Ambition and cunning is the trade mark of Satan. Rape drugs are jokes. Lethargy and the desire for even more lethargy is shown as an inspiring trait in Harry. The whole crap with the Elder Wand, yet another excuse for lethargy. The blind eye to the Dursley abuse. List goes on and on. Even in the context of a kids story its....

Harry Potter is an exciting story. It keeps us hooked. But the world, the elements of the story, once you analyze them... they are just skeletons upon which the actual story should have been built. I learned not too look into it so much. This is why I prefer HP fanfiction so much more than the actual canon.

** It seems as though JKR realized just towards before the start of HBP that she'd written herself into a corner. The Prophecy says Harry is the only one that can beat LV, but she spent the entire series having him dick around and not learn anything. So she created the Deathly Hallows as a cheap deux ex machina that allowed Harry to win, and removed any reason for Harry Potter to actually need to learn how to fight. Pathetic.

I can't think of a less dramatic or exciting finish to a story than Harry Potter. It would have been more epic if he had pulled out a 9mm and put a round through LV's eye, honestly, and would have made as much sense as that absurd "wand ownership changes every time someone hits you with an expilliarmus".

*** I honestly was okay with it at the beginning. Harry should have seen a pattern after second year and started seriously training, especially when he thought Voldemort right hand man Sirius Black was after him. But I can excuse that because he did spend time learning an OP spell. And I can excuse fifth year since Harry was spending a lot of time tutoring students.

But I don't get why he didn't train durin his 4th year. He should have been panicking being a 14 year old in a tournament meant for 17 year olds. But he mostly waits till the last moment to prepare for the tasks. He could have looked up past tournaments and trained skills that were important in those.

And sixth year bothers me even more, he is now aware that he is fated to fight Voldemort. He had just seen Voldemort and Dumbledore duel and was aware that he was hopelessly outclassed, but instead of preparing he spends his time obsessing over a book and Draco.

****** I totally agree that Harry should have done more, and learning more out of stress is a legitimate response to being in the tournament. However, I also think that what Harry actually did in canon isn't that ridiculous, from a psychological perspective. Avoidance is a really common stress response. It's not that weird that he would just not want to think about it. Studying for the tournament (and honestly, having to deal with voldemort all the time) is a huge undertaking for a 14 year old. Frankly, it's overwhelming. The kind of thing that you look at and think "I have no chance. There's no way I could possibly do that, so why bother trying?" So he ignores it, and does things to take his mind off of it, until suddenly he has only days or hours and is like "shit, I'm gonna die" at which point he frantically crams. Not the smart thing to do, but a common and understandable emotional response

** While at first glance it seems that Harry is not really Tom' equal when we look deeper it isn't quite that simple. Yes, he had only two close friends, but when he called everybody he knew for the DA petty much everyone believed him about Voldemort, even though by this point between the closure of the chamber of secrets (that must have be seen as suspicious for the rest of the students) and all the prophet's slander by all rights they had no reason to believe in him, this show's that while he isn't really close enough with everyone to the point that theirs interactions become plot-relevant he is in good standing with the students population as a whole. Tom Riddle in the other side, while being charismatic and managing to fool a big enough portion of the student-body didn't really have close friends (or friends at all), he had people who would follow him because he was talented, powerful, in good standing with the faculty and could convince this people to do his bidding using his charm, they would hear him and mostly follow his lead, but no one would actually stick with him if he asked them to go with him in the same kind of life-threatening situations as Harry, while Harry himself had two close friends who not only agreed, but insisted in going with him.

Yeah, Harry seems to be magically and academically inferior to Tom and, truth be told, maybe he really is, but when we pass this to combat abilities we can see that it's not nearly as direct as it first seems, mostly because in a true fight it's not only a question of who can do more spells, all that matters is being able to put your enemies down and guarantee that they won't get up, the situation in which Harry did this with Voldemort are questionable, but the fact is that in the other fights he was in he actually managed to do very well, defeating adversaries that by all means should grossly outclass him in spell repertoire and experience. From the beginning we knew that it would never come to a competition in magical abilities between Voldemort and Harry, Voldemort was a prodigy during his Hogwarts years and then went traveling collecting even more skill in this period, plus contrary to Harry he wasn't limiting himself on the type of magic he learned, even if Harry has learned the DA the fact is that at this point he would take much more than only seven years to catch up, and Dumbledore teaching him would only result in Dumbledore having less time to do more to help in the war, Harry had good teachers and the material he would need to learn to pass onto more advanced magic would be the same with Dumbledore that he would learn with the other professors, I suppose that Dumbledore could teach him things he wouldn't learn in Hogwarts, like alchemy, but really, not much in battle application. I, like petty much everyone else in the fandom, like to criticize genius/super Harry stories, but the truth is that if you want to have a one-on-one straight fight of magical ability between Harry and Voldemort this is petty much the only circumstance in which it would be possible without making Voldemort so weak that there would be no conceivable way of him not having been killed before.

** If Harry won through intelligence, through power, through hard work, through any of the ways that you apparently want him to win, it would have completely gone against the theme of the book. The theme has always been love. Love is THE theme of Harry Potter. Love is what saves Harry. Love is what allows him to defeat Voldemort, it's what saves him from death numerous times, it's why he succeeds. Harry Potter is a children's book series. If you think it's too dark in the later books to be, go and reread some children's books, because they heavily feature death. Harry Potter is essentially a fairy tale. If you don't like that, then you can go read another book series, like A Song of Ice and Fire, or whatever. You can even read and write fanfiction that changes this. But stop castigating the Harry Potter series for being what it was suppose to be.

​

Again and again, the series points out that being smarter and stronger is not what is important. The entire premise of the series is that there is a secret society of magical beings living parallel to our own that have powers we could never dream about. Routinely, they show that muggles are completely powerless against magic. But in real life, we, the readers, are muggles. In this world, we would be powerless against them. They could the Imperius curse against us, modify our memories, completely destroy us. But they don't. We are immediately set up to want to root against this 'Might makes Right' that Voldemort espouses because if it's true, then muggles, us, are doomed. We have no defenses against magic. We'd be doomed to slavery or death.

​

And this is not the only time power and intelligence is cast as less important. Dumbledore literally talks about how his brother was infinitely wiser than him, as he was able to see what Gellert was from the start, while Albus, despite being much smarter and more talented, was blind to it, and that this caused the death of his sister. At the end of the first book, right before Harry confronts Quirrel, Hermoine, being used as the mouthpiece of the author, literally says there is more to life than intelligence. And the main storyline of the series, about Harry fighting Voldemort, is literally about how a young, mildly above average wizard is able to defeat Voldemort again and again, despite Voldemort being smarter, more powerful, better trained, older, and more experienced. Why? Simple. Love. Love is the reason why Harry succeeds. Again and again. Because people should not win because they were just born smarter, or because they're more powerful. Good should win. As I said, Harry Potter is a fairy tale. Stop asking it to be something it's not.
