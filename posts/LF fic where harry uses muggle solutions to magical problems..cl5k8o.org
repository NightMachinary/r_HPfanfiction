** Starfox5 has stories like this, if you're not looking for Harry specifically.

There's a oneshot here linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11638812/1/]])

  What if, in fifth year, Harry did just that? An independent Harry story with some OOC, no real bashing, but not a big fan of some of the big players. No pairings. Rating for some curse words. First attempt at publishing on this site... we'll see.

** Linkffn(So How Can I Weaponize This?)

Hey, let's use Lumos and a lasing crystal to create magic freakin laser beams!

Riddle diary? Let's dive him mad by using the diary as sketch pad for drawing obscene images.

Lake adventure? Let's have my flying van deliver a boat with scuba gear I stole from the US coast guard.

Voldemort? Sniper.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
