I've read the sacrifices arc and am working on the Dangerverse right now. :)

linkffn(sacrifices arc) linkffn(living with danger)

Thank you for any recs!


** I think "Resonance" by greengecko might be around that mark, including the two sequels. Third story is abandoned, but was winding down by that point so you're not left entirely high and dry. It's AU, Harry is the main character, interesting use of magic, mentor/parent figure Snape.

Edit: yep, definitely over 1m words

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.

  Family isn't everything, as Harry, Snape, and Draco discover in this sequel to A Year Like None Other. How will a mysterious mirror and a surprising new relationship affect a father and his two sons? COMPLETE right here on AO3!

  #+begin_example
      This story follows Canon Books 1\-5 and an alternate sixth year\. HBP never happened\. Instead, A Year Like None Other, available on this site, took place\. You're advised to read that first before starting this story, but in case you need the Cliff Notes: Harry got adopted by Snape, Draco turned to the Light, and then Snape adopted him as well\. The Dursleys all died except for Dudley who lost a lot of weight and found his heart with the help of a talented therapist\. So, Harry's got a father and brother now, plus a cousin he can stand\. Lucius Malfoy died and turned to stone, and is currently installed at Hogwarts as a piece of statuary\. Remus Lupin is currently impersonating Lucius Malfoy courtesy of some specialised Polyjuice Potion Snape developed\.Since Year was started before HBP came out, some other things in this universe differ from canon\. In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died, but Pansy Parkinson did, and Theodore Nott went to Azkaban for murdering her\. Draco is younger than Harry, but only by a few days\. I'm sure there's more but that's what comes to mind\. Just remember, nothing that we found out in HBP necessarily matters in this story\. And now, on with the show\.

** linffn(4098039)

1,3 million words spanning one year. Incredibly well-written and character-centric. Canon-compliant up to OotP and bits of HBP. Is quite slow in places.
