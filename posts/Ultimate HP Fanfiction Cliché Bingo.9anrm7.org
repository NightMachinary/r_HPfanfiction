[[https://i.imgur.com/2xMtG9x.jpg][BINGO]] featuring the most prevalent tropes in the community.

Some authors can make /some/ fanfic clichés work, but the ones I've seen end up anywhere from mediocre to awful. Needless to say, if a fic manages to hit five in a row, then you know for certain that it's either really bad and/or a guilty pleasure.

Please rec any fics that win Bingo and fall under the So Bad It's Good category.


** Pretty good! I think "Draco in leather pants" is more tropey than Tom Riddle, but okay. "Daphne Luna, Tonks & Fleur harem" should just be "Harem". Why just that particular combination?

Also there's a distinct lack of "magical creature animagus" and "soul bonds / mates". Maybe also worth it to include "Harry & wandless magic" or something like that.

Is there an online version? Maybe I'll try it out for the next fic I read ;)

Edit: I'd also cross-out the "Reincarnated" in Master of Death.

Yes. Do you think he explicitly just wanted it for Voldemort? Meh. I'd still argue that it should be "Draco" then, because it's difficult enough to get a Bingo.

For example I would have also crossed off the "Molly's love potion son-in-law special" if it's a "Potionsqueen!Ginny" scenario, because it's the same idea.

*** To be honest, I wish there were more fics with the "death eaters have a point".

Of course, I've yet to come across one where they still aren't written as sadistic terrorists, which rather undermines any "point" they may have.

I'd love to read a fic where the situation is more nuanced and it isn't just dumbed down to "dark wizards (?!)" and "sadistic bigots". I especially hate that Voldemort is always "evil for the sake of evil" or is born that way.

On that note, I'm pretty sure this is in canon as well, but wtf is the deal with torturing your followers? And why would they follow someone like that...? More of this "evil for the sake of being evil" bs.

Like, I get it, the Canon books were intended for children, but why do people carry on this childish idea of "good vs evil"? Would be so much more interesting if there was a story with fleshed out politics and ideologies, where it's acknowledged that morality is subjective, where there's more going on than "hurrr durrrr, muggles bad, we terrorist, crucio, crucio, avada kadabra!!!"

Am I the only one who feels this way?

#+end_quote

"Genocidal hatred of muggleborns, wizard Nazis" is in itself cartoonish.

The NSDAP (Nazi party) wasn't built on blind hatred and genocide, the German people had real concerns and real grievances. And as much as people don't want to admit it or acknowledge it, Hitler and his party - for all their many faults and morally dubious social policies - did in fact raise Germany out of the biggest economic disaster any country has ever seen into a world power.

For ethnic Germans, Germany was actually a great place to live in the pre-war years, so much so that Austria enthusiastically welcomed Amazon l annexation in what was called the "war of roses".

Furthermore, it's well documented historically that Jews were peacefully deported to Palestine with their wealth intact in the pre-war years: what happened to the Jews that remained during the war in the concentration camps is definitely immoral and a tragedy, but was nonetheless a hasty and unplanned reaction to having a population that can rise up and revolt during wartime. The Holocaust wasn't planned or executed until the war started going badly, which of course doesn't take away from the immorality. But then again, the USA killing half a million poeple with nukes is also not moral, but is justified as an action during wartime.

Before anyone gets their panties in a tizzy, no, this isn't an endorsement of Hitler, who is of course responsible for a great many evils and a huge loss of life. Hitler is very bad and the vast majority of his racial ideas were completely lunatic. He thought Aryans were super humans from a magical island, for God's sake. I'm not saying he's a good guy.

All I'm saying is that history and politics is not so simple as "oh, these Nazis are just evil and want to genocide".

And of course, the Death Eaters as portrayed in canon would be very hard to justify, which is why I hate their whole premise. They aren't just cartoonish because of their masks or whatever, but their actions and beliefs as well. Real people don't act like that.

/Edit/- some people seem to be construing what I wrote as some sort of defense of the Nazis. No, it is not. All I want is human villains.

It's easy to have a Hero fight against pure evil. It's much harder, and rewarding, to explore the human element and the struggle of both the Hero and Villain(s) in a dynamic world. Having a Hero stand against blanket, blind bigotry, sadism, and supremacism is easy. I don't want to keep reading about easy villains, I'd much rather have a truly engaging and exploratory story.

****** Do you have sources for peaceful deportation to Palestine with their wealth intact ? Living as a german in pre ww2 was only good as long as you didnt disagree with Nazis. While a lot of people welcomed the Nazis in Austria, the previous government had banned them. There was supposed to be an referendum and the austrian chancellor thought that a majority would have voted for an independent Austria. The referendum was then canceled because Germany just annexed Austria. Afterwards they integrated Austria in their booming war economy and the referendum the Nazis set up didnt have secret ballots, so a lot of people were afraid to vote against them. I also have never heard about the term war of roses in that context but maybe that is just not used in german. Nazis introduced a lot of legal discrimination against jews so its pretty hypocritical to claim that the Holocaust was just an unplanned counter-measure against a revolt.

Also, the Nazis did persecute Jews and other minorities from the beginning. Anti-semitic rants appear in the first chapters of Mein Kampf. Racial hatred was at the core of their movement, and Hitler planned from the start to conquer Eastern Europe for the German race.

The idea that real people don't act as the Death Eaters is wrong. Real people did act exactly like them. The Nazis took over Germany by force as soon as a coalition made Hitler Chancellor, and then used oppression and violence to consolidate their power - they never got a majority of the votes in free elections. And as far as torturing their own goes - there was a bloody purge of the SA rather soon after the NSDAP took power.

********* I responded to your comment.

Hitler was not planning to start a World War: he did not expect the Great Britain to declare war and keep fighting. The idea of "lebensraum" was thrown around by the Hitler and the party because in WW1, Hitler noticed that German agriculture was lacking and insufficient, when hundreds of thousands of Germans starved due to English blockades.

That's not to say Hitler didn't mean for there to be conflict. He did have plans to expand Eastward, towards the Soviet Union, and reclaim traditionally German ethnic lands which were taken after WW1 as a consequence of Versailles, such as the port city of Danzig (than in Poland) which had an ethnic German population of over 90%.

And yeah, wartime policies aren't infinitely sustainable, I agree, but then again, the US has been in a perpetual war in the middle East and the industrial military complex is massive here. We're somehow cobbling along.

******** I never said the Nazis liked the Jews or that they were fair across the board. You seem to think I'm defending the Nazis - I'm not. Remember, my comment was in the context of talking about ideological motivations and "cartoonish" villains. All I was trying to show is how you don't need to oversimplify things and dehumanize people to make a compelling villain or force to fight against. The Nazis were human, just like the Communists, just like every person across the globe.

Yes, Hitler wanted to consolidate power and purge Strasser and the more true "socialists" from his party. Like, again, I'm not advocating or defending for Nazism lmfao.

It's much more interesting to me to explore the motivations, the history, and the tragic outcome of their actions without just writing them off as evil bigots. That's not intellectually honest or simulating, and doesn't make for a compelling story - which is why I made the comment about having less ridiculous enemies in Harry Potter. I didn't say Harry should ally with them.

It would be very interesting to write a story where there are several human characters on both sides, and explore their rationale, growth, reasoning, and struggles with their beliefs and the consequences.

Instead of writing interesting and three dimensional characters and fleshed out political theories, we get the same old evil, bigoted and one dimensional Voldemorts, Dracos, etc.

Maybe I should write a fic like this.

No man, your are the one who doesn't get it.

"Racism" is not an ideology. "Bigotry" is not an ideology. "Murder" is not an ideology.

Now, let me be clear: the death eaters, as portrayed in canon, might as well have an ideology of solely racism, bigotry, and murder. But this is a fictional, cartoonish Boogeyman intended to give a clear evil for the main character to destroy. Voldemort, and his death eaters in canon are like Sauron in Lord of the Rings, who doesn't really have any political or ideological goals to speak of but just wants domination for the sake of domination and murder for the sake of murder.

My whole point is that *people aren't like this*. I mean, yes, there are some outlying psychopaths, but to think that an entire nation just decided "hey, let's gas the Jews and start WW2 because we're bigots" is fucking ridiculous.

People have nuance, and ideologies have nuance.

Communism caused - directly or indirectly, whatever you want to argue - the deaths of millions of people and the impoverishment and ideological oppression of millions more. Communism is not predicated on oppression and murder. It is a political theory, one of many. You can make the argument that it will necessitate these things to keep it alive, but the people who believed in Communism weren't bad people just for holding that ideology.

Now, for some reason it's perfectly fine in modern discourse and fiction to theoretically separate and deconstruct ideology from history where Communism or European imperialism is concerned, but when the same is done to national socialism, suddenly it's whitewashing and the person doing it is a Nazi themselves.

And using murder for their goals? Please, you can't be this naive. If that's your criteria for evil, then there isn't a single political system or ideology that is exempt, because everyone who has the courage of their convictions is willing to use force at some point when threatened.

Every single nation and successful movement has a history of "using murder" at some point in their formation or establishment. Every single one.

Now, JK Rowling did mean for the Death Eaters to represent the Nazis. But let's be real here - JK Rowling isn't a very nuanced thinker, she certainly isn't a historian or a political theorist, she is a children's author who is a product of her times.

Like whatever, maybe you just want an endless parade of fics where Harry is fighting an endless iteration of canon Voldemorts, of Saurons, these limitless sources of evil, with no discernable goal but rape and pillage.

If that's what floats your boat, more power to you man. If that's the way you think about the world - if you just divide it into an easy binary of good and evil, don't let me stop you.

What did you do, Goggle it lol? Yes, antisemitism was indisputably part of Nazism, just as it was part of hundreds of countries before Hitler. You can hold these beliefs and not want to rape and murder, you do realize this, right?

And this was only a part of Nazism. The whole Herrenvolk shtick was undoubtedly ridiculous and unscientific, but you have to look at it in the context of the times. It wasn't thought up because they wanted to exterminate every other race - although I'm sure there were some who did, like Himmler - but because Hitler and the Nazis were very focused on preserving their in-group, their nation and their people. In a way, these beliefs were as much a product of love as hate.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The Nazis didn't act like that. Like it or not, they had broad popular support. Undoubtedly, they had their brownshirt tactics in the beginning due to the extreme political polarization and economic situation, but even thuggery and intimidation is a far cry from terrorism, rape, torture, and murder. On the latter point, the majority of deaths that can be attributed to the brownshirts came as a result of street fighting with the Communists. They certainly didn't just show up in a town square and start looking and shooting.

Again: the death eaters as portrayed by Rowling are not written as humans under the sway of a harmful ideology. They are written as all being extremely racist, extremely bigoted, extremely psychopathic evils who lack any sort of moral compass.

You tell me to read about Nazi Germany, which is absolutely laughable. I've certainly read more books and texts on the 21st century and Nazi Germany than you have read blogs and WSJ articles with your Google searches.

Yes, you can follow an ideology without murdering people - but that doesn't mean "Aryans are the Herrenrasse and Jews are parasite on the Volkskörper" isn't an ideology.

Yes, the Nazis had popular support - so had the Death Eaters. Snatchers, Ministry employees, Daily Prophet journalists, House Slytherin - lots of people supported the regime.

What you seem unable to admit is that Nazis were humans. They mass-murdered children, tortured slaves, orchestrated genocides, denounced their neighbours as traitors, etc. - and then went home to their family and were loving parents. Or engaged in sports and hobbies. Pursued their dreams.

In HP, we see the Death Eaters from the perspective of their victims and enemies. That doesn't mean they are caricatures - we don't see their private lives. But they are mass-murdering scum, nuanced characters or not. Just as the Nazis were humans and mass-murdering scum.

************** I'm not even going to bother responding to you. You are incapable of looking at history objectively, and the history you do know is Hollywood, comic book bullshit.

Insulting me and saying I want to "whitewash" Nazis (whatever the hell that means) is fucking ridiculous. I'm a Jewish Slav myself, my grandfather fought and killed the Nazis, the Nazis were massacring my people. The fact that you're spewing all this bullshit to me is just inconceivable. If I was transported back in time, I would be gunning Nazis down left and right, you dick. Stop it with these accusations.

The Soviets, the Americans, every fucking empire and ideology had people that killed and then went back to their families, because they fought for what they believe in. I can have the intellectual honestly and maturity to honestly analyze history in the context of the times and the people without being a fucking Nazi, mate.

I can tell talking to you is pointless. I've read a dozen books on this time period. You haven't read shit. I'm done talking to you, this conversation is obviously not going anywhere productive now that the ad hominems are coming out.

*********************** Historical fiction? Propaganda? Well, I guess you would think so, given your views.

Citing original sources is what Janusz Piekałkiewicz did in all his books - first he quoted all the original sources, then he wrote what actually happened.

And a thousand pages? That's really not much for WW2. Beevor's "The Second World War" got 880 pages, and that's more of an overview than a detailed approach. I liked the book, but it was really more of a refresher, nothing that made me go "Oh, I didn't know that." For that, books focused on smaller parts of the war are much better.

(Not to mention that a fifty year old book has to be taken with a grain of salt - a number of archives weren't open to historians at that time. Hell, back then, people still believed that the Battle of Midway was decided because the US strike arrived in the few minutes the Japanese planes were changing bombs for torpedoes on the flight deck - in reality, they didn't spot their planes on the deck, and that took two hours. The "window of opportunity" was hours long, not minutes.)

And I'm not saying they didn't pass "discriminatory" laws against Jews.

** I kind of like the "lemon drop" meme and "Hadrian" though :/

I don't know, "Harry" is just a bit of a lame name for a Hero. I mean, there's also Harry Dresden, but he's got a cooler last name....
