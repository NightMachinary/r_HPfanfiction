:END:
After the fiasco in the Chamber of Secrets for some reason (details are hazy here) Harry gets resorted into Slytherin from Gryffindor. I remember all the Slytherin's except for Malfoy were showing him the utmost respect with that fanon Slytherin attitude to Parselmouths while Harry just wanted to be left alone and hang out with Ron and the twins. It was on Ao3, Wood tried to get him an exemption to play for Gryffindor, Blaise was the one who explained the respect for Snake-speakers, and the first couple of chapters were rather long and descriptive for something that was starting after when all the exams would usually be taken. Oh! And Snape might have been shaping up for that Mentor!Snape trope so...pls help me :)

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much. COMPLETE, sequel to come.
