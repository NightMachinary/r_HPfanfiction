Other than his hubris, I can't think of anything.

was also thinking of his influence being taken from him. the hardcore death eaters get killed (which is tough enough to do, but easier than killing voldemort himself). and some others get swayed to another side, or start believing there's "another way". and idk i haven't thought this through

if im remembering right, in What Lies Beneath, harry [[/spoiler][can defeat him through a combination of luck and having inherited his memories and skills]]


** I feel like getting rid of all the Death Eaters would only hinder him slightly. Lord Voldemort is simply an incredibly dangerous and powerful wizard; having Death Eaters was a convenience to truly take over the country, but he could still wreak untold destruction upon Britain if he was alone. With no Dumbledore, I'd even say he might manage to literally kill every wizard in Britain if he set his devious mind to it. That's how dangerous he is.

As for ways to defeat him: your best bet, I think, would be to sway the Dementors. A Dementor's Kiss could still destroy Voldemort's soul even if his Horcruxes were still intact, and they're immune to Voldemort's main weapons (direct curses), though it would still take some effort for one to get to him. For bonus points, Harry could also breed a Basilisk.

**** Of course, they /do/ get along rather well with Voldy, since he's the only man since Ekrizdis who just lets them suck the soul of just about anyone but his soldiers. I never said convincing them to betray him would be /easy/. But they're also very opportunistic; they switched their allegiance back to the Ministry the /moment/ Voldemort disappeared, and gleefully mind-tortured the Death Eaters who were there allies a few weeks earlier. If the Order can find some incentive for them to betray him, the Dementors would do so in a (metaphorical) heartbeat. Or at least, I'm convinced /some/ of them would --- perhaps "younger" Dementors who didn't exist yet during the First War?

For the record, they're not talkative, but they /can/ canonically talk somehow (they voiced their discontent with Dumbledore to Fudge, for instance, and repeated Sirius's muttering "He's at Hogwarts").

******** That's the one. It's not completed, but Voldemort /is/ defeated (not dead, though).

It /is/ from Hermione's perspective, but in all honesty, her gift has led to her being a rather different person from the canon Hermione, so depending on what annoys you about her my Parselmouth Hermione may not annoy you at all.

*** I have to disagree there. If the magical world got properly organized, they'd wipe the floor with Voldemort. After all, this is close to what happened in canon. The final part of the battle always seemed anticlimactic to me because Charlie and Slughorn show up with the cavalry and take down all the Death Eaters in minutes--and that /after/ everyone thought Harry was dead. Even without Harry's sacrificial protection, I think they still would have won because as powerful as he is, the Voldemort we see in canon couldn't stand alone against an army.

**** At the end, Voldemort was fighting McGonagall, Slughorn, and Flitwick (IIRC), they weren't making any headway, but when Bellatrix died, he just casually knocked them aside. And, that's with Harry's sacrificial protection in place.

** Apparently according to canon, you can use the Goblet of Fire to create a binding magical contract that would kill a signee who breaks the terms of it. "I am not Tom Marvolo Riddle or Lord Voldemort, and I do not seek the death of Harry Potter."

Toss in his name, and BAM, he dies.

** I assume this entire conversation works ignoring horcruxes. The answer is he can't do it fairly. He can however do a hundred underhanded things. If you want the whole 1v1 hero and villain showdown then Harry has no realistic chance. There is nothing however that stops Harry, for example running Voldemort through with the sword of Gryffindor or even Molly Weasley's biggest kitchen knife from behind under his invisibility cloak.

Finding Voldemort in such a situation would be harder but not impossible. There is, nothing other than legality and morality stopping someone imperiusing a death eater to commit the act. There is a chance that Voldemort's legilimency would let him see it coming but I would believe a story that has Voldemort too arrogant to believe such a thing possible. Another option, would be a house elf, Voldemort's breakfast and something from Snape's cabinets. Maybe Voldemort was a potions prodigy back in his day and could create any antidote and might carry around a beazor but surely there are nasty enough things in the wizarding world that you can't be safe from all of them?

**** I doubt Voldemort (if he even needs to eat anymore) let's anyone prepare his food. He probably makes copies of existing food and conjures something to drink.

** Horcruxes do not grant physical immortality. You can still kill the body before you deal with the wraith. Therefore you want to kill him as fast as possible.

Harry gets a sniper rifle and takes him out from distance. Voldemort does not know anyone's gunning for him = no shield.

Harry uses the invisibility cloak and a poisoned dagger/Sword of Gryffindor to stab Voldemort in the back.

Pretty much any form of physical attack with no reaction time would do the trick, either coupled with stealth from the cloak or range to avoid tripping Voldemort off.

** Has anyone noticed it is always Horcruxes then kill him, shoot him or something and then while he is off resurrecting you have ages to kill the soul anchors.

** Run with the idea in OoTP that Voldemort cannot stand the presence of powerful emotions relating to love. So that when he attempts to take on Lily's sacrificial protection in GoF it kills him.
