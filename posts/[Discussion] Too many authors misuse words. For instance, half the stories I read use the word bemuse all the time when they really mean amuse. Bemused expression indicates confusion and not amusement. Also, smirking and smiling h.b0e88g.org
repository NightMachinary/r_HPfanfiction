Not so much misused words, but I'm particular about name usage. Some authors aren't consistent or use names that aren't fitting to the story. I.e. Harry calling Malfoy "Draco" even though there's a ton of animosity between them, Harry calling Hermione "Granger" even though they are friends and there's been no falling out, etc. I have more pet peeves with names, but these types of things are closest to your topic.

Is this a British only thing? Because I have literally only ever read this sort of thing in Harry Potter. All the US books I read and in my US life people are always first name, even people who don't like each other. Like in school I hated a girl who bullied me all the time and I still called her Jessica, not her last name. She called ME my first name too.

So yes is that just a British thing, last names to indicate formality or unfamiliarity?

****** It is a thing - more among guys than girls - but a lot of my friends (we're c. 10 years younger than the potter crew would be) still refer to one another by surnames. I think the origin is often in sports teams when your surname would be printed on your kit, so that's what your teammates would call you by.

It's also definitely more prevalent in public (fee-paying) schools. Although I know that's never really addressed, Hogwarts fits the general public school mould so this would make sense.

Both, I think. They call each other by last names as a form of detachment. Like, "we may be classmates, but we're not really friends. We may be co-workers, but we're not friends." Harry, Ron, and Hermione call each other by their first names because they're good friends. The others in Gryffindor are similarly familiar--they all live together. People they barely know and those to whom they are unfriendly are still addressed by their last name.

Unfortunately, a lot of fics turn that around into, "pureblood custom and manners say you're not allowed to call me by my first name until I give you permission." Oh my, what a faux pas.

**** Yes, but it's a historic British thing.

A couple of centuries ago, in polite society, you'd only address close friends and family by first name.

Boarding schools tend to be highly traditional, so some have adults address students by surname (with or without title dependent on the level of respect they feel students deserve).

Harry using "Malfoy" is probably intended to evoke this aesthetic. (Draco calls him "Potter" first.)

High society is also highly conservative socially, so Slytherins using this system of address might be commentary on their aspirations or Draco's influence over them or just an attempt to make them seem less friendly.

**** 70 years ago, everyone in British schools would have called each other by their surnames. And in adult life too, to a considerable extent. It slowly died out over time, but continued on longer in more traditional schools (actually, they probably still do it). Hogwarts is of course based on that sort of traditional school.

So no, it's not really meant to convey animosity. Using first names indicates a bit more familiarity, but using surnames isn't particularly unfriendly.

What part of the US are you from, cause as a fellow american i've had the exact opposite experience. I'd say about 40-50% of people I knew growing up were referred to exclusively by last name, my self included. It also had nothing to do with level of friendship or animosity, like me and some of my best friends who i've known since i was 5 years old and am set to be a groomsman at his wedding next fall still mostly refer to each other by last name.

It took until graduate school where I was with an entirely new set of people and didn't feel like I could introduce my self by my last name that people started calling by my first name. Tbh it's still kinda weird to me.

So when they're in public, it's surnames, whether in the third-person narrative or dialogue, I keep it lined up because that makes it easier to show that in ‘this scene' their relationship is formal, then for private, more intimate scenes, I will use first names for both dialogue and narrative. It's hard, but I think it makes the story and setting of scenes easier for the reader to follow.

**** I suspect this is a bit of bleed-through from more expressive forms of media (like animation/manga/comics) where people necessarily have larger, more exaggerated reactions. If you remove the random hand gestures people normally make, most normal, emotionally neutral conversations people have are very boring in terms of physical action, and subtle actions don't convey well to non-visual media. I think it's a necessary evil of creating physicality within something so abstract as writing.

Of course, I might be biased. I have aphantasia, so I /literally/ cannot imagine the words on the page as real scenes. Shuddering, extreme blushing, blanching - those terms convey to me only an emotional intensity; they don't actually make me see someone have an unrealistic full-body reaction like some people might imagine. It therefore doesn't bother me as much.

The Anti-Smirk, The Sneer

Pudding is Dessert. The Wizarding World's children are not constantly being fed that horrid stuff with lumps in it that was still warm on the tray in Middle School in the US. They have a delightful array of various sweets to choose from.

Waggling their eyebrows. Unless it's a special Wizarding skill, most people can't, or at least don't frequently, waggle both of their eyebrows.

Expelliarmus isn't a knock-back spell. It is the disarming spell that at times can cause a knock-back effect, but too many people have it tossing people around right and left while nary a wand goes missing.

Oddly specific: One fic I read had the term wanking being used as a descriptor for something being glaringly obvious or hard not to notice. "When she turned her head, the book was wanking at her from atop the table." type of thing. Maybe it's simply a variation of the term I'm not familiar with, but I've adopted it into my vocabulary.

**** So actually I didn't realize how much controversy apparently existed over this word! I guess it depends on whether you're being more linguistically liberal or not?

As the dictionaries that provide the second definition explain, it really has one original meaning (derived from Latin and coming about around the late 16th century). But eventually in the 20th century people were mislead enough by the “non” prefix that they incorrectly assumed it meant the opposite and the mistake became so common in the english lexicon that they just also sorta included it (which i actually also find to be a really interesting decision). But i wouldn't quite agree that the word has two equally well accepted and opposing definitions? Otherwise, they wouldn't need to specify “informal, North American”.

Though maybe if even Obama has used the word incorrectly in his public comments I can't be /that/ picky? Especially if its an ESL writer, as someone pointed out.

** The thing is, English is not a set language. There are no hard and fast rules with English like there are with other languages. There is no singular overseeing body who determines how words get used and how they should get used unlike French. It's a language that is constantly mutating and evolving. There are some general guidelines that make it way more readable, but the thing with English is that its linguistic anarchy. The only reason there are accepted conventions and definitions of words is because enough people have decided that that's the way a word is going to be used that that's what it means. Take "literally" for example. It's meaning has mutated over the years. Same with "ironic" (none of the examples in the song are actually irony, but now it's an accepted definition that unfortunate coincidences are irony).

This is why we do not speak the way people spoke in the 19th century, or even in the 1950's, or even a decade ago. That is applicable to all languages. Also, there is no governing body that regulates languages. In every country new words are being added to the dictionaries --- if they are used enough times in print --- every year. English is in fact a linguistic anarchy compared to French, but not because of this. English has no rigid rules when applied to word creation and usage. You can make a noun into a verb, you can add a Latin prefix and a German suffix to the same word at the same time, etc etc. English is just much more flexible grammatically.

My point it is, however, within the topic of this thread. Meaning: because English is an evolving language, fanfic writers still cannot choose what the words shall mean on a whim. Especially if it's counter to what the dictionary says.
