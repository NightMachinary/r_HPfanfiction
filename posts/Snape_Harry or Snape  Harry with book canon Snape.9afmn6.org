** These are all Snape/Harry, and all contain explicit sex.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/69622][Sadness of Eros]] by LoupGarou Grotty sex. Harry encounters Snape via a glory hole in a gay bar's bathroom stall early in the fic. Harry's also cheating on his wife, so YMMV. Has some hilarious scenes with Harry's kids when the whole Potter family goes to visit Snape. Frankly, Harry is an asshole in this fic, and I love it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/69544][Death and the Open Mind]] by LoupGarou Does Harry have PTSD, or is that Snape in his head? Very funny fic that lays waste to Harry's friendships.

[[https://geneticallydead.livejournal.com/289555.html][Yearning]] by geneticallydead The author never transferred this fic to AO3, so it's only available on LiveJournal. You have to click for the next chapter at the bottom of each section. Snape has been underground for 10 years when Harry realizes they probably buried him alive. So they dig him up. (Not a horror story.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/752763][Kestrel]] by lomonaaeren After the war, Snape makes a living as a designer of magical prosthetics. One of Harry's sons needs a new hand. Harsh, competent Snape and grown-up, competent Harry.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2590][Reconciling Lily's Eyes]] by persepolis130 I love this fic, but it's not for everybody. It's written with a lot of deadpan humor, and Harry and Snape are both OOC for humor purposes, although they're recognizable even so. Snape is described in terms so uncomplimentary they make canon seem kind, plus he's a basket case. So is Harry. The author has a gift for writing ridiculous, gross, perversely hot sex scenes. Also, it deals with the issue of Lily head-on. No Slytherin sex gods anywhere in this fic.

** But... Book!Snape despised Harry. If he survives he'd endeavor to never interact with another Potter ever again, he could finally stop playing teacher and go back to doing something that he enjoys, preferably alone.

*** Enemies to Friends (to Lovers)+Slow Burn I believe solves this.

**** I just see no reason why Snape would interact with Harry if Voldemort isn't in the picture. None at all. Don't worry, I understand the concept of fanfiction... maybe I was hoping you'd be able to come up with some kind of scenario that would make sense.

****** u/Deathcrow:
#+begin_quote
  Snape has to rely on Harry's help to get out of/stay out of Azkaban
#+end_quote

canon!Snape would rather go to Azkaban than owe a Potter anything ever again.

#+begin_quote
  Snape has to stay in Hogwarts
#+end_quote

why? He hates it there.

#+begin_quote
  Harry needs Snape's help dealing with something related to Potions/Dark Arts
#+end_quote

Snape doesn't care?

#+begin_quote
  I mean, people write accidental forced bonding fics just to overcome the issue of the two not being too keen on any interaction
#+end_quote

Yeah, I mean, they do, but they are equally as stupid no? Just because they exist doesn't make the idea less terrible?

#+begin_quote
  Snape & Harry due to their similarities
#+end_quote

I'm intrigued. Please list some. I'll start "They both have black hair." Okay, I'm out of ideas now ;)
