Little plot bunny which I can't seem to get out of my head:

Older Harry from a bad!future uses a spell to go back in time and destroy Voldemort. He wakes up the day of the trip to the zoo and sets about carrying out his plot. He changes things here and there, gets Sirius freed, befriends Malfoy, etc. He never let's anyone know he's a time traveller, and ultimately brings the fall of Voldemort for good by the end of his third year. His objective complete, future!Harry vanishes from the timeline, returning the reigns to the original Harry.

Ten year old Harry Potter goes to sleep in the cupboard the day before Dudley's birthday. He wakes to what amounts as a dream or another reality - he has aged several years and has no memories of the past few years.

Also, magic is real, he no longer lives with the Dursley's, he's famous, has defeated an evil murderous wizard twice, once as a baby and now as a thirteen year old (13?? He can't be 13, he's only just about to turn 11!). He has a wide range of friends, who as far as Harry is concerned are complete strangers.

Harry has trouble reconciling this new reality of his, he can't quite believe everything people have told him. He struggles to understand his place in this world, and doesn't know how to live up to everyone's expectations.

Plus there's the added trauma of waking up in a body mid way through the stages of puberty after going to sleep as a child. Harry tries to recover his memories but to no avail and ultimately has to reconcile with the fact that he has lost almost four years of his life, and important ones at that.

Further still, future!Harry, who as far as everyone is concerned is this Harry, was a genius/prodigy at school, getting every spell right first time. And now here he is, having no idea how to cast a Wingardium Leviosa when he's apparently supposed to have mastered NEWT level spells in his spare time.

Tldr; Future!Harry steals years of Harry's life and original Harry with no memories has to figure out how to fill his shoes

I might have a go writing this when I have the time


** I'm interested. Keep talking.

Also, not where I thought you were going.

I thought you were going to say the badFuture!Harry's spell was just a swap, so now a 10-year old Harry wakes up in a post-Voldemort apocalyptic hellscape. Which i would also be okay with reading.

** The nice doctor lady - though everyone called her a "medi-witch" - couldn't figure out what was wrong with Harry's memory. She told him to take a day to rest and relax, hoping that things would be better in the morning. The simple meal of soup and sandwiches that they shared was one of the finest Harry had ever had.

In much the same way, the hospital bed was the most comfortable bed Harry had ever slept in. But it was not so comfortable that he slept through the sound of something appearing nearby.

Opening his eyes, Harry saw.... something. It had large ears and great, round eyes, and seemed to be wearing a hand towel or a napkin or something. It looked up at him with a mix of hope and pity, and Harry felt distinctly uncomfortable at the creature's attention.

Without a word, the creature handed a small book over to Harry, who took it without thinking. It had a brown leather cover with no markings. Before Harry could say anything, the creature disappeared with a pop.

Laying back in the hospital bed, Harry considered the book. It felt both old and new at the same time, just like everything in this strange place. The sense of deja vu that had followed him around that entire day, and which led to the other kids realizing that something had been wrong, was now screaming at him.

He opened the book, and found that it was a journal. The messy handwriting, smudged ink and all, was the first recognizable thing he had seen since he woke up in this place. The letters, the phrasing, everything about that writing was familiar.

Seeing his own handwriting in a journal he had never seen before was not the strangest thing he had seen that day. At this point, it probably didn't make the top ten. He could not help but scan the opening phrases, in the dim light of the infirmary.

"If you're reading this, then my plan worked. Our plan, I guess, since you're me. Or I'm you. Maybe I'm a you that might've been. Or you're the me that wished with everything you were for someone to keep you safe.

Well, it worked. You're safe. Let me begin at the beginning..."

The tale was as unbelievable as it was plausible. If true, it explained everything and nothing all at once. Page after page, explaining the whys and wherefores of everything he had done over the course of two years.

There were even sketches of people he had never met, but whom the journal identified as his friends and allies. Some, he recognized from earlier that day. Harry had always wanted to learn to draw, but chores never gave him time to manage it. It seems that he found the time.

An hour later, Harry closed the journal. For every answer he had found, two more questions were raised, and all of it was a jumble in his mind. Perhaps the nurse was right, and a night's sleep would help.

The next morning, Harry Potter woke to sunlight streaming in through the windows if the infirmary. He looked over, wanting to find his glasses, and saw that there was someone sitting nearby. She had blonde hair and blue robes, and even without his glasses he could tell that she was smiling at him.

"Welcome back, Harry," she said, lightly.

The journal had spent more time describing this girl than any other, so - for the first time since he arrived - Harry was ready for this person.

"Good morning," he said. "You must be Luna."

** This idea caught me on the worldbuilding of the world the time lost Harry would find himself in. Hopefully this is interesting!

Probably needs another editing pass, but this is what you get for things written quickly for Reddit.

-------------------

The nights events weighed heavily on the Headmaster as he retreated to his office. He had not wished that the horrors of war be so soon seen in the walls of Hogwarts, but he could hardly deny the effectivticty of the action. The Dark Lords soul, gathered in shredded by the Boy-Who-Lived, in front of a gathering of his supporters and opponents, under a masterful plan by Professor Lockhart.\\
The remunerations from the revelations would be felt throughout the Wizarding World for years.

The principal participant (and, Dumbledore suspected, the principal architect) of the nights events sat in his office. The Wizarding world at large thought him dead, slain ambiguously in the spectacle that put the Dark Lord to rest forever. Dumbledore should have felt relieved that Harry Potter had escaped death, but he was wise enough to recognize the reason Harry let the world believe him finished.

To finally stop Tom Riddle, Harry Potter would have to die.

Harry Potter regarded the Headmaster with a cold calculus. It was always cold with him, as if the Headmaster had done him a great wrong in the distant past. Dumbledore supposed he possibly had, although he would not remember that. He felt a pang of loss at that. He had always hopped he could give Harry a chance to be a child for his first few years at Hogwarts. Before the reality of the prophecy and Tom Riddle's efforts forced him to grow up too early.

It was not to be. It had seemed like it might in his first year, where he took to magic like a fish to water, forming an unusual social group consisting of his Yearmate Mis Granger, Ms. Tonks, a Hufflepuff 7th year, and to a lesser extent, the ever troublesome Weasley twins.

However Dumbledore could not overlook Harry's strange and inconsistent behavior, unlike what he would have expected from a child with his upbringing. He had finally brought himself during Harry's second year to peak at his mind with Legilimency, only to find the boy had fully developed, and strong, Occlumency shields.

It hadn't taken long for it to come to a head after that. Strangely, it appeared that Harry had been replaced by himself from a future timeline. One where things did not go well. Dumbledore had never been able to get much out of Harry about his previous life, but he was clearly taking decisive action to end the war before it could be started.

Dumbledore had taken that opportunity. As much as he regretted Harry not having a childhood, he was not so foolish as to pass on a chance to unload the burden of fate onto a hardened soldier, allowing him to better protect his young charges from being drawn into it.

"I guess it is time to end this" said the man in a child's body. He showed none of the grandiose bravery he did during the public destruction of the Horocruxs. Dumbledore realized that it was the act, and what he was seeing now was the true Harry. An exhausted solider at the end of a long fight.

"You'll make sure they are ok?" To an uninformed observer, Harry might have been talking generally. Or perhaps his 'partner' in Professor Lockheart. Dumbledore however, knew better.

"There will be no repercussions for Ms. Tonks, Ms. Greengrass, or Mr. Diggeroy for their parts in tonight's affair, I will make sure of it" Dumbledore reassured. "And Mr. Black should be well on his way to being rehabilitated after tonight revelations".

Harry produced a rare smile. "Good" he muttered, and began digging around in his pouch.

Suddenly Harry produced a ragged piece of cloth. The thing resonated dark magic. Dumbledore had initially be shocked that Harry Potter carried the trapped soul of the dark lord around in the old turban of his late defense professor. But with the antics that followed, he had accepted it as one of the saner parts of the year.

Even knowing its futility, Dumbledore felt compelled to check for a way out.

"Harry" he murmured. "Are you sure there is no other way?"

Harry let out a dry laugh. "None may die while the other may live". Dumbledore knew the Harry in front of him had been through much, but it was still heartbreaking to see so much defeat on the face of a 14 year old body. "Trust me, it is better this way".

Although Harry had not told Dumbledore exactly what happened in the future from which he came, Dumbledore had pieced together the prophecy had been discovered by Voldemort, and he had been left alive in order to ensure the continued existence of both of them. This grace, however, had not extended to his friends and loved ones.

"Besides", continued Harry "You examined the details of the spell that sent me here, did you ever figure out what would happen when it breaks?"

The spell that had sent Harry to this time was still active. At first it had seemed as if there was enough power in it to last several lifetimes, but as Harry took actions to change the timeline the spell strained, as if maintaining continuity of a changing time-stream was some tremendous effort on the magic.

"No" replied Dumbledore shortly.

"Well then" responded Harry "The final death of Tom Riddle will certainly push the spell to its breaking point. The future will be so radically different the connection won't survive." Harry sighed. "Best if I wasn't around for that to happen. Who knows what would happen if I was still here and the spell shattered".

Harry withdrew his wand. Dumbledore new what was planned next, Harry would retrieve Tom's spirit from the Turban, and then Tom would kill Harry. Finding a way for a spirit to kill a mortal wasn't easy, but Dumbledore and Harry had ample time to work on the issue. When he was awakened, it is almost certain his anger would result in a frenzy that the spirit would act in the way that they wanted.

Harry hesitated, and then turned back to the Headmaster.

"Can you make sure that Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger get the guidance they need?" Harry asked, making a final request. "Ron is constantly battling an inferiority complex relating to his older brothers and simply needs something unique to call his own. Hermione..."

Harry trailed off, as if merely thinking about this was painful.

"Hermione needs to establish some social interaction outside of her studies. Something besides the gossip she will get from her roommates" Harry continued, after settling himself.

​

This request came as somewhat of a surprise to Dumbledore. Harry was close to neither Ronald nor Hermione, so something was off about this being his last request.

Young Ronald had tried to ingrain himself into the life of the Boy Who Lived, but Harry had dodged this masterfully. But far from leaving him dejected, Harry had seemly organized it so Ronald fell in with a rather tough but caring crowd. Minerva had been quite ecstatic when describing how Harry had demanded that Mister Wood, the captain of the Gryphondor quidage team, take to mentoring Ron as a condition of Harry joining the team. But afterwords Harry barely spoke a word to Ronald, and indeed seemed incapable of working with either Ron or his younger sister.

If Harry's handling of Ronald Weasley had been masterful, his handling of Hermione Granger had been an unmitigated disaster. He had (rather publicly) broken her heart by declaring them no longer friends and that he wanted nothing to do with her. The poor girl had not taken well to her first friends rejecting her so. To this day, she refused to interact with Harry or speak of him. It had not occurred to the Headmaster before, but their falling out was very soon before he himself had encountered his suspicions about Harry. He did not know much about Hermione, but she was described as very perceptive and stubborn. It was likely that she picked up on the same inconsistencies as the headmaster and was trying to track them down. And Harry Potter had thrown her off the scent by breaking her friendship.

​

Still, Harry had not interacted with either of them for over a year, so it was a strange last request. It must have come from his past lives. Dumbledore spared a thought for a moment for the timeline that could have been.

"I'll take care of it, Harry" Dumbledore said, entirely in earnest. The boy was about to make the nobelist of sacrificed, he deserved to have his concerns looked after. Even if they related to friendships that happened in a now vanquished timeline.

​

"Ok" said Harry, pointing his wand at the Turban. "Let this long road finally be completed."

*** Dumbledore stared in wonder at the sleeping form of Harry Potter before him. He had seen the boy march into his death, and the deadly (if silent) battle that occurred between Harry Potter and the last remaining piece of Tom Riddle. He had watched them both perish before his eyes.

And yet, here Harry was, once again breathing. He had been exhausted, so Dumbledore had taken him to the Hospital Wing. It was easy to explain, after all, Harry was believe (but not shown to be) killed in his very public fight with the Horocruxes, so him appearing an inch from death was not out of line.

Dumbledore didn't know what had happened with the time travel spell, but he suspected it was finally completed. There is no way it would have survived such a massive change in the timeline as the death of the Dark Lord, yet all of reality has not yet seemly imploded on itself. Regardless, the connection that had held Harry anchored to his old time was almost certainly terminated.

Harry could finally live free of the demons that haunt him.

​

Harry stirred, and Dumbledore set his eyes atwinkle, ready to guide Harry back into lucidity. He then opened his eyes.

​

"Um Hello", said Harry, seemingly confused. "Who are you? Do you work for the Zoo?"

​

"The.... Zoo?" asked Dumbledore, before kicking himself. In these situations it was simply best to roll with it. "Yes my boy, I do. Do you know where you are?"

​

Harry frown , "Well me and my Aunt, Uncle, and Cousin were to visit the zoo today. I assume I got lost? Can you get me back to them?"

​

"Apricot Rhubarb Fudge" cursed Dumbledore. Things were about to get complicated.
