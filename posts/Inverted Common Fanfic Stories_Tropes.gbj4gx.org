So if you've read a bit of HP fanfiction and other fanfics in general, you'll recognize a lot of the same plotlines crop up in every fandom, with certain ones being a bit more common in others (such as arranged/magical marraiges in HP fics). I had this idea: think up common stories or elements of HP fics (time-travel, Dumbledore/Weasley/Hermione/Order bashing, misunderstood evil characters, etc.) and invert them or turn them into unique fics (or at least elements). Here are some ideas rattling around for me:

- Arranged marriage - two characters are arranged to be married via magical contract, but both are told only after its already made. So they each run away/flee, perhaps already in a relationship together even. They decide eventually to come back and force them to break the contract individually, but don't know they are contracted to each other. The breaking of the contract makes them realize that they don't love each other without the magical compulsion (or it feels different) and they have to come to terms with the tragedy (this is a Shakespearean style plot).
- Benevolent force sends character back to fix things - instead of sending Harry or whoever back to kill Voldemort or whatever, they give them another task to complete as compensation for getting a second chance in the first place, and they have to juggle two or more tasks.

  - Alternatively, make the force malicious or evil with a sinister purpose, or maybe just doing this for kicks. Why /not/ screw with the world if you can, right?

- Reincarnation - has many iterations, but how about having Harry reincarnate as Tom Riddle and Riddle as Harry Potter? Or have Voldemort's resurrection plan actually involve taking over Harry? Or Harry has to keep reincarnating as random British wizards/witches until he is able to actually achieve his overall goal, making the plotline different after each death.

And so on. So what ideas can you come up with?


** So many stories have someone go back in time to fix the mess that is canon. I wrote a silly little one-shot where a Hermione from a rather nice alternate universe goes back to fix what she sees as a problem, which winds up creating the mess that is canon.

I also wrote a story where a man and a woman are thrown together by circumstances, and even have to pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend for contrived reasons, but then don't wind up romantically involved. I told that to a fanfic group and all these writers were sputtering, “But, but, you can't do that!”
