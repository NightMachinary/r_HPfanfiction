I just read it, and I have read it through so many tears :(


** Yea, Survivor is in my top 3 of tear jerking fics.

I will just leave the other two here in case you want to keep going. I am sure you already know linkffn(4152700), one of the absolute classics in the fandom and one of the very few fics that now have more reviews than words. The other one is less known but just equally great, even if it does not seem so at the beginning: linkao3(16957743)

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

*** Cauterize was one of the first few fics I read more than 2 years ago. It is, perhaps the best written ONe-shot of all time.

I had not read the second one - and now I hate you as well,

  Waiting. He was always waiting. He'd already buried one best friend and now the other will follow. There was nothing he could do or say. There was no Harry without Hermione. Ron witnessed the beginning and now he must accept the end. HHr. 4parts Complete!
