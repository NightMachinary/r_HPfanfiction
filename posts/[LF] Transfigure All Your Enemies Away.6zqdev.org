Are there any fics where someone, the Government, the Wizarding world as a whole or just Team Harry, get sick and tired of people being evil-dark-melodramatic-angsty wizards and run a catch and interrogate team in which, if someone is found guilty, they are transfigured into some innocuous inanimate object and thrown into the proverbial basement until they are in a stable enough place to efficiently deal with them?


** IIRC, in linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5), the good guys use Draught of the Living Death to store PoWs. Possibly in his other fics as well.

I have this plot bunny that answers the question of "Why JKR couldn't have Hermione helping Harry in HBP?" My answer follows.

--------------

*Hermione:* Fine. I honestly don't think that Draco is up to anything, but just so that you would leave me alone about this, let's do something about him. We owe the prat for the Inquisitorial Squad, anyway. Lend me your cloak and that Potions book.

*Harry:* OK.

--------------

/[Next day, Harry is in the Great Hall eating lunch. Draco is conspicuously absent. Enter Hermione.]/

*Hermione:* Harry, we need to go to Myrtle's toilets right away. I'll explain on the way. We'll resolve this Draco situation right now. Also, here are your things.

*Harry:* What happened?

*Hermione:* I spent the rest of yesterday practicing nonverbal casting of the Stunning Spell and brewing Draught of the Living Death using Half-Blood Prince's improved recipe (which, I would like to point out, Slughorn had validated in class, so I wasn't brewing recklessly, /unlike some people/). This morning, I used your cloak to ambush and stun Draco and fed him the Draught. I've left him in Myrtle's Toilets.

*Harry:* Why Myrtle's Toilets?

*Hermione:* Because, that's where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is. You're the only one in Hogwarts who can open the Chamber of Secrets, so if we leave him in there for the rest of the year, nobody will find him, and we can have a quiet year for once, without any inane mysteries to solve. Happy?

--------------

/[Late June of 1997, Hogwarts Express]/

*Harry:* Hermione, is it just me, or do you get the feeling that we've forgotten something important?

*Hermione:* Well, it can't be that importan... bugger.

--------------

/[Spring 1998, Chamber of Secrets]/

*Hermione:* That was brilliant, Ronald! I had no idea you were so good at voices!

*Ron:* I am a man of many tale... What.

*Hermione:* /[with a sigh]/ It's a long story of forgetfulness and procrastination. Just leave him there for now.â€‹

--------------

/[Later the same day]/

*Harry:* Open! Open!

*Hermione:* You're speaking English, Harry.

*Harry:* I am?

*Ron:* Yeah, you are, mate.

*Harry:* I guess Parseltongue was from Voldemort as well...

--------------

/[Even later...]/

*Ron:* Hshsshssshss! Shshshs! Hsshhh!

*Hermione:* Come on, Ron! I know you can do it!

*Ron:* Hsssshshshshs! Hshshhhs! Shsshsh!

*Hermione:* Don't give up!

*Ron:* My hongue hurh.

*Hermione:* I guess it was a one-in-a-million fluke...

*Ron:* Why dih you even puh him ih here?

*Hermione:* Yes, Harry, why did we put him in there? We still don't know if he was even planning anything!

*Harry:* Hey, you're the one who came up with the plan! I just wanted you to help me investigate!

*Hermione:* Oh, so now it's my fault for not wanting to waste my valuable time on your wild speculations?!

*Ron:* Honh ahgue oeh him. Mahfoy ih a phat.

*Harry:* That he is, mate.

*Hermione:* Very well... That Draught was exceedingly good, if I may say so myself. It should last another decade, at least. Plenty of time to find a Parselmouth.

*Harry:* Yeah, no rush.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** So he can see "patterns" which represent materials the constituents of matter (and later he can see souls too). Over time he develops the ability to edit these patterns, which is essentially transfiguration, if more permanent. He can even edit the souls he sees to kill people. Since what he's doing is really transfiguration at its core, I thought it fit.

** As far as I can remember, transfigurations in Canon were not permanent.

You could however dose your prisoners with the Draught of Living Death. Or if you have a Basilisk at hand, petrify them.

*** That's the idea, perhaps I should have been more vaguely-specific about things - but I did assume that people would get the idea like you did. I mean, they could use a ritual or runes or a potion or just knock them out and throw them in the back of a car. I read this one fic, whose name I do not remember, In which Team Harry turned all the death eaters into canned bologna or something and used them as a footrest until the war was out. That, and some unnamed users comment suggesting they be ritualistically transfigured, etc., are what - err - inspired the post.

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.
