Are there any fics like this where Fake Moody's Confundus charm was super effective and Harry was chosen instead of Cedric?

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** The confundus was to make the Goblet forget that only three schools were participating, rather than to force it to choose Harry. It probably had defences against being forced. Harry was picked because he was the only one in his category. Could be fun to read, though. :)

  ‘It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that Goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the Tournament ... I'm guessing they submitted Potter's name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category.

(said by 'Moody' himself, so maybe it should be taken with a grain of salt; but we have no other information)

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
