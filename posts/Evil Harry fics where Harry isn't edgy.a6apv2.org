Do you know Evil!Harry fics where Harry is Disney evil, rather than Emo evil?


** I'm uncertain...give examples of Disney Evil please. I'm serious because most Disney Villians can be interpreted as edgy.

*** Tarkin, nowadays.

Refined, cultured, aloof and professional. Nary a word nor a button out of place, soft-spoken and eloquent in his minimalism. Respected by his men, his peers and his enemies.

Can damn a billion souls to be consumed in unimaginable fire with a soft smile on his face.

You know, Disney Evil.

**** Darth Vader works too. Not counting the black suit he wears he is normally calm, collected and while he is angry his anger is a calm cold anger unless something causes him to lose his composure.

***** I thought so too initially, but he does register on the edginess scale, so I went with the safer and ultimately more terrifying of the two possibilities.

** Isn't evil just edginess with more frills and lace? I think most evil characters just naturally come with edgy viewpoints. Thinking they're inherently better than others really just comes with the territory. Tom Riddle would just be some crazy inbred loser racist if he didn't have charisma and big magic.

** Can you give a definition of your "disney evil"?

Also, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die./]] I wouldn't call that story's Harry evil, but it's literally the only ruthless-Harry story I've found so far in which he's not also a sadist (if you discount dark magic addicttion) or a conceited brat.

Plain evil, completely unapologetic, no winning about anything. Very NSFW and messed up, though, you've been warned.

** linkffn(Harry Potter - The Curse of Undeath)

Harry finds a journal of some Warhammer Fantasy lich, and figures that if hes probably going to get killed by Voldemort at some point, he might as well choose the not quite dead route.

No betrayals, no light bashing, just a stressed boy that finds a how to necromancy guide and decides that it can't hurt.
