I think we all know this feeling, sometimes you start a story without checking when it was updated for the last time, fall in love with the writing, the characters, the world, the story... and suddenly it just stops. Or maybe you knew that something was discontinued, gave it a shot anyway and feel way deeper into it than you ever could have imagined. You feel like you ran into a wall, but there is a bit of hope: You start checking when it was updated in other archives, realize that it was years ago, you still don't give up and search other pages for it, maybe a tumblr? Maybe a long lost livejournal? Maybe an original page? Somewhere? Anywhere? But of course it is nowhere to be found and so you suffer, you read the first chapters again, you think about what could have been, you try making up your own ending, but you know that nothing you could come up with would ever satisfy you. You bookmark the story and you check and check and check, for all your longing and wishing and writing begging reviews, it never continues.

So, if you could pick one story that put you through that to be magically finished by its author, which one would it be?

Mine is: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/589726/chapters/1060711]]) - The Prince and the Professor by the_supreme_mugwump

It contains the best young Snape that I have ever read, the only OC that I ever cared about, the best flow, the perfect mixture of humor, romance and angst AND the author has no other stories - which makes everything SO MUCH WORSE.

edit: Do link it, so we can share the sweet pain!

I love this story and have reread so so many times. I would be over the moon if it was ever completed!

The characterization of Harry is one of my favorites, ambitious and cunning without being evil or overwhelmingly “dark”. The dialogue and dark humor make it an entertaining read.

This one. It's THE time travel fic.

...Well, in more detail, it's a traditional 'Harry goes back in time to fix things' fic, but really good. Dumbledore isn't evil (though Snape is), exposing Peter Pettigrew adds new layers to the story instead of just solving-problems, there's some unseen antagonist in play...and Harry, despite being powerful, is still balanced within the story.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Unlike a Sister by MADharmony. By far the most superior Harry/Hermione romance story I've come across since reading FanFiction. The best part of the story for me is how the author portrays Harry and Hermione. They are very close (in my eyes, at least) to their canon counterparts. Reading it is like reading a continuation of the Harry Potter series itself (minus The Cursed Child drivel). I just can't believe it wasn't finished.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  When he looked back on it in later years, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in Sixth Year were of much greater importance than he could have ever known at the time. Then again, it was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16, when his daily existence consisted of constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come.

Has to be this one. I know it isn't HP, but this has to be one of my favourite fics.

Writing an interesting Dragon born can be hard to do, but this story pulls it off remarkably well.

This crossover niche should work damnit, but this is the only fic i have read that isn't terrible.

I also love the interactions between the characters.

****** For me, fanfiction is mostly about the characters, and secondly about the world. I have trouble with ES fanfiction too, because I'm not really invested in any of the characters except my own, and I don't want to read some self-insert story.

Also, did you know that Ulfric Stormcloak bashing is a thing that exists? I accidentally got invested in a story that I wouldn't have started if I knew where it went, where a perfect oc dragonborn was sent by Ulfric to infiltrate the thieves guild, where she would eventually fall in love with Brynjolf and of course decide to stay a member. I think she and Ulfric were in a relationship, but he didn't really care about her, and would send her impersonal gifts, and was probably really racist.

It was boring and annoying.

*** I feel the same about young Snapes, I think the main problem that most authors have with him is that to me he seems like a character than does not talk when even he should and if he says something it's not understandable enough for anyone and since characters like this are extremely hard to write authors tend to change him.

What are other stories with young Snapes that you enjoyed? I am always looking for more.

  This is the first chapter of my huge sprawling SS/LE fanfic, Sympathetic Magic, which I wrote between 2008 and 2013 (when you see it, you'll understand why it took so long!) and posted on DeviantArt. I've been meaning to post it on AO3 for ages, but I can only work in like half-hour intervals when my baby is asleep, and I'm also trying to write original fiction in those precious half-hours, so this could take a while...\\
  The story follows Severus and Lily through their last two years at Hogwarts, but it's also focused on the Marauders, Narcissa and Lucius, Regulus Black, Poppy Pomfrey, and lots of OCs. No characters are really hated, except, I guess, for Bellatrix. It's AU, but I think quite respectful towards J.K Rowling's plots and characters. It gets extremely caught up in the emotional world of the characters, and can spend whole chapters in symbolic landscapes representing their souls (I'm not sure if that's really selling it, but it's the truth!) Anyway, I can't really describe it. It was my soul for almost five years, and I haven't re-read it in way too long, but I still hear from people asking me to make the story more wiely-accessible, so I'm going to post it here. Hope you enjoy it!

***** I think we have a very similar taste in fanfics - If you ever decide writing one, please let me know!

I guess you already know this one, but in case you don't and are interested in the adult Snape getting another try at life as well, make sure you check out linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834/1/Come-Once-Again-and-Love-Me]]) - it is really really awesome.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** ID: linkffn(4828132) Harry Potter and the Ascension of Ra by Apocalypse Thou.

I was never a big fan of Smallville, but I was (and still am) an enormous fan of this story. The kinds of Magic Harry gets into and the vibe of growing into his own away from Britan and people who know him. Him growing up, instead of just growing powerful.

The same vibe I got from Jbern and his two works in second person. Also a good read but those are complete.

But the story just stopped, and I have always wondered when or if it will ever continue. It never felt like the story ended in the author's head, just people stopped reviewing. This story deserves more love than it got, I recommend it if you haven't had the chance.

*** Okay, I have to ask here, because that title is familiar... what's that story about?

I mean, when I hear "Last Tango in Paris" I think of that really controversial Bertolucci film from 1972 with Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider, with all the nudity and non-con sex... I happened to catch it on TV when I was like fifteen and watched through it in morbid fascination, even though it was a long time before I could eat butter again. (Anyone who's seen the movie will KNOW what I'm talking about!)

I'm almost afraid to ask, but that fic isn't about an anonymous sexual relationship between two people that turns increasingly abusive, is it?

**** I am not familiar with that movie (I have only heard the title), but I would guess they are nothing alike. It is the third part of a story that is Hermione-centric; she is a researcher who has made a breakthrough regarding Neville's parents, and of course there's a mystery. She spend much of the story in Paris, so I imagine that's where the title comes from.

Lords of War and Thunder linkffn(9880708). It's got a lot of promise, it's extremely well written, and it's one of the few stories where Harry has a good relationship with his BWL brother.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre.

** I'm going to say linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone), that story had great worldbuilding and a lot of potential but never got to stretch its proverbial wings. I am also naturally looking forward to the updates of /Core Threads/, /Fantastic Elves/, /Natural 21/ and /The Evil Overlord List/, but for all of those --- well --- they haven't updated in months, but the authors drop by periodically and confirm they're not abandoning them, so we'll see.
