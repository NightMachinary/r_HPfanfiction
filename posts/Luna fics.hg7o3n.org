Are there any fics where luna is handled differently? Like where she doesn't spout nargles or silly conspiracy theories. Preferably paired with harry


** That would just be an OC named Luna.

** Not paired with Harry, but I think you'll like this one: linkffn(Stages of Hope).

It has a very different take on Luna than anything I've seen before.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** I just read this one the other day. Blessed blood linkffn(12378425) it's a Harry/Luna/Hermione but I thought the way it handled Luna's typical behavior and explained it was really interesting and plausible.

** It's been a long time, but I remember the Luna of this fic being fairly sober while retaining some of her Lunaisms. She's only a side character though, sadly. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12365803/1/I-m-Not-The-Only-One]]

** Satisfied Mind linkffn(13360465): a Harry dealing with his issues after the war, and meeting Luna at one of his sessions who is also dealing with similar problems. Luna is alot more grounded in this one, and dealing with a heavy dose of depression

** You Poked a Dragon shows Luna abandoning her Luna-isms because plot. It makes more sense in context, but only just.

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL
