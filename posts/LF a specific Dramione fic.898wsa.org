Hi all, this is probably a long shot, but I'm looking for a specific Dramione fic I read on FF a few years ago. The setting is post-war where Hermione is working in the Ministry and is tasked with hunting down the few remaining Death Eaters, while also secretly attempting to locate her parents. She ends up employing the help of Draco (who is now some sort of prisoner) who provides information to help locate the Death Eaters. I can't remember too many of the details as it's been so long, but Draco eventually finds out about her missing parents and it spirals into some angsty love-hate relationship. There was one particular scene where Pansy attempts to seduce Draco but he ends up leaving because of his romance with Hermione. Sorry if this is too vague, but it's been way too long and I'd love to locate this fic again - any help in locating the story is much appreciated! Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Believe I found it, "When the Bell Tolls" by everythursday! Thanks everyone who tried to help out :)
