Okay lets talk about this for a second. We've all read the horribly clique "all next gen kids time travel to grimmauld place at the beginning of OotP because james did something stupid and we will all spend a horribly long time introducing ourselves. Everyone will gasp cause "OH MI GAWD A POTTER? WHOSE MIDDLE NAME IS SNIVILLUS AND HE'S A FILTY SLYTHERIN AND HOLY CHILUPA HE'S SLEEPIN WITH DRACO MALFOY CHILD WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HIM AAAHHHHH" and also Molly will cry cause "oh mi gawwwd percccay comees bacck??? And he names his kid after meeeeh Wahhhhh" and then it'll end cause "hey guys I'm gonna finish this story I promise I never abandon a story" (updated 3 yrs ago)" and let's not forget the "hey guys this is my first story pls be nice no flamez" (authors note that is longer than the story) and also top quality shit writing.

Okaaay got a bit carried away there, but you get my point. Now I love the premise of this, but I want a good fic. And it's hard to find gold in a mountain of shit.


** Wait, so do you want all of the cliches, including the capslock? Or are you looking for something original? Because I just got a (crack) plot bunny, but it's AU seeing as the premise is Ginny's two children, Albus and Harriet Creevey, causing the accidental time travel while stalking the Potter family.

**** I'm not sure if that's "please do this" or "please for the love of all humanity do not torture us with this".

If it's the first one, I'm already trying to come up with a title that's a pun on 'Creevey'. Maybe 'I'm Creevey For You?'

***** I think that sounds hilarious. Please write it. Maybe instead of a pun you could set up a title similar to an actual HP book.

** I think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/][Choices]] linkffn(5846417) is an interesting fic, but it's Romance so let me know if that bothers you. Lily Potter is 19, directionless and kind of a mess. She's drunk, she's just dumped her boyfriend and now she's time traveled fifty years in the past. The twist of this story is that she gets back to her own time pretty easily. However, she doesn't realize that her actions have consequences and someone might follow her back.

Also, there's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7073162/1/][The Next Adventure]] linkffn(7073162) where Harry goes on an Auror mission to 1993 to uncover a future Dark Lord, and takes Teddy along to go undercover at Hogwarts to help find their target and get to know his father. Remus Lupin is confused, his wolf senses can tell something is familiar about this boy but he can't make out what it is

Since the linkbot isn't working for me I've also linked the stories you can click on the title.

** linkffn(4337434) is the best. It probably won't make much sense unless you read the first book in the series.

  This is the companion novel to Backward With Purpose. I'd read that one first. This story is complete; the sequel has begun.
