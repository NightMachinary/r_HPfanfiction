I was just wondering if their were ant fanfic with the above premise.


** If you're talking about romantic relationship, I'm kinda hoping it's most of them. If you're talking about Harry not trusting them, I recently read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], which does have that premise in the last couple of chapters. It's Drarry (with enough distance from their canon relationship for me to actually like it), but much of the focus is on friendship, it has a great Hermione, and Harry is very mistrustful of adults.

** Linkffn(For Love Of Magic) has a Harry totally uninterested in getting to know Lupin. He does however get along with Sirius.

Lupin is depicted as an emotionally paralyzed weakling though, which I think is a bit of a character assassination.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
