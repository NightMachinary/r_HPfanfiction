I prefer the Idea that at least some Muggleborns are something new that have nothing to do with Squibs that were sent into the muggle world.( I feel like if that was the case there would be a hell of a lot more muggleborns after the population boom cause by the Industrial Revolution)


** It plays into the anti-muggle narrative (it would imply wizards have something completely separate than muggles, since any genetic accident creating magic the first time would likely happen again and keep happening through time), but against the pro-pureblood, since they're basically offing their own family by going after mudbloods.

** I don't mind that bit of JKR's post-canon trivia. The series has been pretty clear about how magic runs in families, with one of Harry's big bombshells as a kid being that his Mum and Dad were wizards just like him.

If you're going to write a universe where magic /isn't/ genetic and comes out of nowhere, instead of Muggleborn wizards coming from several skipped generations of Squib blood, then you should balance it out by making wizarding families have a good chance of producing no-Majs. If it doesn't work both ways, then your AU is inconsistent with itself.

Also, I think there are plenty of hints that Magical Beings and Muggles are different species. Magicals can see Dementors, Muggles can only feel the effects. Magicals have hardier bodies where they aren't killed playing Quidditch, and can live up to 150+ years. That doesn't sound like standard humans to me.

The easiest thing I've found is not to address it all, unless the story is about purebloods coming to terms with their prejudices. Mixing modern genetic science with Harry Potter turns a story into pure Mugglewank. And that ruins stories to me, because these wank fics always make Harry Potter into Harry Dresden.

Good question, but where did magic come from, to begin with? We have no clue. Could be Muggle-Borns randomly started being born at some point, but it's equally plausible that a group of adult cavemen were selected by... whoever... (God(s)? angels? aliens? Cthulhu?)... and were granted magic all at once, subsequently passing it on to their descendants.

**** My idea is that all living things have a tiny amount of magic, normally to small to notice, but wizards and magical creatures have a mutation (or several) that cause them to have much more magic. This seems like the simplest explanation for having magical vertebrates, insects, worms, fungi, plants, and even viruses all over the tree of life.

I know that doesn't explain why magic didn't become dominant in the environment. Maybe an alternative explanation is that there is a fixed amount of natural magic in the environment, and it can only sustain a small number of species. Or maybe it's powered by belief, or otherwise required a sapient being to absorb it from the environment and convert it to a form that can be absorbed by other lifeforms. There's not really a good way to explain both the genetics and the evolutionary biology of magic as described in canon.

Here I would agree with you. I think the idea of dormant magical/squib lines being more numerous that Muggleborns/Muggleborn makes exponentially more sense than there is no such thing as a "True" muggleborn line.

Personally, I imagine "true" muggleborns lines as spontaneously occurring phenomenon What makes most logical sense to me is that these new lines act as hosts or receptacles for latent, naturally occurring magical energies. It gives some credence to Grindelwald's grandstanding that" Magic blooms only in rare souls." It seems to me, that given the historical connection between nature and spellcraft, any magical being--be they pureblood, halfblood, muggleorn, troll, or house elf-- is, in some respects, a conduit for naturally occurring magical energies.

#+end_quote

This is where I differ a bit. On some basic level I find the mixing of genetics and magic to be slimy. However, at the same time, it seems to me as if there must be some sort of connection between the two. If we accept that muggleborn lines are likely to produce magical offspring in perpetuity, barring the inbreeding and mass warfare population devastation that seem to occur in great frequency in the magical world, it seems paradoxical to then assert that genetics and magic are unlinked.

If we think of being a squib as a birth defect it makes sense for Purebloods to produce no-squibs. Because I think of magical beings as conduits rather than being inherently magical themselves, I think it makes even more sense. Some people have birth defects or genetic conditions which make it impossible for their bodies to produce or process certain hormones or nutrients. If magical lines are more about create individuals capable of harnessing magic it makes sense that in those rare souls in which, magic bloom some sort of genetic alteration has likely occurred.

Another question I've had though is why are dormant pureblood/ "fake" muggleborn lines not considered half-bloods. If magic is genetic and being a squib is a birth defect then it would make sense that the offspring were still considered magical beings, incapable of excising magic. Since the all Muggleborns are descended from Squibs argument is still based on the idea of the inheritably of magical blood it seems that dormant pureblood lines are more accurately half-blood lines (this being based on the idea that most squibs settle on the fringes of magical society with other squibs or in the non-magical community with muggles).

On a basic level, this sort of thinking would play into a blood supremacist ideology, in so far as it supports the idea that there is a fundamental and biological separation between magical and non-magical beings. Thus, this line of thinking can undeniably be used as pureblood claptrap. At the same time, I think it also creates room for a critique of pureblood ideology. One of the underling principles of supremacist ideology (outside of its focus on traditionalism and peerage), is that the "purer" ones blood is, the more magically gifted and inclined that individual is likely to be. While people scramble to claim that muggleborns are defective purebloods gone defunct, little attention seems to be given to explaining why this happens (hello inbreeding anyone...just as a place to start). Consequently, on an entire other level the idea that all Muggleborns are descend from squibs undermines another key tenets of pro-pureblood fanaticism because it recognizes some of the inherent limits in genetically inheritable magical traits.

*** Pro-purebloods believe that magical blood matters.

And then you have Malfoy style purists, who think Muggles are trash, and the purer the magical blood the better.

Pro-Muggles believe that blood doesn't matter. Wizards are all equal to each other if they have magic. Muggles are equal too, and as humans, and deserve equal treatment and having their basic rights protected, ie, protected against baiting, cursing, or having Unforgivables used on them, which is a direct line to Azkaban when used on a witch or wizard. (Magical Creature rights for non-human magicals is still iffy, as people like Ron don't seem to care about house elves.) And people like Arthur Weasley, who are Pro-Muggle, still treat Muggles like carnival novelties, so eh...

If Muggleborns come from Squibs, then it means they're not really /true/ Muggles, or Muggles who have "stolen" magic, especially if their Squib blood comes from a "good" family. It proves that blood /does/ matter, which supports some pureblood agendas.

That's kind of a narrow way of looking at it, isn't it? Whether blood matters in whether or not you get magic is besides the point. The reason Muggles and wizards should be treated equally has nothing to do with how likely they are to be magical; it's a matter of the fact that they are sentient intelligent beings with feelings, deserving of empathy. No one would argue that blood doesn't matter in making someone a human vs. a house-elf, yet the latter still deserve equal rights, too.

***** Yeah but all things being equal, it's still a point in favor of the pureblood argument that they're superior by virtue of their genes. Like, if it were scientifically proven that Aryans were superior, that still wouldn't justify exterminating other races, since as you said, they're sentient beings, but Ayran superiority was nevertheless an important part of their justification for genocide, and one reasonable counter-argument to Nazi philosophy is, "Aryans are not genetically superior."

The pureblood argument is basically two-fold: 1) magical ability stems only from pureblood genes, 2) this justifies treating non-purebloods badly.

If muggleborns are descended from squibs (and thus from wizards/purebloods), that means the purebloods are right about the first half of their argument. Obviously, a difference in someone's inherent magical ability is not a justification to treat them poorly, but if all muggleborns are really descended from purebloods, that does lend credence to the pureblood view that their genes are superior (superior genes, meaning that due to their genetics, they have magic powers, they are tougher, and they live longer).

Since muggle/muggleborn discrimination is an allegory for racial discrimination, it's almost like JKR (unintentionally, I'm sure) is suggesting that some races are genetically superior, even though that wouldn't justify persecution if it were true.

** I personally like the muggleborns are descendant from squibs theory for a bunch of reasons that other people have already mentioned. In my head canon, you need a squib ancestor from each side of the family within the last five generations. Also, like wizards, squibs have lower birth rates meaning most muggleborns will come from smaller families (Dean Thomas is actually a halfblooded with a wizard father). I personally like to believe that the first witches and wizards were half-breeds like Fleur and Hagrid and that pure humans don't have any 'magical' genes.

I've read AU's where muggleborns are the result of true love (usually Once Upon A Time crossovers) which allows for random muggleborns without there being a lot of them.

** I've never thought that as such, if anything maybe the other way round? Humanity is what both groups have in common suggesting that is the default form. Just like a different eye color gradually breeding to veer wildly from the baseline.

Although I've also always headcanoned squibs as not being /non/ magic, just being unable to access it. A great prompt tbh would be muggle science and medicine solving that issue as well as others the wizards, not ever needing logic or rules, just never thought of.

** I'd say it creates ground for a more separatists narrative, than pro-pureblood - after all, assuming it's true, it means purebloods were fundamentally wrong on the point of muggleborns being less worthy, or stealing magic. Also, I quite like this idea, as I've always pictured muggles and magicals as two separate species that can breed with each other, but not much else, and it's the preferred background I look for in fanfiction :3

** Something I've thought about a lot. I write Hermione as a main character often, and I mostly try to avoid her suddenly being discovered to have wizarding relatives because I think she would feel that all of her accomplishments up to that point would now be seen like ‘I told you she was too smart to be a muggleborn'.

There's so much to do with the squib-born angle, though, so I like reading other people's takes on it as well.

*** This. I get kind of annoyed at some stories with Lily and Hermione who "secretly" have magical relatives, because it is seen to explain their being head girl or Hermione being a genius and so on. Like it kind of comes across as "magical heritage wins out."

The only exception are a couple of stories I've seen where Harry is a parselmouth because of LIly, and the whole magical bloodline in Lily was seen to be fucked up (like the Gaunts) and not the reason she nor Harry were powerful.

** I do think it does play into the pro pureblood narrative but I also think it's the most likely idea. A story I once read had it that magic in humans first came from normal humans and 'humanoid' magical creatures producing offspring together and this is why some people are better at some branches of magic, and where things like parseltongue and metamorphs come from. The fact that magical humans all do magic the same way can be explained by the offspring of these different magic creatures breeding together and the adaptation of magic to an otherwise fully human body. Of course as time went on people forgot where the magic came from and a lot of magical people would now throw a fit if you suggested that their magic came from a magical creature. This way, the only way for a 'Muggleborn' to have magic is if at some point in their family history, there was a magical creature or a magical person, which in the time the books are written in, is more likely to be an already existing magical family than its likely for a muggle to have children with a magical creature even if they somehow came across one.

** I feel like it's a mix, the original "spark" had to happen at some point, and more than once. It makes sense that, eventually early magic users would find each other and start grouping up. Which, of course, led to the divide but.... why would that particular genetic quirk just... stop?

And, now that wizards have been marrying wizards for so long that both parents are practically gaunteed to pass on the gene it... sometimes happens in reverse. Sure, maybe its occasionally inbreeding - but that, I think, it is less "they didn't get the magic!" And more "something is wrong that is blocking it!" And it never gets fully investigated to figure out what. 90% a "true" squib is just... the reverse of what happened in the first place.

...but yes, sometimes it means that there's a surprise wizard or muggle or squib or muggleborn somewhere in the background.

Like Colin and Dennis... both of them feels like too much to be an accident. My gut says wizard, and maybe pretty recently.

But Hermione just sort of happened.

And Lily... maybe a "true" squib somewhere.

But... you know, headcanon

*** I think at least after the Founding of Hogwarts in the UK it was a case of the Muggleborns being removed from the muggle Gene pool as they appeared with them marrying other magical they met at Hogwarts.

and before the Industrial Revolution the ratio between Muggle and Magicals was probably a lot closer.

**** I feel like there was a lot of removing themselves from the muggle gene pool anyway as a side effect of the "grouping." Once there's enough groups running around theres probably one close and.... I fully believe that some well meaning wizards stole their local muggleborns away from "those people that just won't understand." Maybe those wizards are waiting, hunting for lack of a better word, for a kid to pop up or... maybe... well people talk and when something odd happens people talk more.

** I understand where you're coming from and, especially with current context in the world, definitely have some uncomfortable feelings about it. However, I don't think it /has/ to play into that, if it's written right.

My take on it is that Magic is a semi-sentient force in the world that has begun manifesting in humanity because of [insert whatever macguffin I want for a particular story]. It /wants/ to encompass everything and it certainly does a lot to boost the survivability of the humans it manifests in, but the trade off is that wizards (and to a lesser extent, squibs) have overall way fewer children than muggles historically have, so while "magic" is a heritable trait that cannot be lost once it's in a bloodline, it spreads much, much more slowly than pure muggles can reproduce. To continue the idea that Magic wants itself to spread, I headcannon that wizard x muggle partnerships have a much higher chance of producing more than two children than wizard x wizard relationships, and that squibs are a method Magic uses to force wizarding lines to bring in new genetics (because squibs blend easier with muggles and will be more likely to be sent out into the muggle world) and that they only manifest when the families involved haven't brought in enough new blood in the last couple of generations. Muggleborns are due to Magic deciding that a nice mix of new genetics has been brought in and manifesting so that those genetics can be mixed back into the rest of the magical population - or due to enough manifested magicals dying that Magic begins manifesting in many squib lines at once because it needs to keep a balance of active to passive power (ie wizards to squibs).

** I like to mix and match the idea that some muggleborn are descendants of squibs, and that Magic is sentient to some degree and either thinks “oh, this is gonna be awesome!” When it makes a muggleborn or does it because it like the baby's giggle or something cute but arbitrary.

This way you can have muggleborn s being the only living descendants of the hogwarts four and other famous witches and wizards, and you can have Magic itself deciding that certain muggle babies are completely worthy of having magic, thus producing muggleborn magic users that are orders of magnitudes more powerful than their inbred opponents.

That way you can have the Creevy brothers being the great*10 grandkids of helga hufflepuff, Hermione being chosen specifically by Magic because he/she/it decided the waves she would make would be awesome, and a little green-eyed redhead who get her magic because when Magic itself was wandering by it saw the little girl and thought ‘Oh! That's one of Sali's grandkids! This'll be great!”

** Wizards have been around since at least ancient Egypt. Statistically speaking literally everyone is descended from a squib somehow.

I kind of like the idea that muggleborns are the result of some old "magical genetics" that runs in the family coming back to the surface and it doesn't even really exclude anyone because with how long wizards and muggles have been intermingling those genetic markers would be scattered just about everywhere in the population.

** My headcannon is that while magic is generally hereditary, once in a while de novo mutations will happen to Muggle people's embryos activating a latent gene and that's how Muggleborns are born. Respectively, another de novo mutation could silence the magic gene, and that's how pureblood Squibs are born.

It's not like you will find many racists who will tell you that they hate people of color for no reason, instead they'll cite some FBI reports about black crime being high for example. Sure from their point of view they do have a point, but the problem is that they ignore all of the sociopolitical reasons behind it, just like the pureblood bigots do.

** Well if it's all based on genetics and not some mysterious force that randomly selects who gets magic and who doesn't then that means practically every human on earth carries the magic gene in a dormant state, and only very rarely does it become active when they are born. Think of magic like eye colours, most people have brown or black, but some, rare people have blue and green.

So not only is Harry special in that he has magic, he's doubly special because he has those bright green eyes too!

** Thinking about Mendel and his peas...and how through cross breeding and selection, we are able to come up with seedless grapes for instance, I would say that, if you want to bring common sense into a possible explanation, we all evolved from the same species BUT...at some point, Magic manifested itself in some people, and those people actually married each other,and their descendeants married into otrher similar magically talented people for the betterment of their comunities, as Magic would bring more chances of survival.

​

Like in nature, through the centuries, sometimes their offspring would be born without Magic and, as it happened to them, sometimes magic would appear to non magically inclined people, so i would guess this "genetic lottery" also played into worlds becomeing more separated.

​

This would be a logical explanation and progression, but I guess JKR already said that muggleborn descended from squibs, whichis quite meh IMO. ( If that is so, then we should also assume that a percentage of muggleborn were actually half bloods, as throwing squibs- children under 11 years old- into non magical world- I assume, in Orphanages- would also offer opportunity for magicals to have sexual partners in the real world and go on to pretend that nothing happened and live without facing consequences,)
