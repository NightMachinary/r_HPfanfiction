Where is the badass earthbending the cool ice spear spell the simple wandless warming of cold tea the wierd fairy bubble flying thing from the wizard of oz.

/but super handsome demigod of mega macho power! Dumbledore said magic isn't supposed to be flashy and light lasers are the best most greatest magic ever!/ well you know what fuck that shit remember all the cool magic you've seen like that guy fishcake whirlpool that avatar guy every character from the one about the pirates with the fruit power and haxi or even the alchemist dudes with the circles and truths. Remember how their magic was badass and showey and more than light beams and force pushes.

Where are the fucking badass magic like seriously like it doesn't even have to be combat based in fairy tail they had magic to change their fucking makeup for crying out loud but it was fucking badass more than grungy pub with desolate street that has some floating thing a ghost or two and there is a single spell that doesn't involve a laser.

Tldr: we of the order are tired of all that laser=all the magic in the world bullshit and think that Dumbledore should go fuck a goat with his fucking lasers and give us the good magic.

Call us flashy bastards we dare you!

** You're a barely literate flashy bastard. Also Dumbledore didn't say that, Harry did.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backwards and forwards over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.

  ‘Here,' he said. ‘We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.'

  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.

I'm so confused as to what that statement even had to do with the situation at hand tbh. It's one of those things that you read off-hand or Stephen Fry says in one of his condescending tones, so you kind of zone out. But now that you make it the central point, that is such an odd statement to make, what do bangs and smoke have to do with this?

**** Harry is witnessing this great wizard perform an incredible piece of magic. By walking about and touching the wall, not with any sort of spectacle.

***** Yes, but there are several powerful spells that do perform bangs and smoke. Harry's favourite is one such spell. Edit: Downvoted for having a differing opinion? XD

******* Dumbledore 'felt' magic, it wasn't any kind of spell or ability, he is just that in-tune with magic. What he did was not some kind of advanced spell mechanism.

******** How common is it to feel charms and spells in Harry Potter? Since all spells have different abilities, it seems like finding them and deciphering what they do would be pretty difficult. Ever since I first read that scene, I've really wanted to learn the details of what Dumbledore was actually doing.

*** It's not my fault Harry Potter magic is fucking retarded. Hell, every fight is simply protego+different color lasers and non combat magic is retarded transportation that only a madman would use plus floaty things and I guess ghosts too but they are badass.
