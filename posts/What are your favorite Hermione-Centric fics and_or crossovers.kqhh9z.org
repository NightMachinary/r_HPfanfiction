Just what the title asks. I know this has been asked before, but the most recent post was a year ago (please correct me if I'm wrong).

I don't really care the genre, length, completeness, crossover fandom, etc. Although I'd like a warning if it's an abandoned/rarely updated fic so I can prepare myself for the disappointment of seeing no new chapters before reading it. I'd also prefer if there's any crack/parody fics they be on the shorter side, but other genres are welcome at any length!

The pairing can be anything really, if there is one at all. But I prefer no adult-that-has-seen-her-grow-up/Hermione unless there's time travel or something that results in them being around the same age/adults when they first meet (if it's super well written and crosses the whole “I met you when you were a child” thing well with the ship then I'm not 100% opposed).

The only thing I won't read on is first person POV. It's hard for me to even give a first person POV a chance unless it comes highly recommended.


** Slightly bored at the moment so here's my top list of Hermione stories.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13267404/1/Bouquet-of-Asphodels][Bouquet of Asphodels]]
#+end_quote

One of the best (if not /the/ best) executed time travel story featuring Slytherin!Hermione. My heart ached for many of the OCs which is a rare occurrence for me. Really interesting forays into magical theory and politics. It's just... so good. I low key like to pretend this is really what happens after the Battle of Hogwarts, I find it /that/ satisfying. I've heard some people mention they were put off by all the pureblood politicking, afraid it was going to lead to some weird marriage contract sort of thing, rest assured - it does not. It is the ideological opposite of The Arithmancer so if you're put off by the mugglewank of that whole series, this is for you.

#+end_quote

No list would be complete without this one. I held off reading it for a long time because it was always mentioned and I rolled my eyes at the premise. Finally caved and it works! By god, it works. Dark!Hermione but in the most wholesome of ways?? The hype is real. It's so entertaining and it's such an original take on magical theory. Wish the author had the time to flesh out all the other years but I appreciate them taking the time to give us summaries so we're not left wondering where she ends up.

#+end_quote

This is another classic which always makes it on the lists despite being incomplete, it's just that good it's still worth a read even if it's been abandoned. The world of fanfiction is poorer for this abandonment, but what jacobk did manage to share reads so credibly. Yes, it's another Slytherin!Hermione, what can I say, it's my favourite genre lol.

Stepping out of the Slytherin! Dark!Hermione genre, comes a beautiful tale of healing and very slow burn romance (Hermione/Fleur). I haven't read it in years (it's coming up on my re-read list) but I still think about it years later. If you're open to the possibility of a niche pairing, this would be the one I recommend.

Special mention to [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SaraSmile416/pseuds/SaraSmile416][SaraSmile416]] who's doing a chapter by chapter rewrite of the books from Hermione's POV. They're pretty good. My biggest complaint is the sheer amount of summarising that goes on (e.g. we're constantly reminded who Hermione is and what's happened previously). You have to squint to ignore the rough edges that can be Britpicked, but overall they're very polished works. If I'm being brutally honest I do find this Hermione infuriatingly annoying a lot of the time, but simultaneously, I appreciate the author doing an unapologetically flawed exposition of Hermione which is rare. It's a good reminder that most 11 and 12 year olds are awkward, annoying, clueless creatures.

Keen to see what others recommend!

#+begin_quote
  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I'm obsessed with the harem-esque stories where she has a gaggle of men, most notably [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10506441/1/Arx-Domus-Nigrae][Arx Domus Nigrae]] or even [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17237618/chapters/65614753][A Contract Most Inconvenient]]

For some dramione - please please read the Rights and Wrongs series by Lovesbitca8[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/251882654-all-the-wrong-things][Rights and Wrongs]]

** I've only read one. It was a Handmaid's Tale-esque story.

I don't know if your into dark, twisted plotlines but if you are then this is good. If your not into dark, twisted, cruel stories then don't go near this. It's really good but heavy on the trigger warnings.

I loved it!! It was cruel and cunning and sly and dark and I loved it. But I'm sadistic.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

*** This is the BEST. I put it off every time the recommendation came up. I never watched Handsmaid's Tails and didn't think it would really be my cup of tea. I finally gave in and read it and for how dark it was, it was beautiful. It's on my reread list.

**** I was the same! I'm really not a Dramione person but these were so out of character and the world was so dark and twisted that it was ok? They fit for the world they were in.

Don't get me wrong, that relationship was not the healthiest thing in the world. Hermione was fustrating and Draco was downright terrifying...

But I loved it. I loved how cunning and sly everyone was. I loved the cruelness of it. I loved how utterly hopeless it was and everytime there was a glimmer of hope it was squashed down to the dirt.

I wouldn't recommend it to people unless you have the stomach for it. But it's worth the read. And definately the reread to get a whole different perspective on the opening 15 chapters!

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.
