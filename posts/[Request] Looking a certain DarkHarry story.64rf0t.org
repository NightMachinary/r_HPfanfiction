From what I remember of the fic is that dark wizards have these markings that only other dark wizards can see. And I think harry was staying in Diagon Ally for the summer or somewhere close to the ally.


** Out of the Night by Raining Ink. It isn't on fanfiction anymore, but the author allowed someone to keep it as a Google Doc. I think I found it just by searching for it on this subreddit.

EDIT: It's on Dropbox, same difference. [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html]]

*** Thank you so much, it's been on my mind the past couple weeks and you just saved my sanity. It also helps knowing that because of my search parameters I was unable to find it due to it being taken off the site.
