*** That's fair. Tell you what: I've got a bit of time on my hands, what with the lockdown and all. If you're willing to send me the latest version of the source doc, I'd be willing to write a script to automatically prune dead or relocated entries from it. I'd be happy to send you and back the cleaned up result - and script - so you don't have to bother with that busywork again.

If you're interested, send me a PM and I'll hand you an email address.

***** Taure never got back to me, and there's not much I can do without access to the source material. I /could/ write a general tool to assist in maintaining such lists, but I'd prefer to get in touch with one or more maintainers so I can figure out the requirements. That would also give me confidence that there's a demand. I don't mind doing the work, but only if people have a use for it.

*** All the docs on my ff.net profile are still working, you just have to add in the docs.google.com to the start of the URL as FF.net deletes it.

Alternatively use the links on my AO3 profile.

**** Well, what I'm referring to is the smut master list of fics you used to have: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/34xtpl/good_smut_list_32_fics_various_het_pairings/]]

I don't see a link to that list on your ffn or ao3 profiles.
