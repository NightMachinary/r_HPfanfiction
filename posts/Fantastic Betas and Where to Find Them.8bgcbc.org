** Wow. First off, congrats on 5000 reviews. If you want, I can help out with grammar and spelling. I'm currently on holiday right now and will be for the next 7/8 days or so, and don't have access to a laptop, which I prefer using, but I'm interested, and if you wish so, you can send me part of a document to look over and see if you're happy with that? Just reply to this comment if you're willing to give me a try?

** I don't have enough time to commit to betaing a story but I can throw a few reviews as I read through it

** Well I'll be damned, I stalked you on twitter hoping for those updates after you stopped, any chance of you continuing the other story you had with Harry working for Newt Scamander? It had a good humour and was enjoyable to reread.

**** Cool! I'm glad you're committed to finishing the Game story first and I hope to see it rewritten better than originally

** I'm actually able to beta If you need me too! I have a bit more time on my hands now that it's summer, and need something to occupy my time and keep my writing skills/grammar checking up to their regular standards. As well as asking for help on this subreddit, I believe that Shayalonnie keeps a list of available betas for HP fanfics at this link: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3gAsZWSxjVPQ6kEUGiac48jYGUzSjbEmGzLAF5sbSM/edit]]
