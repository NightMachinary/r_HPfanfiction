:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
And he was live streaming his life from Hogwarts, but everyone of his viewers thought he was faking it all with actors and CGI. I remember it was quite a funny fic. There was also a Harry that was the most tropey fanon Lord Potter possible, and I think another that kept talking about the power of love (?). Does anyone know how that fic was called?

Thanks!

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
