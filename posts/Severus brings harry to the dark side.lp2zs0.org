I've read a bunch where voldemort brings harry over, but very few where severus brings harry over to the dark side. Like not where harryis voldemorts son, but like severus and harry are together and severus shows ahrdy the wonders of being dark.

** Knowing this fandom, Harry is gonna join the dark side because of Snapes wonderful cock and his amazing blowjobs. Why cant he stay on the light while still fucking Snape? Because of the greater good Dumbldore of course, who is gonna do his best to seperate the two soul mates because Harry would suddenly become super powerful after swallowing Snape's cum and we can't have that after all, he has to be sacrificed for the greater good!
