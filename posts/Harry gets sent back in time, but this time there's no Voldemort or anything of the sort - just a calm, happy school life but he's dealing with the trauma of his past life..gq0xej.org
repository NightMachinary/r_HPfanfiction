I remember reading this /weird/ story a while ago where Harry was sent back in time but like, instead of doing things over...there's no Voldemort anymore. I can't remember why. It's like he was killed permanently the first time he attacked Harry as a baby in this new timeline. But Harry still has the memories of the war and everything, and he's dealing with borderline PTSD from everything as he tries to enjoy a normal childhood for the first time while still suffering from his issues and not being able to talk to anyone about it.

I remember finding it really unusual for the themes - it wasn't a random power fantasy, it didn't focus on Harry being amazing due to time travel or anything, it focused on his emotional development. It was a legitimately good story exploring an interesting premise...and I haven't found it again since.


** This is also an alternate reality rather than time travel but seems to be essentially what you're looking for;

** This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it's similar. I stead of time travel, Harry goes to an alternate reality where Neville is the BWL. It doesn't really focus in the war and Voldemort, but rather in Harry learning to be vulnerable with his newly alive family and dealing with his trauma.
