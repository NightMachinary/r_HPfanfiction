Ron, Ginny, and Dumbledore (originally had auburn hair).

Edit: It's a joke discussion.

** No wonder Lily's blood protection turned Harry into a Horcrux...

Also, small wonder Ginny ends up falling for Harry too, if this is the case. Hell, that could be why ALL the Weasleys like him.

Honestly I would say they affect people with snake obsessions more though.

*** What if little James discovered this information somehow and made a horcrux as a way of courting Lily

**** "Goddamn it, Snape, you can't die to Lupin - I need to ritually murder you next week!"

"What was that?"

"I said... your arrogance is reaching its peak."

I imagine you could get some mileage out of a humor fic in which James tries to kill Snape once every other week, while protecting him from horrible disasters the rest of the time. Snape assumes he's behind those problems, but doesn't realize the Wile E. Coyote-style deathtraps he accidentally walks through. I mean, the kid apparently did extensive Potions research before his sixth year, which Hermione notes is quite dangerous. Surely someone pulled his bacon out of the fire once or twice.

** But, they can affect them both ways! Dumbledore probably gained the skill "ginger sense" and sensed that Tom would/made Horcruxes, so he never trusted him!
