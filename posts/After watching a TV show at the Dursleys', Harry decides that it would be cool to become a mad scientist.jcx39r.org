** Dang! This reminds me of that one fic where Harry is a mad scientist and moves to Azkaban! It's cracky and absolutely hilarious. Pretty sure he refers to Hedwig as an overlord (supreme empress?) Or something. I can't remember if it mentions the Dursley's tho. It's been months since I've read it

** Oh gosh, that comment about hermione totally reminds me of Kurisu from Steins;Gate.

My name is Kurisu, not Christina, and I am NOT your assistant!

Or

You're not a mad scientist, you're just chuunibyuu!
