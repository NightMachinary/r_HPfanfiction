It doesn't necessarily needs to be a fix-it fic, I just prefer fics that show a different side of Narcissa instead of the usual suffering spouse that tries to save her family only in the end. I especially love AU fics where Narcissa gets to do lots of ritual magic, like The Reclamation of Black Power (though she's not in it nearly enough) and A Simple Plan (which is hilarious, but resolved the Dumbledore issue a bit too fast for my taste), but I'll take any fic that portrays Narcissa as clever and eager to take matters into her own hands. Just please, no abusive Lucius. Even if they are divorced, and I enjoy many Cissamione fics, I just can't enjoy a fic if Narcissa is a battered wife.

I prefer fics with little to no Sirius, not because I don't like the character but because I must have read two dozen fics with plotlines about clearing Sirius's name and they are all nearly the same, but I'm grateful for any recommendations. Happy to check for myself if it's my cup of tea.


** The Innocent series has a Narcissa trying to pull the strings from the very beginning, although she's not the main focus and it doesn't really influence the story until about 500k words in.

*** Thanks. I don't know if I'll survive all 500k before getting to the meat of it, but I'll definitively check it out.

**** The first 500k are about Sirius escaping from Azkaban and raising Harry while on the run from the ministry, Narcissa and the other Malfoys don't really appear in it a lot but it's very interesting, especially since the story also follows Tonks hunting Sirius as her first job as an auror. The Malfoys play a very big role once the story gets to Hogwarts.

** Lomonaaeren‘s Narcissa Militant is a great fixit series focused on Narcissa where she's an assassin. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/759120]]

you'll go the same way by LullabyKnell is a time travel Draco fic where he and Narcissa go horcrux hunting together linkao3(7811107)

Then there's Harry Potter and the Road Not Taken series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/481666]] that features a world where Lucius and Narcissa fought against Voldemort in the first war and will fight again in the second. They don't become major characters until book 4 Solace linkao3(8825035)

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor.  Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

  Even as the Harry-Potter-Now-Known-As-Ren-Cartwright takes his first tentative steps as the man his own world never allowed him to be, his new world begins to reveal its unique beauties and horrors - and he finds himself not only redefining himself, but everything, and everyone, he ever thought he knew. 'Solace' provides a look at that world through the eyes of another who lived through the history that now defines Ren's future, and provides a greater perspective on how the finer facts and details can, and will change everything... Everything, that is, except for those greatest truths that, no matter the eyes that behold them or the hearts that hold them, shine as light in the darkest depths of the deadliest jungle.Love and lethifolds, hope, horror, and heartbreak, second chances, salvation and self-identification, renewal and redemption, damnation and Dark Wankers, Malfoys and mayhem, and lots of bloody buggering bollocking swearing. Also, smut. Lots o' smut, and slash. DLDR. Part 4 of 'Harry Potter and the Road Not Taken'. Read all priors for necessary context.

*** Draco and Narcissa horcrux hunting sounds awesome! I read Narcissa Militant for a while, but her relationship with Lucius disturbed me. Once she started threatening him because he didn't want to accept Draco, I couldn't take their dynamic anymore. I'll see if I can understand Solace without all the backstory. Thanks for all the suggestions!
