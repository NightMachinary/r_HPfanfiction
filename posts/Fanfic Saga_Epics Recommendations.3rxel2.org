** There's the Dangerverse series, linkffn(living with danger by whydoyouneedtoknow) . it's an AU with a slightly different take on some magical topics, and spans from when Harry is a baby to the end of the war (which I think was 1998 here as well). Complete, and I think it had a short epilogue as well. Plenty of original characters, handful of side characters from canon are prominent, and plenty of character development to go around.

Oh and there is romance, just not among any of the kids until they're not exactly children anymore.
