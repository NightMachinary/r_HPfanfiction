** Yes. Your bros come first.

Though I suppose if the situation were reversed and Ron started dating Ginny, Harry might have some problems with it.

** Overall, yes, I think. The specifics depend, of course, on when the relationship developped. If Harry only began dating Hermione in Fifth-Year or something, Ron might already feel jealous enough of her that it might temporarily drive a wedge between he and Harry... although I still think they'd make up after a while.

*** Well, because Ron is a super disloyal glory hound the likes of Peter Pettigrew and is only friends with Harry because Dumbledore said so and he wants Harry's fame.

**** Sure. Lets assume that is true: So why would he ever stop being friends with Harry if he is in it for the fame? What does any of that have to do with Hermione?

***** It was sarcastic, no idea why he would stop being friends.

** He'd never stop being Harry's friend, although whether there was a rift in their relationship would depend on whether he was attracted to Hermione. Then he might be jealous at first, but either way I think he'd eventually end up with someone else, like Luna or Lavender.
