Oh Harry's twin brother Larry is thought to be the boy who lived, so let's send Harry to live with the Dursley's even though Lily and James survived. Or any other of the multitude of ridiculous plots these authors come up with.

If you're thinking about writing a WBWL story just don't.


** Yeah, that's my issue with the trope. It's just always so dumb. There's always some stupid reason as to why /both/ boys cannot live together: Dumbledore manipulates them and Potters are dumb enough to listen to him, or Dumbledore is evil and /Imperios/ them, or Potters don't think they can take care of both children for whatever reason, or Potters are dumb and think that being the brother to BWL will make him miserable so it's better to send him to miserable someplace else, or they hide boys at different places but then they forget about Harry for some reason. And of course, the worst of all, Potters are drunk on fame along with their son, to the point that they ignore Harry.

** It's a good plot for a story, but most authors butcher it by having Harry be overpowered as fuck and smart while his brother is snotty and spoiled to show how much better Harry is.

** WBWL by itself is not a bad plot to use .. however the way people write it makes less and less sense, they can use one of many other ways to implement it instead of driving out Harry, Potter parents bring them up away from all the attention by raising them in isolation .. possibly in muggle world, don't give more attention to one above other .. James pushes back as much as possible but it's not possible to avoid all the media attention or can't stop people from pointing fingers or showing one more attention than the other which gives Harry more drive to excel either to make people(not his parent as they are good ones) treat him like they treat his brother or to gain more power to protect his brother as he knows there will be people out to kill him for what they believe he did .. eventually turn it into Harry killing Voldy to save Larry or together .. there must be other ways of doing this without Dumble, James & Lily bashing.

** When they are well written they are fine but most are just plain boring.

Harry most often is portrayed as a 1.89m muscular, politically genius, magic god at age 11 who could work as an Auror if he was 7 years. That just puts the suspense out of every encounter or threat and therefore we never wonder if he got in over his head or not plus any rival turns from a hurdle to overcome into a bug to be stepped on.

And how do his parents react to all of this...

he just wants to get attention beat him up.

  Sequel to 'Mistaken Identity'. The Dunce Who Lived and his unfortunate brother have finally arrived at Hogwarts. Snape is both manipulative and placing bets. Not so oneshot.
