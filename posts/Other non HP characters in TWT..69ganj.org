Does anyone have any ideas about a non HP character who has do the TWT with or without harry in it maybe taking his place or as competition.

By non HP characters I'm talking about characters from other TV/Movie/Comic/Anime/Cartoon. How would Superman (from Superman) combat a magical dragon or Sabrina(from Sabrina) maybe Light Yagami(from Death Note) or Ben Tennyson(from Ben 10).

How would characters with such unique skillsets deal with the challenges presented to them.
