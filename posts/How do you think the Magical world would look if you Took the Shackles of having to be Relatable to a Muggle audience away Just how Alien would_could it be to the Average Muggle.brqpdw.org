Were Diagon Alley and Hogawarts are two of the least magical places in the magic world because they are where new Muggelborns are acclimatised to the magical world?

More Diagon Alley than Hogwarts after all Diagon Alley has to be at least muggle friendly enough for any muggle parents to take their children shopping.

I understand why the wizarding world is the way it is in canon, it couldn't be to alien and needed to be something that the Audience could still relate to, but are there any stories were to new muggleborns(and raised) the wizarding world is at least as alien as a our current world would be to a Muggle from before the industrial revaluation.

Like instead of having Wizards chess they have something that is more like jumanji crossed with age of mythology/empires.

were technology Like Full Dive Virtual reality a technology we can only dream of is considered primitive.

were every books is its own portal fantasy, like a Herbology book takes you too a Garden of Forest in something similar to Full Dive VR were their is an interactive teacher insider ready to Guide you threw what the book is trying to teach the "reader".

were they have the Ability to upload theoretical knowledge straight into your mind as something that is widely available.

Pretty much what happens when you take the muggle shackles off the Wizarding world and Give the Wizarding world Magical equivalents of all the technology we see in science fiction.

Like why bother with Written tests when you can have something like the Sorting hat literally read the Students mind to see if they have learnt what the class is trying to teach(I know why the books do it, to make them more relatable to its muggle audience).

Edit: were every room is a holodeck or upgraded room of requirement that has been improved in the hundreds years since the first one was made.


** I like stories where the Wizarding world is made up in a more traditional fantasy manner. When they have different religions, customs, heck I remember a fanfic where they traveled around the world through something akin to Yggdrassil. And its most interesting when they interact with Muggles in such stories, they really feel like a distinct civilization rather than a comic relief who doesnt know about electricity and cant dress properly.

One thing I dont think I ever saw in fanon is Wizard dialects. I assume their form of English might be a bit different, given they split around the 1700s, in such a complete manner.

** I doubt their would be a magical Britain. Magic users can literally teleport anywhere in the world at a thought.

Why would their be doors for most buildings. or even physical locations for buildings if they can teleport and fold space.

Their clothes would be amazing. Able to change with a thought. Able to think for themselves. Protect from any elements, look like you are wearing flowing lava.

Potions to enhance the user, physically and mentally. Also people would love to "accidentally" make cat girl hybrids like Hermione in book 2.

Transfiguration to literally create anything your mind can come up with. Try imagining what Lunas room could look like if she was allowed full control of matter to decorate with.

They can make brooms fly, why walk anywhere.

Bathrooms? I don't think so. spells to vanish waste while it's still inside you.

Glamours, you can literally look any way you want to with an illusion. Tonks' crazy changing hair should be on the tame side of things.

Hogwarts should be able to be made of anything, like diamond and obsidian rather than plain stone.

Magical animals /pets would be a lot more prevalent rather then oh hey an owl and a cat.

Other magical sentient races would be super alien. There is absolutely no way goblins would be in business suits running a bank.

*** The one thing that never made sense to me about Patron was that Voldemort and his revolutionaries were still a thing. Given that Purebloods were legally a higher caste than Halfbloods and Muggleborns, had a monopoly on political power and most wealth, actual Muggleborns made up less than 1% of the population and were magically bound to serve prominent Pureblood families there doesn't seem to actually be much of a political grievance for the Death Eaters to be motivated by.

In the canonical series Muggleborns had equal status to Purebloods legally, occupied high positions within the Ministry, had real influence over the culture and composed as much as 10% of the population. For traditionalist Pureblood who's bloodlines were decaying and influence was on the decline it made sense that there was some dissatisfaction to exploit for followers. But changing all those details and the political realities of the series in your world building and expecting the central conflict to stay the same seems lazy and inconsistent.

Patron is a cool story otherwise but the more I think about it the more it bugs me.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** In my experience it wasn't that angsty or edgy. At first it can seem like it's over-the-top in how aristocratic Harry and Hermione act, but there's layers to the formality of the wizarding world in this fic. It has some moments where the focus on Hermione is all the angst as she muses on her position as an object, but those are only moments in the larger picture. The worldbuilding is seriously thick, right down to the levels of formality, ancient traditions, magical Jamaica and magical Bulgaria, and rituals calling on old gods. Forget the plot, forget the emotions of the characters, t's a great read just for absorbing all the worldbuilding.

Honestly, I had to drop it a little after chapter 50, "The Year of Discovery". It's sex. Sixth year at Hogwarts is apparently the time to have constant orgies, and it's made out to be a ridiculously well-known tradition in the wizarding world. Harry struggles with constant invitations to threesomes, while Gildroy Lockhart has trouble keeping the sixth-year girls off him. His entire character background is redone and he's semi-competent while being terribly clumsy, actually, which is a great touch.

**** Angsty? Patron? I suppose you could argue that the process of getting Harry and Hermione together is /slightly/ so but that doesn't really take long to resolve, and it's far more romance than angst.

The big thing I should have mentioned in my previous post is that because magic is so much more obvious, it becomes more about how well you do it. In canon, Harry is amazed that magic is possible at all. In this story, everyone takes it for granted but is always out to impress others with their skill.

** They likely wouldn't speak standard English. They have been culturally isolated from the UK for 300 years.

Muggleborns are only drip fed into the community and the social pressure would be to assimilate, perhaps only investing a few new terms into the culture.

The endless reordering of European states that occurred as a result of war or revolution likely did not affect wizards perception of their own cultural identity that existed in those regions.

As an example Viktor krum might consider himself an Ottoman rather than a Bulgarian because the liberation of Bulgaria only occurred in 1908 and whose to say the magical counterparts acknowledged these changes?
