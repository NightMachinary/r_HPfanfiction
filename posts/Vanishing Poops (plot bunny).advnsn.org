** "I don't care if you did somehow get it to replicate into every copy of Hogwart's: A History," Lily exclaimed, "No one is stupid enough to believe this!"

James and Sirius shared a smile. Remus coughed, then said, "The Ravenclaws have announced a new club called 'the Sanitary Scholars' to revive the tradition, and Flitwick has agreed to sponsor. They figure it'll save them a trip away from the library. It's the power of the printed word. People assume if it's been printed nicely, somehow it has passed some sort of editorial judgment."

Lily paled. "It's the bloody Merlin thing all over again."

*** This is hilarious. Thay said in a time predating plumbing vanishing their waste makes sense. Looking at our own history without magic in places like London, shot ran in rivers as the animals crapped in the streets and people threw it out their windows. Given this was happening as recently as the 1800s and the magical world is concentrated seemingly in London, a belief that muggles are dirty among those that rarely interact with them could make a bit of sense.

** Chamber pots are a thing in the magical world as well, so using them was always an option as well.

** If Slytherin's chamber entrance was built into the Girl's Bathroom, and he was alive in the 10th century, then they must have had bathrooms since at least then, so why were they shitting on the floor?

*** The whole reason this question exists, is because JKR said they didn't have plumbing until the 18th century.

If it was a girls bathroom before that... it was showers or changing rooms or something...

Thus all my theories, the pipes were built into hogwarts for some other purpose (letting the basilisk roam) and the bathroom entrance was placed there later when they reused the existing pipes.

**** Would have loved to see the unfortunate wizard who followed those pipes to repurpose then and accidentally came across the Basilisk lair
