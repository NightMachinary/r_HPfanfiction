** Linkffn(a second chance at life by Miranda Flairgold)

It's book three of the series and was never finished unfortunately but the first two are worth another read :) it was the first â€˜Harry-goes-to-a-new-school' fic

You might like linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) after the first ten chapters it turns into a really solid, good 5 part completed series about basically terraforming a new planet for wizards, I highly recommend it

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** It doesn't particularly sound familiar, but it might be a crossover with /Terra Nova/, a TV series that had a similar premise of people in a post-apocalypse colonizing the prehistoric past in an alternate dimension.

Also, the word is "sentient" not "sentiment", so if you were trying to search for it and used the wrong word, it wouldn't have popped up
