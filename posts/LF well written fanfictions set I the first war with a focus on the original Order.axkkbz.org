  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  War is looming over the witches and wizards who graduated in 1978. Thrust into an exciting world where you party hard, find a job, take care of your friends and take love where you find it, they quickly learn that this is not all there is to life. Everything turns sour as they are faced with increasing paranoia, traitors from within, and morbid revelations about Voldemort's soul. Can the wizarding world be saved from the Death Eaters, or will they all go down fighting?My take on the first wizarding war and the rise of the Order of the Phoenix. The story follows many different characters and their experiences in the war and is written from different points of view. OCs are kept to a minimum and will not play big roles in the story. Canon-compliant to begin with, but turns into a horcrux hunt starting from chapter 25.

  Kingsley Shacklebolt arrests James Potter... a lot. "Each time Potter was arrested, he came quietly, officially, since he never put up the slightest fight. Off the record, he wouldn't shut up."
