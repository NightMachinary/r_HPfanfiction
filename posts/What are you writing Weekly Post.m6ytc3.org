** Really happy with how this scene in my WIP turned out.

Context : Harry is an Auror trainee, patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade as part of a training exercise. He is partnered with Susan Bones and is bored out his mind

#+begin_quote
  Harry sighed before he caught sight of two people moving towards them. The young woman with the turquoise sundress and tartan hat could have been no-one else but Luna Lovegood. She held a shopping list. It was six feet long and trailed behind her, occasionally tripping a passer-by. Next to her, his muscular arms laden with merchandise from shops already visited was a young man whose face was obscured by the bags and boxes he was holding in a precarious pile.

  Luna immediately noticed Harry and gave an enthusiastic wave, skipping over with her companion stumbling behind, not knowing what the sudden rush was about. Up close, Luna's eyes sparkled through hot pink sunglasses that clashed terribly with her hat.

  "Hello Harry. Hello Susan." chirped Luna. Harry returned the greeting while Bones gave Luna the same look one would give a newly discovered breed of dog. "We've been picking up some things for the paper. Colin has been such an immense help."

  With that, Luna's helper carefully set down what he was holding, revealing none other than Colin Creevey. At least, Harry was pretty sure it was the same Colin. The last time he had seen him, Colin had been a slim and baby-faced sixteen year old. This iteration was tall, broad-shouldered and had one of the squarest jaws Harry had ever seen.

  Instead of Colin's usual mile-a-minute yammering, the man in front of them merely gave a nod of greeting. The idea of Colin Creevey being suave was an odd one to say the least.

  "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go see a goblin about a printing press." said Luna, bouncing off before anyone could process what she had said, leaving Harry with only Bones and Colin.

  "So, er, you're looking well Colin." said Harry awkwardly, tapping his foot on the cobblestone.

  "Oh you really think so? " cheered Colin with a bright grin and shining eyes. Evidently he hadn't changed that much after all. Bones sniggered. Colin took notice of himself and coughed several times before speaking again, his voice intentionally lowered.

  "Oh, you see I took up a Beater position in 7th year, really made a new man out of me. And after school, I've been doing odd jobs here and there - fixing up the Lovegoods' shed, fixing up the Lovegoods' weather vane, fixing up the Lovegoods'-"

  "So are you and her a thing? " asked Bones, looking mildly exasperated.

  Colin's face turned as red as an overcooked lobster as he began stammering and wringing his hands.

  "Well, you see, uh, not exactly, I have spent the night with her a few times, er, on the sofa I mean, not like in the same bed, but we are pretty close, she sent me a birthday card last June, er, uh, um."

  Colin's suffering was only relieved when Luna returned and his face immediately snapped back into suave mode. Luna peered at him with a quizzical look.

  "You're looking a bit flushed, Colin. Have you been trying the herbal bath regime I suggested? "

  "Every night." squeaked Colin, clearing his throat and trying to look as cool as possible.

  "No need to overdo it." said Luna with a look of alarm. "Come on, I need you to help move this."

  As Luna and her admirer left, Harry and Bones ducked into a side-street and collapsed into spasms of laughter.

  "He wants in her pants so bloody much." cackled Bones, looking the most human she had been all day.

** Still writing the official fourth chapter of my crack fic, here's a snippet:

“I'm starting a chivalric order.” I said.

“Why?” He asked in confusion.

“The deep one-”

“Who?”

“The pink one, she's basically a dictator right?”

“From what you've told me, yes. But what does this have to do with anything?”

“Most dictators start a secret police, so I want a chivalric order around as some extra security.”

“So you're starting a protection racket.” Hastur stated dryly.

“No, no, no- well yeah.”

“Uh, huh. How exactly are you going to get knights for this order? Do you even have a name for it?”

“We're going to kidnap and brainwash some particularly burly students. But anyway, I want you to be the Grand Master of the Knights of the Crawling Chaos! You're the only Great Old One for the job Hastur, I have full confidence that you'll uphold my tenets.” I declared, putting my arm around his shoulder.

** My latest addition to my Severus Snape has a little sister AU, "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24417451/chapters/73791129][Long Way From Home]]", is finally a finished story with an epilogue.

I have also started drafting the first chapter of a new story for this same series. I think it will be called "Old Gemini" and it will focus on one of Severus's oldest daughters in the AU, Eileen. The summary I have right now for what the story will be about is:

"After Edie's 49th birthday, Eileen decided she would give her mother a painting of Lottie to celebrate her 50th. Over the next year, Eileen found creating the portrait was only one of several challenges she would have to handle in her life."

** This is an idea I've had in my mind for a while. A muggle witnessed Death Eaters killing a witch when he was young and became aware of the magical world. Ended up killing dark wizards for a living. Not sure if I will write a full story out of it, but I've got a halfway done rough outline.

--------------

Aiming down the scope of his sniper, he asked his partner through his ear piece “The target is alone. Is the jinx ready?”

To which she replied with a “Negative, no time to jinx. You've got one shot, make it count.”

“Understood” he replied “Is the coast clear before I take my shot?”

“Clear.” She replied professionally and he held his breath, adjusting his aim, without missing a beat or hesitating, he fired.

The rifle, being completely silent thanks to his partner's spell, fired a 7.62 round at supersonic speed, it too was magically silenced. The unsuspecting Death Eater stood no chance as the round penetrated his chest, passing between the ribs, tearing lung and heart before losing momentum. Once the round made its duty, it vanished, leaving no evidence.

200 meters away James closed the window and put his sniper rifle back in his bag. Without wasting a moment, he left the apartment and gone down the elevator. Upon leaving the building, he got on his motorcycle and left the scene towards their safe house.

While James Breach was a muggle, he wasn't ignorant of the existence of magic, and in fact, made his living primarily off killing Death Eaters and other dark wizards and witches. His partner, a Hogwarts dropout witch named Elizabeth, has been working with him for the last 4 years.

  When the Killing Curse strikes him, Harry doesn't appear at King's Cross. Instead he wakes up as 17 year-old Arcturus Black who apparently has a bad relationship with everyone at Hogwarts and especially with a teenage Dumbledore. But as Harry begins untangling the identity and secrets of the boy he's been reborn as, he's thrust forwards into a war he wanted to be no part of.

** This is from a long one-shot I've been writing on and off for the last few years(!) Finally almost finished with it.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius stared at him. His smile faded. Harry suddenly realized just how little his godfather knew about his life prior to their introduction last summer in the Shrieking Shack.

  “Er...Dumbledore never told you?” Harry asked uncertainly, avoiding Sirius's gaze as he picked at a small rip in the threadbare satin fabric of the seat cushion.

  Sirius's dark eyebrows came together at his mention of the headmaster's name and Harry knew the answer before his godfather even spoke.

  “Tell me what, exactly?”

  So Harry launched into an abridged version of his dealings with Quirrel and the Sorcerer's Stone during his first year, and the pandemonium during his second year with Tom Riddle's diary and the Chamber of Secrets. Sirius listened attentively. The more Harry talked, the more troubled his expression became.

  “...And so Voldemort has been trying to return for a few years, ever since I was eleven, or maybe even before then...” Harry trailed off, his voice slightly hoarse.

  Sirius did not speak immediately. The flames from the hearth threw flickering shadows across his face, and for a moment, Harry felt just a little bit afraid, thinking he had angered his godfather in some way. Sirius's eyes were still darkened as they had been during his row with Mrs. Weasley, and in their depths Harry recognized the haunted, faraway look he'd seen there a few times before, whenever Azkaban was mentioned. Harry wanted to tell him to forget what she'd said, that she'd had no right to verbally attack him in such a way, and that the whole thing was just stupid, but he was uncertain whether it would worsen his godfather's mood. Instead, he took to gazing out the window, the cobblestone walk below awash in the streetlamps' orange glow.

  “Listen, Harry...”

  He turned his attention back to his godfather. Sirius sat up a little straighter, and he was looking at him now, his features pinched in sorrow.

  “I am sorry that I've not been around very much. I should never have gone after Peter. It was my fault that I ended up in Azkaban. I should have been there for you.”

  “What?” Harry gasped, exasperated. “It's not your fault -- the Ministry -- they wouldn't even let you have a trial --”

  Harry broke off. Sirius's eyes were shining in the firelight, his expression apologetic and one of deepest regret. Harry suddenly found that his throat was painfully tight.

  “I don't blame you for what happened...not since you told me the truth about that night...”

  It came out as a whisper. Sirius nodded slowly and his throat bobbed as he reached over and rubbed Harry's back. Harry realized, mortified, that his eyes were wet, and he quickly hid his face from Sirius to dry his tears with the sleeve of his sweatshirt.

** I've been working on a long, dark thriller that takes place in the “lost” years between 1984 and 1994, and follow's Charlie's class. It takes the idea that this was a peaceful time in the wizarding world and turns it on its head, focusing on the consequences of the first war and depicting the descent of a traumatized Dumbledore trying to prevent another war, and failing. Voldemort may be gone, but his toxic ideas were left behind, leading to a somewhat dystopian world where muggle borns are losing their autonomy and dying as fanatics hunt them down.

My goal was to keep the story as compliant as possible, despite all the political unrest and murder, so it also weaves into canon events with a bunch of untold story type chapters. Oh. And there's a lot of playing around with space manipulation magic in very un canon like ways. If you check it out, let me know!

​

*Fudge's Story*

/Cornelius Fudge was minister for magic by Harry's third year. But he came up through Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. That's tempered his outlook on life a bit./

“Potter's had accidental magic and done what?” asked Minster Fudge. Not listening was important, as subordinates would repeat the important bits.

“He... blew up his muggle aunt. We intercepted her over Surrey, obliviated everyone and got her down. But Potter's missing from his home.” said the floo-calling Obliviator.

Cornelius's ears had caught onto the first part of the report, and his imagination had already filled in a picture of a scene. One of the muggles oddly uniform houses, blown to pieces, a crater in the ground, having to call in favours with the muggle authorities to accept a muggle-worthy excuse.

“So she's... not dead?” asked Cornelius.

“Just obliviated” said the face in the fireplace.

“Right” said Cornelius “Where has he gone?”

“Our best guess is the Knight bus. It had a service call nearby and the only Squib for miles around is still at home” said the Obliviator.

“I'll go to the Leaky Cauldron, get the boy a room” said Cornelius. ‘Keep him calm, act friendly, don't get him upset. And later, find out from bloody Dumbledore why his bloody boy-who-lived's acting like a you-know-what.'

--==0==--

Cornelius waited outside the doorway in the cold night. The bus arrived with a squeal of brakes, and a small boy with black hair got out and took delivery of a trunk and owl cage.

“There you are Harry” he said. The bus conductor stared like stunned mullet.

Cornelius put a hand on Harry' Potter's thin shoulder and held him still.

The idiot conductor jumped out and called Harry Potter Neville, of all the outlandish things.

Time to get Harry Potter into a parlour, have some hot tea, and calm him down before something awful happened.

--==0==--

“Albus” said Cornelius, shaking the ash off his robes “What in blue blazes is going on with Harry Potter. He's a bloody .... you-know-what!”

Albus Dumbledore froze in his office chair. Surely Fudge didn't already know. There was no way the hunt could succeed if Lucius Malfoy knew.

“I'm sure I don't know what you mean” said Albus.

“The boy is an Obscurial, Dumbledore. In our premier school. With children from families who Matter all around.” said Fudge, the soot from the floo reminding him of that obscurial-attack-site. A whole building, all those dead bodies. Cornelius took a deep breath and concentrated on looking confident.

“Harry Potter is not an Obscurial” said Albus Dumbledore calmly. [AN: Zing!]

--==0==--

“What's wrong, Cornelius?” asked Dolores in a simpering tone.

“Potter. He's dangerous, and unstable” said Cornelius. ‘I can't say the O-word to Dolores, she probably wouldn't know what I'm talking about and bugger me if I'm spending all day explaining to her. Dangerous and unstable will do.'

“I'll take steps” said Dolores and left the office.

‘That worked well' thought Cornelius, shivering as he remembered the crater, the dead bodies ripped apart.

--==0==--

Albus Dumbledore's fireplace flared green and a tall man in elegant dress robes stepped out.

“You let an Obscurial into Hogwarts” said Lucius Malfoy sharply.

Albus Dumbledore sighed “Harry Potter is not an Obscurial” he said “A troubled young man, yes, but he is perfectly capable of magic.”

“I heard he exploded his muggle aunt” said Lucius.

“Inflated her, and she floated off. She responded well to deflation charms and obliviation “said Albus Dubledore evenly. “Harry is a wizard with a lot of potential, and will doubtless be in the same league as his mother and father. Which is to say, capable of NEWT O's in multiple subjects.”

--==0==---

“Narcissa Darling” said Lucius Malfoy, stepping out of the fireplace at Malfoy Manor”

“Yes Lucy, my little snuggle bunny?” asked Narcissa. Lucius blushed. “Not outside the bedroom dammit!” he said sharply “It's Potter. He's dangerous, a danger to everything. A danger to Draco.”

Narcissa stood ups straighter and her face took on an icy calm “Well” she said sharply “We'll have to give the Prophet some direction. Rita Skeeter will take direction quite simply.”

“Through a cutout” said Lucius Malfoy.

“Heavens' Husband, it's not like I'm a brainless Gryffindor” said Narcissa. “But if he's a threat to Our son, he has to be stopped.”

** Wrote and posted chapter 22 of my primary WIP this week. I'm starting to write chapter 23 and plan to bring Regulus Black out to play. 😁

Summary: After the wizarding world learns of a prophesy that appears to indicate Tom Riddle will vanquish the Dark Lord, everyone expects him to defeat Grindelwald. Once it becomes apparent the prophesy doesn't involve Grindelwald, however, the question arises as to who exactly is the Dark Lord referenced. A slow-build tale told in 3 parts. No smut.

Rating: M mainly for violence.

** struggling a little with my eighth chapter of my dark ron fic, heres a snippet:

”Riddikulus!” 

“Ron!” Ron stepped forward, wondering what his fear would be, before the hair on his neck raised at a familiar voice. 

“Pathetic.” He spit out, words coated in venom. Ron stuttered, taking a shaky step back. “Pathetic. Pathetic!” He yelled. 

“Can't even do a simple spell? Can't even save yourself? Must I do all the work, you /pathetic boy/?” Tom screeched, pointing a pale finger at his face. 

The screeching reminded Ron of something. Something.. unhappy. Of worse times. Times of.. long before him. “Boy!” She shrieked. “You! You foul, demonic boy! Undo what you did, immediately!” 

Ron grit his teeth. This wasn't a fear of his. Could never be. Mrs. Cole was a /pathetic,/ rude, old lady who did nothing but shout and scream and direct her anger at the wrong child. 

“Oh, no need for that, Mrs. Cole.” Ron froze. His blood ran cold, in an icy fury at that damned voice. That tone that was to reassure, to calm, to help, made Ron go mad.

It was not reassuring, it was placating. It was not calming, it made his anger go blinding white. It was not helpful, not at all. The bastard had the audacity, even in boggart form, to let his eyes /fucking twinkle/. 

“Ava---“ Ron stopped himself, biting his tongue in a sudden moment so hard blood filled it. “Riddikulus!”

** Even though I'm a pretty uncreative person I got an idea for a short and somewhat-degenerate smut fic, and wrote a first draft over the last few weeks. Not sure how bad it is because I'm not exactly objective, but regardless I am planning to put it up on FFN after I edit it some more. Hoping that this gives me the guts to write something more substantial. I do have a few ideas for (non smut) fics, but I've never put pen to paper on any of them until now, as it were.

Anyway, the fic I actually wrote has a Hermione MC and centers around Slughorn's Christmas party. Sanguini the vampire goes around the party and uses his vampire mind whammy to get the attendees more hot and bothered for their dates. In the end he gets Hermione hot and bothered for him, and that's the main focus of the fic.

I was thinking about writing another chapter covering Harry and Luna's night together, but not sure if it would be worthwhile. It would pretty much just be a handsier version of the canon chapter followed by a sex scene with little in the way of character development or even much talking, but sometimes I like reading those, so maybe. Actually I'm giving myself an idea for how to make it more meaningful, but now I'm thinking that this would be diluting the fic I set out to write. Anyone have any thoughts or advice on this? I'm very new to this whole thing. Professionally I only do technical writing, and that comes with much more well-defined borders to stay within.

Oh, and I aged everyone up by at least two years, so no named character is under 18. Maybe a hollow gesture, but it makes me feel better.

** 3 years ago I had written 3 chapters of my first fic ever, published them, got lovely reviews, and promptly lost all motivation 😬 But the plot won't leave my head even after all this time so I finally started again, rewrote the first chapters so they're a lot better now, and I've written two more. This time I'll definitely write all the story before posting it, I mostly want to get that plot out of my head at last, having readers comes after (though it is really nice).

** Wrote Chapter 15 and 16 and posted Chapter 12 of my first ever Fanfiction, a Severus and Lily time-traveling story titled: /A Better World/ on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] this week.

Synopsis: Severus is killed by Nagini in the shrieking shack and meets Albus, Lily and his mother Eileen in the afterlife. He is met with a proposal by Albus to go back in time to 1926 with Lily by his side to raise and look after the soon to be born Tom Riddle Jr and ensure that he doesn't end up being a genocidal, maniacal dark wizard. Merope Gaunt and Albus also play central roles in the story outside of the main time-traveling duo of Severus and Lily. It is a Snily, 1920s and onwards AU centered around the two protagonists and their efforts to prevent this world from suffering the same fate as their own.

**** Edit - whelp, made an awkward mess of all of that (thought that maybe deleting the original comment would get rid of the incorrect bot link). Anyway... just published chapter 3 of my first ever fic. Comments welcome (preferably not on my reddit posting abilities)

Nope - not that fic. Although same song reference. This one:

** I've just posted 3 of my first hp fanfiction! It is slash, with the main ship being drarry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29371572/chapters/72151683]]

Summary: Harry Potter has had enough. He's sick of the lies, never being someone's first choice, and hiding himself behind a veil of deceit. The golden boy of Gryffindor is nothing more than a mask to protect himself, but he is done playing games. It's time for Harry to find his place in the world as himself, all while using the fame he oh so ever detests as a powerful weapon. Along the way, he'll find true friends, a loving family, and love where he least expected it.

I would really appreciate feedback of any sorts as I tend to just write as I go!

** Just posted the first chapter of my first ever fanfic on Wattpad!

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/263201825-hogwarts-1975?utm_source=web&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share_myworks][Hogwarts 1975, Chapter One]]

It's a Marauders-era fic starring original characters, but heavily featuring all of the book characters that were around Hogwarts during that era, especially the four marauders and Lily Evans. Similarly to the original Harry Potter books, the main plot will be driven by action, mystery, and friendship, but there are also romantic storylines that will play out slowly over the course of the book.

I'm an aspiring writer of original fiction and right now I'm in my final semester of an MFA program. I've dabbled in fan fiction for fun, but I decided to finally complete a longer project. I'll be posting a new chapter each week until the story is complete. It would make me so happy if you would check it out, and leave a comment with your thoughts/feedback if you do!
