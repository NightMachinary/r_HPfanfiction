** The class was snickering. Even Hermione, usually the one to most visibly disapprove of disruptions, couldn't quite keep the mirth off of her face as it broke through the exasperation. Harry blushed a little - Luna was still a girl, and Harry a teenage boy with, as he was increasingly realizing, raging hormones - but accepted the hug nonetheless.\\
It certainly helped keep his mind off of Umbridge's detention, not to mention it was quite pointless to try and escape a Luna-hug with how hard Luna would try to keep you in it.

Harry knew Luna had a free period that day, during the fifth years' Transfiguration class. He knew she had a philosophy of "hug all your friends at least once a week". He hadn't quite reached the conclusion of "I'm going to get hugged in the middle of class".

She'd caught Ron and Hermione a few hours prior, during a mid-day Prefect patrol, and hugged the stuffing out of them. They'd given her a light admonishment, but hadn't taken any points or assigned detentions - it was an innocent enough action coming from Luna. Harry was just lucky she hadn't picked Harry as her "target" at that moment - he doubted Professor Snape would be quite as tolerant of interruptions during Harry's "remedial Potions" lesson.

"Miss Lovegood, might I ask why you're hugging Mister Potter in the middle of Transfiguration class?"

Luna had just let Harry go, thankfully. Harry knew she probably meant nothing by it, but it was easy to interpret the hug as romantic. Harry wasn't quite sure how he felt about it, or the fact she'd once done it during a class with Dumbledore's Army and it had momentarily driven his mind away from Cho Chang.

"Well, a hug a week keeps the Wrackspurts weak. That's what my daddy says, and he's usually right about those things. I couldn't find Harry any other time of the week and don't want any of my friends to be infested with Wrackspurts, so right now would have to do."

Even /McGonagall/ couldn't suppress a slight smile at this point. Bless her heart, for all Luna's... Luna-ness she was almost impossible to get angry at.

"Well, miss Lovegood, as admirable as your intention to protect your friends from these... Wrackspurts, is, I'll have to take a point from Ravenclaw for interrupting mister Potter's work. Further, if you're intent on being in this classroom, I will interpret it as having learned ahead - so I'm sure you could show this class what the proper incantation is for the Vanishing Spell?"

Luna smiled, and went over to the Professor's desk where a few random oddments were prepared. She'd seen her father do this spell hundreds of times - sometimes a printing press for the Quibbler would accidentally mis-print a page or two of a newspaper - the misprints would start piling up, and her Daddy would give her a recent issue before Vanishing the rest.

Such was the case for the issue of the Quibbler she'd been reading a few weeks prior - Page 4, and only Page 4, had come out of the press upside-down.

"Of course, professor. The incantation is Evanesco, sometimes preceded by a Latin term for the object you're trying to Vanish. The wand-movement is normally a wave over the object, but in the case of trying to Vanish a conjured animal it's simply pointing at the animal in question." She proceeded to demonstrate, quite perfectly, a Vanishing Spell cast on one of the objects on Profesor McGonagall's desk - a small tea-towel that hadn't been handed out for the lesson.

Professor McGonagall awarded three points to Ravenclaw at that, and Harry mused that Luna was probably the only student in Hogwarts history to interrupt a Transfiguration class and earn more points than she'd lost. Luna gave Harry another short hug to his embarrassment and secret joy, then skipped over to the empty table next to his to continue practicing the charm as though she'd belonged in the class.

Harry's year was shaping up to be very interesting - and "interesting" wasn't always a bad thing.

Welp, I only went and did it again. In my head, this was a lot shorter than it ended up being written out.

There's some Harry/Luna there if you squint, but mostly I just wanted to focus on Luna being entirely Luna and just randomly handing out hugs to people she considers friends.

** Harry didn't even so much as flinch when Luna wrapped him up in a hug. This was Luna, Luna liked hugs, Luna was a friend.

The first few times Luna had tried to hug him, he had flinched away. She had immediately stopped, blinked up at him with large and knowing eyes, and declared him to be covered in some strange and invisible creatures.

Apparently, the only way to deal with these specific creatures was to gradually increase physical contact at whatever rate he felt comfortable with.

Then she stuck out her hand for a quick handshake.

They had slowly gone from a simple handshake to a handshake with shoulder touching, to Luna asking for hugs and accepting when he said no, and she made sure he knew he could always say no to her hugs.

Finally, finally, they had reached the point where she could hug him like she would anyone else. Provided she didn't come up from behind, that was.

/This/ however was new.

"Mister Potter, what exactly is Miss Lovegood doing?" McGonagall questioned, seeming just as confused as he was.

"...Hugging me, Professor," he replied, carefully setting his wand down.

"And why is she doing this during your Transfiguration class?" asked McGonagall.

"I have no idea," he answered honestly.

"The Nargles said you needed a hug, quickly," Luna explained, letting him go and turning to McGonagall, "I'm sorry, Professor. But they were ever so insistent that I needed to give Harry Potter a hug as fast as I could."

Harry could, privately, admit, that he had been feeling like dogshit and that Luna's hug had made him feel a bit better.

"Two points from Ravenclaw for disrupting a class," McGonagall said, but the corner of her mouth was twitching, "and a point to Ravenclaw for care given to a friend. Next time, please wait until after class."

"Yes, Professor," Luna curtsied, a move that had anyone else had done it would have been almost sarcastic, before turning back to the class and waving, "Bye, Harry Potter, bye Hermione, bye Ronald, bye Fifth Years."

And she skipped from the room.

Harry fought a smile, picking his wand back up, and shaking his head fondly.

** *Harry*

Harry walked into Transfiguration class, just as the bell was ringing. Luna was /still/ clinging to him, her forehead pressed against his shoulder.

"Mister Potter?" Professor McGonagall asked. "What, exactly is Miss Lovegood doing?"

"...Hugging me, Professor," Harry said weakly. As if on cue, Luna readjusted her arms so that she was pressed to Harry's chest instead of his shoulder.

"And why is she doing this in your Transfiguration class?"

"I have no idea," Harry said. He felt his ears begin to burn. If Luna got him in trouble over this, he was not going to be happy.

"Miss Lovegood," Professor McGonagall said, her lip thinning. "Isn't there somewhere you're supposed to be?"

"I have a free period," Luna said serenely. "There's no rule that states that I cannot sit in on another class, even if I'm not in the year."

"Yes," Professor McGonagall said. "But the rules also state that you cannot disrupt my class."

"I understand Professor," Luna said. "So I will be silent while you lecture."

*Ron*

"Loony, get off of my Won-won, right now!"

"Ron doesn't like to be called that," Luna said, snuggling into Ron's chest. Oh, bloody hell. "You should refrain from doing so."

"Refrain? Loony, you can't keep making up your own words!"

"Stop calling her Loony," Ron said weakly. He glanced down at Luna. She was staring up at him with huge silvery eyes.

"I'll stop calling her that, when she stops behaving this way. She's a freak," Lavender said. "C'mon, Won-won, there's better people to be friends with than /her./"

"Oy!" Ron said. "She's standing right here!"

"Oh, like she's smart enough to realize that nobody can stand her," Lavender said. "It's not as if she really matters, Won-won. She's not as strong or talented as you..."

Luna tightened her hug. Ron frowned.

"Lavender, I want to break up."

*Ginny*

"I have to say, I think I prefer hugging someone my own height," Luna said. "Your brother and Harry are both so much taller than me."

"It is nice," Ginny agreed. "When Mum made me hug my brothers when I was small, they would tease me--Fred once used hugging as an excuse to pick me up and put me on the coat rack."

"That does seem bothersome," Luna said. "But in general, I do like hugging. There's a sort of comfort that only exists in hugs."

"Right then," Ginny said. She glanced down. "Luna, did someone hide your shoes, /again/?"

"Yes," Luna said. "But given that it's Saturday and it's late May, I find it far less inconvenient than usual."

*Neville*

"Oy!"

"Neville, hold still!"

"Ginny, how did Luna talk you into hugging me with her?"

"The Nargles are swarming in your brain, Neville," Luna said. "Hugging is a remedy."

** Hermione looked at Harry's face. The first time it had happened, his face had been nothing but embarrassed pleading for help. The second time he had relaxed into it and hugged back with an expression of resigned acceptance. The look on his face as Luna had quietly snuggled into his side - after somehow simply appearing in the Gryffindor common room - bordered on affectionate. Hermione felt a sudden creeping wrongness slither through her, and she closed the book and put down her quill.

Luna's eyes met hers, and a shock of realization stiffened her spine. Luna's eyes were not soft and dreamy the way Luna's eyes were. No, the gaze that pierced Hermione straight through said very plainly "If you won't, I will."

Panic seeped into Hermione from that look, and she knew that Luna was right. She had to do something, or someone would take him away from her. Oh sure, Harry would say that they would always be best friends, they would always stay in touch, but she knew that wouldn't happen. They would talk less and less, then letters would dwindle, and then suddenly they'd discover they hadn't thought about each other in ten years.

Besides all that, his friendship wasn't all she wanted, and she had been increasingly forced to recognize that fact in the last year.

She rose from her chair feeling sick and giddy and slightly disoriented with what she was about to do, but clenched her fists against it. 'Brave, Hermione. Be brave.' she told herself.

Harry sat facing front on the sofa with Luna next to him and her arms around him. She removed Luna's arms from him and gently pushed her aside.

"Hermione, what are -" Harry asked with a slight frown.

She straddled his lap and held his face between her hands, then slowly and deliberately captured his lips with hers.

Luna smiled quietly.

** I'm not too experienced with writing fanfictions, but here goes a little snippet...

It was a lazy Tuesday in July, and Harry Potter was trying his hardest to focus on the Transfiguration lesson he was currently having. The room was stiflingly hot, and the heat from the sun in the window directly behind him warmed his back wonderfully. He gazed down at his notes.

/The Vanishing Spell, Evanesco, vanishes any object, whether it's inanimate or living. The more complex a creature is, the harder it will be to vanish.../

/Looks like I couldn't vanish myself out of this lesson,/ Harry ruminated idly.

In the row of desks ahead of him, Hermione was crouched low in her chair, jabbing Ron's shoulder with her quill and speaking in a low and angry murmur. Harry couldn't quite decipher the words, but Ron's slouched posture and lolling head told him the rough gist of her admonishments.

Harry suppressed a chuckle. /Looks like it's another night copying Hermione's notes in front of the fire for Ron. Not that he seems to mind the fire. Or Hermione./

The classroom door creaked open, and a small draft of cool air swept blissfully across his back. Harry felt his eyelids beginning to droop, and immediately ground the end of his quill against his forehead. /Last time you slept through a lesson, you had to do three inches more of Snape's potions essay than everyone else... don't do it again.../ Harry silently rebuked himself.

'Want to copy some of my notes, Harry?' Dean Thomas muttered quietly from beside him, sliding a piece of parchment between their desks. Harry grinned gratefully at Dean: setting Dean's parchment aside, he was just about to start writing when a familiar Irish lilt whispered in his ear.

'Afternoon, Harry.'

Harry had just enough time to recognise the voice and wonder whether he'd survive the ensuing embarrassment before a crushing bear hug enveloped him, and the blonde-haired head of Luna Lovegood buried itself in his shoulder. Harry turned his head as far as Luna's embrace would allow: Dean next to him looked halfway between mirth and surprise, Hermione was biting her lip in sympathy, and Ron shot him a wink and a smirk that Harry would have responded to with a rude hand gesture, if he could've extricated his fingers from where they were awkwardly pinned under Luna's stomach.

The hugs had started when they'd got back from the Christmas holidays. Luna seemed happier, freer almost, and started hugging those she considered friends. Neville had been the first recipient of an impromptu Luna hug on a frosty January morning - she'd come up to him in the courtyard wrapped up in a scarf and jacket, and, without so much as a word, slung her arm around his neck and hugged him. Since then, she'd hugged a rotating schedule of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville once a week, at any random time.

Harry's mind flitted to Neville receiving that first hug. He had looked faintly mortified: they'd all been too polite to mention Neville's long-standing crush on Luna, although he assured them he was interested in someone else now, and Hermione's gossip from the girls in her dorm seemed to confirm it, although nobody knew exactly who. Harry privately hoped none of Neville's crush still lingered, but who could tell? Why had she chosen to give Neville the first hug? Was he conveniently just /there/ at the time or was there something else between them?

Harry snapped himself out of his daze, uncomfortably aware of Luna's earthy, grassy scent pressing into his shoulder. /Stop thinking about her. I thought we agreed to stop thinking about her./ he told his brain. /I didn't expect it to be so hard!/ his brain seemed to reply. /Wait. Merlin, don't think about hard-/

The truth was, Harry uncomfortably realised, was that he didn't know where this Luna had come from. The Luna whose smile made him stop thinking for a while, who he kept finding himself returning to in DA lessons long after she'd succeeded at the spell, who - and Harry was embarrassed to admit it - had appeared in his dreams several times now in the place of Cho Chang.

But he couldn't admit his attraction. He'd made that mistake with Ginny at the Burrow last summer, and her polite, yet firm rejection still rung in his ears. He wondered how her and Kevin Entwistle were getting along: a few months ago he'd have chased the thought of them together round his mind for hours, but the recent appearance of Luna in his head seemed to banish those thoughts, and suddenly all he could think about was how Luna hugged him tighter and longer than anyone else.

A twittering and giggling roused Harry from his thoughts. People were starting to look round and stare, and he felt his cheeks burn with the blush of embarrassment. Luna was, as usual, completely nonplussed.

'Mr. Potter, what on earth is the commotion back there? What...oh.' McGonagall called as she saw Luna holding Harry in a near-death grip hug. At this, her eyes got the same knowing glint as Ron's, and Harry wanted nothing more than to melt into his chair.

The Slytherins grinned evilly at him, and Draco Malfoy stared him right in the eye as he crowed to the class: 'Potter's going out with Loony Lovegood, the nutter and the whacko. Aren't you two just perfect-'

'Mr. Malfoy, I was under the impression that that you were a student of this school, not the living embodiment of Peeves the poltergeist. Kindly leave your childish taunts unsaid in my classroom.' Professor McGonagall snapped coldly. Then she turned to Harry and Luna, with a look in her eyes that was somewhere between reproachful and amused.

'Mr. Potter, what, pray tell, is Miss Lovegood doing?' she asked.

'Er... Hugging me, Professor?' Harry mumbled.

'And why on Earth is she doing so during a Transfiguration class that she is quite clearly not supposed to be in?' McGonagall continued.

At this moment, Luna finally seemed to notice the classroom of people staring at her. She unclasped Harry from her grip and addressed McGonagall, oblivious to her rumpled hair and reddened cheeks.

'Sorry, Professor McGonagall, I was just giving Harry some support. He needs a hug once a week, just like the rest of my friends.' Luna replied composed ly. Harry glanced around, noting the mingled expressions of sympathy and mirth on his classmates' faces.

'Indeed. Unfortunately, Mr. Potter is currently in a lesson, and I must ask you to leave the classroom before you disrupt this lesson yet further, Miss Lovegood.' McGonagall responded, her stare somewhat softer than it had been two minutes ago.

'Of course, Professor.' Luna chirped back, and began to smooth the creases in her shirt.

'Thanks, Luna.' Harry whispered to her as she headed for the door.

'Anytime, Harry.' Luna beamed back before closing the classroom door, and leaving Harry to a more interesting Transfiguration lesson than the one he'd started.

** Reminds me of The House of Potter Rebuilt.

Hermione sets up guest lectures by Gryffindor alumni. Arthur talks about how the Ministry works, Celestia Warbeck talks about careers in the arts. There's a former editor of the Prophet that speaks.
