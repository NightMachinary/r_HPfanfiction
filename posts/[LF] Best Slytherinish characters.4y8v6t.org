So, I've been watching House of Cards recently, and Frank Underwood, at least in the first few episodes (I'm still in the first season, and a bit wary of where it's headed, really), is the epitome of Slytherin as it is described. Clever, ruthless, pragmatic, ambitious, cunning, manipulative... What's very striking, however, is how he doesn't fall prey to the classic villain tropes that JK Rowling constantly forces her Slytherins into. No oversharing of plans, no pride getting in the way of his manipulations.

I'd really, really like to see more characters of this type. Whether the character is sorted into Slytherin or not, and even if the character in question isn't the main character. Even if it's not a constant thing (canon Hermione comes to mind as having some impressively Slytherin moments without /being/ a Slytherin). I don't really care what sort of story this character occurs in, so long as it's well written (book recs are also welcome if they occur to you).


** In linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by broomvroomshroom), Tom is a true slytherin. He doesn't scare people (much) and he's an all around pleasant person. On the outside only of course. Besides the banter between Tom and Jerry makes it really funny but not overbearing.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** Hermione never had Slytherin moments. She only know how to learn a book and use it after. She is intelligent not really clever.

*** Umm... I think you've been reading too much bashing fanfic. Hermione is plenty clever. Whether you approve of it or not, her handling of Skeeter with the jar and leading Umbridge to the centaur are both very Slytherin. You don't have to /like/ her, but she's a well rounded, well written character.

Also, replying to a nearly week old post just to gripe about an example I gave? Immature and irrelevant. Don't be such a pest.

**** In my opinion, putting a beetle in a jar is not clever. And she could have handle the Umbridge situation better than that (she almost killed her and could have landed in Azkaban).

And if you don't like someone giving his opinion on Reddit don't post here. Don't be such a pansy.

***** I don't care that your opinions are ludicrous. They're about fiction.

However, just as there are times in real life when your comments would be unwelcome for being irrelevant and obnoxious, so too on reddit.

[[/r/hpfanfiction]] has discussion threads. This is a fic request thread. In a fic request thread commenters recommend fanfic and perhaps there is some discussion about the fics recommended. This thread was flaired REQUEST and also used LF to say 'looking for'.

The subreddit also has DISCUSSION threads. These are flaired with DISCUSSION, and are phrased in a way to encourage discussion. In those threads, it is reasonable to comment with your opinions, although stupid ones will still elicit snide responses and downvotes.

Let us also touch on thread age. While recommending a fic is welcome even for very old REQUEST threads (although sadly fewer people will see it then), DISCUSSION threads will tend to quiet down over time. It is expected that people will make a new thread to discuss things if the old one is dead but there is much more to say (if you try to revive it when people are done with the topic or it's too recent, they will ignore you). If you transgress those expectations, people will either ignore you or make their irratation clear.

Hopefully this helps you understand when your comments are appropriate, and spares you the embarrassment of making a fool of yourself.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
