It's been on my mind for some reason and I can't seem to find it anywhere. I've re read several firs just to find it. What I remember isn't much.

- it's some sort of marriage Fic. I don't think it's a marriage law Fic but maybe it is. I think Draco manipulates her into the marriage somehow or perhaps his parents manipulate it. I'm not real sure.

- This is the part that stands out... During the ceremony the touch wands and sparks of color fly out. The different colors all mean something and it's suppose to give them and their guest and idea of what to expect from their marriage. More than one color shoots out but in the end they get a rare Gold light I think that suppose to mean real true love is possible. The guest are shocked becuse it's so rare and none of them have seen it at a wedding before.

- After married they of course are fighting each other and making each other lives difficult. However, they eventually decide to give it a real shot and try for that gold light to come true.

- it might not have ever been finished. I'm pretty sure it was still a WIP when I read it but I'd love to remember the title just to see if it's finished now.


** Do you remember around when you read the fic? I was just reading Blood and it has a marriage scene where gold sparks occur (this signifies the amount of compatibility between the two) and Hermione is effectively drugged into marrying him ... the first fic is finished, though it doesn't end on a conclusion, and the sequel is not finished (I have not read the sequel).

*** It's not Blood. Thanks for trying though. Several different colors shoot out. Ones that signfy disharmony and struggle but apparently those are common b/c all coupes fight. Then they get colors for passion and friendship and then finally the shocked of true love or should mates or something. Molly was a guest at the wedding and she starts explaini g the colors and how every couple dreams of getting the gold light they did but it rarely ever happens.

It had to be at least 7 - 10 years ago. Maybe even before book seven came out. I started reading fanfic after book 6 to fill a void left by that revelation. I mostly stuck to cannon couples back then but ended up stumbling upon a post HBP story that involved Draco and then I fell in love with Dramione fics.

**** Well then I don't think I've ever heard of it! That doesn't ring any bells from fics back in the day. Good luck finding it... I've been searching for a fic that I'm sure is around 8-9 years old (at least that's when I re,ember reading it) but I don't remember enough about it to get anywhere! I'm pretty much the same- always been more into canon fic but delve into Dramione every now and then (where I referred my romance to come from)!

***** Yea, I've pretty much given up. Plus a lot of the old HP sites have closed down now. So if it was never finished its highly likely it doesn't exist anymore.

Cannon doesn't hold much appeal to me anymore especially if it's post Book seven. The story was completed and nothing can be anywhere near as good. So I'd rather read a divergence of the books like AUs and possibilities of what could have happened if one thing was changed.

Although I have had a hard time reading Harry without Ginny (if it's the main pairing). I can read Harry and others if he isn't the main focus. It's wierd cause while I agree with a lot of people on the lack of development and how Harry feelings seemed to come out of nowhere... They make complete since to me as a couple. Harry falling for Ginny and marrying her gave him the one thing he had always been craving. Family. A big family that loves him and wants him.

****** Was it not on ff.net? I know mine was there so I'm pretty certain it's still around unless the author deleted it themselves

To me that's still canon in a weird way - depending on what the one change is. In spite of your comment you may like a few I've been reading lately: Laocoon's Children (which is not complete but the author mapped out what would've been written had they finished it) about what if Remus/Sirius were together the night Lily and James died and eventually adopted Harry at age 8 - it's much better than how I'm making it sound. The Innocent Series - again where Sirius adopts Harry around age 7 or 8, this follow canon a lot more than Laocoon's Children (The Golden Trio + a Draco manipulated by his mother and Severus to become more Gryffindor vs. Laocoon's children is Harry, Draco, Neville, and Padma). There are other great recs I have if you're interested :)

I agree about Harry and Ginny, I tend to stray from fics where Harry doesn't end up with her (though I need a very well written fic to really follow and get into non-Hinny, which some have done!). But I think JK did set it up quite well. In OotP there are many Hinny moments that either aren't very discernible unless you're rereading or easy to look the other way. In addition to this, I think JK makes Ginny a really formidable witch in the background of GoF/OotP/HPB - while she's widely ignored in PoA though that book has very little character development beyond the trio/the Marauders. She becomes a lot more than just a pretty face that Cho was and is a friend and an accomplice to Harry, Ron, and Hermione more than any other character is. She takes Fred and George's place in a lot of ways in Harry's life. I thought it was pretty natural and I thought it was going to happen from OotP.
