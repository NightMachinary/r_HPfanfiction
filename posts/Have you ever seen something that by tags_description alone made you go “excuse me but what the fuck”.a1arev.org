*** It's fucking weird.People often request shit that is just creepy like ‚Äúcheating home wrecker Hermione(rape counts as cheating, Harry has sex with the mom's of HP(for mother's day),Harry has sex with the human personification of his wand.Decent upvotes

People request slash,not the weird shit like Drarry but the classy stuff.Well as classy as you can get while writing gay Harry Potter fanfiction.Like 50% upvoted and as controversial as the Snarry requests and other messed up stuff.

I read Game of Thrones---meaning I'm not so faint-of-heart that I can't handle incest if it HAS to be there. But this pair went completely against my idea of Lily's character, and I was annoyed that someone took a very noble protection spell and decided that was ground for a rare-pair.
