So! I'm looking for fanfics where harry meets other versions of himself. Like in one fanfic that I read (i don't remember the name) where he is an slytherin and he has power of ice and shit and for reason met with canon harry.

Do you know of any where he mets like that? I really would love to read the interaction betwen them.

Thanks!


** Yeah, there's a fic by FalconLux on Ao3, I think it's called The Many Faces of Harry Potter. It's really good but be warned, FalconLux has like so many WIP's literally all his works are, but some guy continued it, so yeah.
