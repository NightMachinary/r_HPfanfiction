So, I was playing Plague Inc, with a Shadow Plague; that's the one where you play as a vampire who releases a brainwashing virus to subjugate humanity.

Now, normally the thing you do (or at least, I do) in that scenario is be super-sneaky, move your vampire around to spread the Plague wide, then evolve Shadow Slaves to quickly wipe out all resistance.

What I did this time, though, was, I had my vampire use Blood Rage to collect a ton of DNA points, powered him up a lot, and then when Templar Industries appeared (your main opponent in the scenario), I sent him around to wipe them all out. And, here's the thing, since I /hadn't/ evolved the Shadow Plague at all, no cure research was going on, so that meant I could collect DNA points at leisure while wiping out the main source of cure research and anti-infection.

If you didn't understand that, don't worry, I'm just explaining where I got my idea from. My X Bad Guy went around the world, pre-emptively killing off whoever was a threat to him before releasing a plague to subjugate humanity.

So...does anyone know any fics with this plot? A Dark Lord, possibly Voldemort, is going around and killing targets with seemingly little to no connection to each other; the heroes of the story have to find his lair and figure out what his ultimate plan is and how the killings factor into it, before it's too late?
