**** I've always interpreted this as there being different kinds of love potions, with the milder ones being sold freely and the stronger ones being more regulated.

Anything that comes close to mind-control is icky, but I'd be way more ok with teens buying a potion that may make someone else more likely to view them in a positive light than something that makes another person fall in love with them.

I could also see a market for lust potions (spice up your private life) and “joke” love potions, where the reaction is so over the top that it's immediately obvious to everyone around. The joke thing would need pretty heavy restrictions to be ok, though. It's way too easy to imagine scenarios in which they could be abused.

Possible restrictions for lovepotions could be: always superseded by real love, inability to perform sexual acts while under the influence of a love potion, alcohol and the potion cancelling each other out, repeated consumption reduces effectiveness,...

****** Of course, but that kind of goes along with my head canon of there being multiple kinds of love potions with different effects. Without those kinds of restrictions on at least some potions, the Weasleys are straight up selling super-powered magical roofies to minors, which is very morally questionable.

So my solution for this is to assume that Fred and George sell more “harmless”, milder potions, while Merope went all out on Riddle Senior.

***** a specific ingredient in love potions that is vital to them working that sadly acts as an anti viagra for men and makes them completely flacid. The substance is so strong that kissing someone who has consumed the potion will effect the male also. The effects of love potions are strong enough that someone under it's control will have extreme urges to kiss the person to show there love.

The ones in Fred and Georges shop could be a perfume that makes the user appear more attractive but in the end is used like make up or a low cut top and onlycapable of gaining attention.

They are important to the plot in the book for the purpose of making Voldemort even weirder by being the product of a squib raping a muggle.

The potion itself is barely touched on in canon and people just take it as a potion of mild difficulty that causes complete love to the person it is keyed to. Really it could be a fairly weak potion that has similar effects as alcohol by dulling someones mind and effecting decission making processes. It could also be extremely obvious to someone else that the potion is in use. It's effects could be mild on a magical person but completely controlling when given to a muggle. The potion could be incredibly difficult to brew and poisonous if done wrong so many do not risk it in case they poison the person they want to love them.

In the case of Merope Gaunt it is not known exactly what she gave Tom Sr just that it was assumed to be a powerful love potion. For all we know she could have used a dark ritual that sacrificed her ability to properly concieve children to cause Tom Sr to love her but the ritual is not permanent thus Tom Sr kicks her out and Tom Jr is born with severe brain damage.

No shit it has mythologies from the real world, congratulations. When I asked why it would be weird to omit rape potions, you said:

"Yes, it would be weird to use every bit of mythology except love potions".

There's plenty of mythologies from the real world that aren't in the books. There's no medusa, there's no cyclops, there's no chupacabra, there's no "magical beans"... the list goes on and on. You can't pick and choose some mythologies and then claim she uses enough (or "every bit", as you said) that it justifies including rape potions... that doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Whoa boy, I really hope you can keep up with this: it's different because the logic behind the killing curse being unblockable was that death was inevitable, not something "all life will know". I mean, all life will also know what it's like to consume energy, meaning some form sustenance is inevitable (otherwise the lifeform wouldn't be alive), but wizards still can't conjure up food.

There's plenty of things that are inevitable. Using the inevitability of death as an excuse to not be able to block the killing curse is both lazy and illogical - why is it possible to block a full body bind curse? It's inevitable that "all living things" won't be able to move by their own will at some point. The inevitability argument doesn't make sense.

If you check [[https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/864axe/i_just_found_the_link_to_the_university_of/][old, historical children stories,]] you'll find them to be generally much more brutal than what's currently being printed for the same age brackets.

Regarding the "rape-potions": [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LovePotion/Literature][love potions]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_magic][love magic]] are a common motif in the folklore of many different ethnicities. And it would've been surprising if they weren't, really. Many people would either be ending up with a partner they didn't want or fail to end up with one that they did want. So naturally being able to "love-charm" the object of love-interest would be a common fantasy and thus folklore.

And if you want to criticise JKR for "rape potions", then at least be consistent and criticise her setting all the way through:

#+begin_quote
  Avada Kedavra
#+end_quote

she introduces a murdering spell

#+begin_quote
  Crucio

#+begin_quote
  Cheering Charm
#+end_quote

Is she condoning drug addiction and antidepressant epidemic?

TL;DR is that if someone overanalyses a childrens' book series, --- one the setting of which is based on historical motifs and tropes, --- through the prism of outrage culture for long enough, then /of course/ they'll find things to be offended or outraged about. But if we (or the author) sterilised the story to remove everything potentially offensive from it disregarding the context of the culture and intent, we'd be left with an insipid husk of a setting that's not fun to even think about too long, let alone to read as a series of books.

p.s. JKR actually toned down her [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_witchcraft#%22Witch%22_stock_character][source material]] by quite a bit by removing (or at least making it not directly cross the main character's field of awareness) things like pacts with the Devil, orgies, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel#Plot][cannibalism,]] etc from the adaptation.

  And if you want to criticise JKR for "rape potions", then at least be consistent and criticise her setting all the way through:

First of all, let's be clear - the way JKR's "love potions" work makes them literally rape potions. Not "love potions" in any way, shape or form.

Secondly, I'm not criticizing her for introducing them, she can do whatever she wants to. I'm saying I don't understand the choice, and I'm arguing against people who say that it "makes sense" because "love is a major theme of the books", as if a rape potion has anything to do with love.

Thirdly, even if I wanted to, I can't criticize one aspect of worldbuilding just because I'm not /actively/ criticizing the rest? How do you know I don't have anything against the rest of the spells you listed? You're arguing a strawman, yet again. I never said anything about the rest of the spells. And for the record, I hate the Killing Curse because it ruins a lot of otherwise potentially cool duels where now instead every bad guy just uses that because it's so over powered.

I don't have any problem with Imperius or Obliviate or anything like that. They're not the same as rape potion. You can theoretically rape someone using Imperius (never canonically stated, maybe people wold resist at that point, but whatever), but a rape potion is /specifically/ for raping.

Furthermore, Imperio is /illegal/ in the wizarding world, whereas rape potions are apparently not only barely frowned upon, but Fred and George can freely sell it to hormonal and horny teenagers, no questions asked.

  She didn't have to.

#+end_quote

That choice was perfectly consistent with the core spirit of HP-verse throughout the series --- that being a reflection of centuries-old folklore, as well as its morals and notions (I'd reckon also mixed with some criticism towards real-life Great Britain). Book 1 had a hag selling dubious nails and hair, quidditch with its Bludgers and falls from great heights, and a school being used as a bait for VD; book 2 had polyjuice, bone-vanishing Lockhart, and a Basilisk; book 3 had an unsecured magically contagious werewolf professor hidden from parents and the board of governors; book 4 had obliviation of muggles with no regard for their rights or safety, DE muggle-baiting with no repercussions, and an extrajudicial execution; book whatever had the Zabini getting away with a long chain of dead husbands; book 5 had ministry-approved child torture.

Magical Britain's society is not intended to be described as a rightous one, or even one "in sync" with modern Western morals and ideals. Love potions get smuggled into the castle for the same reason why the Weasley twins are testing on the lower year students their products and getting away with it: wizards (of Magical Britain, at least) don't much care about muggle-based morals, they have their own perspective. And cherry-picking out love potions while leaving everything else intact would've made no sense and just censored the characters to look less like themselves.

1) You are confusing [[https://imgur.com/a/3eObLmd][aphrodisiacs]] that are intended to increase the consumer's libido (like the cheering charm is intended to make the target cheer up) with Amortentia and its effects of obsessiveness / false love. Varieties of the former were what I assume the twins were smuggling, and the latter was what was used as a plot device in VD's background story. I am assuming being able to handle libido fluctuations (in the sense that if you fail then it's on you --- see characters' reactions to people overwhelmed by Veela allure) is expected from wizards and witches just as it's expected that they'll bounce off the ground when dropped from a window as a baby. 2) Counterargument scenario: a pureblood pair has to merry each other when neither likes the other. Love potions (of both varieties) help both of them throughout their marriage.

I assumed that you wouldn't have found so many things problematic, because otherwise you wouldn't be interested in HP at all. The fault is mine, so I apologise.

Because they all look like pieces of the same consistent characterisation of wizards and their magical abilities to me (see above).

*** Seeing that mind control spells such as the Imperius curse and mind control potions such as amortentia are heavily regulated, it's unlikely that "rape potions" are legal... Or +Araki+ JKR forgot 🤷🏻‍♂️

** That's part of the backstory in the dead fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2905557/1/Heir-of-Slytherin][Heir of Slytherin]]. The reason why is one of the more disturbing aspects of the fic.

  Voldemort needs to find a worthy Heir in order to assume the title of Lord Slytherin. Fortunately, he planned ahead, and his grandson Harry Potter is the perfect candidate. Sort of Severitus. Rating is for Sirius' pottymouth. No pairings.

** I was never really able to picture Snape as a rapist. Sure, I can see him get the thought during his active DE days, but I could never see him go through with it.

I remember one Severitus fic where they wiĺlingly fed each other love potions (Snape was gay -- probably specifically to absolve him of wrongdoing here because I think the fic was gen otherwise) for a day for the purpose of "artificial" insemination. James was sterile. Even in such a "harmless" (morality-wise) case, I was still rather disturbed by it.

*** That sounds like a wacky idea for a fic, but could be interesting in execution. Care to share a link?

I do agree that the idea is disturbing. I don't think that such a scenario could ever really be "harmless" in real life because human beings are too prone to emotional baggage. That's one of the reasons that people opt for medical methods of artificial insemination instead of actually sleeping with the semen donor. I've read some fics which had fanon spells or potions that functioned like artificial insemination, plus Lily should have enough muggle roots to be aware of the non-magical options in the 80s, so I'd consider it unlikely that she would settle on sleeping with her gay friend as the only viable choice.
