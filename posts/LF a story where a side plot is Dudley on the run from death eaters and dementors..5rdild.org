  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year
