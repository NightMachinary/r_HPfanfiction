If voldemort can fill a lake with infari to protect a horcrux, then why couldn't he fight with them too.


** Not quite what you were looking for, but in the first part of linkffn (2680093) a necromancer allied to Voldemort basically turned Great Britain into a zombie apocalypse with a few demon-like things for extra.
