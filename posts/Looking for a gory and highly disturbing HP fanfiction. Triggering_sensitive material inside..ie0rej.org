:END:
I read this about years ago. I remember muggleborns and kids from blood traitors were kidnapped by Voldemort and were then used as toys/entertainment. I'm not sure if they were going to be soldiers.

I remember Hermione being forced to eat her parents.

Ron was among the kidnapped.

Harry was taken and was Voldemort personal toy.

Somehow they are all rescued and taken to Hogwarts for school and "reintegration". Don't remember what happens to Voldemort.

I remember either Susan Bones or Hannah Abbot ate glass to kill herself cuz she couldn't deal with all she lived through.

Obviously the trio is unhinged and broken.

I think Hermione lost an eye.

It's a really dark tale, I know I read it on ff.net, but I can't find it.


** I was eating thank you very much

** That sounds super fucked up and I thought mudbloods at hogwarts was bad. If that was on ffn it probably got taken down.

*** Yeah. It is. And it haunts me still and I can't take it out my head :|

I guess it was taken down, easily, but for the chances anyone else read it...

**** I'm the same way with mudbloods at hogwarts. Mainly cause as fucked up as it is to the point I have to stop reading at points I want to know how it turns out. Not sure if the writer has plans to continue it or not
