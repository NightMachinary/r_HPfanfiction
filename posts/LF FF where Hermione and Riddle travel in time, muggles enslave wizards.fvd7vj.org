I'm looking for a particular, unfinished ff. Through time travel, Hermione meets Tom Riddle, then the both of them are kinda thrown out in different times, mostly in future, and the time travel spins out of their control. There is a third, original character, who at first seems just like an inventor of the time manipulation technology, but turns out to be more essential to the plot.

Some other important moments that I remember

Hermione meets her older self during her death

Riddle and Hermione end up exposing the wizardly world. In aftermatch, muggles enslave wizards

I've spent months looking for this one and all I find is some classic tomione. Would love to read that one now that I have so much spare time.
