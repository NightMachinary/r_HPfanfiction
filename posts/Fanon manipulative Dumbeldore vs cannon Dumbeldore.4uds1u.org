It's been almost a decade since I have read the books and over the past couple of years I have read a lot of fanfiction. Now I am almost confusing fanon with canon. Are there any indications in the books that Dumbeldore is manipulative or evil or even of "the greater good" trope. I remember there was one at the end of ootp.


** Here's the thing. Good writing has characters that are multi dimensional. Having one character be the epitome of good with no flaws would make for boring reading. Having a character have no motivations for their evil would be boring reading. Humans are complex, and have many layers.

Rowling did the thing where she wrote in subtle clues about a character in the character's actions. For example, you see Ron eating copious amounts of food. Where did Ron grow up? At the Burrow, where there were FIVE brothers ahead of him. I know a guy who had a similar situation (his parents are devout Catholic), and he does the same thing. Part of it is because the mother is constantly like "Eat, eat, eat!" Part of it is that if you don't load up your plate early on, you won't get enough of the thing you like. You'll always get enough /food/. But there are certain things that you prefer that you won't get a chance at if you don't load up early and get it down your face hole.

She never explicitly mentions why she's making Ron that way, but it's clear to anyone who knows people from large families that the sort of thing tends to happen.

Same goes for Albus. He's an overall good character, but has things about his personality that come from his history, his upbringing, and various other things that you don't quite put together until you read the last book. Yes, he wants to defeat the evil of Voldemort. Yes, he should have given Harry more information earlier on. Yes, it was a shit move to not let Harry choose for himself the path of fighting Voldemort.

However, I don't know that I'd see those actions as explicitly manipulative, as much as I see it as part of the guy's character. He's the oldest son of a family where one of the children had problems early on. He'd have had to grow up entirely way too quickly. His boyfriend ended up being evil, and sort of crazy. He killed Grindewald. He has had to make choices, over and over again, that sacrificed his needs and well-being for the immediate, pressing needs of the people around him.

Part of the burden of having such great power at your beck and call is that you have to use it to protect the innocent, and those who can't defend themselves. You start seeing it as the default way to think, live, and be.

Like any parent figure, Dumbledore did exactly what he thought was best for his charges. Like any parent figure, Dumbledore made mistakes. He's a complex character.

Now take that character, and put him in the hands of someone who's not a skilled writer. You get the person writing Ron as a glutton, who thinks about nothing but food all day. It's not that Ron is a glutton; he's interested in many things, but will eat heartily when food is in front of him. It'll take Hermione, who loves to learn new things, and read, and turn her into an insufferable, smug know-it-all. She was never smug in the books, but rather (frequently) exasperated and frustrated that others didn't see the most basic (to her mind) things that were staring them right in the face. You take Dumbledore, and turn him into some kind of evil spider, sat in the middle of his web, pulling the strings of everyone around him.

Dumbledore WAS manipulative. He saw to it that Harry was raised far away from the Wizarding world. He wanted to make sure that Harry didn't get an inflated head early on. Someone with a huge sense of self-importance wouldn't be as willing to choose the path of self-sacrifice or being helpful as would someone who's well aware of the limitations of his abilities and self. Look at Draco Malfoy. It took him until book 6 to realise that he was in WAY over his head. That one was raised with the thought that he was hot shit, and something special. He behaved like it too.

Just when shit got real around book 5, Dumbledore peaced out, and didn't have any contact with Harry. By this point, he had to let Harry see the depths of what happens when someone who thinks she's doing it for everyone's own good starts to drink her own kool-aid. Or, he was protecting his own hide. Or, he was literally unable to do anything else.

The thing about someone's motivations and thought processes is that you can't quite know exactly what it is until after the person examines it, and tells you what it is. Unfortunately, a poor writer will see that, and be ham-fisted when it comes to the characterisation.

**** Exactly! But why can't it be both, you know? How many times do parental figures blatantly manipulate their children? They impose their religious beliefs on the children. They force the children to participate in activities that the children want nothing to do with. They try to influence their children to go into the same profession. Any parent is going to be manipulative at best, and downright controlling at worst.

This is all true, but Harry wasn't facing the decision of Proddy or Papist, Auror or Quidditch which are far less consequential than an imminent fight against a dangerous lunatic. He only had all of the pieces as to why and how Albus had done what he had done when Voldemort was laying siege to Hogwarts and his friends (particularly Ron and Hermione) were in grave danger. Given what we came to know about Harry's values system, he certainly didn't feel like had any other choice but to play his part.

Albus' actions in canon don't morally balance for me, but I also think that the vast majority of manipulative!Dumbledore stories go way too far in their interpretation of his character. I'm always happy to read other opinions, though.

But I'd personally compare it more to the patriotism that invariably happens during a major war. Like, look at World War I and II. Any person who'd not want to join up to the military would be seen as weak and unpatriotic. Pretty damn near all the parents around that time would have Strongly Encouraged their children to go join the fight, regardless of the risk to life or limb. You can probably bet your buttons that if there were a family that had a child whom they knew was prophesied to kill Hitler, they'd have done the same.

I don't know the real answer though, you know? It's a difficult position that everyone's placed into. If we were in the same position, would we have acted the same way? I can't say, because I've never been in such a position before.

I was on board until these paragraphs.

I do not think Dumbledore made plans based on the type of person Harry is /until/ Half-Blood Prince.

I know this is such a widely accepted theory, but I just don't see the evidence at /all/. I think Dumbledore /had/ plans, but they were not related to the type of person Harry was and especially not related to him sacrificing himself, because the plans involving Harry's sacrifice depended on things he didn't know about until after Harry returned to the Wizarding World, and is especially dependent on Voldemort having taken Harry's blood.

I think Dumbledore was still collecting information when Harry was a baby, but because he seems so smart and all knowing we think he always knew what to do that it's difficult to imagine a time he didn't have a plan, and so the actions he takes based on guesses and more importantly his inaction based on lack of information look confusing and intentional when really he just /didn't know/ what to do.

** The biggest damning of canon Dumbledore in my opinion is Snape's memories at the end of Book 7 where Snape (of all people) accuses Dumbledore of raising Harry like a pig for slaughter. Stacked on top of all the other evidence that Dumbledore cares for ends far more than means, I think manipulative and ruthless is a completely fair characterization of canon Albus.

That said, he wasn't malevolent. Just a little too willing to sacrifice others to the greater good.

EDIT: Regarding fanon!Dumbledore: My biggest complaint is that writers have DD becoming unhinged far too often. I don't care so much that DD fails (although failing repeatedly to children with "wing it" as their gameplan is far too common), but that he doubles down every single time and winds up being completely unbelievable as a character, both in dialogue and action.

That's the most compelling argument I've heard for in defense of Dumbledore's character regarding Harry's early childhood. I'd never considered Dumbledore's age and how his own childhood would have taken place in first half of the 1800s which was a very different social environment.

I'm still not convinced that it redeems him, but it certainly paints him in a less harsh light for me.

With regards to Voldemort, Harry unhinges him because his normal methods of operation are completely ineffective. We don't see him being competent behind the scenes (anything pre-books, orchestrating the events of GoF, taking over the Ministry). I'm willing to give Rowling the benefit of the doubt on that, particularly considering making an seventh horcrux (beyond seven pieces) might have had disproportionate and unexpected effects on Voldemort's stability.

That plan could have failed at each task and it's just luck and author fiat that kept Barty from being discovered and dosed with veritaserum. The fact that there were four triwizard participants should have had everyone (especially the brilliant Professor Dumbledore who is old friends with the very paranoid ex-auror Alastor Moody) suspicious of the circumstances and had them investigate every visitor that had access to the cup (especially Karkaroff and the defense professor) to understand what happened.

Intelligence does not mean you make the right emotional choices, though. Voldemort and Dumbledore /are/ both incredibly intelligent. This and power are what Voldemort values and are what Dumbledore valued when he met Grindelwald. But his experience with Grindelwald made him realize that intelligence and power are not good without the stability empathy and love bring to it.

I think to an extent Dumbledore is quote unquote "fine" with the Dursleys being bad parents, but I don't think he would have approved of just /how/ bad it was - hence why things begin to improve once Harry rejoins the Wizarding World and it becomes clear how awful they are.

If Sacrificial Protection hadn't fallen into his lap, he might have had to come up with other measures, more time-consuming and restrictive, less reliable, but since it had, to have Harry live under the same roof as Petunia was the safest thing he could do for Harry, and he was proven right: living at 4 Privet remained an inviolable sanctuary against Voldemort and his agents even after Voldemort took Harry's blood, with the only ones able to breach it being the Dursleys themselves and Dementors on the orders of Umbridge, who was not acting on Voldemort's behalf.

Be careful not to confuse intellect with emotional strength. Dumbledore's brilliant, he's powerful, he's committed to making the world a better place...

... but he is a god damned fool when it comes to love. It doesn't make him stronger like it does with Harry, it clouds his judgements. This is what he learned with Grindelwald, and so he tries to not care about Harry, but he fails that too, which leads to a lot of mistakes, like thinking he can give Harry a normal childhood by keeping secrets from him. But he's wrong. Harry can't have a normal childhood, and Dumbledore finally accepts that at the end of OotP.

He tell Harry that he has to go after Voldemort because Harry /wants/ to go after Voldemort (which I'm sure you cannot deny that Harry's been wanting that since he was eleven). Dumbledore only thinks Harry is the best option after Harry has proven in several ways that he /is/ the best option.

But it seems to me you were at first condemning Dumbledore for making Harry involved in all this, and now saying it was the only logical option?

Why would Dumbledore plan for a child to do anything? What does he know at that point that makes that option logical? It all seemed /illogical/ to me to look at an infant and go "I know exactly what he's gonna do", when at that point in time there are better options. What within canon tells us he's confident baby Harry will become the sort of person capable of defeating a Dark Lord? Why not have it be someone much older and more capable?

  The importance Harry had both due to the prophecy - which the Dark Lord believed
#+end_quote

Voldemort believed, but Dumbledore's reaction is determined by what he believes too.

Let's say he believes the prophecy definitely comes true - but the prophecy still doesn't say who will win "either must die at the hands of the other", but Voldemort /can't/ kill Harry becomes of Lily's sacrifice, and Harry /can't/ kill Voldemort because Harry's got to die before Voldemort does and a dead person can't kill Voldemort. The prophecy predicts two scenarios that are /both/ currently impossible - sort of an anti-paradox. So... the prophecy must be referring to a scenario that hasn't revealed itself yet... therefore, I do not think a Dumbledore who believed the prophecy would come true would create a plan because what plan can he create yet when there's clearly an unknown predestined scenario that hasn't happened yet. I think this Dumbledore would spend his time examining Harry closely and doing a ton of research.

An opposite theory, what if Dumbledore doesn't believe the prophecy will come true at all, he acts only because he knows /Voldemort/ believes it and will try to kill Harry. Therefore Harry's only reason to be involved is because he is harboring a bit of Voldemort's soul and must be killed. In this scenario, I think Dumbledore would keep as far away from Harry as possible in order to not get too close to this child whose death he may someday have to plan. I say "someday", because Dumbledore still can't know what will happen - maybe Voldemort will never return and then therefore Dumbledore never has to kill Harry. In this scenario there is no reason to train Harry or, in fact, to do anything with him.

But I don't think either of the above are correct. Some prophecies come true - even Dumbledore can't deny despite his low opinion of Divination. But enough /don't/ come true that if Dumbledore can make the one about Voldemort/Harry /not/ come true, then I think he'd work towards that goal (edit: as in, Dumbledore himself would defeat Voldemort and Harry doesn't have to do anything, or to try to indefinitely delay Voldemort from being able to return so that he floats as a spectral ghost forever, or something else creative like that). Again - the prophecy says either must die at the hand of the other - at this point in time Voldemort is the /clear/ winner against an infant. Even 15-20 years from now, Voldemort is still going to be the superior wizard to any kid. Even a ruthless!Dumbledore who doesn't care about the life of a child would see that attempting to avoid the prophecy is the best way to defeat Voldemort, because /how/ can a child win? Especially considering the anti-paradox.

So I reckon a Dumbledore who's planning for both scenarios would still make sure he's not super close to Harry - he sets protections around Harry to avoid his murder, but keeps far away from him in case he has to someday plan the kid's death, and caring for the kid would make that much harder. He keeps a close watch on Voldemort and sees that he's not coming back until about shortly before Harry's first year, and I /think/ Dumbledore comes up with some plan for Harry that year, but I /don't/ think it panned out the way he wanted it to - I can get more into my toughts on this, but essentially, I think Harry didn't act the way Dumbledore expected him to, and Dumbledore realized what a stout-hearted, brave, and loving kid Harry was and his attempts to distance himself began to fall apart - /“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine.”/ (Book 5, U.S. p. 837).

I think from the end of Philosopher's Stone onward, Dumbledore becomes blinded and begins to inadvertenly work against what he knows will get rid of Voldemort, because getting rid of Voldemort means getting rid of Harry. He's tries to delay and delay his return, but Voldemort keeps pushing back - but working towards killing Voldmeort means working towards killing /Harry/, which is becoming more and more and /more/ horrible to think about - so Dumbledore doesn't. /"What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands"/. He's emotionally weak and he deep down he knows he has to think about it, but isn't it just so much easier to push it away. Voldemort isn't back /yet/ anyway....

And then he /is/ back, but.... but... Harry says he used Harry's blood...... Harry no longer has to die! /Harry no longer has to die!/

I think it takes him a year before he gets used to the idea (hence the mess he causes in OotP), but this (and the fact that Harry's wand absorbed Voldemort's power, that his wand is imbibed with Harry's immense courage making it extremely powerful against Voldemort, the fact Harry doesn't need Occlumency, the fact Harry can read Voldy's mind, and the fact that Harry is guided by love and clearly has greater fears than death) is why Dumbledore finally accepts that Harry's got to be involved.

So basically - why do you think Dumbledore needs to pay attantion to Harry if you agree he doesn't believe prophecies have to come true? I'm asking less about the morality of it (because I think Dumbledore should have simply out of human decency) and more about the strategy and research related to defeating Voldemort.

************** Why would Dumbledore have to observe and investigate Harry thoroughly? Because whatever was done to Harry has resisted the Killing Curse and defeated the Dark Lord. Why wouldn't Dumbledore try to find out how that was done? He knows there is a protection on Harry. He even managed to move it to Privett Drive. Why wouldn't he try to duplicate it? Or find out how it was created, so it can be used against Voldemort? Find a way to defeat the Dark Lord without Harry having to die, maybe? Ignoring this "superweapon" makes no sense. At all.

And as long as Voldemort believes in the prophecy, Harry is important since Voldemort will come after him.

Harry is also a symbol for the resistance to Voldemort. Dumbledore could use his reputation and Harry's to deal with Malfoy gaining influence on Fudge.

Ignoring Harry was dumb and careless, even from a "I don't care about the boy, only about defeating Voldemort" point of view.

And even if we discount all that: If Dumbledore feels guilt and wants Harry to have a normal childhood, then making sure that he actually enjoys his childhood is the most basic, most obvious thing to do. And even if he failed utterly at that, he should have taken notice after Harry didn't receive his letters.

That's just too much stupidity for a charater like Dumbledore.

You answer your own question - he knew how it was done - he even added onto the protections which is why Harry lived with Petunia. He did duplicate that very magic too with Harry's self-sacrifice eradicating Voldemort's power and he did figure out a way to allow Harry to survive too. I'm so confused what you're saying, everything you're blaming Dumbledore for not doing, he did. You just seem to be expecting him to have done it without the information he needed to plan it properly.

You are expecting too much about of magic. He knew how it was done, but it's not something that can be easily duplicated. What would you say intention affects magic? Voldemort had to intend to spare Lily, Lily had to intend to die, and then Voldemort had to change his mind and intend to kill her for the magic to work.

Do you think it is easy to set up a scenario in which intention can work so suitably in your favor? Once Voldemort took Harry's blood and insisted nobody else kill Harry so that he, himself, could do it, then Dumbledore recognized an opportunity to re-create the magic, but you can't just whip it up out of thin air, that's not how this magic works.

#+begin_quote

I'm sure he would have been happy to give up his life for that sort of magical protection, but then Harry still stuck being a Harrycrux meaning Voldemort still can't die. Having Harry sacrifice serves two purposes, not just one. It negates Voldemort's power and also removes the bit of soul while allowing Harry to live. The soul could have been destroyed any other way, but this is the only way in which Harry can return to life.

You are mixing up two different types of protection. Lily's protection means Voldemort can't kill Harry and lasts forever (or until Voldemort uses Harry's blood), Dumbledore's added protections prevent Voldemort from /finding/ Harry while he's at the Dursleys, and this one expires when Harry is 17. They are two separate protections that serve different purposes and have differnet life-spans. The kind that Harry is able to replicate is the former, that prevents Voldemort from killing, it does not prevent Voldemort from finding.

#+begin_quote
  So, why didn't the greatest wizard of Britain work his butt off to use this knowledge you claim he already had?
#+end_quote

He did. I think you are expecting too much from magic, that because they need a way to defeat Voldemort, that there is a magical option to do it just /because/, that magic can solve any problem, regardless of what the problem is. But magic isn't a blank canvas, there are limitations. Dumbledore /does/ find a way to defeat Voldemort /and/ it works. But there are things that had to happen before it became a viable option that would work. Before CoS, it wouldn't have worked because Dumbledore didn't know about multiple Horcruxes, so sacrifying his life would have been fruitless and Dumbledore was clever enough to know he didn't know enough to act yet. I think Dumbledore would have been fine to do it after Goblet of Fire, but that still doesn't solve the problem of the Harrycrux and giving Harry a long life. But then we have to ask - is Harry's life more important than the lives that could have been saved if Dumbledore had sacrificed his life sooner? I think Dumbledore would have made the hard choice to prioritize the lives of many over the life of one /if he had to/, but I think outside cirucmstances (i.e. his impending death) meant that he was never faced with that question - he spent Harry's sixth year hunting Horcruxes and found one - but he'll die before he can hunt them all and he knows it, so he gives the job to someone else - and he gave it to Harry for the reasons I mentioned before. Are you saying that limitations like time don't apply to Dumbledore? That each books starts with Dumbledore having a fully-formed plan? That once the book starts his plans are fully-formed just because you think they ought to be? That spending the one year between Voldemort's return and the beginning of HBP is far too long to come up with a plan so Dumbledore clearly was sitting on his ass eating lemon drops?

Everything you are saying he didn't do he /did/ actually do! I'm so confused!

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Maybe some, but maybe others would have died. If Voldemort understood what would happen if he asked Harry to come to his own death, he would never have done given Harry that option, and yet it being an option was essential. Dumbledore's plan is completely dependent on Voldemort's ignorance of how important that part is. Perhaps it was a wrong move to keep it a secret, and that's for you to decide, but at least consider how dangerous it would be to tell the Order only to discover once again there was a spy who would tell Voldemort these plans.

When Harry dies for everyone it means whatever way Voldemort tries to kill them, he will be thwarted - which in this case was Voldemort's spells not sticking. Some worked at first, but then Ron and the other managed to break through them - but it's the same as Quirrell strangling Harry - he managed to start it, but couldn't finish killing him.

Yes!! But you're forgetting Harry's own wand's power against Voldemort. Dumbledore intended Harry to beat Voldemort because his pheonix feather wand had absorbed Voldemort's own power and considered Voldemort a mortal enemy. This is why the chapter where Voldemort dies is called the "Flaw In the Plan" because it wasn't part of the plan, but fate had worked in Harry's favor, reinforcing the themes of why Harry was able to win in the first place!

And lastly, to assume that Dumbledore can come up with a completely 100% perfect plan is asking a helluva lot. The man may be smart, but he's not God.

If Dumbledore had been able to duplicate the effect, he would at the very least have used his own sacrifice to protect the Order. He didn't, hence he wasn't able to duplicate it. Hence he didn't study it enough.

What's so damn difficult to understand? The protection was never duplicated in the books. It was always just Harry's protection, manipulated a bit at most.

Ergo: Dumbledore couldn't duplicate it, or he'd have done it.

And duplicating that protection is not that difficult to think of. And if Dumbeldore had at least tried to study it, he'd have observed Harry more, and the abuse wouldn't have happened.

Harry's sacrifice in the forest is the duplication plan you're looking for.

There are clear-cut reasons he was able to succeed here in ways that he could not have duplicated until after Goblet of Fire. It would not have been successful because of the very /nature/ of magic - this magic is dependent on the wizard's intention.

Yes, I totally agree, but it's not Lily's intent alone that matters. James died with exactly the same intent but his death created no magical protection. It was Voldemort's intent to spare her and then him changing his mind as well as Lily's together that created the magical protection for Harry.

#+begin_quote
  So, anyone sacrificing themselves should be able to duplicate this protection
#+end_quote

No, for the reason above - not just any single person can recreate the magic - it is dependent on the intentions of both the attacker and the killer. The German-speaking woman who Voldemort killed while looking for Gregorovitch did what Lily did, as have countless of other mothers, fathers, friends, etc. But their sacrifices and attempts to save their loved ones did not create magical protection, because Voldemort had not entered into the Potter's house or the German-speaking woman's house with the original intention of sparing James or the woman.

When Harry sacrificed himself, Voldemort always intended on killing him, what made it a choice is that he gave Harry the option to come /to/ him - Harry could have ignored him, but he chose to go.

Furthermore - I do not think Lily's sacrifice is the first time this magic has formed, it seems clear to me it's happened in the past, or else how could Dumbledore have recognized it so quickly? It seems clear this is the sort of thing only well-read and educated witches and wizards would understand, like our Muggle genius mathematicians and stuff like that.

I do agree to an extent - there's a lot of examples of this in the first two (not just with Dumbledore, but Voldemort and a couple others too), maybe some in the third, and I think even Goblet of Fire can kind of be thrown into this, but by OotP, I think his characterization is extremely thought out and his reasons for doing things are no longer just for plot-purposes - his characterization makes perfect sense for his actions and mistakes all have reasons that help explain what is going on in Harry's life and in their pursuit of ending Voldemort.

Either he didn't expect Voldemort to take over after he died, in which case he would have been stupid, or he didnt care at all about all the innocents those scumbags would kill after broken out of prison again. If he doesn't want to kill them, he could obliviate them down to 11 year olds. But protecting the innocent has to be his priority, far, far before he thinks about protecting the scum.

Exactly my gripe, he had ZERO contingency plan for his eventual death, and the Order didn't do any either after his death.

If Voldemort just practiced coup-d'etat 101 after the Ministry takeover, which was to liquidate your political enemies ASAP, the Weasleys would have been wiped out, and the Trio would have been emotionally destroyed.

******* But how do you /really/ feel? Haha!

Firstly - I think people think I'm defending every action Dumbledore took. He made /a lot/ of mistakes, in fact his characterization is centered around how much of a fuck-up he is. And how poetic, the wise Merlin-type is actually pretty cowardly and weak-minded. I attribute his mistakes to this rather than omniscience and maliciousness.

#+begin_quote
  He wastes his last year alive "teaching" Harry stuff about Voldemort that could have been done in an afternoon.
#+end_quote

I don't consider this a waste of time, but fair enough if you do.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't take action against Draco, despite Ron and Katie and Slughorn almost dying - no benevolent Dumbledore would risk innocents and allies for a scumbag like Draco.
#+end_quote

I don't think Dumbledore thinks of Draco as a scumbag, but I also don't think he'd risk innocents for a less scummy Draco either. I think he /and/ Snape underestimated him to their discredit, just like Voldemort underestimated Harry at first. It's a mistake, for sure, but just slightly different than the one you're suggesting.

#+begin_quote
  That he wasn't able to give the key items the trio needed a few weeks before his death, instead of trying to smuglge them through the Ministry's checks? Stupid and pointless.
#+end_quote

Did they /need/ any of the items besides the sword, which Snape is in control of, and maybe Hermione's book? Honest question. How crucial are they?

#+begin_quote
  That he didn't set up the trio for their seach with all the goods and golds they needed? Safe houses included?
#+end_quote

What is the Order for then? It was Harry's (not Dumbledore's) decision to act alone. Dumbledore only said to not tell anybody about the Horcruxes, not to work alone.

#+begin_quote
  He should have trained the three a year long, not done "Tom Riddle, the movie".
#+end_quote

I disagree, but still consider this valid. I don't think any amount of training would be a match against Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  why didn't he ensure that the captured Death Eaters were killed after he was back in power?
#+end_quote

I'm sure Stan Shunpike would be very comforted to hear this.

The main take-away I get is that most people blame Dumbledore for EVERYTHING. We don't consider there are only so many hours in a day, only so many contigency plans you can devise, only so much influence you have over the government and other people. He /did/ do things wrong, and I enjoy discussing those because I think his mistakes are what make him the most fascinating character, but when we blame him for everything, we are expecting a robot or a god, and I think his mistakes make him the most /human/.

******** No, his mistakes make him not just human, but a failure, and a stupid failure to boot. I wouldn't object to calling canon Dumbledore an idiot - but that's not what he is presented at. He is, throughout the books, presented as a man just about every good character trusts and follows. If he is an idiot and makes so many mistakes as seen in the books, then what makes that those who follow him? Who's the greater fool, the fool or the one who follows him?

Though since the Order went along with the flight of the 7 Potters, a plan a 6 year old would have objected to on the grounds of being suicidally stupid, I guess we can't really call the Order competent or smart either. It's not as if Harry had /the/ Cloak of Invisibility, and could have walked out by himself and taken the bus 2 miles away or so... and it's not as if Harry and his friends had used that cloak in every book to sneak around.

That's why I say that the characters were wrecked and reduced to plot devices in the last few books.

#+begin_quote
  Are there any indications in the books that Dumbeldore is manipulative or evil
#+end_quote

Yes, but they are almost definitely not Rowling's intention. I have a list of fanon stuff that seems to suppor the evul manipulator theory

* First book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: first-book
  :END:

- Gets raised ignorant in such a way that he doesn't value his own life and the magical world is seen as an escape

- First contact with the magical world is with an extreme Dumbledore-supporter who won't shut up about what a great man he is

- For some reason Dumbledore has Harry's vault key and invisibility cloak (doubtless for evil and devious reasons)

- He isn't told about the entrance to the train platform and conveniently the friendly and Dumbledore-loving Weasleys are there to help for some reason using the muggle entrance and shouting about muggles and the location of the platform

- He is immediately biased against Slytherin house by ron (an obvious plant by dumbledore) and Hagrid.

- Dumbledore warns all the students not to go to the third floor corridor but the simplest way to get somebody curious about something is to conspicuously forbid it.

- Snape is used to make sure that Harry is kept humble and pliable

- Dumbledore maliciously uses the Mirror of Erised in order to find out the deepest and most desperate desires of Harry's heart to be better capable of manipulating him (presumably using legilimancy)

- Dumbledore travels from scotland to London by broom to give the his plots time to unfold instead of just apparating

- The defences of the Stone are perfectly tailored for the trio of friends that formed.

* Second book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: second-book
  :END:

- He convinces Lockhart to become the defence teacher which isn't necessarily manipulative but it's definitely evil
- Harry is shunned by everyone and Dumbledore does nothing to get rid of the rumours that he is trying to wipe out the filthy mudbloods
- There is absolutely no way in hell that Dumbledore didn't know that the beast was a basilisk
- Dumbledore saves Harry's life last minute in the chamber even though he shouldn't have any issue just having Fawkes bring him along and deal with that stuff himself

* Third book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: third-book
  :END:

- Isn't it suspicious that Sirius Black got no trial at all and wasn't even interviewed about what he saw as a first responder to the scene of the greatest magical mystery ever? Clearly Dumbledore used his considerable authority to push Sirius into Azkaban to make sure Harry didn't have anyone to care for him other than abusive muggles
- Dumbledore could have just borrowed Hermiones time turner and summoned pettigrew as a rat to him after he ran off (He didn't because that would give Harry a Godfather to look after him and he has to live with the muggles because of blood magic or something)

* Fourth book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: fourth-book
  :END:

- Dumbledore uses Harry as 'bait' to catch the person who tried to get Harry to compete instead of just telling Harry not to compete like a reasonable person, there must be a hidden agenda!
- Dumbledore does nothing to help Harry during the tasks
- Dumbledore does nothing to convince anyone that Voldemort is back (pensieve memories or veritaserum or just faking a death eater attack with some order members would be enough)

* Fifth book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: fifth-book
  :END:

- The blood magic now does nothing to defend against Voldemort anymore and didn't really do anything to defend Harry from outside danger anyways but we should definitely let him stay there with no protection for reasons
- Dumbledore does not explain the connection to Voldemort
- Snape is assigned to teach Harry occlumancy but probably just tried to use the connection to read Voldemort's mind instead
- Harry is finally told of the Prophecy after there is no way to keep him ignorant any longer

* Sixth book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sixth-book
  :END:

- Harry is finally going to be given special lessons to defeat Voldemort... oh wait they are useless history lessons because Harry isn't supposed to fight Voldemort, he has to die

* Seventh book
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: seventh-book
  :END:

- Snape literally says that Harry is raised like a lamb to the slaughter
- Dumbledore has had an item (the light put-outer) that could listen in on any conversation that Harry has had since the Halloween Voldemort attack when he was one year old

This is all from memory so there are bound to be tons of examples that I missed and the actual plot of Harry Potter is a bit of an impenetrable clusterfuck so I don't even know if any of that made any sense.

*** I'm pretty sure you're being sarcastic, but most of this actually happens. Not because Albus is an evil dark Lord, but to further his plans. Albus actually disowns the "For The Greater Good" philosophy, but he is a proponent of "The end justifies the means" most of the time. On the other hand he tends to give second chances. He's a flawed and well-written character. I still don't like him, but I despise him more if he's just absurdly evil and asinine in a fic. My favorite manipulative Dumbledore is from linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind). And also I like him in linkffn(Itachi is that a baby?) but mostly because he's hilarious and doesn't give a fuck.

** The core problem is that we look back at what Dumbledore did and why, and what came of it, and it doesn't seem obvious in hindsight that it would work.

Did he somehow test the Master of Death effect? Did he put a compulsion on the snitch so Harry would keep it with him? Did he implant a suggestion in Harry's mind with Legilimency so he would figure out how to open it? How did he ensure that Harry would survive long enough -- that no one else would kill him? Or did he trust in the prophecy instead?

In order to have /any/ hope that Harry would succeed, he would have needed to be manipulative. But that would only have provided a small shred of hope. And all along the way, Dumbledore had to know he was risking the entire country, possibly the whole continent, on a toss of the dice. On a /hunch/.

It's much easier to get an evil, /incompetent/ Dumbledore that's similar to canon. Dumbledore wants Harry dead for reasons, but the prophecy means it's impossible for him to do it. So he engineers situations to get Harry and Voldemort in the same room together and hopes that Harry dies. But somehow neglects to remember that he could simply forward Harry's home address to Lucius Malfoy.

I suspect there's potential for a comedy in here somewhere, with Snape as the loyal and competent minion and Dumbledore being all "that's not how we do things".

The most evil thing he did was send Harry off to be abused by his family. It depends on whether or not he would have been truly endangered if he was given to another family/wizard/witch on whether this was evil. The "big head" he would develop from being raised in the world was a bit BS though, since it would be better to have an arrogant Harry rather than the a abused one.

That said, this was lessened in impact considering the berating Dumbledore gave the Dursleys in the sixth book. I think the fanon explanation of "Dumbledore had a lot on his plate, and ended up doing less good for Harry" is the most reasonable one. Harry was just another issue Dumbledore had to handle.

There simply isn't enough in the canon for "Evil Dumbledore" argument to be canon. If that's your fanfic, that's fine, but one can't really argue that he was evil in the actual story.

** This post was made for me.

I don't know what is the cause, if it's the films or fan fiction, or just the subtley of the way his character is written, but I do think that his character is one of the most universally misunderstood characters in the entire series.

I defend Dumbledore a lot, but I don't think he is perfect, I just think his faults are slightly different from what others imagine. I think the HP books are incredibly symbolic and that the major plot points and the major characters are directly or tangentially related to the themes of love, death, and choice. In contrast, I would say Game of Thrones is not symbolic (or at least not in the same way, the story isn't done yet, so I can't say for sure).

I do not think Dumbledore had a plan from the beginning - if we look at what he could have known, there's so little, there's just no way he /could/ have had a plan from the beginning. I think he's still soaking up all the information and going "what the hell is going on?".

Then, over time, he learns who Harry is, discovers with his own eyes that Harry repeatedly thwarts Voldemort, and best of all, Dumbledore (unlike Harry, unlike Voldemort, and unlike everyone else) undertands /why/, he /sees/ what power Harry has and how it's working against Voldemort. It's through seeing this proof that he decides Harry is the best candidate. I /don't/ think Dumbledore molds Harry to be the perfect soldier, I think Harry /is/ the perfect soldier and Dumbledore recognizes this and invites Harry to be a part of his plan.

But I don't think recognizing it comes easy to Dumbledore. I don't think he /wants/ Harry involved, despite knowing it's got to be him - and there's where Dumbledore's emotional weakness comes into play, the core of his characterization.

He's incredibly intelligent, and he knows that Harry has to die, but he's also incredibly empathatic and doesn't want him to have to die. What the hell is a person in that position going to do?

That characterization is entirely lost with Cruel!Dumbledore, who's selfish and only works for his own ends - but what the hell ARE those ends??

** In terms of what Rowling intended, Dumbledore is most certainly not evil or manipulative. Some of his actions and lack of actions aren't really possible to explain, other than from a meta sense in that if things were different the plot wouldn't work. So from that you can instead explain it by making him evil/manipulative like in fanon, but that was pretty clearly not what was intended by the author.
