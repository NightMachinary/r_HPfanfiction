In this fic Harry learns the spells from any wand he touches? I know it's not barefoot\\
I'm pretty sure the first wand he touched was James


** Hmm...are you /sure/ it's not Barefoot? Because that's the one I was thinking of when I saw the post title.

Are there any specific scenes you remember from the fic? When did Harry touch James's wand, was it when he was a baby or when he was with the Dursleys or on a Gringotts trip...?

What does he do with the information he gets? Does he become a master ward-breaker, or youngest duellist ever, or does he learn secret family spells from wands, or use it like Prior Incantato to know what spells people have cast, or...?

*** I believe it was when he first met Dumbledore, and it lets him know his parents through the spells they cast, and I believe the knowledge of the spells stayed with him.

  "The wand chooses the wizard- The wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand." But what if you were a freak and touching another's wand caused you to learn everything that passed through that wand and was learned by the host. Another twisted story around the time of the Tri-Wizard tournament. No Slash.
