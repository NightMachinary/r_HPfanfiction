Just seen a thread about the worst, wanted to find some well done bashing. So anything that works, that's well thought out and enjoyable.

This one comes to mind. Linkffn(8163784)

*** Subversion of it, maybe. Or perhaps they're just looking for bashing fics with proper spelling, grammar, and prose. Anything higher quality would require proper characterization, and thus not be bashing.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

*** Bashing that's got a good reason for it?

Like say attacking Dumbledore because of what he put Harry through? Or attacking the Weasleys because of their (preventable: Use contraceptives and/or send Molly to work!) poverty? Exposing Snape and Draco as despicable people (and have them face adequate punishment!)?

All those are examples were "bashing" (as in exposing their flaws by shining some more light on them) is ok and if done well it's "great bashing" :)

** It seems that my definition of bashing is too broad, but I'm pretty sure I've seen it being used for whatever fic where good guys in canon don't have a good role.

Maybe I've been misinformed then.

The question still stands though, what are three best fics you know about that have some of the canon good guys being the antagonists, end those that have a different take on the bad guys than the classical you're the antagonist do you're evil.
