"The Person you need is Nanny McPhee" A hag in black travels around the world disciplining children and fixing families with five lessons and a bang of her stick. And where do you think she learnt it all? Well Hogwarts of course and now it's time for her to return to her beloved school to mentor the next generation of witches and wizards.

I personally think it would cool if she mentored Minerva but it's up to you.


** Uhm hags ~eat~ children.

Ma'am this is definitely not a Wendy's

*** Not a literal hag. She's under a curse that gives her warts and wrinkles in inverse proportion to the trust people around have for her.
