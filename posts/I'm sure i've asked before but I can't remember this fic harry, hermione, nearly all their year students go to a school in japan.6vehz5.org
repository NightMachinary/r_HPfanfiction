~that uses time dilation to pack a whole year into a summer. They still go to hogwarts. I think molly weasley finds out she had a kid at hogwarts while attending(they also use time dilation to accelerate gestation) and her memory is wiped and the child is placed with muggles. Most muggleborns are a result of this.

I can't remember if i hated or loved this story.

This story is an epic clichefest of clicheness.


** I remember that story, too.

I loved it at first, but everyone had crackfic-level powers by... second year IIRC, and there was no believability to there being any conflict at all.

It was also one of those fics where Magical Britain is backwards isolationist to a ridiculous degree, and everywhere else is more or less a utopia.

Yet no-one uses any of their stated gained abilities in even the most blindingly obvious of situations.

**** my very first fic was HPMOR (excepting every single fic on that ancient PokemonTower website in the early 2000s), so I have a very... judgmental view of those who do not see the use of Hufflepuff bones, so to speak.

***** I think I missed the reference? I mean, MOR was among my first well-liked fics (though I'm not sure I should publicize that fact here...) but, err, I don't know what you mean.

*** The thing is Radaslab has very detailed, lore-rich worlds that he creates for his fics. It's why I dove into them in the first place. But as cliched filled as they may be what turned me off then was the intense focus on weirdness/squick, especially in The Harem War, which is simultaneously both better and worse than that name implies. A 750,000 word novel set in that world could be an enjoyable read for the most part. But there are, to put it lightly, age issues in both directions, among other things that forced me to give it up.
