This is my third year on this subreddit, and oh boy it's been a journey, while I have not been as participant as other years I still value a lot the ability to exchange ideas over a pass-time that is sooo time consuming. I do not have the place to speak about fanfics in general IRL, and to have this outlet filled with talented and incredible people is amazing. I want to wish you a very good 2018, from the suckers at the IRC :P hey guys, to the incredible authors that make new and exciting stories with a franchise with so much potential as the HP one, to the incredible readers that are capable of enjoying and motivating said authors to create more fantastic content. I wish ya all health, love, wealth, friendship and what not. Thank you for making of this tiny space of the internet such an active and incredible community.

Best Regards Rodrigo Catalan A.K.A Zantroy

**** Perhaps that is for the best. This drink is too good to pass through the sinful lips of mankind. Really.

** Should auld acquaintance be forgot,\\
And everybody cheer!\\
We've managed somehow, friends,\\
To make it through another year.

Let's stay up late, let's celebrate,\\
And then count down from ten!\\
'Cause tomorrow when we wake up, guys...\\
/THE WHOLE THING STARTS AGAIN!/

** Happy New Year!

And can we get some Good!Dumbledore fics here? With how much Manipulative!Dumbledore on this subreddit, we could use some positivity.
