...and upon hearing noises in Myrtle's bathroom, he finds a small battered book, laying in a puddle of water.

Curious, he goes back to his office and decides to read what sort of things Tom Riddle may have written in his youth, only to find the pages empty if not for a compulsion charm.

Thus, an amused Dumbledore finds himself writing to a young Voldemort.


** /I love this prompt to death but my writing sucks today. Oh well:/

"Greetings!" he wrote, fully aware of the futility and utter recklessness of this endeavor and not caring in the least. 

The words disappeared immediately. It was an impressive bit of magic. Ominous. He respected the work. Begrudgingly. 

"Hello," the book responded. 

He wondered if the object could tell who he was. He assumed not, given that there was usually a limit to the degree of sentience with which an object could be imbued, but then Tom always had a penchant for taking the scientific aspects of magic and blowing them all to hell in spectacular, dramatic ways. 

"What is your name?" he wrote. 

"My name is Tom Riddle." 

Interesting. 

"Hello, Tom Riddle. Do you know where you are?" 

"I assume I am at Hogwarts." 

"That is correct." 

"Who are you?" 

Albus thought for a moment, then threw all caution (or what little he had left) to the wind. "I am Albus Dumbledore," he wrote in his best curly script. 

The book did not respond. 

To add insult to injury he added, "I am the Headmaster of Hogwarts." Capital "H" included for effect. 

The book began to write, but the scrawl was unreadable. It erased itself several times before finally forming a proper word. 

"Prat." 

"Is that any way to talk to your Headmaster?" Albus wrote with a smile. 

"What year is it, prat?" 

"1993." 

"Well in that case, I assume I have long since graduated from Hogwarts - top of my class, no doubt - and have gone on to conquer the world in some brilliant and impressive way." 

"Not quite," said Albus. 

A pause. Then, "what happened?" 

Albus wrote slowly. "You graduated from Hogwarts, yes, but after that you disappeared. It wasn't until years later that you returned asking for a teaching position. I turned you down. Naturally." 

"Naturally. Teaching? What on earth would possess me? I assume I asked for the Defense Against the Dark Arts job?" 

"No." 

"Sorry?" 

"As it turned out, you had spent your time abroad, studying all manner of flora and fauna, becoming well known as one of the most knowledgeable naturalists in the Western world. You had a particular penchant for plants, and had decided-"

"Don't say it-"

"-to take up-"

"No-"

"Herbology." 

The book responded with a series of angry scribbles and then caught fire.

** Imagine Dumbledore just deciding to fuck with Voldemort. Dumbledore teaches teenage Tom Riddle spell theory for a dark curse that actually just teleports the nearest bee to you. Voldemort needs dark secrets to connect with the other's soul and start influencing them? Dumbledore starts describing in great detail a fictional relationship with Hagrid. Poor 16 year old Tom Riddle is so horrified that a horcrux commits the equivalent of suicide for the first time ever.

** "Albus!" Minerva McGiggles shouted when Headmaster Dumbledore joined the rest of the staff for breakfast in the great hall. "What in ...." her exclamation slurred into indecipherably thick scottish at the sight of her boss and friend.

Albus paid no heed to the surprise splashed across every single student and professor's face as he took his seat. His robes, his hat, his hair and beard were all divided perfectly down his middle, giving him an even more unbalanced appearance than normal. His right side was as gaily decorated as it ever was, his luxurious locks and beautiful beard as thick and flowing as his peach colored robes, bedazzled with dancing embroidered dragons and small jingling bells and whistles.

Dumbledore's left side was as conspicuously dull as his right side was gaudy. His hat was cut right down the middle and must have been charmed to stay in place, for it stayed mounted on the side of his head despite the complete lack of a left hemisphere. His hair and beard were as absent as the half of his hat, and Dumbledore's polished dome and jawline caught the morning sunlight with a rainbow that couldn't quite work up the happiness for color, and left a sheen like an oil-slick in a dark basement.

His robes were as drab on the left as they were obtrusive on the right, solid black fabric with just the hint of steel grey in the stitching and pocket lining. His left arm was in a sling, hand hidden in the dull bit of forest green fabric wrapped over his sleeve.

His glasses were likewise divided, his plain blue eye twinkling brilliantly behind one half-moon that perched right in the bend of his long crooked nose. His unobscured peeper glowed a vivid, vibrant red as if a stoplight inside his skull was overpowering his eyeball.

Filius "Mister Fister" Flatware, in between bites of his porridge and sheathing the occasional knife and spoon in his cummerbund or boot, asked a very simple question. "So, you thought last year with Quirrel wasn't quite enough, you had to go and do it again, but more, yourself?"

"What are you talking about /last year/?"

"Well, I wouldn't say it quite like that, I don't think." Dumbledore's left and right side said simultaneously, somehow managing to clearly enunciate two different sentences at once.

He clearly was not about to give any more of an explanation, as his right hand, carrying a jam slathered scone, intersected his kippered toast just centimeters from his mouth. The scone crumbled, jam aiming directly for Dumbledore's liver as crumbs tumbled all across his chest and lap. The kippers, launched off of the toast and upstream across his beard, his cup of morning tea, and all the rest of the professors seated on either side of him, lodged themselves as well as they could for being dead and salted cured and served at breakfast and placed on toast and launched across the head table of Hogwarts when Dumbledore swatted down his possessed half's attempts at sustenance.

One intrepid hero of a kipper, perhaps still just barely clinging to life, flipped instead of flopped and hurtled itself at the narrowed, glaring eyes of Professor Severe'R'Us Snape-On Tools. Professor Snape-On Tools just glared double hard, infused his hatred with magic and then his magic with hatred, and then squinted his eyes even tighter at the incoming assailant. The kipper bounced of the nigh-tangible aura of enmity radiating from the man, flipping head over flippers through the air of the great hall.

Harry Potter, gormlessly poking at his half-eaten plate of breakfast, was absolutely clueless this whole time. Hermione Granger was halfway through 'summoning the evilist of demons for dummies' cleverly disguised with the cover from 'ye eldestest historie of Brittania, 7th edition' and only half paying attention to the excitement at the head table. Ronald Weasley was finishing his second plate of breakfast, and eyeing the serving spoons within reach to determine the fastest and most efficient way to fill his 3rd plate with his favorites.

The kipper landed right beneath Harry's nose just as he leaned back and yawned, both arms stretched out as far as they could go. Dorko the MILF'sBoy laughed at him from across the great hall, a simple remark about the smell of not having a mother.

Harry fell backwards off the bench, his windmilling arms unable to find a handhold to keep him seated and upright after the salty splattering impact against his upper lip. Professor Lockhart jumped to his feet, leapt over the head table, and then pranced right up to Harry's collapsed form before he could regain his seat, or even clean the fish off his face.

Harry saw Professor Lockhart whip out his wand, and with the reaction of a twice scalded cat he managed to flip himself back over his head and to his feet, twisting in midair to dodge the incoming spell.

"Therpenthorthia!" Harry yelled, lisping over the fish still stuck to his lip.

An enormous slinky appeared, nearly the size of a trash can and large enough that Harry could jam Colin Creevy in it and send it down the main staircase if the kid didn't stop following him around with that camera.

"SSSSSSSssssSSSSSSSsssSSssssSS!" Harry hissed at the slinky, his parseltongue magics sinking into and possessing the slinky entirely unlike Dumbledore was suffering from at the head table.

The slinky bounced itself directly at Harry's face, one edge impacting him right where the Kipper was peacefully catching a second wind. Harry was launched into an ungainly backflip, landing him in a bowl of fruit directly in the middle of the Gryffindor quiddich team's starting chasers, a trio of lovely ladies older, wiser, and far more experienced than poor hopeless Harry could even imagine.

Harry sneezed, the rush of blood to his nose setting him off like a bottle rocket strapped to an M-80 strapped to a Falcon-9 rocket. The kipper broke the sound barrier (powered by Love, or so Dumbledore thought), and with a wet splat after an enormous boom, tore a hole directly through Dumbledore's left hand, detaching a couple rings and fingers, followed by a pocket containing the diary of T. M. Riddle and finally right on through Dumbledore's old man hip.

The Love-Encrusted-Kipper (as Dumbledore thought of it), or the Killer Kipper (as everyone else did), violently burned away the spectre of Voldemort that was contained within Dumbledore's crotchety old body. Dumbledore's weak old man flesh was reduced to just as much ash, and when Poppy "Healer? I hardly knew 'er!" Pomphrey had watched his entire left half flake away to nothingness, she immediately hit him with some fancy complicated spells that kept him from falling over sideways and spilling all his insides out. He continued on with breakfast despite his new disability, pouring himself a new bowl of granola and then coating it with marmalade instead of milk or yogurt.

a/n: couldn't remember how to spell McG's name, so went the other way with it. And then followed along with the other teachers. got bored, stopped.
