Looking for fics where Harry receives fan-mail, whether it be 10 years worth of letters stored up when he first rejoins the wizarding world or just letters arriving when he's at Hogwarts.

Come to think of it despite reading dozens of fics that have a gringotts vault filled with letters I don't think i've ever read a fic where he actually receives letters during the school year / summer breaks


** It's a plot point in the "Perfectly Normal" series linkao3(5121464). Harry gets Lockhart's help with answering his fan-mail and does things like inviting to a school match the manager of a Quidditch team who sent him complimentary tickets.

There's also a slightly disturbing bit where he gets some of Voldemort's mail (addressed to the Heir of Slytherin).

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?
