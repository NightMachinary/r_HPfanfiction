** Pretty poor argument, I think. For those who want to save 4 minutes of their life, most of the video is just a recap of the Deathly Hallows myth.

The actual argument, which appears at the end of the video, is nothing more than: "The Philosopher's Stone lets you live forever so seems to be more powerful than the Resurrection Stone, therefore it should be one of the Deathly Hallows."

Except there's good reasons why it isn't:

1. The Deathly Hallows are just enchanted objects; the story of getting them from "Death" is a myth. The fact that they are each flawed and fall short of their mythological stature is the whole point. The unbeatable wand is beatable, the invisibility cloak can be seen through, the resurrection stone summons only shades of the dead, falling short of returning them to true life.

2. The Philosopher's Stone was destroyed at the end of PS, so if it had been the Resurrection Stone then the Deathly Hallows would no longer exist as a set by DH.

3. The Philosopher's Stone can theoretically be made by any wizard who possesses the requisite ability in alchemy; it is not a one-of-a-kind item.

4. The Philosopher's Stone also allows you to make gold, which doesn't fit the myth at all.

5. The Philosopher's Stone is known to have been made by Flamel and kept by him; it has no connection to the Peverells nor has it ever changed hands except in PS.

*** Furthermore, it makes little thematic sense for an artifact of eternal life to be associated with a personified Death. By and large, people don't think of Jesus as a death god even though he promises eternal life after death. Also, from a storytelling perspective, the "power" of the Philosopher's Stone to avoid death is already covered by the True Cloak, even though the intended moral lesson is completely opposite, and putting an artifact that lets you live forever into a myth about accepting death is colossally missing the point.

**** Eh, the moral of the Deathly Hallows is that death is a fate that should be accepted. And while you might have to stretch to make the cloak fit that parameter, the stone definitely doesn't fit.

****** And therefore doesn't fit the myth. The purpose of the stone is immortality. The point of the Tale of the Three Brothers is death is an inevitable fate we must accept. It contradicts the moral.

** Saying it should be a deathly hallow means it should fit into the myth. Saying it would have been a better weapon for Voldemort would have been a better argument.
