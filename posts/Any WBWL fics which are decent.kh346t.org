It doesn't have to be WBWL, I'm fine with "Harry has sibling who is BWL, and the BWL is treated better"

By the way, I've already read POS and Corvus, and I prefer complete stories


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23277868/chapters/55746463]]

is sibling of bwl fic

sarcasm and slytherin ofc

antithesis by oceanbreeze7

and one of my favorites is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23649316/chapters/56762986]] which isn't wbwl but has potter siblings and family drama

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

**** The story is good but it progresses so bloody slowly. Also there's a weird obsession with the Mind Arts that gets a bit annoying. And like mentioned earlier, the "maybe this, maybe not". They are a brilliant author but he resorts to a few attention grabbing tricks more often than necessary. Tricks that are far below the standard they can easily produce. But if you start reading it, you can't stop. The story is that interesting.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
