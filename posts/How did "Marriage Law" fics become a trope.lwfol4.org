Honest question here, not looking for story links or to hear myself rant.

I'm confused at the idea that so many fics could be written about this to even justify it being a trope. Doesn't it seem patently absurd that the government would force people to get married? I assume it is either A) to... equalize muggleborn/pureblood relations, or B) to raise the population, but marriage seems to be a pretty absurd solution to both of those things.

Someone once said it was to provide an excuse to pair up 'odd couples' like Draco/Hr, but... again, not pointing fingers or anything, but shouldn't a story about enemies -> lovers be a little more creative than "oh the government says us not getting married would be illegal".

I don't doubt that *someone* has done it well, but why do you think so many people latched on to such a patently ridiculous theme? Even WBWL makes more sense, and that's saying something.

So are these stories crackfics? Humorous? Serious? Someone who enjoys them, please explain!!


** I don't know where it originated from, but I think it comes from the same sort of story idea as arranged marriages.

In fiction, it's somewhat romantic for two people to be forced to live together and learn about each other and come to love each other. Obviously doesn't work like that in real life.

*** I am not a woman, so I probably miss something somewhere, but to me forced relationship sounds like a horror, not something to be desired. The same about relationship with a bad guy ... the idea of Dramione (not mentioning Lucione, Drarry, Harrytrix or another abominations) pushes me towards puking not excited.

**** I've actually seen some subvert the trope this way, like Harry is forced to marry but he and the spouse just have drastically different world views and never get along, just tolerate each other, like recent divorce'es. Then there one that did even that wrong where Gabrielle accidentally vela binds her self to harry, and begins to realize it's not a story book thing, but has emotional and physical repercussions. She is willing to work with Harry to try to at least be friends. Harry for some reason comes off very juvenile and whiny, even though he is now free of the dursleys, he simply lothes having another thing in his life he can't control, and refuses to accept the bond, acting super emo. This damages the bond and makes it they have to be close to each other or Gabby could die. He is even told simply accepting the bond will alleviate this, and learning to love Gabby will fix it completely, but no he continues to emo for like ten chapters.

I had to skip to the end and the epilogue was basically they never reconcile, Harry is an asshole emo and they live stuck together with Harry hating Gabby with a passion.

***** Sorry, but calling someone "emo" because they've been shackeled to a person for the rest of their life, uprooted from their home country and everyone they've ever known, and are now treated as a piece of incolvenient luggage is bullshit. And saying "he just needs to love her" is such an incredibly ignorant statement, too.

Oh yeah, Harry should have just accepted and loved her. Because love is such a simple emotion that is very easily created, not the most speculated-about emotion in all of philosophy and literature, or the /literal force of nature/ that it is in HP.

Love is like faith - you can't force it. Every couple that's divorced can attest to that. Saying that being depressed over the loss of your freedom is "being emo" is such a fucked up statement, too. It's like saying "just don't be sad lol" to a depressed person.

****** I'm not talking about it being hard I'm taking about a 14 year old acting like a seven year old, yes it's a fucked situation, yes it's terrible and hard. But canon harry was not only willing but would have preferred living with a near stranger in a dilapidated house simply because he showed an iota of actual care and was friends with his father than live with the dursleys. The only reason he didn't was that Sirius was still a wanted criminal in hiding, and dumbledore wanted him to live under those protections.

A kid more grown up than most adults after everything he has faced to that point, in another unusual and unwanted situation that affects his life, who has been shown to plough ahead and deal with shit situations and make the best of them, having his desire to leave the dursleys fuffiled. And he all of a sudden hates his friends, hates his life, becomes a depressed shut-in and even after years basically suffers through the situation because then at least it's his choice. It's a product of the writing and the way the author strings the plot but he basically took canon harry, placed him in this situation, and harry went from being the kid who would face death to save a friend, face down a basalisk, fight Voldemort. To this whiny depressed over exaggerating trope of woe is me my life is the worst possible thing to ever happen to anybody ever and even though it would be an understandablly difficult road ahead, which has been my life so far, instead of facing it head on like I've been doing as it's a defining character of mine I'm going to give up and am literally going to blame everything and everyone, shut myself in and act like a war criminal in a Russian gulag rather than find a way to deal with it even though better solutions and outcomes are possible with some work.

If I had the link for you to read I guarantee you would think the same. Again it's not the story or trope itself I have a problem with, just the plot and the way harry is characterized is, what would be a good way to say it, over-exaggeratingly angsty and emo for the sake of trying to force you to emphasize with him rather than allowing it to come naturally through understanding and comprehension of being in that situation by ourself.

It's not about the story, it's about the tragedy, the universe destroying angst and loss of will to live that is stamped in your face because you have to feel bad about it to. That's not how to write a well written story, and definitely not how to convey such circumstances.

Hold on there. /Forced/ to live together, maybe not, but merely arranged by someone other than the couple themselves - well, be cautious about knocking what you haven't tried. It seems plausible to me that in many cases, parents or even impersonal algorithms might achieve a pretty favourable success rate compared to the way people choose for themselves.

Especially when an arranged marriage naturally comes with the expectation that happiness will require adaptation and work. Setting realistic expectations is a good starting point.

** “The Marriage Law Challenge was a fanfiction challenge proposed by chelleybean at the WIKTT Yahoo! Group [in 2003]. The premise of the challenge is a forced marriage of a Muggle-born to a Pure-blood due to a new decree passed by the Ministry for Magic to help preserve the magical population. A number of variants of the challenge have developed.” -fanlore ([[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Marriage_Law_Challenge]])

*** Yes, this is the answer to where it comes from. The original WIKTT MLC of 2003. Back when we didn't know as much about Snape, and pureblood culture was even more a mystery than it still is today.

To further answer OP's questions, there is something to the "odd couples" argument. SS/HG is one of the most popular ships, and there are lots of us who enjoy MLC fics because we already like the characters and don't want to have to read 100k words for how they first got together. I like a good slow-burn just as much as the next romance reader, but I also like action, comedy, and any other way to treat MLC. I /really/ like MLC along with the Fake Relationship trope.

Pure MLC is a guilty pleasure all about power dynamics, and I don't generally recommend them outside the SS/HG ship. Lots of folks are really uncomfortable about the age gap and student/teacher aspects of the relationship, so adding in a Marriage Law muddies the waters even more and provides more drama. When the story is about how the pair who are "forced" to get married decide to use a Fake Relationship to regain some autonomy, those are the ones I like best. Especially in the SS/HG ship -- they are some of the most intelligent characters in the series, so when they team up to "outwit" the Ministry's backwards decrees, there's a lot of satisfaction in it, with or without the romance.

I've seen them done every way (serious, comedy, pwp, mystery, action, etc). I think most of them are tagged/categorized as slow burn romance, and they can be very sweet and sincere. Some are just thinly veiled dubcon PWP, which can be a little squicky. BUT that's what makes it a good trope -- there are lots of ways to treat it, but ultimately you get a good excuse for your favorite ship to spend more time together.

There are also a bunch of variants on this trope. The original MLC was a Ministry Law for boosting the population. Sometimes it's Voldy giving his DE's harems. One of my absolute favorites is the economic extortion of post-war Hogwarts providing a higher salary for married teachers: In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][The Marriage Benefit by miamadwyn]], Snape and Hermione dial up the Fake Relationship to 11, and it's full of some of the best, funniest /banter/ that SS/HG has to offer.

** Some fics take the more realistic approach of it being something the Dark-aligned Purebloods pushed through (using your explanations above as an excuse) with the details basically handing Harry and his friends/allies over to Death-Eater sympathizing spouses. The plan is generally to enslave their enemies via the law and/or claim all of their financial/political clout (often by inheriting it after their spouses' "tragic accidents").

*** I agree that Voldemort would probably do something like this.

But most of the marriage law fics I've seen have the premise that the war is over, Voldemort lost, and now the population needs to increase and also the pure blood families need new blood because they keep having squibs and purebloods can only have one child (canon evidence- Draco is an only child). So it gets put forward by Kingsley as Minister and usually Hermione is the only one to see it for the utter madness it is. By the end she changes her mind because she luuuurves Draco now.

I much prefer your idea, that it could be used to show parallels between the death eaters and irl cults. But all too often it's presented as something reasonable, done by the good guys, to "protect wizarding society."

** Like many tropes we have, I blame the other wildly popular fanfiction community, the Naruto one(of which I am part of too).

Many of the tropes we see in HP can be traced back to them, and I think, as a whole, their community is older.

-Arranged Marriages, ha! CRA(Clan Restoration Act), lol, also this was a custom that the Japanese kept for longer than most of the Western countries did, and wasn't limited to Major Houses or Royalty like Europe did after the Middle Ages, either.

-Titles? Heir Potter? I remember many fics where they brought the whole -sama thing there, and used some old feudal Japanese custom where people were addressed as Heir or Heiress, though IIRC only in very formal events, not when they meet in school.

-Naruto in fanfictions also has the habit of being given lots of surnames that end up hyphenated.

Though I think if you asked the same question there they would say it was the HP's Community "fault".

I don't think we can get a straight answer, probably got very popular with some challenges but the trope was already there, it's not like we can point at the Harry/Fleur and say it was started by Letters, even if for many it mostly was.

** I usually don't read fic that I know are based off of that trope. Mostly because I don't like them, but they are very popular. I think that it is a way for the author to get a relationship started between two characters that normally wouldn't happen. For example: Hermione/Draco.

I mean, I have read some really good Hermione/Draco fanfic, but usually the authors take their time and set up the relationship whereas with marriage law fic the two are forced to have a relationship.

I feel that the best hate/love stories are ones where the author builds up the relationship between two characters as opposed to forcing it. Which seems to be very common in marriage law fics.
