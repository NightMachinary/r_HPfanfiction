Apologies if you all are already aware of this. I'm sharing it because I definitely was not. I was flipping through Deathly Hallows this morning to look up something for my fic, and I came across something that floored me a bit.

Early on in the book, Hermione explains her plan with her parents, which we're all very familiar with:

#+begin_quote
  'I've also modified my parents' memories so that they're convinced they're really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life's ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That's to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me --- or you, because unfortunately, I've told them quite a bit about you. Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I'll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don't --- well, I think I've cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy.'
#+end_quote

Right. We all know that. But then, /two chapters later/, after the trio are attacked by Death Eaters in the caf√©, this scene happens:

#+begin_quote
  'We just need to wipe their memories,' said Harry. 'It's better like that, it'll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it'd be obvious we were here.'

  'You're the boss,' said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. 'But I've never done a Memory Charm.'

  'Nor have I,' said Hermione, 'but I know the theory.'

  She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov's forehead and said, '/Obliviate/.'

  At once, Dolohov's eyes became unfocused and dreamy.
#+end_quote

....what?

Well... all right then. This introduces a option into my fic that I hadn't been aware of before. I guess 'modifying memories' is something you can do that's different than a Memory Charm.


** She used the False Memory Charm, not the Obliviate Memory Charm. One plants false memories, the other removes/suppresses them.

*** didnt know, there are 2 types of memory charms. Since Hermione, Lockheart and this Ministry Guy at the Quidditch Cup used "Obliviate", i really think, its the same spell, BUT its full usage isnt reached, when simply manipulate a Memory. After all, erase a Memory is easier than replace/maniplulate it.

***** if we consider the Movies as "extentions", then she indeed used the same spell. Remember Lockhart was about to use the Spell to wipe out Harry Memories. Hermione used it in the same Movie with the same incantation but different effects.

The actual use for manipulate the DEs Memory was so, that the "Forbidden Name" trail was ringing, but the DEs found nothing and couldnt remember ever seeing the Trio. It is, after all, possible that the ones who used Voldemorts name did it on purpose immediately before disapparating to make fun (or fools) of the DEs

******* Oh, i totally agree with you. Yes, they have many flaws of the adapted stuff. But those who are adapted correctly and "show more", than there is in the Books, you can consider them as extensions....or you dont consider it. Its your Choice.

Still, despite what the HP wikia might tell, i see the replacement and erasing Charm as one and the same memory Charm. Because it sound like a later extension of Rowling to explain things. Here i have to say: if she has "forgot" to mention so many things, then reewrite the Books again and insert them there. Otherwise she can make something out of thin air.

** There's a third possibility: she convinced them to flee, and then had her /own/ memories modified so she believed they were under a false name in another country. That way, if /she/ gets interrogated/mind-probed, she can't lead them back to her family.

*** from a logical perspective, this makes so much more sense. I mean, the strength of a memory charm that would be needed to make someone forget their own name, and not have permanent brain damage after all is through. It would make so much more sense to modify hermione's memory, which would only be inserting a single memory of performing a spell, vs the lifetime of memories

**** I dislike it. Less horrifying violation of consent.

For me this is one of the most important moments in Hermione's character development - it shows how thoroughly she has adopted wizarding cultural norms. It goes well with her statement in GoF that technology is a "replacement for magic". Like other wizards, Hermione has come to view magic as natural and its absence as a disability, with Muggles unable to properly take care of themselves or make their own decisions.

**** It also makes sense of the phenomenon of her remembering having mucked with her parents' memories but, when called upon to actually muck with someone's memory, only knowing the theory.

(In her position, I'd've seriously gone for it with the memory charm, and given them the Full Lockhart. Theory's nothing without practical familiarisation, and look! Volunteer practise dummies.)

** The simplest explanation is that her parents are dead. She's not ready to process it and /really/ doesn't want to face Harry and Ron's reactions, so she makes up the memory charm story.
