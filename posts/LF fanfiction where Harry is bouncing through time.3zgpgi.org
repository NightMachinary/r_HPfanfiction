#+begin_quote
  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

**** True. I think I've gotten to the point where I've read all the good completed fiction, and take what I can. Sure, I still prefer completed stories, but incompleye/abandoned don't bother me like they used to. Oh well.

*** Harry winds up spending a couple of days possessing various people in the past before heading back to the present each time. From what I remember he's a ghost that nobody can see in the present and if he looks into someone's eyes he ends in their head 40 years in the past or so. I think there are some other limits to it, but I can't really recall them at the moment.

** Hm.. well, Harry visits two time periods in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673904/1/Harry-Potter-My-Way][Harry Potter My Way]], the founders and his parents, both for a period of 3 years.. but it's honestly not that good a book.

Better is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106557/1/The-Time-Ship][The Time Ship]] - A Harry Potter, The Time Machine, and Dr Who crossover in a way, saying more would spoil it I think, but it's really very good and somewhat meets your requirements.

  Semi-sequel to "In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter." Voldemort was dead, all was well, but the real enemy had yet to reveal himself. Time-Travel Story.

*** Dimension hopping can be fun, but what I'm looking for is closer to timeloop stories but with the bits of the loop intermingled with each other. Kinda how A Long Journey Home swaps from the present to a random time in the past, or how Coexistence goes from past to present every couple of chapters.
