  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

*** I second this. I actually just finished re-reading it and came in to the comments to suggest it.

Warning, this fic is a "seven shot". Each chapter is a condensed version of the whole book. It also really doesn't diverge from cannon much in that harry always finds himself in the same situations even if he logically shouldn't really be there. So if you were looking for something more substantial, look elsewhere.

It's a fun fic regardless though, and can easily be read in a day, so it's not like it's that much of an investment.

** In GoF Harry's first instinct is to summon scuba gear but they dismissed it. It would be difficult to learn how plus, statute of secrecy. Can't have that stuff flying across the country.

*** Flying across from an accio, no, but if he'd solved the egg earlier maybe he could have paid a Hogsmeade shopkeeper to go to a muggle shop and purchase one for him and bring it up to the castle, or owl it from Hogsmeade with like 10 owls or something.

*** I do have to agree that there are some cases where magic does trump the normal solution, and gillyweed worked just so much better than scuba gear would have - and his friendly elf friend acquired it for him. I'm not convinced a net would have worked, either...but I am very certain a tranq gun would have sorted Fluffy >:D

**** Spiked honey cakes would have sorted Fluffy. No need to get fancy or try to use tools you have no training for.
