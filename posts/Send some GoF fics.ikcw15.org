Currenty quite interested in GoF fics, or Triwizard Tournament variations. send 'em my way.

Edit: wow thanks for these. Should keep me busy for at least an hour ;).

Thx


** So, I've just realised people have spent far too long talking to me about G.R.R Martin recently - I just looked at your title and without any irony went "Game of... Frones? I think you spelled that one wrong, mate." before I realised it meant Goblet of Fire.

Anyway, do you have any limitations on what you wanna read? - fem!Harry, canon compliant, romance or gen, slash or no slash, Slytherin Grey Douchebag Harry, Slytherin Grey Less-of-a-Douchebag Harry, First person or third person, Veela shit, everyone lives/everyone dies, evil Weasleys/Dumbledore, good Snappy, etc.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7469856/1/Hallowed]] - Harry does the tournament in 6th year. Great fic.

**** Although it hasn't aged well trope and writing-wise, TLIL is just sheer /fun/, in the way that a Schwarzenegger movie is fun.

In fact the whole thing is rather structured like an 80's movie; the action scenes, the romance scenes, Harry's absurd grimdark lines that he narrates to himself (I am Igor Karkaroff's judge, jury and executioner). It couldn't be more 80's if Harry was driving a boat in Miami and snorting cocaine.

It's just loltastic, doesn't itself seriously and has some great action scenes. There isn't a GoF rewrite I enjoy more.

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

** Not sure it's what you're after but my own fic 'Behind the Hatred' is from the perspective of a Beauxbatons student who went to Hogwarts for the tournament (and falls in love with Terry Boot).

** linkffn(Consuming Shadows)

The above book features a Beauxbaton Harry with an alive Lily and a Tom Riddle pairing, but it is entirely set in the GoF. So you can check that out and also, if you've read the Pureblood Pretence series, the Futile Facade has an entirely unique and brilliant take of the TriWizard tournament.

Hope this helps :)
