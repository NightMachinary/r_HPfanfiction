I'm looking for recommendations on the best fics where Hermione undertakes a potions apprenticeship under Snape. Preferably during their time at Hogwarts, and preferably resulting in some conflict with Harry and Ron over it ("He's a slimy git, Mione!" "This is a rare opportunity, Ronald!") Preferably non-Snamione, but if it has to be Snamione then well written please. Thanks much!


** I believe this fic has her as his potions apprentice: linkffn(The Professor's Discretion by Twelve Years in Azkaban). Snapes character and dialogue here is spot on. There are some minor romantic undertones in the last few chapters but the fic is gen.

  The only thing keeping Hermione out of trouble and Harry Potter alive is... the Professor's Discretion. AU.

*** Starting on this. I'm loving the interactions between Snape and Hermione. Snamione might grow on me yet.

**** I am glad to hear that. I love everything from Aurette. She writes those two so so well and her funny fics are hilarious. Try 'appetizers' for example, it's short.

** It doesn't result in any conflict and it isn't a /major/ plotline, but an apprenticeship from Snape does occur in linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat).

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
