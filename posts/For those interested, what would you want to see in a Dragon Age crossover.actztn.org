I'm thinking of possibly writing one, probably with Harry (maybe, maybe Hermione) travelling into the Dragon Age universe / Thedas around the time of Inquisition, and I guess I just want to know what sort of elements people would want to see in it.


** Harry not losing his magic, and still uses his magic intelligently. (Read a fic where Harry was lost and couldnt find water, almost dying of thirst, despite knowing the watermaking charm)

*** Honestly, one of the ideas I've got running through my head is that he still has his brand of magic without being OP / that much better than the DA magic; each would have its highs and lows, without being too much or too little.

**** If Harry retains his magic, something you could try is make it so that he is still open to possession and how he has to deal with this new danger. Also, don't get stepped on by Templars.

** TBH I would love to read whatever. Dragon Age is one on my favorite games of all time, besides Mass Effect. I'd love for Harry not to lose his magic per se, but to have to learn the magic of Thedas, because the one from his world doesn't work anymore. Also, depending on the setting, if it was a MoD situation, where he is reborn in another universe, I'd enjoy if Harry was either Orlesian (partly for the comedic inner dialogue of a Brit "being in the body of a pseudo-french"), or a Free-marcher (possibly a Trevelyan, love my Inky)

*** I'm genuinely tempted to make him be reborn as / soul transfer / whatever magic bullshit you want as an Evanuris, probably Falon'Din: Friend of the Dead, the Guide. Or an old god. Just to make things more complex.

EDIT: or a champion / manifestation / shard of / servant / Master of Falon'Din. Honestly, I just like the idea of two beings of death having a connection.

** Not Hermione, because writers can't resist turning her into Hermy-sue and writing that she's the most beautiful in this new land etc.

Harry keeping his brain, and keeping his Magic, but more of a looser in morals Harry, giving the chantry a real reason to suspect him if it's Inquisition. Not Evil, but willing to Avada his enemies. Death Magic and such being seen as evil by the Creator, him being seen as a form of Apostate/Maleficarum as far as the Chantry are concerned, but as he uses his Magic to HELP, then the Inquisition will go with it.

Canon Harry/co would be eaten alive as they were so hesitant on killing they'd die before they got to the Inquisition, and OC-centric fics that might as well be "Not relevant to Harry Potter except the character uses Wand Magic" are terrible.

** Keeping the DA characters internally consistent is an issue I see with DA fics often. For example, someone might write a fic like yours where Harry is dropped into Thedas and he becomes friends with Cassandra. But Cassandra would likely lose her shit over a dimension-hopping wizard who uses magic that's foreign to her, and could just as easily be a demon trying to deceive her. That doesn't mean that Harry and Cassandra /can't/ be friends, but it should have some challenge to it.

** FREEDOM FIGHTER HARRY :) (he wouldn't want to go to Circlekaban after all and be locked up!)

Not to mention that I'd want a travelling Harry who learns whatever magic is available in Thedas :) and who helps the Dwarfs fight the Darkspawn (maybe make them Golems through animation charms, so the Anvil of the Void is not needed anymore!) :)

Shapeshifting Harry (I still question why Rowling never let him learn to be an animagus! Damned, it's the best escape tool ever - especially if he can't use magic in muggle surroundings!)

Also: Blood magic (he wouldn't want to be unable to fight if a Templar smites him (unless the Harry-Verse magic is immune to that?))

I'd love to see him meet Flemeth and Morrigan (that would make for a great relationship...do gooder Harry with Morrigan who's a lot less good, but not outright amoral "I will kill you all")

I'd love to see Harry try to make potions and dabble with Lyrium and the blight (like Avernus!)...not to mention maybe him being a metamorph (helps to avoid capture if he can change his looks - especially at first when he doesn't know crap about his surroundings and has to survive!)
