** It's not 100% Harry (you'll see what I mean) but

The Lie I've Lived always gets a giggle out of me.

It's not amazing but it's worth a read if you want something light and humorous.

I think The Lie I've Lived is one of the few stories most of [[/r/HPfanfiction]] can agree on the quality of, in some way or another.

**** Well yes but I will admit that it's a guilty pleasure for me

Some people's guilty pleasures are pairings or bad tropes.

I read it for the Sorting Hat.

But yes. It is bad.

***** Hat is the best part of that story. He singlehandedly turned the story from "great" to "one of the best fan-fictions ever written".

He is hilarious. My favorite were his comments on Lily Potter's preferences when it comes to sex positions.

***** I've heard this opinion from a lot of people, especially on DLP, and I'm curious - can you elaborate on why you think it's bad?

edit: so I went out and re-read it (and what a productive use of four hours that was), and I can sort of see why people criticize it - there's definitely some issues with characterization, especially with Hermione and some of the Weasleys, but I'm willing to chalk that up to it being written at least in part before Deathly Hallows.

****** I think the biggest count against is probably Harry's relationship with Fleur, and the general treatment of women in the story. (That, at least, would be my opinion-- not sure about [[/u/JacElli]] or DLP)

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon]] is a Firefly & Harry Potter crossover. It's probably my favourite fanfic.

Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

Are there any stories where Harry follows One Punch Man's training regimen and gains similar strength, and that's the power Voldemort knows not? That could be pretty entertaining.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
