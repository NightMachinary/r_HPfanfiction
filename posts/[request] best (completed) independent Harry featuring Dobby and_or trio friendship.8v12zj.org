Hi all. I'm super new to Reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. I'm looking for any complete independent Harry fics with eccentric/silly/helpful Dobby/other house elves. Also I know a lot of independent fics usually have Ron/Weasley bashing so I'm looking for a good hp/rw friendship too if possible :)

Thanks for the help!


** You're doing good. linkffn(not even a first chance) Harry is Dobby after being sent back in time.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

** You're doing so good you even properly flair'd your post. You wouldn't believe how many people mix up Request and Looking For. Or even know how to flair at all.
