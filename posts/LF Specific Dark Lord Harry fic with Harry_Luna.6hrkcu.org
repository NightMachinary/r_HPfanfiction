I'm looking for a specific fic from around 2012. I was on a Fanfiction binge around that time, so I'll try and give only the details I'm mostly positive were in the fic.

It was a Harry/Luna story, where Harry decided to become a Dark Lord. I'm about 90% sure Hermione was killed by the Troll in first year. Luna was petrified in second year, Harry found some kind of diary in the Chamber of Secrets written by Salazar, and Ginny died. Harry managed to take control of the Basilisk and have it kill Tom.

I think Harry kept Tom's diary too.

The only other thing that comes at me (and trust me I cant forget this part) is when Harry and Luna get a bunch of old House Elves and use them to suicide bomb the Ministry so they can break someone (I think it was Ron) out of a holding cell.

I've been looking everywhere for this fic, contacting all of my reading buddies to see if they know about it, going through Dark Harry fics, and I've come up dry. I'm seriously starting to wonder if I just misremembered Partially Kissed Hero but I distinctly remember going 'wtf' at the Terrorist House Elves scene.


** I think this is what you're looking for [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic]]

Coincidentally, I was reading this a few weeks ago and found it in my search history. This is the one that Harry uses ancient runes and arithmency to go all ape shit banging on every female ever.

Edit: I just reread your description, and this fic only meets the plot line in the beginning. Maybe you are mixing some fics up??? I'm now second guessing myself af. Hope you found what you're looking for!

*** Thanks for the help, but I remember reading For Love of Magic and it definitely isn't it.

The stuff I listed is stuff I'm 90% sure was in the fic. The terrorist House Elves was 100%.
