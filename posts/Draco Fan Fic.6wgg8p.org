I used to follow SO many Draco fan fics back when LiveJournal was a thing (not sure if it still is?).

Anyone have any links to some good stories with Draco as the main character (and yes, some "adult themes" are fine)? I would love if they're completed since I'm a speed reader and would rather not wait.

Thanks!

Edit: ALSO! If there are any that are centered around having nothing to do with Cursed Child that would be great! As big of a fan as I am of the HP universe, I couldn't get into CC for the life of me.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
