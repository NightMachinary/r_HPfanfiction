  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

*** I like that you didn't mention the name of the house, since it would ruin the surprise at how awesome and fitting the name is.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11637611/1/][The Silent World of Cassandra Evans]] has a fem!Harry form her own house by Hogwarts magic taking a joke too seriously. It is crack with a rather grim beginning, but past chapter ~7 it turns to lighthearted humour.

** Linkffn(12717474) sort of fits, I think.

There was also a crack fic where the Sorting Hat declared that Harry got his own house, but I don't remember more than that.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2xd4on/eu_for_generations_hogwarts_students_have_been/coz3r8q/][House Ambaret]] by [[/u/luna_lovewell]] is really good. It's pretty much an origanal story set at Hogwarts, where the OC main character is sorted into the newly rediscovered House Amberet.

You do have to subscribe to Luna's Patreon to read the second half onwards though.
