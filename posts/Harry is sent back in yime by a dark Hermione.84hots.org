I started reading this than lost it, but from what I remember Hermnione goes dark, winds up with Ginny, and takes over the world, (Not necessarily in that order). Harry is with Luna when Hermione captures them, and sacrifices Luna to power the ritual to send Harry back. He gets there and is terrified of Hermione. Don't remember what year he was sent back to, though.

Please and thank you


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen) I'm guessing? Never read past the first chapter or so, but it sounds like what I remember.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
