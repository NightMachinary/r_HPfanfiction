** You are asking a very heavy, "high-level" game design question.

The answer to which is this: It depends.

Would making each individual spell have its own skill bog down the writing, would it make sense with how you handled other skill organization?

With the Skyrim model, are other types of skills(non magical) also broken down into parent skill categories. Also can you effectively classify all the types of magic, and will you use their different schools as a character point?

I personally think you can get away with anything, if you theme the whole game somewhat similarly and make it work for the character and plot.

** Well the first step to separating alchemy and potions is to decide what alchemy even is, because the only canon example is the philosopher's stone, yet there must be more because Dumbledore is a well known alchemist.

You pretty much have to invent it whole

** A better approach might be to first ask what the challenges that your protagonist has to overcome will be.

Then you can build your game system to meet those narrative needs.
