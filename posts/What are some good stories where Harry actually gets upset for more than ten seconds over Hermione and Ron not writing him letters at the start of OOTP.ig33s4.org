** I have to agree with you. That's a poor way to treat your best friend. People seems to ignore that there are other ways to communicate. For example: The guards for Harry could have passed the letters. Or they could have sent it by Phoenix fire. Or Hermione being the "smartest witch of her generation could have used telephone or muggle post" It's not like stuffy purebloods would have looked to intercept anything not Owl post and they don't even know about telephone.

#+begin_quote
  Isolating Harry over the summer before 5th year didn't work out like Dumbledore had hoped. Now, with her friend having run away, Hermione is left to pick up the pieces, trying to stand strong against the challenges in a school where racism and injustice are not only tolerated, but actively encouraged by some teachers. All she can do is wonder how Harry made it all look so easy!

I consider it the worst betrayal in the series, honestly. At least every other time, Ron and Hermione did things of their own volition. How little must you care for someone to accept orders to ignore your best friend? In real life, I don't even listen to people who order me to stop speaking to /my enemies/. Let alone anyone I considered a friend.

IMO, you are exaggerating a bit here.

It was also set up that the Ministry was spying on him. So it is established that they didn't do it because they wanted to or intentionally. It was necessity. So at least it's not negligence as they kept counting the days to see Harry again and the Orderly a track on him.

**** All they didn't put into their /unsecure, owl-shipped letters/ was secret intel on the war. They wrote normal letters back and forth - just without top secret data included. We know owls can easily be intercepted. Harry's owl is extremely noticeable. The Death Eaters know where he lives, even if they can't actually go there.

  The world, universe, fate, it's all very complicated. Too complicated in fact and explaining it would take far too long, better to move on. The important thing is that everything is connected. The Universe can be changed by the simplest little things. Harry Potter's life changed because of one simple thing: Homework.
