There's lots of Draco/Hermione fics where Draco's a death eater linkffn(1806983) linkffn(2254316) and obsessed with Hermione and keeping her safe but not actually on the side of good. Anyone got any Snape fics where he's playing both sides and is only concerned with him and Hermione getting through the war? Or enacting their own plan to rule the world?
