** Huh. I guess that's why he's evil. He's not malicious, he's just going for 100% completion of quests, nevermind that a bunch of them are evil deeds for demon lords and that he sided with Death Eaters over Ministry in the Civil War questline.

** Probably none, I checked a lot of gamer fanfics for harry potter but only found harry gamer, Neville gamer, a few Hermione gamer, one gamer of who worked with Voldemort and I think the rest were oc characters.

Why would you want Voldemort to have a world destroying ability though? I could understand if it was Tom Riddle due to him not being crazy but the dark lord himself?
