I'm looking for well written, good stories in which Harry is in some way not the general idea of light or good. I have no definite requirements beyond that, that the story has to be good, and that it has to be a decent length. Thank you.

** Check [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/35/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] + [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendant]] (WiP, w(T)≈300K). The protagonist doesn't try to be immoral and “evil” for the sake of it or because she deems it “cool”. E.g. there was some other story where the main hero was getting off of people's suffering and of being able to crudely dominate them---like one would expect from a little king of a banana republic---and that is not what I am recommending.

Here, instead, she's merely amoral and pragmatical because that's how she was raised and how her flavour of magic operates.

Downsides: WiP + contains some low-level humour---especially at the beginning. Possible downside (depends on how the author will eventually play it out)---2nd book spoilers!---she's under the control of an evil god because of a “contract” her teacher made her sign with him when she was too little to realize what she was getting into. The character of this evil god, by the way, seems to be borrowed from the 3rd season of American Horror Story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3750393/1/Harry-Potter-s-Life-Lessons][Harry Potter's Life Lesson's.]] Perfect Amoral!Harry, but it's a short pleasure.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium][Moratorium]] !Gray Harry !Dark Harry !Manipulative Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry. No fancy sex triangles or anything, I don't think there's even a pairing. But it definitely fits Dark!Harry.
