So I was in the process of writing some more content for my current story, when I realised that most, if not all of the magical world's publications are printed on paper of a sort, rather than the thick rolls of parchment that they use for almost everything else written.

I understand that something like the /Daily Prophet/ would be hugely impractical to print onto parchment, but if magicals are happy to use some kind of refined paper for their printed works, why not just use it in everyday life too? It's already established that characters can own muggle stationery - Tom Riddle's Diary, for instance - and I assume take them to Hogwarts or elsewhere to write in privately, so it's not as if it's unheard of. Hell, I have a hard time thinking that the homework planners that Hermione gets Harry and Ron in (I think OOTP?) are made out of parchment, yet a planner or notebook is clearly intended for writing in.

Is it simply to do with the fact that they all use quills rather than any kind of actual pens (a dip/nib pen would be a perfect substitute for a quill, some of which might already have a similar kind of tip attached to them anyway), and need a thicker medium on which to write?

What are your thoughts? Bonus points for any cool fanon explanations you'd want to pitch!


** My guess is that it all comes down to the underlying mindset of producing materials with magic, and the fact that mass production hasn't been introduced in the wizarding world.

Wizards have magic, and (with the only notable exception being potions) use it almost exclusively through their wands. This means that if a wizard is going to make a thing, he's going to cast spells on stuff with his wand until he produces what he wants. Any sort of complex machinery isn't going to be useful or anything a wizard considers making, because machines can't cast magic, and a wizard can only cast one spell at a time.

So way back in the day, wizards and muggles alike discovered that they could make parchment by treating animal skin in a certain way. But for muggles, they eventually needed a faster method of production. You can only raise or catch and kill animals so fast. You have to wet and dry and wet and dry the skin. There are lots of limiting factors in the process that can't be done any faster. However, for wizards, this isn't the case at all. A wizard can soak, dry, stretch, or treat the skin in an instant. Transfiguration means that the source materials don't necessarily have to be animals in the first place. Hell, there's probably a transfiguration spell to simply make something into parchment immediately. And perhaps most significantly, there are charms to duplicate and increase the quantity of materials with virtually no limits. So basically, individual wizards could produce as much parchment as they needed, as fast as they needed, and never needed to look into alternate products.

Another point to consider is that the magical population is /significantly/ lower than the muggle population. So in many cases, mass production is not something that would necessarily be as needed or cost-efficient in the wizarding world.

And also, parchment doesn't necessarily have to come in rolls. Some very simple charms that probably every wizard can do could lengthen, cut, and reshape it. The only reason we've heard so much about rolls of parchment is because the books are mostly set in Hogwarts, and rolls of parchment seems to be the standard for school essays.

I hope that gave a decent answer to your question. I've thought about stuff like this a lot, and have a ton more thoughts on the matter that I could provide if you're curious. But basically, to understand the specific stuff the wizarding world uses, you have to think way back and boil it down to the basic underlying philosophies and how magic would influence the culture from the ground up, because it really makes things a /lot/ different. A common mistake is to look at the differences in materials and technology and think that the wizarding world is simply a couple centuries behind the muggle world, because that isn't true at all. Instead, it's developed in a different direction.

TL;DR: Production with magic involves an entirely different philosophy, it's all about craftsmanship as opposed to mass production.

*** the craftsmanship argument is also what answers the question of the sustaining quality of the wizarding economy: its clear that specialization of crafts and skills sustains the post-scarcity economy. Or in other words, the scarcity is skill (for whatever)

** Some thoughts on the matter:

- Tradition. Wizards love it.

- Government corruption. Perhaps the wizarding parchment manufacturers paid for a law to be passed restricting the sales of paper for use as stationary.

- Parchment is tougher than paper. Perhaps this is needed to stand up to the rigors of a magical learning environment.

** Easy to produce. I made a point in another thread, that the Duplication Charm, canonically doesn't vanish and disappear after a certain amount of time, dispute what fanon claims. Instead it is more prone to rot and tarnish, becoming "worthless". Geminio increases the reactivity of items. However, parchment is much studier than paper, and likely can stand up to a lot more abuse, and time. At that point, it is a matter of convenience. For a society which values knowledge above all else, the power to copy a book, or some notes instantly and perfectly is invaluable. We don't even have that capability in 2017. We have to scan a book, then print each page. Yes, we can mass produce books, but for a tiny society which doesn't really benefit from automation, being able to just copy something in a second is amazing.

The Daily Prophet doesn't have to last long. It is probably better if it does decay faster, if it gets left out in the Muggle world for whatever reason.

Anyway, we don't really know what Wizarding books are made of. They may well be made of a magically refined parchment. Imagine taking a large piece of parchment, and then shrinking it, so it is as thin as paper, but retains it's properties.

There are a lot of explainations for weird things in the Wizarding World, if you think a bit. Hope this helps!

** All parchment actually comes from a breed of magical cows whose skin is particularly receptive to enchantments, and all kinds of parchments Hogwards allows students to use are enchanted with "anti-dictaquil" and some other anti-cheat methods. Why else do you think the muggle-borns haven't revolutionized writing equipment yet?

That's why magical contracts are made with parchment but books and the like don't need to use it. Of course, the binding of the books still uses the material and is thus very enchantable too.

There, kinda makes sense no?

** I think its simply because of tradition. Its not like wizard would actually have a problem with the cost of it when they can simply produce cheap parchment with the use of transfiguration. It probably also allows them to feel superior to most muggles who couldn't afford to use parchment in amounts that large.

The reason why they use quills is probably because by the times pens were invented there was already a established market of enchanted quills. I mean why would you integrate pens into your society if you have quills which are self inking, spell checking, can be dictated what to write, and can answer automatically.

** Isolation I believe. For many magicals who are born into magical families, they would hear about the non-magical world from their parents/grandparents before Hogwarts. Dumbledore was born at the end of the 19th century and he was still alive at 1990s. So think about it: the headmaster of Hogwarts was born in an era where a lot of people in non-magical world were still using parchments and quills. (Pottermore says 1881) I'm sure there are also many grandparents that were born at similar dates. Even Arthur Weasey had been so clueless about muggle items, just imagine how cluless others would be. And imagine those people living only with their kind in their own isolated world. Where would they learn about muggles? Their own parents first and then from muggleborn children in Hogwarts. (And I'm sure there wouldn't be much information transfer from muggleborns to magicals. It would be opposite. Muggleborns would ask many questions about magic.) And what would they say about the non-magical world to their children/grandchildren? About what little they know. And in the non-magical world, people used quills and parchments even in 1800s (although they started fountain pens, it was only the rich people who used them). So isolation is my answers to your question.

Also from that perspective: magicals seeing muggles as barbarians with no worth is also actually very possible thing even in 1990s. Imagine how different lives of muggles and magicals would be in the middle ages. In a fic I read long ago, there was a line sth like that: "They were still using chamber pots and cleaning them with their hands while we could just enchant them the vanish it". In middle ages, wizards and witches would live like gods. Their living standarts would be much much better than even non-magical royality. And if they had little to no contact with non-magicals, they would have no need to borrow ideas from them thinking them to be still primitive. Maybe one or two people in every generation would check out non-magical contraptions and try to make magical counterparts but it would be a very slow process.

I believe one reason could also be that there are many enchanted quills and parchments and instead of changing all of those, it makes it easier to continue tradition. And perhaps those blood quills had some sort of real use instead of torturing children?

** I can't remember which fic it was in, but the reason they used quills and parchment is that quills, having come from living animals, can channel minute amounts of magic, and imbue parchment, which can also retain that magic better than muggle paper or regular wizarding stationary, with the students' magical signatures.

So by using a simple spell, they can compare an assignment's magical signature with the signature on record for a student and instantly verify whether a student wrote it themselves.

I think it was also expanded upon in that contracts were also on parchment and signed with quills for this same reason. By using magical signatures (embedded within the written signature), a contract can be verified by simply checking for valid and correct magical signatures.

It's been the most logical reason behind parchment and quills for students when they clearly have printing presses and normal books and such.

*** That explanation does not sit well with me. Living trees are at least possibly magical (wandwood), and if mundane animalskins work, mundane tree pulp should too. At that point, the best justification you could have is that machinery, or prolonged contact with metal, channels magic out of formerly living things, but then you could easily produce paper using only non-metallic substances & magic, especially once plastics were invented.

Similarly, it is trivial, again especially if using magic to manufacture, to create modern pens entirely out of 'organic' materials.

** Parchment holds onto ink better, I think. Aside from that, it's likely harder to use magic on as it's thicker, making it harder to cheat on homework. Quills have more longevity than pencils or pens as they can't break in the middle of class while you're writing an important essay, due to them being made of stronger materials than simple wood or plastic (Quills have metal tips I believe). There's also something to say about the fact that pens/pencils are muggle inventions and wizards want to show that because something is new, doesn't automatically make it superior, maybe just more convenient.

****** That I agree with, normal quills generally aren't more sturdy than metal or wood. Certainly, quills won't break in the middle of writing the way pencils can (which is why you are a fool if you don't carry a sharpener with you and that's that, it's a few seconds to get it working again if you do), but they do definitely get worn down quicker than wood, though I can't say about plastic as it's a gamble with that one, and alas metal as the main building material for pens is not the most common thing when it comes to the cheapest stuff.
