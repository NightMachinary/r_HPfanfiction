** I wrote [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22160956/chapters/52900930][this]], a series of letters between Regulus and Sirius that were never sent, that you might find interesting - I've also got a load of drabbles about their relationship with varying levels of angst. linkao3(22160956)

  Regulus Black is just a second son. He speaks when spoken too, he shuts up when dismissed.But beneath his bed he hoards stacks of stolen muggle library books. He thinks about Greek myths. He plans the deaths of tyrants. Everyone has a story to weave.

  Why was Sirius convinced that Peter would be the better option for the Potters' secret keeper? The Fidelius charm is designed so that the secret cannot be tortured out of the secret keeper, but Sirius still refuses to accept the responsibility.It leads us to assume that there must have been certain scenarios that Sirius could think of where he might, just might divulge the secret. Even though he'd die for James.It's here that we must remember that Sirius has a family on the other side.

#+begin_quote
  Regulus waits for hours. For hours, he stands on that cursed cliff, the black waters churning and gushing and crashing far below. Even as far up as he is, the air is heavy with spray. He breathes in the salt, and tries to cast his mind back to childhood visits the seaside. He can't. It smells too much like blood.There is an odd noise behind him, inhuman footsteps, nails on rock-Regulus spins around and finds a large, wet, dog. It's huge, and black. The dark eyes are wide and intelligent; far too intelligent to be a convenient stray.  Regulus laughs hysterically. He has been sent a Grim. An omen of death that should be sent to the unwary, not to someone who is attempting what is tantamount to suicide.   The Grim walks closer, eyes wary, and Regulus tells it helplessly, "It is alright, I already know." His voice doesn't waver, and he takes a moment to be viciously proud of himself for that. "I am going to die."Or:Regulus hopes for a chance to say goodbye to Sirius, and somehow that changes everything.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is probably not entirely what you are looking for, but it features both Sirius and Regulus as friendly brothers.

It's not a major plot point, neither does it appear right at the beginning, is a rather long story.

It's also /not/ finished but gets updated every month or every other week.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
