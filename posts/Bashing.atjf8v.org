The ever contentious word. However, at what point is it truly bashing? In some cases, like in most of Sinyk's work or in the classic crack fic Champion's Champion I can see the term being applicable. The characters' negative qualities are magnified to the point of mockery.

However, I have seen many fics where Dumbledore, Molly, Ron, Snape, etc cast in the role of villains where they are capable antagonists are labeled as "bashing."

Why? Is it because the character is behaving out of the norm from their canonical circumstances (though arguably those might still be true) and not a carbon copy of JK's work?

If I were to write a story with a capable puppet master Dumbledore is be being bashed or recast?

While he is an ineffectual twerp in canon, and is often portrayed that way in fanon, you rarely see a label "Draco bashing," yet Snape being a villain (not too far from the truth, but that is a soapbox for another day) is seen as "bashing."

I would like to know other people's opinions on this potentially misused label, but keep it civil. This isn't about who you like or why x character is "totally misunderstood because the actor is hot."


** For me Bashing is Bashing when a writer can have written the chapter and then goes back to figure out where he can throw in some snide remarks and a quick little display of power throughout the chapter.

Like Ron's eating habits whenever Harry and Ron end up being remotely close to one another as they eat. Or Harry and Ron are remotely close to one another when a Slytherin friend/LI comes over Ron can't help but butt in.

Or Something happens somewhere else and Ron or Draco is there to throw a snide comment at Harry and he quickly slams them into a wall or stuns them before leaving.

As soon as a minimal amount of actual effort is made it is not bashing any more, it is just dark/evil/Non-canon characterisations.

*** Ron's eating habits are always interesting, and his apparent tendency to butt in, or just get jealous and leave, can be tricky to work with.

I think the difference between bashing and just portraying the character, is how their negative traits are shown. Bashing would be focusing on any irritating or negative traits as an example of how they're the worst person in the universe. On the other hand, portraying the character as flawed and imperfect, but still worthwhile, would be done by showing these traits as flaws, that the character does have, but having those around the character see them as things that aren't of great import, can be worked around, or are even endearing.

Does that make sense? I'm tired AF today, so I don't know.

** The difference between bashing and villainizing a character is that a villainous character does not have to be a loser or universally hated. A villain can still be a fun and engaging character, as well as being treated with respect from the narrative.

Bashing means that you through your story keep telling the reader "This character SUCKS!" It's a way of declaring your hatred for a character and insisting that the reader should hate the character too. You don't even have to turn a character into a villain in order to bash them... plenty of Ron-bashing fics don't turn him into a villain, they just turn him into a pathetic loser with no redeeming qualities whom nobody likes.

So, to take your idea with a capable puppet master Dumbledore... well, turning Dumbledore evil often goes hand in hand with bashing because it doesn't come from a "what cool story could I tell with Dumbledore as a villain?" mindset... it comes from a place of anger, loathing and a hint of revenge: "Dumbledore SUCKS and he HAS to be a villain because all the crap he did to Harry so I'm going to write a story where Harry becomes super-powerful and exposes him for the total monster he is!"

And so, the "evil Dumbledore" story becomes not an interesting alternate take on a canon character, or a legitimate exploration of his darker sides. It just turns him into a cardboard figure who's really only there to be taken down by (a usually overpowered) Harry, while being told how much he sucks.

Turning a character into a villain without bashing requires a LOT more effort. For one thing, if you just want to turn them into a villain in order to see your fave characters beat them cause you feel they deserve it, that's going to be bashing no matter how you put it.

*** Yes, lack of respect from the narrative is probably the best explanation of bashing.

** I consider it bashing when one of these three things occur:

1. The character is written as stupider/meaner than in canon, while eliminating his/her positive characteristics, without any explanation as to why the character has changed. ("Molly cast the Cruciatus Curse on Luna, telling her 'that will teach you to interrupt my lunch.'")
2. The narrative takes constant, gratuitous shots at the character but not at other characters. ("Molly heaved her fat bottom out of her bed and waddled to the kitchen, leaving a puddle of drool on her pillow.")
3. The people who canonically love the character suddenly despise him or her for his or her canon behavior. ("Arthur had always hated Molly for refusing to get a job outside the house. He also hated her because she yelled at Fred and George when they blew things up. In fact, Arthur hated everything about Molly and was carefully plotting her demise.")

** Bashing exists because the author finds it fun, and because there is an audience that likes it.

It's FF - it doesn't have to be canon compliant, and it definitely doesn't have to have a neutral take on all characters.

** It's considered bashing because it's essentially character assassination most of the time. Conflict created simply because the author dislikes some character.

** There's nothing new with the whole bashing experience. The Weasleys have been giving Harry and Hermione love potions? Oh no! Harry's been lied to by Dumbledore, and Dumbledore has been stealing money from him? Oh no.

Harry is actually heir to Potter/Malfoy/Black/Weasley/Dumbledore/Gryffindor Et Cetra and has a seat on the Wizengamot? For what reason? Harry has a trillion galleons, the majority of which he will never use, big whoop.

Harry is nice to the Goblins and suddenly the Goblins are nice to him? The Potters had a secret will, that says specifically that Pettigrew was the Secret Keeper that Dumbledore knew about, but kept hidden? Oh No!

Harry is a secret Animagus form that hasn't been seen since the times of Merlin?

Ron is the biggest idiot, who calls Hermione a Mudblood, and only wants her for her looks? (Which in these Hermione is often just replaced for Emma Watson) Snape's hatred of Harry is taken even more extreme then it was in canon?

Just why? Why all of that? It's been done to death, it's just for shock value or OP wank, if there were different takes on it, or expanded upon takes it would be different, but it's just not written well at all, for the majority of the time.

Bashing is more often then not used as a crutch, something that a writer uses when they can't think of a proper story themselves.

**** And then the very obnoxious Hadrian Potter and the like, just why?! Just why, I don't understand it. I mean we have a Prince Harry, if Harry is a good name for the prince, it's a good name for a Potter!

And the thing that really irks me is that the will thing, like Pettigrew is Secret Keeper, if we're dead then that means Pettigrew betrayed us, go get him! That's not a reasonable response for a will to have.

Also the only Lord that we know of is Lord Voldemort, and that's just a name that he thought of himself, do you honestly think that if Lords were a thing and that Lucius was one, Draco would keep quiet about it? I highly doubt so.

***** Well, some folks extrapolated the house system to give some depth to the vaguely blank canvas that is Wizarding Britain. I mean... Otherwise there is the Ministry and.... Pretty much nothing.

The secret keeper thing, if I were to write the will it would state "If the fidelius charm is broken, please check on Peter. He could be in grave danger as he is our secret keeper." Anticipating betrayal makes his selection suspect.

I am not overly fussed on the Harry is a nickname thing. That is up to the author and their AU. Pup, cub, and Prongslet /shudder/ drive me up the damn wall.

****** The please check on Peter because he might be in danger, is at least a lot better of a phrasing then if we're dead that means Pettigrew betrayed us! Which is something that I've seen in those Harry betrayed by people he used to look up to trope.

I just don't see James or Lily assuming that if they died then that means Pettigrew betrayed them. That's a bit too much, for me.
