I find it extremely unrealistic that the Original Order was decimated yet almost all of the DA members who were children survived a battle against Death Eaters during the final battle of Hogwarts. They practice Dark Magic for godssake.

Would it be totally unacceptable if I killed of a few of them in my story that is an alternate version of the second war? I can already see the negative response from a mile.


** Several plausible reasons come to mind:

- OotP adults might have taken risks to protect the young ones.
- Those under 17 were sent into hiding or evacuated, so there might not have been many of them in the first place, relative to the number of unnamed adults.
- DEs would be more focused on taking out those they perceived the most dangerous: the more experienced witches and wizards.
- There is some circumstantial evidence that DEs had standing orders to spare pureblooded children if practical:

  - Voldemort outright tried to recruit Neville after.
  - At the Department of Mysteries at the end of OotP, the only one targeted with lethal magic was Hermione.

** You mean at the end of Order of The Phoenix? My reasoning is that most of them spent 10+ years in Azkaban, they are bound to lose some combative edge. The kids were losing, employing stall tactics in what amounts to a maze until the Order showed up. They had also spent time getting practical defensive magical lessons, which may have been the only thing to keep them alive that long. If Snape hadn't been a member they would have been properly fucked.

** It is abit unrealistic. Though Voldmort was prone to underestimating those he considered unworthy. I'm sure he didnt think an army of mostly half blood and muggle borns or even creatures could defeat him.

He seemed to underestimate Harry too.

I think the only person he was wary of underestimating was Dumbledore.

** No. I think you'd be fine with killing some of them, although it would depend on who you were thinking of killing and it is probably a good idea to develop them a bit.

As for why, other than plot reasons, I think it's possible and indeed very likely that most weren't facing Death Eaters (those saved for Order members) but the likes of Stanley Shunpikes (imperiused victims) in the battle .

Dark magic is evil. It does horrible things. You have to be a terrible person to use it. But nobody ever said anything about it being remotely effective in combat. Avada Kedavra takes like twice as long to say as most other spells, that's an eternity in battle.

** Death Eaters aren't exactly a trained army. They're basically just people who decided to go around terrorizing others. More like gang members or thugs. So except for a few particularly talented ones (Bellatrix, etc.) the average Death Eater probably isn't much better at combat magic than the average teenager who's been training for a year or more to fight them.

Just as much as people get mad at Harry for not training much, I doubt the Death Eaters in general train much either.

As for the first war--those few particularly talented ones can mean a lot in terms of actually pulling off murders. Especially since Voldemort himself probably killed lots of Order members.
