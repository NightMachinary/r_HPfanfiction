** Stretching the definition of Weasleys a bit (just Ginny), you get this gem linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11982933/1/Aunt-Marge-s-Even-Bigger-Mistake]]). Harry and Ginny are invited to Dudley's wedding and have fun with Marge. It's great.

** If you read the books the Weasley /do/ meet the Dursleys. The twins give Dudley one of their joke candies and turned his tongue big and purple.

*** If I read the books I'd also find that Harry goes to Hogwarts, yet somehow that doesn't stop me from wanting it in fanfics...

**** Yet you never see someone asking for a fanfic where Harry goes to Hogwarts. People generally make fanfic requests for stuff that /doesn't/ happen in canon. I was just pointing out that there was an instance, in canon, where the Weasleys meet the Dursleys in case they didn't know.
