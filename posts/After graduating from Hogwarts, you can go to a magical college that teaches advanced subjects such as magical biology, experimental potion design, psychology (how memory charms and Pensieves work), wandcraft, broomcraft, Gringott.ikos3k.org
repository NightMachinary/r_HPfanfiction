#+TITLE: After graduating from Hogwarts, you can go to a magical college that teaches advanced subjects such as: magical biology, experimental potion design, psychology (how memory charms and Pensieves work), wandcraft, broomcraft, Gringotts economy. Some wizard colleges even teach Muggle subjects.

Oh and medical education, magical surgery and which healing potions to administer.


** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i2n8vm/healing_in_harry_potter/]], here's why I don't think healing would involve surgery or be a muggle "healing" education. Anatomy seems important only for identification, healing spells don't seem to require knowledge of anatomy. I definitely think potions would play a large role, though, along with spells. In short, anatomical knowledge most likely takes a step back in favor of magical skill in the wizarding world.

Also, a lot of these subjects seem to be muggle subjects. I'd expect advanced topics to be alchemy, metaphysics, conceptualization/psychology, and continuations of the Hogwarts' classes.
