Hi all! I've recently read All part of the plan, and want some more fics in a similar vein. I also enjoyed The Arithmancer series. Any recommendations?


** linkao3(the changeling) and the rest of the Armstice series. The writing, plot, and character development is phenomenal.

** Sorry in advance because I have not read All Part Of The Plan, so I just rec female lead fics in general. Female lead as in anyone who is female, including a gender-bent Harry? If so, then may I shill my own fic:

linkffn(13512039)

There's also linkffn(13514676) though it hasn't been updated in a while because I concentrated on *A Different Perspective*. Also, while the main focus is on Lavender, the POV switches between her and Harry.

I also find linkffn(13510736) quite interesting and Silently Watches is a fantastic author, so I have very high hopes for that fic.

linkffn(13540525) is very interesting as well and I am already curious to see where it will go. Quite different.

I hope you find something here!

** Confectionary Chronicles is delightfully fun. It's apparently a crossover with Supernatural, but I haven't seen a single episode and know bugger all about the show except that apparently there's a cool gay angel in it played by Misha Collins and they met Death a few times. It's got Arithmancer vibes in that it's basically Hermione being reasonably awesome and fun.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/968343]]

Mistakes and Second Chances is pretty interesting - Fem!Harry and Fleur are weird magicals and kick arse.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15951056]]

Future's Past is basically a Victorian Romance Novel in prose, but with a standard spunky Fem!Harry who doesn't care for social norms and definitely would've been a fan of Anne Lister going back in time to meet Orion Black.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6762790]]

Charlotte the Great and Powerful is an interesting fic and there is honestly absolutely nothing else to say about it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3694820]]

Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise is just fun angry Fem!Harry shouting at things and being generally thorny in the side of everyone who irritates her wherever possible. I enjoyed it greatly. Also, really interesting tournament changes! :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12568760/1/]]

I can probably come up with a few more, but they'd be more along the request in the title than the clarification in the description.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

*** I just recently finished the Pureblood Pretense series, and I'd say it deserves more than a passing mention :). It starts off fairly simple - Harriett and her cousin Arcturus Black switch places so they can go to their preferred schools - but it gets ever more complex as you keep reading. She's a better student than canon Harry, exceptional even - but when you're pretending to be someone else, standing out becomes a real problem. She has unusual magical power, but that comes with a trade-off of reduced control and serious amounts of accidental magic - and then she turns thirteen, the age where magical cores mature, and her power grows out of control and becomes unusable without suppression jewelry that has dangerous side effects. And /then/ she finally gains proper control of it, but only after a horrifying experience of weeks of claustrophobic imprisonment and torture, and she ends up with a foreign intelligence in her head that might or might not be on her side in the long term.

Tom Riddle is interesting, too. This version didn't launch a violent war, instead opting for politics and legislation to achieve his goals, some but not all of which actually turn out to be reasonable, but if anything he's been a bigger threat to Harry's life than the canonical Voldemort was.

*** I had veered away from the pureblood pretense because the sparse descriptions I had heard of it had rung of the kind of pureblood felating nonsense that too many fics have. One of the main conflicts of the HP series is that of blood. Or, more precisely, of those that believe in blood superiority. These bloodpurists are framed to a tee as the bad guys.

But, because they have privilege and money, which people want, stories seem to delight in redrawing them as paragons of sense and propriety. Some stories take this to the point where they take characters and redesign them as purebloods eliminating aspects of their character for a asinine desire to make them "wizarding royalty."

I had dismissed these stories as not worth reading. I considered them to be full of petty twistings and justifications for characters to be the way that they are. I predicted tropes galore and an overrelience on making other characters two dimensionally bad to make the main characters look good. To my chagrin and delight, The Pureblood Pretense decimated that expectation.

Now, tropes are present, but in a good way. They are present for the same reason that they are commonly immitated in the first place, because when implimented well, the narrative repercussions are interesting and engaging. Best part of all, no bashing. Characters are characters rather than caricatures. The main characters stand out on their own merit rather than by the behest of other's incompetence.

Harry (or Rigel) is exceptional, but not overwhelingly so. Her talents are isolated even to the detriment of other abilities. She is not an effortless socialite and repeatedly bothers her friends with her flaws and behaviors. What she achieves is believable due to the work you also believe she puts in. Honestly, she doesn't have much of a life she works so hard, but she has to, and it's a damn good read. What exceptionallity she does have that isn't due to her own efforts is excellently implemented. Most importantly, it never comes across as wish fulfillment. at least not to an unacceptable level. The most unrealistic thing I can remember is that she manages to achieve a massive workload that is beyond her age competently without any repercussions. Could an eleven year old really study and practice multiple feilds of magic effectively while completing her year of work as well as work years ahead of her as well as several hours of potion work as well as keeping up a masive front? Maybe, but i imagine it would wear her down alot more than it seems to. This is a minor quibble in front of more positives than I have time to write right now. It's good, please read it and support the author.

It put me in the shoes of reading the HP series. I'm rediscovering a world and characters as they live and develop in a magical world rather than just playing around with the conventions and tropes of a well tread fandom. This stories popularity is well deserved.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Ginny made a thin, distressed sound. “I ... Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly.

Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically.
