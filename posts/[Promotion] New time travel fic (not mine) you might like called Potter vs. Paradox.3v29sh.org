I'm sure I'm not the only one who's guilty pleasure is reading time travel fics. However, it's hard to find good ones, least of all ones that are original or without tropes. I haven't finished this yet but I've enjoyed what I've read so far. I figured I'd promote it for any of you out there scouring for new time travel fics that haven't been suggested to death on here.

Edit: correct link


** I don't know, I'm kind of burned out on time travel fics.

They usually go like this: X years later, a main character either has an accident, or decides "the prices was too high," and ends up back in time.

The first few chapters involve either goofing around, or buying stuff they know will come in handy, and generally just enjoying being young.

Then everything gets Dark relatively quickly.

*** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][this time travel fic.]] It's a lot different than the ones you're thinking of.

And if you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]], then do that too. It's probably the best time travel fic there is in the fandom other than A Long Journey Home.

** Goddamn it, I have LITERALLY only just caught up with Circular Reasoning and I was really hoping the next HP story that took my interest wouldn't be another time travel fic. But nooooo, you /had/ to go and recommend one, didn't you? Now I've got to read this one and my other guilty pleasure premises will have to wait!

Also, as a sidenote, you've linked the seventh chapter of the story on ffdn. Just a heads up for anyone that clicks that link and is a bit befuddled about being dropped in to a story-in-progress

*** Hahaha oops. The best laid plans and all that...! And thanks for the heads up on the link. I've changed it to the correct chapter. I hope you do enjoy the story though!

** I loved the latest chapter. I had a suspicion she might do it, but that she did it, and how! And that unfortunate mental imagery of retrieving it without pants... (I hope that was spoiler-free enough)

It's a great story so far.

** Are there any HP x Timecop crossovers, where Van Damm shows up and tells Harry to knock it off with the time travel?
