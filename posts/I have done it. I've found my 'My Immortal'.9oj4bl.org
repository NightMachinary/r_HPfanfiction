Have you found a fanfiction like a trainwreck? So utterly terrible that you can't stop reading? That is a 'My Immortal'

I am so utterly done with Harry Potter fanfiction after finding my 'My Immortal'.

So post whatever fic is your 'My Immortal'

Mine happens to be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12588154/1/]] Eugh. So much potential spoiled.


** I cannot remember the name of the fic, but half way through it mentioned bombing turkey, and then spent a while discussing what a good thing this was because "turkey is a Muslim country". Does this ring any bells for anyone? It was pretty long as well known at one point.

**** Barefoot has nothing like that, there's some weird bits but no racism. You're thinking of For Love of Magic, a decent fic that went full terroist/nazi supremacist.

**** Reading the summary, I've definitely read that one, so possibly, but I was so horrified the first time round I decline to read it again to check just in case it's the right one.

** It should by called our Ebony Darkness instead. Much more melodramatic.
