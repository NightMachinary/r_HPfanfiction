So I'm sure at least one other person has experienced this. I am a very picky reader. I will try new stuff but only once. I have gotten to the point where I can no longer find fics that fit my requirements. This isn't a plea for fic recommendations. Could you write down something that you have done or might do that could help someone like me? Thanks if you can, because maybe you'll find yourself in my situation (again even).

*** Thanks for your suggestion. I have used AO3, but have used fanfic because of its app. The ao3 app is so unintuitive. I will look into it. Thanks again.

***** I'm pretty sure Fanfiction reader has every story on fanfiction.net. It has all the stories I've ever read. I cant say much about AO3. They are both simplified web browsers that only work for the respective sites. You should try it. I dont regret the switch to the app.

** Start writing yourself, if you haven't already ;) that's the best way to read stuff that exactly fits your requirements and it's great fun

*** Thanks. I've never properly tried it. I got a new laptop though so it will be easier now... I'll give it a go. Thanks for the help.
