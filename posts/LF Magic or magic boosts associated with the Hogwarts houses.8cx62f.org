I've read quite a few fics where old families have family magic that give them a boost or advantage over others. I'm curious if there are any fics where the house you get sorted into at Hogwarts gives a boost based on the house. Gryffindor gets a +5 to courage and reflexes making them the more jock/warrior type. Slytherins get a +5 to charisma and ambition making them better leaders. Ravenclaw gets +5 to knowlege and retention making them suited for research and development. Hufflepuff gets a +5 to all crafting and labor skills making them the skilled working class. In a world like this I would see something like 50% of students sorted into Hufflepuff and the other 50% split between the other three houses.


** It feels like you would enjoy fanfics that are similar to RPGs, where choices influence your 'stats'. One of the fics that fits very well into this request would then be Harry Potter and The Game, in which Harry lives his life like a game, including stats, level-ups, special abilities, etc.

/Note: this fic does not have the specific magic boosts you request, but is very close otherwise./

(Also, I believe the fic is currently being rewritten/transferred, so not all chapters are on ff.net. I think I have an epub file with 40+ chapters somewhere, but other people can probably give you more information or point you in the right direction, if you want the full but 'old' version)

  With his life turned into a Game, Harry now has to raise a Phoenix, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, deal with political manipulations and live through Hogwarts all while trying desperately to not swear too much.

*** Hey, xDarkSadye, just a quick heads-up:\\
*therefor* is actually spelled *therefore*. You can remember it by *ends with -fore*.\\
Have a nice day!
