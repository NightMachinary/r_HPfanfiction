Looking for PreHogwarts Harry centric fics I would prefer them to be long (40k+ for abondand or completed) Unless they are actively updating. But I prefer them to be as long as possible. I want the fics to start before his first hogwarts year starts but it can start as late as the summer before. I would like to see gen fics but have no aversion to slash or het I would love some Worldbuilding and it can be as Au as possible as long as it is interesting. I prefer them having magic though. Link and describe the fic if possible thank you!


** I really enjoyed linkao3(greyspace by noaacat) . Hogwarts doesn't start until 14, so we see a lot more of Harry starting to grow up in privet drive.

Warning, it's not exactly what I'd call cheerful, but it's fantastically written.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
