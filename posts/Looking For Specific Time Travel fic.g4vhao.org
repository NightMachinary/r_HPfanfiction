:END:
Hello,

I am looking for a time travel fic that was a bit different than usual. I do not remember the details but:

1) It featured a time travel of harry in peter pettigrew body.

2) At some point he and Lily did some sort of ritual that made them married? or family?.

Other than the above I do not remember much but would be grateful if anyone knows it.


** I don't know this fic, but you might get more responses if you change your flair to "What's that fic?"

** I think it deleted to be honest as I found out a few of my Harry Potter fanfics are gone such as across the time.
