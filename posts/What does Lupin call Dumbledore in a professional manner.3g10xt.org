Headmaster? Professor? Albus? I know he calls him Dumbledore in conversation with others. Thanks!


** It depends on the situation. In private or with the Order, I'd say Albus. In the school, when in public, probably Headmaster. There's no definitive title anyone to call him.

** "Headmaster" or "Professor Dumbledore", like every other teacher.

**** That one has to do with the fact that they'd spent a lot of time as colleagues and pretty much are close friends. In Britain, in oldie times, it was very rare to see people not close to each other call the other by their given names. This is the very same reason why Draco calls his goons “Crabbe” and “Goyle”; not because they are that unimportant (though they are, true), but rather because it's the proper way of addressing them as they are not his friends.

You can see the same phenomenon in the Sherlock Holmes series, as Holmes and Watson call each other with their surnames despite being fairly close.

** Depends. I imagine him calling him 'Albus' in a one-on-one conversation, whether he's a professor or not is irrelevant imo. I think it's the same when it comes to the Order (for example in meetings).

Talking about Dumbledore with students (including Harry), he calls him 'Professor Dumbledore' I'd imagine.
