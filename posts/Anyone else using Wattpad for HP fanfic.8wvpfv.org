** No. Wattpad is generally a place for really cliche originals or really bad fanfic

*** That's not been my experience at all.

Edit: Actually, I've mostly kept to competition winners and books with high read and vote counts. It is kind of hard to weed through the garbage. True.

**** That's why I said generally. There's a few gems in there but most of it is pretty garbage. I once read a story with a few hundred thousand reads with trash grammar and spelling and a non-existent plot

** I uploaded the stories I wrote as a teen there. Only right place for them.

*** I wonder how long ago that was, because Wattpad seems to be less for teens these days. Maybe that's just me idk

** The reason I enjoy it personally is the usability. Comments, votes, followers. It's a good platform for developing your story and getting advice. Is there a reason I should be elsewhere? Honestly curious.

*** Probably. Both ff.net and Ao3 have all those features. Both have A much larger user base the wattpad, (therefore a large audience, and more potential feedback) and if Im honest, both have a more powerful search and filter engines, alowing users to find content they want.

The main downside, afaik, uploading stories to ft.net can be fiddley with some of the formatting, and Ao3 has issues with its tagging system.

I will give wattpad the edge in UI, if only because the off-orange, black and white colour scheme looks a lot cleaner then ft.net, but it's close, and really comes down to user preference.

Tldr: may as well cross-post to ff.net and Ao3, if only to reach a wider audiance, and gain greater, more nuanced feedback. Nothing is stopping you from using all three!

**** Seems like you know a lot about this.

Last I checked, Wattpad had 65 million active monthly users, but that's for all genres... Hmm. ff.net is obviously dedicated primarily to fanfic. Makes sense to go where the readers are. I've been feeling lately like Wattpad is not where the Potterheads are, so it's adding up now.

I think the only thing stopping me from posting to all three sites is laziness at this point. ha
