:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay, I'm looking for a fic I read awhile ago. It's a Harry/Hermione soulmate fic where Harry goes back in time after meeting Death/Grim Reaper to fulfill his destiny. The twist in the end is that even though Harry gets together with Hermione and defeats Voldemort, the real person who's destiny was being orchestrated was Harry's daughter. She becomes the person who ultimately changes the wizarding world (you find that out in the last couple of chapters/epilogue). I'm 99.99% sure the fic is complete.

Any help is appreciated!! Thanks in advance!


** At first, I thought I knew what fic you were referring to, but the bit about his daughter threw me and now I need to read this fic!!

** I don't know what fic you are talking about. But the start sounds like Reptilia28's Don't fear the reaper challenge, so try searching for that to narrow down your search
