:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a (half-remembered) fic

Harry goes to Hogwarts. Then he vanishes (pre-Tri-Wizard, I think).

Some years later, Death Eaters leave Snape for dead. He is found by someone and given shelter

Snape realises 'this person knows who and what I am. This person is a wizard. This person went to Hogwarts. I have no idea who they are' He eventually figures it out.

Dumbledore's been spreading the tale that Harry's been getting 'special training', and that's the reason he hasn't been seen for years

Snape figures out it's all horseshit, as this person works in a supermarket

Harry infiltrates magical Britain as Snape's apprentice

There is Snarry, which is less than brilliant

Anyone have any ideas what I'm half-remembering?


** It sounds a lot like Pretty Boy from DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan if I remember correctly! I have'nt read it in some time so I'm not sure about the apprentice part but everything else seems to fit :3 ttps://[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3628903/0][www.fanfiction.net/s/3628903/0]]
