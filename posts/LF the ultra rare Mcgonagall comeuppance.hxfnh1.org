As title says, im looking for fics where Mcgonagall doesn't listen to Harry, and/or doesnt treat him right/lets down gryffindor and it has consequenses.

Such as -students reporting bad behaviour to board of governors/prophet instead of her, as she doesnt listen to the children.

-gets flack for sending students at night into forbidden forest

Or other circumstances where she realises she has let down her lions, and has lost their respect.


** There is a couple where she falls with Team Dumbledore (I think it is "Betting on Her" that has McGonagall kill herself in a ministry cell after OP Harry fixes everything?

Honestly, I have yet to read one of those I consider good.

My favorite McGonagall cumuppance is in Grains of Sand in the Hourglass. Tonks forces Harry to bring the blood quill to her, demanding she take care of Umbridge. This causes her to ask why Harry wasn't going to bring this too her and he unloads on her. She is still good and trying, but the call-out was healthy for all involved

*** Yeah that over the top bashing and suicide wasnt fun to read. I prefer a wake-up call type of thing tbh. The sand in the hourglass rec sounds just like what I'm looking for :)

Chapter three. Chapter two is the buildup and chapter one is setting the stage for the fic, so it is really the first bit of drama that happens

****** I liked it because I thought it was realistic for a student call-out of a teacher, given the power difference.

Only other ones that come to mind (again beyond the power wank fics) is maybe in Escape, where Hermione's parents take Snape/McGonagall to task that major medical events warranted nothing more than an owl so what kind of disaster required a professor visit.

But Snape and McGonagall are hero's in that, so it was really at best lampshading. The blame is kind of shifted to Dumbledore, McGonagall is just the receiver of the rant.

(Compared to the self-loathing and helplessness displayed in Grains of Sand. That was a lot more nuanced)

*** I liked one where Harry simply picked the Quill and ran full speed to McGonagall's classroom with it.

McGonagall saw it, got royally pissed off, was a hair's breath away from seriously hurting Umbridge but just disarmed her and dragged her to Dumbledore, who got even more pissed off, called Fudge and threatened to throw the book at him while threatening to write the parents.

I don't remember how it ended but I think Fudge was forced to either remove Umbridge or to disavow her and remove his office's support.

  “I have to admit that I am surprised you have come to me about this, Potter,” Professor McGonagall said somewhat stiffly as she peered at him from behind her desk.

  “I would say that if a Head of House doesn't expect one of their students to come to them when they have a problem, that Head of House is failing in his or her duties,” Harry replied, his eyes narrowed. “But, given your actions last year, that's not much of a shock, is it?”
