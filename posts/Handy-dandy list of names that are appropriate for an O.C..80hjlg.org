*** And from above, Laura = laurel, Camilla can be changed to Camellia, and Marguerite in French is daisy. Silvia also means wood, Chloe means green shoot, Rhoda means rose and Yolanda means violet. Rosalind would be the best if you want to pair Harry with a Black. (If you can't tell, I put a lot of thought into naming my O.C.s XD)

Also it doesn't have to be an exact flower name. One of the meanings of Ginevra is juniper, Susan means lily, Padma means lotus, and Daphne means laurel (which is why I use the latter three for my non-canon pairings).

*** I would say that depends in a couple places. The Black family clearly had a thing for stars and the Evans liked flowers. Following the theme would just give a bit of consistency. It's not required at all, bit it helps an original character fit a bit easier.

*** Not really? If they have a main part in the story their name should 1) have a deeper meaning or 2) be realistic to one Rowling would choose. For example, I have a character named Ariel, which means 'lion of God'. Naturally, she's in Gryffindor (and has red hair because I couldn't resist it).

**** One needn't necessarily have an especial "deeper" meaning to a name. Rowling was ridiculous in her naming tendencies at times, and it hardly matters how /she/ would name an original character when it's an /original character./

It depends on various things: your writing style, how much value you want placed on names within the narrative, et cetera. It's perfectly valid to choose a name simply because you like the sound of it, or because it calls back to a particular period or character trait more than it has a "deeper meaning".

Calling a character "Marilyn", for example, can give the reader an immediate impression of the character - false or true - without necessarily pointing to an author-led Blue's Clues episode.

***** Anything that's meant to give an impression thereby has a deeper meaning as well (connotation vs. denotation). I wasn't making fun of her for choosing pretty names or anything; I was just saying that Rowling used both of those methods and it can be Mary/Gary-sue-ish if you don't follow them.

******* Any character with a name that stands out from the canon names. In this case, it could mean by creating a character /without/ a Mary-sue-ish name. Yes, some of Rowling's names were over the top in giving it a deeper meaning, but then there's Minerva, who most people don't think of being the Roman form of Athena, and she displays wisdom.
