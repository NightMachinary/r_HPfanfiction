I'm aware that the room appears and changes according to one's need but there's no way that there has never been at least one person accidentally finding it.

Say... a muggleborn student in the 70s passing through the seventh floor corridor thinking about disco music and suddenly BAM the room appears to them as a full fledged disco, with a dancing floor, disco ball, psychedelic light shows and whatnot.


** It was discovered before Harry's fifth year - by Tom Riddle.

We have no way of knowing how many other students happened upon a safe place to hide a random object, but based on just how many random objects there were in that room, it was probably a lot.

Fred and George also once hid in it. It was a broom closet at the time.

It's probably been stumbled upon loads of times that we don't know about, by people who didn't recognise it. I'm willing to bet that in the history of Hogwarts, at least once it's been a place to snog.

*** Yeah, Hogwarts has been around for around for 1000 years or so, we only get to see Harry school year, and not many others, not to mention if any other student did find it in those 1000 years and knew exactly how it works why would they tell anyone else about it.

*** Someone might have even figured out how it works at some point and just didn't tell anyone, or only told one person who kept it to themselves.

I mean, why would you go and tell everyone you found a room that could be whatever you want?

"Oh fantastic, I believe we should split time spent in the room up among everyone, thank you very much for not keeping it to yourself despite having no responsibility to tell anyone. Here's your schmuck of the year award."

** You could interpret it as something that only appears when the room itself decides the person has a genuine need (opposed to desire) for it. Obviously it isn't morally discriminating since Malfoy uses it in HBP but it might not appear when the person is just curious or wants entertainment, etc.

  ‘Because it is a room that a person can only enter,' said Dobby seriously, ‘when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs.

** Judging by how many things were hidden in there it must have been discovered plenty of times but people just didn't give it more thought than needed because probably no one wanted to use it as a headquarters for a secret school organization before. At least Dobby used it on a regular basis to hide drunk Winky there.

** That depends what you mean by "discovered". It was used by plenty but few knew what it was.

The room of hidden things is proof of hundreds (if not thousands) of students and staff using the room. It is literally a room full of everything someone hid inside the room of requirement.

We also know that Trelawney used the room to hide her wine. We know Dumbledore once found it as Bathroom that was only there once (that he atleast claims to have never found again). So we know tons of people found the room (although they may never have known what it was). We also know Filch used it to store the broken vanishing cabinet (after Fred and George shoved a Sytherin prefect in it so he couldn't take off points). And I believe according to pottermore the mirror of Erised was stored there for generations by an old headmaster before Dumbledore finds it and uses it.

We know Tom found the room and knew what it was. The book also makes comment on his overwhelming arrogance in assuming that he was the first to find the room and that none after would (thus making it the perfect hiding place).

** I think they discovered it but the discovery was always unprecedented so no one remembered how they discovered it. I mean, who will remember that they have to walk by it 3 times thinking they really need something. At least not without being told. Just like weasley twins, others could not find it afterwards and hence the room remained a secret

** I mean ... it likely has? It /definitely/ has if you count the storage version where Tom Riddle and many others left their stuff. And Dumbledore found it when he needed a bathroom.

The question is whether anyone recognised the capabilities the room has. I think Harry might be the first in a long while to figure that out, but I don't think this is unlikely either. What are the odds of passing there twice and finding a different room each time?

** Magicals aren't really a curious or introspective people. Especially if they have to go out of their way to be so - isn't there basically nothing up on the seventh floor, so anyone having to go up there would be actively exploring or trying to be out of the way?

** It's definitely been found before, just that it seems like most situations is where there's an 'emergency' of sorts (eg, Dumbledore finding a toilet, or Fred/George finding a convenient broom closet, etc). Actually finding the secret of the room is a different story, though.

A disco situation seems highly unlikely to happen without the knowledge of the room being there - you need to pass in front of it a few times thinking intently about it, and that isn't really what you'd do. Instead, the one offs are obviously very different.

There might have been groups that figured it out for particular uses over time (eg, someone figuring out that room X is there), but without being told I imagine they'd just stick to the one version of the room. And then, like the Marauders, knowledge of it would fade with time (ie, like how the various secret passages might be discovered/forgotten).
