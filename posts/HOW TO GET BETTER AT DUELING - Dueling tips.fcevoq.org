I want to write a new fanfic where there's a complex magic AND dueling system and i was wondering if i was a wizard, what should i do to get better at dueling? what are things that give me an advantage? these few things below are things that i thought about

●Knowledge of curses, jinxes, hexes

●Having a healthy body because you have to dodge spells obviously.

●Using environement

●Transfiguring/conjuring objects to act like shields

●Wandless casting

●Silent casting

●Accuracy


** Controlling the environment is, in my not so humble opinion, the number one advantage a wizard can have in a fight.

Dumbledore completely encases Voldemort in a sphere of water. A lesser wizard is just done at that point. Anyone that's ever been hit by a wave knows just how helpess you really are against a large amount of water.

He does this while simultaneously guarding Harry with animated statues.

Control the environment and you control the fight.

** Classy, yet distracting banter like "Oh my merlin, what's that coming from over there?!" so you can point over the magical's shoulder and they'll turn around to look and you can curse them in the back.

** Experience, ruthlessness, an appreciation for cover, distraction, and the creation thereof, along with a really good disillusionment charm. There's enough deadly spells out there that realistically whoever hits first wins, so the best strategy is to be damn sure you hit first.

** Maybe also being aware of what the oppenent is casting next

cushioning a fall if one is blasted through the room

And basic fast healing spells

** Dueling or fighting? If you're fighting then you need to be aware of your surroundings more so than in dueling, in a fight some other dude could just send a spell at your back

In dueling you could need the ability to sense magic, if you're blinded for example you can sense and dodge a spell that's incoming without seeing it

You could learn to cast invisible spells (if that's possible in your magic system ofc)

Point casting aka not needing to move your wand, point casting and silent casting together are deadly, if you can get invisible spells into that mix it's almost impossible to not hit unless you can't aim or the enemy can sense magic.

I did this by thinking of the wand movements and the incantation in my mind, to make the spells invisible I just will it to be invisible. Harry for example has it easy as he knows what invisible looks like (invis cloak)

God this is weird talking like I'm doing it

That's what I could come up with quickly
