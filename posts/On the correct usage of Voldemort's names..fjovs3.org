Voldemort has a fair few names and titles. In many fics, I see those names being used interchangably, which is very much not the case. I'd like to shed some light on how his names are used, and by whom.

- The first is of course his birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle. He... doesn't like it. He never says it himself, and he responds with hatred toward everyone who does. This name is only used by those set on defying him, or angering him. This name is also unknown to a vast majority of people. If you write a fic, have this name be used only by those capable of defying him without instantly being ground into the dust. For instance, Dumbledore uses it in Canon, and he can hold off Voldemort effortlessly.

- The second is his chosen name, Lord Voldemort. This name he has a complicated relationship with. He uses it himself, almost as a title, and not a name attached to a title. It is designed to mock the antiquated titles of the wizarding world, whose debasement may have once been his goal. Alongside the extermination of impure blood, of course. However, it is feared, and for good reason. We don't know if there was a Taboo on it in the first war, but there is in the second. To use it meant a quick death. Use this name to let people speak in whispers, and inspire fear whereever they are.

- The third is a slight change from the second, dropping the Lord, making it just Voldemort. The dropping of the honorific has a slight, but important effect: It turns fear of the name, the exhaltation of the name, into something more mundane. It slightly dehumanizes the man, but the fear sits deep. Use this name for people afraid, but ignorant of the honorific significance.

- The fourth is his honorary title among his supporters - The Dark Lord. It is mostly used by Death Eaters to reference him, and also holds the honorific. Use this name to foreshadow a death eater in disguise.

- The fifth is the first of his people-given titles: You-Know-Who. Born in the height of the first war, this name is used to refer to he who everybody knows, but whose name everybody is afraid of. Over the peace, it became somewhat of an official designation. Use this name for causal conversation on the topic of Voldemort.

- The sixth and final name is the second of his given titles: He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. This name carries with it a severity that isn't present in the other given title, and conveys experience with his methods. It also conveys seriousness and conviction, but not enough to use his actual names or titles. I personally use this name for people like Moody or Snape, when he comes up in relatively casual conversation.

It is my personal opinion that "Moldyshorts", "Voldiepoo", etc are incredibly clashing with the character. It fits for some characters, like Fred and George, who make everything a joke, but most people are legit afraid of the name. To say it meant certain death in the first war.

** I'm pretty sure Snape always referred Voldemort as the Dark Lord. McGonagall would be more fitting to say He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. House-elves exclusively call him that unless you want to foreshadow that they belong to Death Eaters and they could have gotten this from their masters. Kreature would say ‘the Dark Lord', for example, but Windy and the Hogwarts elves would say ‘He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named'.

On another note, the ‘Chosen One' title only appeared after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries for Harry Potter.

*** I second this - If I remember Snape always uses "the dark Lord" to refer to Voldemort - and everything else you stated. Though OP is right. It really disturbs the mood of the fic if the wrong name is being used and it's quite a pet peeve of mine if I read the name "Voldyshorts" anywhere. It would be acceptable in a crackfic or if the twins said it but otherwise it can really be the thing that has me putting my phone down and switching to another fic

*** pretty sure McGonagall is around the same age as Riddle, so she might call him by his real name. she's not exactly easily intimidated. not too mention spends most of her time in the castle, not far from Dumbledore, so the danger to her is kind of minimal. at least until the takeover, anyway.

**** In the first chapter, McGonagall flinches at the name. Dumbledore then tells her there is nothing to fear by using the name, so she starts saying it for that chapter at least.

I can't remember what she called him during Harry's time though. It could have been on-and-off Voldemort/You-Know-Who (which Bill does within one paragraph in Deathly Hallows. He switches between the two names, so I can see this being something Mcgonagall would do.)

**** Depends on what exactly you take as canon. Until recently, and to me personally that still is the case, McGonagall was the same age as him. At most a couple of years older or younger, but the two were definitely in school at the same time. (I always love headcanoning that she had a crush on him in school).

After the launch of Crimes of Grindelwald, we were told that not only McG is significantly older, but she was also his teacher.

** Great stuff, thanks for writing this out!

One thing stuck out about Lord Voldemort though, that the 'Lord' "is designed to mock the antiquated titles of the wizarding world". Voldemort is the only wizard calling himself by a muggle title in canon, there are no other wizarding lords (fanon is different of course and can do whatever it wants). You might headcanon that his choice of a muggle title made him scarier or at least more mysterious, as wizards likely didn't know exactly what that title meant.

*** There is a slight mention of it in Chamber of Secrets. When the Malfoys go to Borgin and Burkes, Mr. Borgin calls Lucius 'Mister Malfoy' and Draco 'young Master Malfoy'. So while not a lord title, the fact that Master was used to refer to a child does indicate that old titles are used, at least within pure-blood society

**** Maybe, but I don't think those are aristocracy titles like lord and lady? Young master certainly sounds old-fashioned, something a really old person might say who is not used to talking to children, or it could be used humorously. Mr and Mrs are completely normal in Britain, and Sir and Madam are formal but still in use as far as I know.

**** Very well spotted. I don't know much about british terminology for nobility, is Master an actual title? I have always felt like the pure blood families that put a lot of importance on that matter, kinda live a few hundred years in the past. The whole wizarding world seems to be very old fashioned and pure blood families even more so, so maybe the use of Master is just a really old fashioned custom.

There are not actually very many ranks in the British peerage: viscount, baron, earl (countess for women), marquis and duke (referred to as your grace). There are also honorifics like 'right honourable' and courtesy titles, for instance in the case of the younger sons of a duke they'll be called 'Lord' as in 'Lord Peter Wimsey'.

*** I always got the impression that the title ‘lord' was only used by Voldemort, and even then only because he grew up understanding the title in a muggle context. He grew up poor and wanted to take on title associated with wealth and power that was unique in the Wizarding world

I kind of think that pure bloods might even Dislike the concept of nobility because of the muggle connotations. After the muggle/magical worlds split they might have distanced themselves as much as possible from the muggle world, especially in regards to setting up a new government

Also, it would just be ironic if Voldemort was the only ‘lord' because pureblood families traditionally disliked the idea of a formal nobility

*** I thought there was reference to "wizengamot lords" somewhere in OotP, somewhere near the passage where Sirius mocks the "ancient and noble" (how I fucking hate the tropes that spawned, at least invent some originals, like "honorable and righteous" or "Most radiant" just not constant ancient and noble) house of Black?

Must have been mistaken, then.

**** You got me curious so I had a quick look through Goblet and OotP, but I couldn't find anything about lords or ladies in the courtroom scenes there, there's talk of the wizengamot or the court, madam and sir, head of x department, undersecretary, a jury and of course elsewhere there are fabulous titles like Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock. But unless I've missed one somewhere I think the point with Voldemort being (the dark) lord is that he is the only one in wizarding society with that title.

Going outside of book canon, I believe the extra information on Pottermore that JKR wrote about the Malfoys state that the family originally mingled with muggle royals and nobility, even becoming landed gentry in the muggle world although they were of course wizards at the same time. This was before it became popular to be racist against muggles. So ironically the Malfoys can legally style themselves with muggle titles if they want, but they wouldn't want to in canon because it is no longer cool to be in with muggles even if they are wealthy or royal.

I'm with you on the ancient and noble thing, I can rarely read those stories myself. At the same time I think it's really fascinating how extensive that trope is!

***** It's pretty prevasive, I agree. Along the whole "Potter vaults" or "Potter fortune" and "Potter manor" thing. The entire wizarding artistrocracy was bolstered in fanfiction to a point where it isn't even funny anymore.

Like, Malfoy Manor was crazy in canon. Like, it just screamed "We're better than you", everyone else lived in a normal house. It's so opulent that Voldemort himself lived there. (or is that another trope?) The whole "and then he discovered his seven houses" is crazy talk. Like, even if these houses existed at some point, they're now only ruins.

And don't get me started on the money. The Potter family may be old, but they're certainly no "pure"bloods or in any way rich. All their money is in the vault Harry sees, because the goblins, surprise surprise, don't give a shite about how wizards spend their money. Like, the whole "don't let harry have his key" was to stop the excesses he tends to, like solid gold cauldrons.

****** Completely agree :) Good point about the Malfoy Manor, the impression I at least got from canon is that it's by far the most impressive and largest wizarding private home of them all. The ancestral home of the Blacks, who are at least implied to have money, was a large townhouse in north London, which today would be valuable because of its loacation but certainly wasn't described as as luxorious on the inside as the Malfoys place.

JKR wrote a similar essay to the Malfoy one on the Potter family, and there she says that it was Harry's grandfather who made a smaller fortune by inventing potions like Sleakeazys hair potion. So quite recent wealth, upper middle class and no old family mansions, although they did have the family invisibility cloak which one might argue is more useful than a mansion anyway :)

Having said that, lots of people seem to like reading about noble upper class families, so to each their own.

There's actually a one-shot series where this name comes up. It more or less reinforces the probability that there was a taboo the first time around, which is why almost no one uses Voldemort's name.
