Simple enough request.

I want to see a WBWL, or at least wrong Chosen One, where Harry has already killed Voldemort before James, Lily, and any of Harry's siblings return.

They all abandon Harry when he was a baby on the word of Dumbledore going into hiding having themselves declared dead. Then maybe during the actual battle with Voldemort... they reappear because they hadn't heard from Dumbledore in a while and wanted to make sure everything was okay only for them, and everyone else, to see Harry destroy Voldemort.

Doesn't necessarily have to follow canon... could be at any time really just as long as Harry has already defeated Voldemort before they decide to return.

Not quite what you're looking for but it has several of the same elements.

During the cleanup of The Battle of Hogwarts a family of Potters from an altU shows up. They act very much like the usual WBWL Potters and treat Harry like crap.

*** I love that fic, but im a few chapters in and find it so annoying how much leeway the Potters were given. Especially at Gringotts. I read other fics where the dimension traveler has absolutely zero rights in the new universe, and always thought it made more sense. Then in here, Potters not only are given equal rights, but have the nerve to try to supplant the real Potter family and heritage. Does this keep going like that, or does the story changes course?

**** The Potters are all nerve and frankly it gets a bit cartoonish later on.

The Gringotts thing was the only time the Potters we're any kind of a threat. Harry is Harry freakin' Potter, slayer of Volemort, and everyone in the prime universe knows it.

**** It's been a while since I read it but didn't Harry pretty much LET them do it? He knew it would be a pain to fight it and set it up so they got what they wanted just not remotely in the way that they wanted.

***** The goblins warn him and he manages to relocate his money to a personal vault and thus avoids being left penniless. But now bit more in, the Potters try to set up a hearing to regain their house in Godric's Hollow. Its funny, I've read all out bashing fics in which the bashed character doesnt annoy me as much as these guys.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

Mostly what you asked for.

They show up a bit later, dursleys are reformed and dumbledore sort of had a too late realisation of what he did.

  Lily and James Potter come out of hiding so their son Alexander could fulfill the prophesy and defeat Voldemort. Things don't go as planned though, as they returned to the Wizarding World in 1999.
