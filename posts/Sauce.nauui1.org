I read this fanfic a while ago where Harry gets a gift from Hermione that lets him manipulate people to some extent. He later on becomes a slave master and lends ginny to blaise and draco for... you know. And later on in the story Harry asks Blaise to pretend to be him or something.... idk what happens next. If anyone knows what I'm talking about, please tell me. Thanks i. Advance

*** I think I remember what fic OP is talking about, and yes, yes he is. It's not worth finding and certainly wouldn't be allowed (for good reason) to link under this subs rules.

** The gift is a wrist holster for a wand. I'm 90% sure. Maybe that will help your search
