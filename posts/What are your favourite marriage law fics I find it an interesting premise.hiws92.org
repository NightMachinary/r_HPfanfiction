#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  This is my response to the Marriage Law challenge after hearing about it and reading some stories... and thinking about what MY reaction would have been if I was Harry. Oneshot, complete with epilogue.

** If you don't mind a self-recommendation, here the marriage law was intended to get diehard blood purists to self-deport rather than debase their bloodlines. It didn't completely work.

I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not a self-insert.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

** I find it totally stupid premise (I can imagine five better more realistic methods how to bind a boy and a girl against their will), so the only marriage law fix I like is the anti-story of linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities).

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

**** 1. I would accept even betrothal agreement ... it is weird and archaic, but I can imagine wizarding world being behind times more likely than the idiotic marriage law.

2. Alternative, less violent, is the last will and testament of James & Lily Potter (or another appropriate parents) asking nicely to marry somebody. That wouldn't get Hermione and Draco, but nothing should in my opinion.

3. [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129977][In the Heat of the Night by Brennus]]

4. Soul-bond ... yes, most soul-bond stories are made to get children banging one another and they are disgusting, but I can imagine something like linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond by Council) or even better linkffn(Error of Soul by Materia-Blade): boy and girl are bounded without pre-existing love, and they found themselves stuck in the situation, which is nicely reminiscent (nicely for the author, not for them) to the ol' fashioned arranged marraige. I would love somebody from India or from some other countries were arranged marriages are still the thing to finish “Error of Soul”, but I don't think anybody from the West could do it well.

5. I always thought that in the logic of (at least Central European) fairy-tales HP & Chamber of Secrets is exactly the classical fairy tale of the knight in the shining armour saving young maiden from dragon. According to the logic of said fairy-tales Harry should get Ginny as wife and half-of the kingdom of the King Arthur on the top. Not sure, how to arrange it properly, but that logic seems to me inevitable (and apparently it forced even JKR to the Hinny logic). Ano no, Grimms fairy tales/HP crossover (or transporting HP to the Middle Ages) is not the answer.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

  After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return.
