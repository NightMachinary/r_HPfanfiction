Fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] by DobbyElfLord. Preferably completed fics (any length). Also time travel or dimension travel related fics are welcome too (featuring a badass harry).


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806][Princeps by Lomonaaeren]] and it's sequels features a badass unspeakable Harry and it's amazing.

** I remeber one called Harry potter and the summer of change where Tonks is a unspeakable and she drafts harry into the unspeakables but it was a while since iv read it but it was completed.

Oh it's a Tonks/Harry pairing
