:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember a large portion of the story but the thing that has always stuck was the time where Harry investigates the meals each houses are given, finding that Slytherin has near inedible food while Gryffindor has the best food available. Ravenclaw has mediocre food and Hufflepuff has just above the quality of Slytherin. Thanks for any help.


** I've read this too .. isn't there like a lot of fish and such at Slytherin a lot of veggies or something at Ravenclaw but Gryffindor has More hearty food?

** Is this the one where Hogwarts house elves are freed and they serve worse food based on your behaviour? And it was with Harry's help that the house elves were freed, I think. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the fic. I'll let you know if I find it.

** I asked the Harmony & co Facebook and so far they came up with this story And while it has mention of food it's that the purebloods get better food than lower class people [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3150414/1/Parallels]]
