I'm sure I've seen stories like this before but I can't find them now. Any help is appreciated, doesn't necessarily have to be both couples.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] likes writing H/G fics in which other family members were against:

"Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect", linkffn(9065880): The Weasleys turned around and redeemed themselves in the end.

"Hail Odysseus", linkffn(10645463): This fic is Weasley bashing extraordinaire. [[/spoiler][They betrayed Ginny to the Ministry and it had her almost kissed by dementors. Harry was so pissed that he made a deal with Voldemort and left magical Britain at Voldemort's mercy.]]

"In the Heat of Night", linkffn(11367427): Another thorough takedown of other Weasleys.

--------------

Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing is also very common among H/G fics. Molly and Ron were usually against Harry and Ginny getting together. For example:

"My Slytherin Harry", linkffn(6160345)

"The Accidental Bond", linkffn(5604382)

--------------

In "Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always", linkffn(4101650), another time traveler's meddling caused severe misunderstanding between the elder Weasleys and Harry. It didn't help when Harry and Ginny (both time travelers) couldn't control themselves and got caught in their acts (when they were still 13 and 12 physically). The Weasleys took several years to figure out the truth and come around.

--------------

In [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], the Weasleys were the Wellesleys, and Ron's grandpa was the Duke of Wellington. They were not poor and disadvantaged, but merely at odds with majority of the (corrupt) Ministry. As a result, the old guard was adamantly against Ron marrying Hermione, although Arthur and Molly were ok. [[/spoiler][Ron's grandma bluntly told Hermione during Christmas of Year 6 that Ron had to marry a proper princess (pureblood), and a mudge (mudblood) like her had no place around Ron.]]
