I've read plenty of Marauders Era fanfiction, but I've never found a fanfic about Blaise Zabini's mother when she was at Hogwarts. Does anyone know of any good fanfics like that? I'd prefer a multi-chapter fanfic, but beggars can't be choosers so please rec even if it's just a one-shot.


** Honestly I'd welcome any Blaise Zabini-centric fanfics too. I think his character has so much potential and it's a crime that he didn't get more page/screen time.

*** I agree, so much could've been done for him. He and his mother had so much potential

** I might be wrong but I think Blaise is Italian, so most fanfic authors probably assume that she didn't go to Hogwarts and they don't write her in. I'll look around though :)

*** Well since last names usually come from the dad, I always assumed that Blaise's father was Italian and his mom could've been from anywhere. But yeah, it makes sense that most fanfic writers probably just assume that she's Italian and didn't go to Hogwarts.
