** I like both pairings and both are among the less used unless harem fic category but id have to say go Padma since she is used far less often. Plus theres opportunity for fun scenes with parvati like a sister test or parv is high protective of her sister stuff like that

*** I concur padma is far under used plus like Aniki said could always do the twin test on Harry though depending on the year it is being written in could give him an unfair advantage of having to be able to tell the Weasley twins apart. Oh and could we get a link for the story then?

**** Ive always thought harry could tell the twins apart. Thats why they dont prank him. But it could be an interesting surprise that he reveals to parvati when shes surprised he knew it wasnt padma. Theres alot of fun to be had with it. Like maybe snape gives padma an underserved detention so that she cant meet up with harry and parvati takes her place or something

** Padma.

To many Susan fics are 'boobs!'

*** I kind of love that about them, though. I mean, it's pretty true to life for a teenage boy.

** I'd need to know Harry's personality and differences from canon for a really good choice. However, I'd lean towards Padma simply because she's a more rare choice.

** A synopsis of the story and personalities of the two characters would go a long ways towards forming an opinion.

*** Noah Potter was declared to the be BWL by his parents after he allegedly defeated Voldemort as a 1 year old. In reality, Harry Potter is the BWL but was ignored by his parents due to not being as special as Noah in their eyes. Realizing how badly Harry is being treated (and knowing the truth), Albus Dumbledore resigns from Hogwarts and takes Harry away to prepare him for his destiny.

** Of course it all depends on the context and the character development you've done for each girl, but if it were a blank slate, I usually would rather read Susan over Padma. That being said, I've really really enjoyed several H/Padma fics, and am always excited for more.

In other words, whichever you pick, I'll likely read your story and enjoy it :D

** Padma Padma Padma.

I think she is totally underused and I would love to see other female characters get utilized. I think they could compliment each other well and I think it can work well that they aren't in the same house.
