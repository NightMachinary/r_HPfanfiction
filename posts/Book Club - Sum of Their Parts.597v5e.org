** Although I didn't like the epilogue either, I honest to God loved this story because of the soul magic brand between Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Mainly because this story didn't force a romance between the characters, but tried to explain the bond between the three of them - sums of each other's parts haha - and that their experiences and past tied them too tightly to be apart... even if Ron and Hermione had different ideologies to Harry and George.

I liked how it showed the descent into Dark Lorddom because there is a lack of that in HP fanfiction. Yes, Harry"s apathy for change is problematic but I also understand how the author explained away Kingsley's status quo red tape and how that was just as damaging. So maybe it was more of a way to explain the lack of change in current policies?

I didn't like Bill's attitude at all given Fleur is a half-human character like Flitwick or Gwamp and he didn't see anything wrong with her potentially becoming a second class citizen. BUT I disagree with what another poster said about Hagrid. He may have loose lips and think Dumbledore is a great man, but he understands prejudice too and knows what humanity is capable of.

*** The soul brand, gah. I forgot about it. It reinforced the notion of a Dark Lord being a formally recognized position. A Dark Lord has the title, followers and he brands them.

And the whole thing with the oath - I guess Harry ruling in the end was meant to suggest that Hermione has descended into darkness with Harry, given that the oath didn't stop him for doing things Hermione would have considered bad? Or something.

This fic just fails on so many more levels than it doesn't.

**** I'm not sure why you're focusing on just Hermione here. Ron was part of this as well. I enjoyed this not because it's /oooo look at us, we're evil Dark Lords now!!/ but because it deepened the connection between the three as friends. Like I wrote below, how many well written FFs are out there that focus on their friendship and not add a romance?

Harry certainly didn't "rule" either - I'm not sure where you're getting this wrong or if you read the story wrong. The oath was to protect them and making a majority vote - "if you don't like something I'm doing, because you think it's amoral, let me know". It's a failsafe.

Maybe the story isn't the best thing out there, but it's one of the damn best things out there *in a while*. :/

** I liked the slight melancholy in the story - the confrontations and battles seem almost inevitable, looming on the horizon as the trio slowly progresses on their chosen path. "Dark Lord" being a title, or rather, a name for a certain category of dark wizards, is a good idea in my book - something like that seems very logical, given the examples of Grindelwald and Voldemort. There are dark wizards, and there are dark wizards who have an army of followers and are challenging entire nations. The latter do deserve a name of their own.

I also do not think Hagrid would mind Harry's course of action. As was pointed out, he knows all about prejudice. And the Order wasn't that pacifist either, as Remus showed berating Harry for not killing people in battle.

I also do not think adult wizards putting much stock on the house someone was in is weird - kids are chosen by a magical artifact reading their minds. It's only natural for wizards to consider that significant, and then see the traits of a wizard that reinforce a clichee rather than the traits that contradict them.

** This isn't the best fic out there, but I don't really know of any actually good ones that have Harry go down the evil/Dark route.

The real problems I have with this fic are:

1. The magical theory on dark magic stuff is kinda boring.

2. Everything talking about Black Madness as a whole. Yes, Bellatrix was certifiable after Azkaban (and was probably unhinged beforehand from that Pensieve memory), and Sirius was a little unhinged in PoA (due to recently being in Azkaban) and in OoTP due to being trapped in a house (kinda like a prison cell, but a bit nicer) that embodies all his bad memories.

3. The whole "Gryffindorish Dark Lord" thing is kinda... eh at best?

4. The Occlumency is... not good in my opinion.

5. Dark Lord being an actual title instead of some self-absorbed bullshit that Voldemort and the Death Eaters came up with.

6. The writing is fairly stilted, and dialogue doesn't flow the best, though that might just be the author's chosen style.

7. Hagrid's simple acceptance of Harry's route to dark wizardism I didn't find plausible at all. Hagrid is a very moral/moralistic person, and I don't believe he would accept Harry's methods no matter how laudable the goal.

The Things I rather Enjoyed:

I. I liked how this wasn't actually about a Dark Lord Harry, but about how Harry became/decided to become a 'Dark Lord' (which for me wasn't until the end, when he decided to [[/spoiler][take up people's offers of support]]. I find this to be something rather overlooked. Usually it's just a rushed thing, but this goes into the transition of "the system isn't working" to fully-fledged dark wizard through via vigilante.

II. It showed how good people can stand on different sides of an issue. Harry, Ron and Hermione vs Kingsley and McGonagall for instance.

III. People post war who have changed in serious ways. The big ones being Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George, with Ginny and Luna in the background of it.

IV. Harry choosing to focus his magic on curses and dark magic, something in canon that he is very skilled with (considering his skill at Defense against the Dark Arts). I also enjoy the depiction of Fiendfyre as his spell of choice, even though it isn't always practical.

V. Walburga Black's portrait being a horcrux was a fun idea.

VI. The depiction of the beginning of a conspiracy is something I rather enjoyed, since I enjoy conspiracy theories, spy v spy, cloak and dagger themes.

Things I wished this fic did instead of what it did do:

- I wish that instead of having that time skip in the last chapter, it had ended.

- I wish people didn't figure out what Harry was planning on doing. Far too many (Bill, the Ministry, his first set of followers, etc.) realized he was trying to turn himself into a 'Dark Lord.' If his reveal was more out of the blue, I think it would have been more powerful.

- In regards to the above, I think it also would have worked better if Harry had tried to work with/through the system for the changes he desired, instead of just sitting back in his (understandable) post-War apathy and then getting mad when the things he hoped for didn't come to be. I think this also would have made the emotional impact more meaningful.

- A sequel focusing on Harry actually being a 'Dark Lord' with followers instead of just a mostly solo vigilante.

All in all, while I wouldn't rate this as a great fic or maybe not even a good fic, I would rate it as entertaining without being utter shit.

** I don't have time for a longer post right now, I'll come back later, but for now I'll say this: the author had a good idea for a story, but wrote all the wrong scenes. The story that this should have been is contained in the time skip at the end. There's a 100k words missing between the final showdown and the last scene. Essentially, the impression this leaves would be better without that epilogue, because it makes you realize what a huge wasted opportunity this fic is. And even if the epilogue wasn't there, the story still leaves a lot to be desired.

Edit: so, a few more points.

First, the prose didn't do it for me. The author repeatedly told me that the world is war-weary and bleak and up for fixing, but I wasn't shown it. Rants about bigots in the Ministry aren't enough. Also, it's such a tired trope at this point. No institution is a hive mind.

Some characters came off as unnecessarily sanctimonious when Harry told them he was becoming a Dark Lord, as if those two words automatically mean you're a bad person. Also, Dark Lord being an officially recognized title instead of a Voldemort-specific honorific.

Adherence to House loyalties and stereotypes. When I saw "Gryffindor-Slytherin Dark Lord" I almost punched the screen.

The big moments, when they happened, had no weight behind the punch. This ties into the prose issue, which simply didn't sell those moments to me.

Some cool ideas were run into the ground. The whole Dark Lord thing. The Black madness was a fun way to explain the Occlumency issue, but it only worked the first time, when Dorea's portrait said it. Every time it was repeated, "I'm not extra psychotic, but I have the recklessness," it lost its charm.

All of the above combined led to a fic with some promise and potentially great ideas becoming just boring. This is how you /don't/ write a Dark!Harry fic.

Yup that's one of those "Fanon" things that I find really annoying. Maybe it's something that people borrow from Star Wars lore (like a Sith)? It always seemed obvious to me that Voldemort is having his minions call him Dark Lord in order to stroke his grandiose ego, not that the title is actually a thing... some fics even go so far as to have a "Light Lord" who has to oppose "The Dark"^{tm.}

IMHO linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood]]) has a brilliant moment of subverting this cliche: There's an actual ministry approved Dark Lord election during that fic: "In my day, Dark Lords just happened. None of this fancy electing." (Spoiler: [[/spoiler][Voldemort actually doesn't win the election, but he narrowly beats out Fudge for being the next Dork Lord]]... but that's neither here nor there)

** Don't usually comment in Book Club threads but I'm a big fan of this fic (mostly). It's already been mentioned but I really enjoy how Harry's steps towards the dark side are gradual and understandable. Too many !darkharry fics have Harry taking a leap towards the dark side and it's not believable.

My biggest problem with this is the same as everyone else, the ending sucks (imo). It feels like the author has the story going really well and it reaches its peak, then all of a sudden it's over. My guess is that the author had real life stuff come up but didn't want to abandon the fic so he/she wrote that time jump to cap off the story. In a way this is good in that they didn't leave us with an abandoned fic. But it also left me wanting more.

** I'm another huge fan of this fic, and I've recommended it many times here.

Many have already mentioned the abrupt ending, and I agree with them. This fic is definitely in need of a sequel. I pm'ed the author about that, and he said he had a few ideas, but nothing guaranteed.

Another thing I have reservation about is the 'Black madness interferes with Occulumency" thing. It feels kind forced and like a plot device to make Harry's life more difficult.

Otherwise, I really love the tone of the story and how Trio interacted.

** I actually read this one a while back when it was still incomplete/updating.

The tl;dr version:

A fresh idea and storyline with competent writing is ultimately hampered by a premature ending.

The long version:

This is one of the better takes on a Dark Harry/trio that I've seen. Their reasons for it were understandable, even reasonable, which makes their slide down the slippery slope all the more insidious. The main premise isn't one that I've seen done well -- Harry doing bad things for good reasons.

The writing is decent and clearly written -- I didn't do any backtracking to try to understand what was being said. There are a couple minor grammatical issues here and there, but nothing that made me want to stop reading. Just typos, IIRC. What's really fantastic about the writing is that everyone feels in-character, which is quite the feat.

But that ending is, hands down, the biggest problem that I have with this story. The epilogue reads like a summary of an outline that was stapled onto the last chapter ... or the idea for a sequel.

Very disappointed by that. The story would have been better served by not having an epilogue at all.
