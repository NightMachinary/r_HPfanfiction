How was Dumbledore famous even before defeating Grindelwald?

I'm watching Fantastic Beasts. The Crimes of Grindelwald.

One of Grindelwald supporters mentions how great and powerful Dumbledore is?

Didn't he get his fame and become renowed after defeating Grindelwald?


** I didn't watch "The Crimes of Grindelwald", so I'm not sure how "famous" they make him, but Dumbledore still had reasons to be (somewhat) well known before defeating Grinderwald. At the times of the movie, he had already:

- Been hailed as a genius throughout his Hogwarts year
- Became an apprentice of Nicolas Flamel
- Discovered the 12 uses of Dragon Blood (I think so?)
- Been hired as the Transfiguration Professor of Hogwarts, one of the few (and best) Magical Institution in the World, as well as Gryffindor Head of House and (maybe) Deputy Headmaster.

One of the most important aspect of Rowling's Magical World is that the entire Wizards population is equivalent to a Muggle small country, and the Magical countries are comparable to a little town in how they work (or at least, it's the case for Magical Britain). It is pretty easy for someone of Dumbledore's talent to acquire a local notoriety in such a world, and his defeat of Grinderwald propeled him to a level comparable to the Founders or Merlin.

*** Btw... for some reason in that shitshow of a film he teaches dada. Why? Probably because jk forgot he was the Transfiguration teacher.

**** Didn't they also put McGonagall as the Transfiguration teacher even though she is supposed to be around Voldemort's age et should be a little child during the movie? I think I remember people complaining about it.

*** He had also already duelled Grindelwald to a standstill. Not sure how known that was but he had. Ariana's death was the result of said duel. Oh and Aberforth was there.

** I'd guess he was already fairly well-known in academic circles, given his that he'd apparently been a prodigy in his exams and a leading magical academic since school (and eventually a professor).

How well-known he'd be outside of academia... probably pretty well-known in Britain. The magical world has a small population, nearly everyone goes to/sends their kids to Hogwarts- by the time he faced Grindlewald, two to three generations at least would know him, either as their classmate Dumbledore, or as their professor Dumbledore, or as their kids' professor Dumbledore. But I doubt he achieved international fame outside of academia, or the status of the greatest wizard of his time in the popular consciousness, until the war with Grindlewald.
