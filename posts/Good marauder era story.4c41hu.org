Quite simply I'm looking for a story that tells of the marauders snape and lilys etc years at Hogwarts Goes through all 7 years cannon compliant events and Parrings as much as possible And if possible goes to Halloween 1981 Basically I want the prequel Jkr never wrote Any recommendations?


** I haven't read it, but my favorite tumblr user excepttheeyes swears by linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) She says it's the only Marauders' Era fic she'll read because it has the best (most realistic) characterisation. excepttheeye's got the best gifsets for that time period and I imagine her face claims whenever I read those characters so I have faith in her taste. The fic is canon compliant

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

**** I am telling you DO NOT READ THIS FIC. You WILL fall in love with it. You WILL become obsessed with it. And then right when it's getting to the end of 7th year BAM! The author hasn't updated in over two years! I die a little bit everytime I look it up to see if it's been updated. IT HASN'T.

***** Are the characters flawed and well rounded or is it pretty much a glowing romp of the Marauders time at school?

****** It's very well rounded. It's like an actual book that is published and put on a best sellers list. Granted, not all books on that list make them amazing books but this fic is just wonderful.
