  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** IMHO, by far the best of this genre is linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall); it's imperfectly plotted (let's just say there are too many threads and the author has trouble resolving them all in a perfectly satisfying way at the end) but it's extremely well written and a very good read.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** I'm not sure if this one, A memory of shadow, is quite what you're looking for but linkao3(13212984)

And this one, Ouroburos, is even more different but still a good story so linkao3(14270454)
