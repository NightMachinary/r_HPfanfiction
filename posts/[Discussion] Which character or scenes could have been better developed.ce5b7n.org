For example, Harry's grief about Sirius, Ron's Chess abilities, and other student characters.


** Anything with Fleur, Cho, Lavender, and the Patil twins. Someone in the Hermione arc thread mentioned her disgust of femininity. That is very much JKR because she kinda has Harry do it, too. Those characters are treated so poorly.

Barty Crouch, father and son, were given raw deals. Amelia Bones, apparently lasted against Voldemort. Also killed too soon. Bellatrix, I love her, but a cartoon.

Ginny. I enjoy Harry/Ginny. It's the only canon endgame ship that I enjoy. (L&J, too, but they're dead) I'm perfectly okay with throw away lines in HBP, /but/ she could've been developed better/introduced earlier. Having her become a true friend after her father was bitten or Voldemort's return would have been great.

Harry's lack of friendship with his teammates.

*** All very good points. While I disagree with the pairing, my only gripe with the pairing is the lack of development of their relationship. Ginny is a name until their relationship.

Yes the cast of characters properly used was abysmal. Development on the cast that was significantly used was also abysmal. Makes me wonder what was in the last 4 or 5 books that made them that long.

Honestly, I think all subjects were kind of lackluster/poorly shown. World building was done mostly after the series was written.

I disagree, but like only a little lol. We see that she can be pretty mean and aggressive. There's also those 2 scenes in OOTP where she's able to get through to Harry. Haven't read it in a while, but there's some development there. JKR just needed to expand on that. To be honest, she gave Luna the scenes she should've given Ginny.

*** Hey, we found a human exposition machine. As much as I liked the idea of Hermione's character the execution of her development was shoddy as best. Her role in the series can be relegated to mother Harry and Ron and exposition. Also having Hermione be smart allowed her to make Harry dumb af. She shows us Harry is dumb but tells us he is average

**** Exactly. I would have loved a more developed Hermione. Well and a smarter Harry. Seriously, he was very inquisitive in book 1-3. What happened?

Her mothering did not help her character at all. Very grating, especially in the later books. Her advising people on relationships is hilarious, considering she attacked the person she had a crush on with birds.

Rowling coddled her in canon. I read a fic where every time she butted in her opinion as if she were a supreme authority, people would fire back their opinion in a scathing manner. It was bashing, but it was so cathartic compared to canon...

***** Yep. Biggest problem is the protagonists Harry, Ron, and Hermione feel like static characters.

I didn't like the stories after book 3. There was nothing that was built upon. Magical items are used as one off plot devices instead of reoccurring and creatively used items.

Also Ron. In the first book, he was a lazy but strategic person. We don't see a hint of any of that anywhere else in the series. He is degraded to a whiny 1D static character with absolutely no growth. First book he is ready to sacrifice himself for harry. 4th book he abandons Harry. 7th book he abondons Harry again.

******* Book 6 was okay but could have been improved so much. Show Harry dealing with Sirius' death after the summer other than nightmares, Hermione not being such an asshole about a goddamn book, some support and trust from his friends considering Malfoy.

There is no excuse for the last point. HG&RW both were there in book 3 when Draco tried to get an innocent animal killed, pretended to be a dementor, and 5th book inquisitorial Squad. You could say Draco was one of the better developed characters in the series.

Edit: Also Harry was beat tf up in the train by Malfoy though I don't remember if that was movie only

Really was stupid of them. Although, it seems Ron was thinking with his dick rather than his head, by agreeing with Hermione.

I liked the fact that Hermione was jealous of the attention Harry got in potions. It showed a human side to her. What I didn't like was how Rowling pretty much had her not learn anything from that. Or confunding McLaggen. Or attacking Ron with birds.

********* Ron thinking with his dick is true enough. Human side maybe? Author being indecisive? Definitely. Hermione's character can never be described as anything but book smart. She sure as hell isn't street smart at least until she is whenever it is convenient. It's just I've never found any HP characters to be human or have human thought processes. Up until deathly hallows it's still as if they are just slightly upgraded 11 year olds with a higher tv rating.

When you live with someone for six years, they become a big part of your life. And Harry actually LIKES Dean and Seamus, there is no reason for him not to have a meaningful friendship with them.\\
Actually, he actually has more stuff in common with Dean than with anyone else in Gryffindor, both having lived in the muggle world and without a father.

** Ron and Hermione in general. They both get some decent development in the first half of the series, but in the second half their development kind of halts... or to be more precise, Hermione's development halts while Ron's development is largely undermined and takes place off-screen.

Also, the Dursleys. They don't come across as characters in their own right, they seem to exist SOLELY to be mean to Harry. It sort of works in the first book where everything's a little simpler and more cartoony, but when everyone and everything else actually gets a little more complex, the Dursleys feel more and more out of place. JKR tries to give a little development to Dudley and Petunia, but it's so minor that it doesn't really work.

** The obvious one is Ginny. So obvious I will not go into more detail here as everyone knows how it ruined the Harry/Ginny pairing for many.

However, there are 4 other things that stand far and above all the others in my view:

1. First... Fleur/Gabrielle and Veela as a whole. Fleur especially deserved more time to simply show her as deeper than she was portrayed and the idea behind Veela was poorly executed and comes off as simply model-looks women with attitude problems. I get why it did not happen, but it still bothers me.

2. Slytherins, especially female ones. I have long been annoyed at how for all the sorting hat sung about the school uniting when folks say "Slytherin" all you can think about is Draco stinking Malfoy and his "goons" and "friends". Its too bad we did not get more of a glimpse into the house as a whole, and while Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff suffer the same fate to a lesser degree, Slytherin was obviously a more important component in the grand scheme of the story.

3. Fawkes. The relationship between Dumbledore and Fawkes and Fawkes as a "familiar" and the whole "familiar" element of the series was criminally underdone. It had such potential and yet was barely touched on. While Fawkes got plenty of screen time, he simply comes off as an intelligent bird, nothing more. He's a fucking phoenix.

4. And finally, the one that bothers me most (outside Ginny)... Minerva McGonagall. Some folks may say.. wait what? But let's be honest here... for being Harry's head of house, a strong witch, and an integral part of the story, she was always playing "second fiddle" to Dumbledore or Snape or circumstances. She deserved more development and for us to see more of her backstory or at least find it out. We deserved to have her play a more impactful part in Harry's life and initially, it felt like there were hints about that. With her not wanting Harry placed with the Dursleys, and moments of early interaction with him in his first year. But she never really "took off".
