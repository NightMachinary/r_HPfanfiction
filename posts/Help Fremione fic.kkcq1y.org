:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I need help finding this fremione fic on archive our own. It's completed but it had a christmas chapter where the weasley's wanted to open presents but it was too early so they decided to draw names from a hat and chose a present from said name to open ONE gift. For fred someone chose hermione's gift and since it was the same for george, the twins opened the present together. Hermione made them a clothes changing device that they called the “granger changer” lol. Dont remember much else from it but in this fic the twins go on morning runs...


** Is it by any chance "You Have the Magic Touch" by Fortheloveoffun? It's the first thing that came up when I googled "ao3 "granger changer""
