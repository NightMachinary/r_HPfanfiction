The fanfiction im looking for is one where tom riddle time travels into the future. It also states that harry went back in time to his era and they became friends and tom brought out harrys darker tendencies. I also remember that a portal or a light appeared in the great hall during meal time and so tom and his original crew came out. Theres also a prequel where we see how they got to know eachother. Theres only one seen i remember in which Tom and Harry fight in the slytherin dorm room and is eventually leads to the common room


** linkffn(Fate's Favourite) by The Fictionist is what you're looking for.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
