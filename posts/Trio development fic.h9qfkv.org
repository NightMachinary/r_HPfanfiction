Looking for fics where all three of the golden trio get their share of development and moments. It doesn't have to be the main focus of the fic (though that would be great) but I would like it if a significant part of it focused on the trio's adventures and development and friendship. They have so much potential and most of it is wasted in the books and most of the fics just seem to bash Ron or just push him aside and... you get my point. I love fics where Harry and Ron take the other subjects like Runes, Arithmancy etc or are good at one or more areas of magic so if you guys have any fics like that I would love to read them.

So ... suggestions?

Trio in separate houses, but they are best friends anyway (some great moments and development)

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7534131/1/Stunning-Shifts]])

Not main focus, but they have adventures together (very much canon compilant personalities)

Don't worry about the ship if it's something that bothers you, slow burn here is really very slow, the gradual development of characters is what mostly happens so far. The characters start from their canonical versions and to bring them to a certain point surely takes a lot of time and a lot of development, and it's great, no bashing, depictions of Dumbledore and Ron are truly refreshing.

  Severus Snape has a change of heart. In an attempt to keep Potter alive, he tells the Dark Lord all about Dumbledore's plans for Potter and the war. Once Voldemort realizes that Harry Potter is his horcrux, his plans change drastically. So does Draco Malfoy's assignment for the school year. Harry's sixth year starts going very differently. Snape is now on a mission to discover why Harry was so ignorant of the Wizarding World. Harry is going to need to learn pureblood politics if he's going to keep up with everything. Draco Malfoy needs to find a way to convince Harry to forgive him. Voldemort finds himself visiting Harry Potter in his dreams. Everyone is realizing that no one is quite what they thought. And through it all, there's a mystery. What is Ancient Magic? Why is it so powerful and so hard to control? And why did Professor Dumbledore go out of his way to make it illegal?

** Great Trio fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), deviates from canon after DH, and depicts the Trio in a beautiful and melancholic fashion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is a dark war epic in which their relationship is tested in new ways.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407), is a Harry/Daphne fic and does not put the Trio at center of the attention. But Ron and Hermione are nevertheless very important and helpful.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), has a somewhat different Trio dynamic, since this Harry thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but he nevertheless grows to care about Ron and Hermione. His interactions with Hermione are totally hilarious.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] happens in a non magical sci-fi AU and loosely mirrors canon events. This Trio is a lot more dangerous and ruthless, but Ron is really adorable.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** So fair warning, I wrote this. I just started writing again after not touching it in over a decade and I'm so rusty I can't even tell what I'm doing wrong lol.

But! I love the relationship between the trio and I'm trying to give them all a serious goal and screen time so hopefully you enjoy it. Also fair warning it's Lunar Harmony, so if that turns you off it fair enough.
