Trying to help this Redit user dive into fanfic by finding some well written fics that play with some or all of the ideas mentioned in his post. I know there are some great fics out there, but I haven't read much in the HP fandom for the past few years and could use some assistance finding them!

** Would friends after second year count? Im writing one now where Draco is fostered with the Weasleys after his dad is caught at the end of COS. But it's also Draco/Rob which I know isn't exactly popular
