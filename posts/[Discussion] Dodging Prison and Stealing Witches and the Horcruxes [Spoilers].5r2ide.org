Okay I've just re-read the latest chapter and I'd like to discuss theories on how or why fake Horcruxes were delivered to Voldy. These are my theories, from most to least likely. Am I missing something obvious?

1. Harry did it himself and used either an alternate personality or obliviation in order to make it impossible for him to be coerced. We know that triggered fideliuses exist and that intent-based wards are possible. Maybe you can only remove the real Horcruxes if you intent to destroy them. Or you can't remove them if you want to give them to Voldemort. It seems like a sensible thing to do. The Horcruxes are endgame material and not something that Harry can afford to lose. It seems out of character to just chuck them in a Fidelius-box, considering Harry knows the amount of trouble that Dumbledore went through to hide a much less important object (and considering that he knows the Fidelius is imperfect). I'd have expected better protections.

2. Fawkes or something/someone related to Fawkes. That bloody bird is mysteriously absent and Dumbledore seems strangely unconcerned by this. I don't think it is normal that it disappears for extended periods of time and it's weird that Dumbledore doesn't seem to question it at all. Possibly Flamel is involved, but it seems awkward for him to be such an all-knowing character just because he was sensible enough to give Dumbledore a fake Stone.

3. Daphne and Hermione actually did something or experienced something else and were obliviated or got false memories. Seems like a stretch because they had no idea what they could do and why would they obliviate themselves... but I guess a third party could have intercepted them at some point, used them to get through the Fidelius and then obliviated them. No idea who would have both the motive and the ability though, again, maybe Flamel?

4. Another time traveler. This seems pretty common as a theory, but I would be somewhat disappointed, because it's too much of a Deus Ex Machina for my tastes. Unless there's some bigger purpose to it, it seems like a waste to just throw another time-traveler or another intervention by Fate at the problem. Please don't let it be Luna, that would seriously devalue her character and skills. Also it opens up a myriad of potential plot-holes if another time-traveler was present.

5. Harry has been bamboozled much worse than we think. The Voldemort rage vision was fake, the Horcruxes in the chest are actually very convincing fakes (could Voldemort create fake Horcruxes that seem real to Harry?), Voldemort didn't blow up Quirrelmorts body in his anger and now has two of his Horcruxes back in his possession. Seems unlikely though, since Voldemort would need to get at the Horcrux-chest in the first place and why not just take them without the whole hostage inconvenience. On the other hand Harry now believes Voldemort's body has been destroyed and be less cautious.

6. [[https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/700674603_mAVrc/0/2100x20000/700674603_mAVrc-2100x20000.jpg][A wizard did it.]]

I wonder if there's anything sensible that I missed.

** I know you don't want Luna to be the time traveler, but if you reread all of her interactions with Harry, it points heavily in that direction. ie: Luna asking Harry to be her friend while he's trying to figure out how to make that happen, Luna convincing her father to marry Harry, Luna always being just a little bit better at dueling then Ginny and being genuinely surprised when Ginny wins once, then is immediately one step ahead of her again. This could all be explained as Luna being Luna but it could also be Luna being a time traveling Luna.

*** Okay time to dive right into that can of worms.

IMHO there's a bunch of problems with that. First and foremost: Why didn't she just tell him? Is there any sensible reason why she had to be so circumspect about it? Why didn't she dissuade him from getting the stone, she had to know it's a fake. Couldn't she have warned Ginny to hide her broomstick better? Would have been nice... As I've said in the first post, it opens up the possibility for so many plotholes.

Also does that mean there's a whole other time line (that we didn't get to see - ugh) in which Harry failed and then Fate decided to send Luna back in order to save his ass? That's just... No. Honestly there's little reason that Harry should be the protagonist is that's the case.

Everything you mentioned as evidence could just as well be quirky Luna-traits that make her interesting - having her as a time traveler makes her boring. Been there done that. You can't just throw a new time traveler at every big problem on order to solve it (and it really doesn't add anything to the story). It lowers the stakes. I guess if Luna fucks up too there can be another time traveler who fixes her mistakes? I'd expect LeadVonE to be a better writer than this.

**** I'm going to counter your point with pretty much speculation, so be wary.

First off, I have no idea how Luna would've time traveled and it would be pretty dumb if it was fate. At this moment, I'd like to believe that it was some plan made up by the Harry in Luna's original timeline.

Second off, I think it would be a pretty unique twist that has some cool set up. It would certainly be the first time I've read of a separate time traveler arriving to help the protagonist time traveler without their knowledge, and it would be set up by the fact that Harry is already shown to be a second time traveler fixing the mistakes of the first, so why not a third? Also, I do believe that Luna is the only girl of the harem to have not had her own POV chapter, but that's off memory so I could be wrong. If I'm not, then a good reason for that would be to hide her as a time traveler.

And finally, as for the not telling Harry about it, it could be because Luna saw two different time travelers fail, one by doing nothing and the other by fucking with the world so much he stopped being able to predict when something went wrong (albeit a knowing decision on Harry's part). It's possible that Luna took a sort of middle ground, trying to not change anything important until a certain point, potentially Voldemort obtaining the Horcruxes, while making little improvements that ultimately wouldn't change the overall path of the timeline, as in the stuff I mentioned earlier.

Either way, I love the explanation, and I think it fits the story just fine.

Long-term time travel is notoriously difficult to the point of almost impossible (at least that's heavily implied in the story or Voldemort would have done it too... he had many years to figure it out).

The Deus Ex Machina is even worse if you use a unknown device. We already know one method for long term time travel (that is quite ridiuclous enough), but now because that might lead to plot-holes we need to invent a whole other secret technique? Sorry that's just a really bad idea.

There's nothing unique about this. Ever seen Terminator? Anyway, it's a very lazy solution and it is only good if you make the whole story about it (again, Terminator). Since the first part of the story barely had Luna in it it would be pretty dumb to make her suddenly the solution to everything. Luna being there to help Harry from the future might be interesting, but it would be a very different story written very differently.

Or there's some other reveal concerning her. Harry has been specializing 'his' girls in very different kinds of training. I'm even willing to go as far as to speculate that Luna might be a prophet/seer, but it seems implausible to me that Harry never noticed something off when he taught her occlumency etc.

**** Long rambling counter argument time! I'll be assuming Luna's a time traveler for my points.

The reason why she doesn't tell him is admittedly the weakest part of the theory, but there can be any number of reasons. As I said in my other post, it could be that she thought having the big events play out as they did in her timeline (at least at the outset) was beneficial for some reason. Unfortunately we can't know if that's a good reason since we don't know the future events of the story. Though don't misunderstand me and think I'm saying Luna's on a "preserving the timeline" kick like John. She's still training Ginny and Alex in a way that definitely wouldn't have occurred in her timeline.

As for the problem with multiple time travelers lowering the stakes...yeah, sure. But that's the entire premise of the story! It was established at the outset that Fate could do do-overs when she sent Harry back after John, and there's nothing in the first chapter that implies she can't do it again. That flaw has always been there, so I see it as a damned if you do, damned if you don't kind of thing. That said, I don't think it's a negative to show that Harry can still fail. He really comes across as too overconfident a lot of the time.

Finally, the issue with this somehow making Luna boring. I'll be honest: so far, I don't like Luna's characterization in this story. Like in so many other harem fics, Luna is portrayed as a flawless, eccentric Mary Sue. She's perfectly sociable despite her weirdness, she's vastly more skilled than the other girls even though we've never seen her training with Harry, and she somehow has an intimate knowledge of ritual magic for no apparent reason. Personally, I think having Luna be a time traveler would temporarily excuse these problems, and leave some room for a deeper character than we've seen so far depending on how it's handled. Either way, I hope second year will flesh her out more.

What about Tracey? She could have died? Was that part of Luna's plan too? I think the fact that Harry gave up the Horcruxes and *couldn't* sacrifice Tracey even though it seemed like the right thing to do to him (he almost seemed to have some kind of physical reaction preventing him) might be his subconscious or a part of his 'trigger' for this exact circumstance.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Okay, this might be a little subjective, but there's a sort of understanding in this kind of story between reader and author. A sort of implied contract... that there's not going to be any more divine intervention (in order to solve problems). You're of course technically correct that there will be nothing preventing Death and Fate from intervening again, but the idea of it ruins any dramatic climax of the story, because there could be no scenario in which Harry would lose anymore. All stories that violate this understanding are almost all bad and you can find a bunch of them in low-brow fanfiction (Harry constantly talking with a divine entityt and getting rescued by Deus Ex Machina pulled out of someone's ass).

Other good stories like this often pre-emptively close the door on this by having the divine entity say something like "This is your last chance!" or "I won't intervene again", the fact that this is missing in DPSW opens up the possibility, but still would make it a bad idea story-telling wise.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I disagree. I think Ginny is much more skilled than Luna, Luna is just more powerful and has a more 'intuitive' understanding of magic. If they weren't allies and Ginny didn't tell Luna about all the new things she has learned Luna wouldn't stand a chance in a real conflict. Oh by the way, Luna seemed genuinely excited and surprised when she learned about the switching spell. Did she fake that excitement if she is a time traveler?

The fact that we haven't seen what Harry has been teaching her is troubling, but we already know that he treats all of them very differently. I'm expecting some kind of 'reveal' about Luna (especially because we haven't had a POV from here), so I agree with you there.

****** Yeah, the potential death of Tracey is a big risk to take, even with reasonably accurate foreknowledge.

Given my theory, I'd obviously say that the lack of a "this is your last chance" moment backs my position, though that's such weak evidence that it's not even worth bringing up.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, actually! I think this moment plays perfectly into Luna being a time traveler. Ginny learned the switching spell after asking Harry for advice on how to beat Luna. Assuming Luna was much weaker in her original timeline, she wouldn't have been able to push Ginny to that extent, and that spell would've never been invented/brought up.

Okay, yeah, that actually makes sense. Thanks. But this also plays into why I don't think that Luna is a Mary Sue. She's not really pushing the boundaries, Ginny is. If the back-and-forth between them didn't exist and Ginny just had someone else to challenge her she would vastly outperform Luna. Luna is just offering a challenge. Ginny is doing all the work. Luna is just some sort of magic-savant who picks it up easily (which is great and incredibly useful I'm sure, but not mary-sue-ish).

*** I think the centaur's comment in chapter 28 makes it clear that this is the third timeline, and therefore there is /not/ another time traveler.

#+begin_quote
  "Jupiter shines bright tonight." "The last time around, it was pluto, and the time before that, was mars."
#+end_quote

So the original timeline (as in the books) had mars shine brightly; the second timeline when John came back had pluto shine brightly; and the current timeline where both John and Harry came back has Jupiter. If there was another time traveler, the centaur would have mentioned an additional timeline.

** My guess is it was a convoluted multiple-obliviation scheme that the team came up with for this contingency. The story introduced the concept to the readers with the fidelus-cracking scheme, but they'd already carried it out to protect the horcruxes and removed all knowledge of having done so.

*** Yeah. It also points in that direction because we never see them discussing protections for the Horcruxes. We already know Harry expected Voldy to take hostages at some point and that he obviously would demand his Horcruxes back in such a scenario. I can't fathom Harry, Hermione or Daphne not considering a contingency plan for that.

** I don't really understand the aversion to 4. I feel like it's been *very* heavily foreshadowed, and it gives justification for Luna's power and smarts other than "lol Luna's the best."

From the beginning of chapter 8:

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood had been a nervous, frightened child when he'd last been at Hogwarts, but Voldemort's memories showed her to be both loyal, and a competent duelist.
#+end_quote

This just doesn't square with everything we've seen from her. My theory is that she's taking a sort of hybrid approach to Harry and John's timeline shenanigans. Her limited interaction with Harry during first year ensures that events involving him go mostly as she remembers them, while she's free to make much larger changes as it pertains to Ginny and Alex. If this is the case, I expect the reveal would happen fairly early in second year, since they'll all be together and the horcrux switch would be a major disruption to the events experienced originally by Luna.
