Hello fellow redditors! I am searching for a different Harry Potter story that I can't seem to find! It is a story where Harry is in an orphage and is very smart and intelligent. So much that he actuelky considered refusing going to hogwartz because he had achieved a scholarship in one of the best schools. He is sorted into Slytherin, manages all of the financial business as the potter or black heir, do not really remember which, creates a secret club where he teaches spells, the Weasley twins are in it even though they are gryffindor and Molly, their mother, don't acknowledges them. She only has eyes for the older son,ginny and ron(I think). Dumboldor says that he is more similar to his mother, he has a '' sister'', ho is an orphan, is friends with some Chinese or Japanese wizards because apparently her mother could have married in one of those Asian families (she didn' t because she had to get a tatoo but didn't like it) So, this is all I remember from the story. PLEASE RESPOND AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT BOOKS NAME IS! PLEASE!

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.
