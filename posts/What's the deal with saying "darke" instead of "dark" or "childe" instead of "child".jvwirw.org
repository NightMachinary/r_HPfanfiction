I don't understand the reasons behind using these specific spellings... Do you know?

** It sounds more old-timey. Vampire the Masquerade does that kind of nonsense all the time. It's the same idea as 'Ye Olde Whatever', basically.

People think "Ye Childe of the Most Darke Onne, retreat from this place, lest a fate most foul befall ye!" type language sounds more appropriate and foreboding for ancient tomes and prophesies and such.

*** Off-topic but I read your comment as "Ye Childe of the Most Darke Onan..." - Onan is in the character from the Bible killed by God for masturbating in order to avoid having children. I just found it funny.

**** I mean, that would be a pretty interesting story. The person so desperate not to have children that they go against God and get killed for it somehow having a sprog. Sounds like a semi-decent foundation for a Biblical Version of the God of War games. :)

Also, Onanism is one of those words that are so interesting to know because most people have never heard the word so you can make plenty of wanking jokes in public without anyone noticing. :)

Mastication is kind of the opposite to that (chewing, for anyone who doesn't know).

**** I've not read the fic you're talking about, so I can't give any certain answers, but I'd imagine it's because Rowling's Magical World is 'Olde Fashioned' and the language supposedly fits the setting. If the Magical World did exist, so the writers might think, the people there would probably speak very old fashioned English, what with splitting off in the 1690s (well before standardised spelling became a thing) and living longer with no internet (meaning there'd be very little cultural or linguistic change in the four or so generations since the Statute became a thing). The writers would be focusing on the 'Moste Potente Potions' type language and ignoring the 'Standard Book of Spells' type language, but people do what makes sense to them. :)

Characters speak with the verbiage they think is most appropriate - ideally - so they'd see that kind of language use as normal, while we with our lit fams and sup dawgs would see it as old fashioned.

Like I said though, this is just my best guess. Hell, could just be the writer wanting to make a 'proper evil Dark Magic is actually Darke Magic and Dark Magic is just Pureblood Traditions the Ministry doesn't like' type argument for all I know. Generally it is the old fashioned thing though.

***** Hm, I disagree that the magic world should sound much more old fashioned than muggle English. I do think it should sound /odd/ as it would have developed different, perhaps with its own dialect. (I'd think wizards and witches across Britain mostly being educated in one school and working in a smaller range of workplaces/localities that there should be more muted regional variation.)

****** It's just my best guess as to why they might choose those words, not my actual beliefs.

In my opinion, the linguistic development would be a LOT more complex due to the stagnation of the aging population, their printing habits, ease of transportation, and regular Muggleborn immigration all mixing together. I'm a Psychogeographer, so the interactions between place and people are of great interest to me and the interactions of Social Ecosystems are very, very complicated things. :)

**** Truth. After all, Shakespeare used the “darke” spelling. His infamous line in Hamlet described female genitalia as a “Darke and vicious” place. The first English dictionary didn't get published until 1604. The first line had “especially” spelled “efpecially” because the print evidently predated the small “s”, and it used “y” instead of “I” for certain words like “neyther” (neither). Just a bit of trivial from a ye olde nerde.

***** Fun fact: The "Ye" of Ye Olde English has a similar origin. The german presses that were first imported didn't have the "Þ" symbol, so they picked "Y" instead. Þ being pronounced "th," naturally.

It's literally "the old" not "ye old"

***** The f in question was actually called a long s. It DID have a different shape than an f, but if you didn't have the correct sort (each of those little bits of metal with a letter on it is called a sort) an f was an acceptable substitution. The short s is the one we use today. It wasn't a different sound, it was an entirely typographical convention with rules about how it was to be used. (It was used for any single s or the first letter of any double s. The English did away with the long S entirely. The Germans turned the double into ß.) Why anyone thought it was a GOOD idea is another question entirely.
