I recently read a fic where Harry and co travel to an alternate reality where Harry was very powerful, but all the death eaters seemed to be very powerful too. I'm not sure if it was an intentional plot point that the Death Eaters there are supposed to be strong or what but it got me thinking.

Is there anything where magic is incredibly weak compared to canon. I was thinking something like canon Harry get's transported to a new world in year 5 (when he's better than average for his age but nothing amazing), and the wizards of the new world are all very weak by comparison. I was thinking that magic in the new world would be on the level of Sympathy from The Name of The Wind where it's 'magic' and powerful, but the average Arcanist is basically about as powerful as the average mercenary as long as he didn't have much time to prepare.

Does anyone know of a story like this? Where it is an actual plot point that magic is weak and not just that it appears that way due to poor writing of fights.


** In Core Threads, when Harry went to Rose's universe where magic is less powerful, Harry was literally treated as God.

*** Thanks, this sounds interesting. I'd actually heard of it before but never bothered to read it. I see that it is unfinished, but well over 300k words. Do you know if this story is anywhere near completion? I much prefer completed stories, but mostly I don't want to start something that had been dropped.

I'm not sure how close the story is to completion, but the author updated last month so it's certainly not abandoned.

**** This story is rather complete by itself even before starting. It's like it has no real goal but adding some new chapters for fun or humor. It's like collection of oneshots. But they are posting sequentially rather than randomly.
