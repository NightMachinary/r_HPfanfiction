We all have read it a thousand times - how great a duelling champion Filius Flitwick is. Are there any fics that center around duelling? If not.... id like to read some with impressive and intelligent/tactical magic(or magical warfare?).


** It's not a fic "centred around" duelling, but I shall nonetheless leave here the best duel sequence in the fandom:

#+begin_quote
  "I want to know how to fight, yes," said Harry cautiously. It was an old argument, one that he'd never really won.

  "Yes," said Remus, a bit sadly. "And no one is thrilled by that, given your age. But we understand it. These aren't typical circumstances. However... what I've been trying to tell you, Harry, is that teaching you those things would be a bad idea. Not because you're too young to learn them, but because it would be too limiting."

  "I still don't understand," said Harry.

  "I know," said Remus. "And that's the idea I had. I've told you every way I know how. But I think it will be better to show you."

  Remus gestured towards the bench, where Dumbledore was already sitting. He'd summoned his magazine and was humming to himself and reading. Harry sat in the middle, and Remus sat beside him.

  Harry watched as Sirius and Snape walked a short distance away from each other. They stood apart, facing each other, unmoving for a time. Snape looked cool and impassive, whereas Sirius had an almost expectant, dangerous grin on his face.

  They bowed. Slightly. Harry thought Sirius's two-fingered salute at the end probably wasn't traditional.

  And then they were in motion. Snape drew his wand smoothly from his robes, dropping to a knee in the same action. Sirius had drawn from his holster impossibly fast, a jet of angry orange light passing over Snape's left shoulder.

  Snape flicked his wand and shot dark red spells, one after the other, at Sirius. They were aimed low, and Sirius jumped out of the way. The spells left a hissing, burning spot on the sand where they connected. Instead of pressing his advantage, Snape swept his wand in a tight circle, conjuring a rough-hewn block of stone that he ducked behind. He seemed to be predicting Sirius's movements as Sirius's counterstrike, a powerful-looking blast of white light, only made the stone block shudder slightly.

  "What does it remind you of?" asked Remus.

  Harry watched, entranced, as they traded spells. He'd never seen them duel like this. They weren't trying to kill each other, obviously, but it looked a near thing. The spells Harry recognized weren't exactly Stunners. He flinched back as a sickly yellow spell shot towards the bench, deflected by Sirius with a quick bit of wand-work. The spell impacted a shield that shimmered briefly before fading back into invisibility -- a shield that sprang into being directly above the line Dumbledore had drawn in the sand.

  "A gunfight," said Harry. And it was true. The quick, staccato blasts of light. The way they used cover. The ebb and flow of the battle, like an exchange of shots.

  Sirius charged. Roaring, he fired spell after spell at Snape, who was forced back. The tempo of the duel increased. The slashing, angry wand gestures. The way the lights of the spells were deflected, crackling against each other as the range decreased. The footwork, how Snape danced away from Sirius's aggressive strikes, turning them back, how Sirius charged ahead, each step pressing the other man.

  "Or a swordfight," said Harry.

  "Yes," said Remus. "That's what dueling looks like. That's what most real fighting looks like, too. When a pair of Aurors pin down a criminal and it becomes a pitched firefight, it usually looks something like this."

  Snape had turned the tide; Sirius's aggression had cost him. Snape sent a spell that was almost black right at the other man's head, and Sirius was forced to cast a thick, heavy Shield Charm. Even so, the impact sent him staggering back, and Snape pressed his advantage.

  Sirius dove to his right, snapping off a Bludgeoning Hex at just the right moment. Snape, who was mid-cast, could only twist to avoid it and it struck him in the ankle. He snarled, going to one knee, and slashed the air with his wand. Sirius, prone on the ground, rolled away and cried out as the spell tore through his shirt, his shoulder jerking with a crack that Harry could hear from fifty feet away.

  "That's enough!" called Remus, standing up. Sirius and Snape both got to their feet, their expressions unreadable. "I didn't mean for you two to get vicious, but I suppose it was an effective demonstration." He turned to Harry. "So, what did you think? Did that meet your expectations? Is that what you want to learn how to do?"

  "Well, yeah," said Harry, sensing he was walking into a trap but not able to see it.

  "Don't be so sure," said Remus with a faint trace of smugness. He coughed. Then again, louder. He looked over Harry's head in irritation. "Albus, the whole 'inscrutable wisdom' routine works a lot better when you pick up on the signals."

  "Ah, forgive me, Remus," said Dumbledore, folding his magazine neatly on the bench. "I was just reading the most fascinating article about the sixteen tertiary exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration..." he looked up. "Perhaps another time."

  Dumbledore stood and up and walked down the beach, stepping with care over the line he'd drawn. Sirius and Snape now stood loosely together, eying each other warily.

  "Gentlemen," said Dumbledore, bowing smoothly. Sirius and Snape exchanged a hooded glance, then faced Dumbledore and bowed back.

  Harry leaned forward in anticipation.

  They were quick, very quick. Sirius's silver spell was aimed high and left, at Dumbledore's shoulder, and Snape's violet jet of light was aimed low and right. Harry filed it away for future reference, something to tease his godfather about at a later date -- for all ways in which the two of them couldn't stand each other, apparently Sirius and Snape made a decent team.

  As the spells converged on him, Dumbledore flicked his wand almost casually, and the sand sprung up in front of him. The creature was shaped like a lion, or a bear -- something large and with four legs, anyway. The sand-creature leaped forward, its paws absorbing the spells as it threw itself, bodily, at the two duelists.

  Sirius tried diving out of the way, whereas Snape took a more direct approach, conjuring a blast of wind and directing it towards the oncoming sand lion. The creature burst apart, but the cloud of sand seemed to have a mind of its own, swirling angrily into a miniature tornado. Snape tried desperately to hold it off, fighting a losing battle as he directed wind against a storm of sand. Sirius, meanwhile, was taking advantage of the cover to take potshots at Dumbledore, who hadn't moved yet.

  Dumbledore casually stepped out of the way of one curse, sweeping his wand even as he moved and leaving a trail of fire in his wake, living, twisting flame that seemed to crystallize in place. Sirius's second spell hit the shield of flame, which pulsed with dark, angry light for a second, and then expelled the curse back the way it came, but faster, and -- judging from the way it made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand up as it passed -- with much more power.

  Sirius and Snape took cover behind a hastily conjured wall of steel as the spell literally exploded in front of them, sending them clattering to the sand in a messy heap.

  Dumbledore flicked his wand again.

  Sirius and Snape were back on their feet, hastily exchanging a few words, no doubt planning another attack, when the wave took them. One of the gentle, foot-high waves that had been lapping peacefully at the shore all morning spouted up to a ten-foot monstrosity with a frothing, scary-looking crest and rushed up the beach, crashing over the beleaguered duelists. Instead of washing away, the water remained, trapping them. Dumbledore took careful aim and waved his wand in a complicated motion. The water started collapsing in on itself, twisting, turning, contorting itself into thin lines.

  A few seconds later, Sirius and Snape were trussed up in ropes of living water, breathing hard and completely immobilized.

  The whole thing had taken less than thirty seconds, and Harry was pretty sure that had been for his benefit, that if Dumbledore had wanted to, he could have done it in three seconds. It was on another level altogether. Every move, calculated. Every defense, an attack at the same time. Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.

  "You see," said Remus, "you'll never learn to do /that/ if you set out by learning how to fight. Aurors are specialists. You narrow your focus that much, and you eventually start limiting yourself in some pretty serious ways. Be a generalist, Harry. Dumbledore's a generalist. If you only learn about magic that helps you fight, you'll get good at it, no question. And faster, too. With the head start that you've got, if you start learning to duel, you could probably take any student at Hogwarts by the end of the year."

  Harry watched as Dumbledore dispelled the water-ropes, going over to the downed combatants, exchanging words with them, joking, laughing. He didn't look at all intimidating.

  "But," continued Remus, "if you learn about everything, if you cast a wide net, if you embrace magic as a whole, if you leave no stone unturned... things will be slow. By the end of the year, you might not even be noticeably stronger at all. But there will come a time when something will click. You'll understand something, see some kind of order in the chaos, some fundamental truth. It clicked for Dumbledore when he was a third year. It clicked for your mother when she was out of Hogwarts and engaged to James. And I firmly believe that if she were alive right now, she'd give Dumbledore a run for his money."

  Remus stood, and rested a hand on Harry's shoulder for a moment. "Be a generalist, Harry. It's the harder road, the longer road, but you have it in you. I've seen it. You put in the time, you make an honest effort, and you'll be an /absolute nightmare/ on the battlefield. Trust me."

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

*** This somewhat reminds me of Fortnite. In the beginning, people would mainly engage in gunfights and build walls every now and then for cover. Then people started learning rapid build strategies and were creating towers and forts while fighting. The playstyle completely changed and it was all about outsmarting your opponent by creating an environment that favors you. The gunfights on their own are just people jumping around shooting at each other. It's when people can build like pros that you can see some really interesting plays and strategies and the skill ceiling of the game increased so much.
