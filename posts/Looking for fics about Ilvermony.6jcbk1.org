** Even one where Harry goes there instead of Hogwarts and gets sorted into Wampus would be cool.

** Alexandra Quick series sort of qualifies. Maybe. It is really good if you haven't read it. Was written prior to Ilvermony being named, or really there being any info about Magical America so it has a ton of its own world building. Its Magical America has multiple schools, none of which are called Ilvermony, but it does have the protagonist go to a magical school in America.
