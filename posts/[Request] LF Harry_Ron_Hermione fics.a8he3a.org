Oddly enough, it's a pairing I don't often see. For some reason I'm in the mood for it. Are there any decent fics with the trio together? Pure smut is fine, but I'd prefer something with a decent story. M rating is definitely preferred, but if the fic is super good I'd be willing to put up with a T rating that just has suggestive scenes instead of explicit. Thanks!

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
