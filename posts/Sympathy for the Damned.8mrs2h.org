Fics that portray the Dursleys in a sympathetic light.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4897423/1/It-Was-All-For-My-Family][It Was All For My Family]] - Centered around Vernon Dursley and his attempts to keep a magical child contained without any magic of his own. Seriously, check it out and you will be left in shocked horror at just how /reasonable/ it all seems.

.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] - admittedly the Dursleys don't have a lot of air time in this one but there are moments early on where it seems likely that they had another child, and when that child was killed by magic they were made to forget. Nicely highlights just how massive the power disparity is between muggles and magicals. (Seriously, a magical dating a mundane is just so incredibly creepy).

.

It's hard to judge if the Dursleys get a bad rep. They are definitely neglectful towards Harry but it seems a little wibbly just how bad they actually are. They probably didn't beat him bloody, or really starve him even if he didn't get as much as he needed. And while it's very easy to come down on them it is possible they had been threatened with horrible magical torture to ensure their compliance, or have been exposed to magic in other extremly hostile fashions. Thinking about all of their encounters with magic in the books... Harry puts their child in a snake cage, Hagrid disfigures Dudley (for literally no real reason), Harry attacks clients with magical cake, the Weasleys destroy part of their house, Harry blows up Marge, Weasleys blow up the living room (they came via floo in the... 4th book?), Weasleys maim Dudley with magical tongue engorgement... the list goes on, the more I think on it the more examples I find. Hard to have a positive outlook on magic when it is only ever used to harm you and your family.

.

Anybody got some other recs?


** I completely disagree. The Dursleys are not victims or misunderstood they are child abusers. Regardless of whatever magic can or can't do Harry was an innocent child. Petunia is aware of magic. This is her nephew, he is family. Whatever ill will she had towards Lily should pass away once she realizes that not only was she murdered, but her child is orphaned. A decent human being would not then proceed to abuse that child for the next 14 years.

All of the examples you mention would not have occurred if they treated him like a *human being* rather than a piece of trash. His parents died in a car crash, his father was a drunkard and his mother was a whore? Cmon now. Who says that to a child?

Only the righteous seek justice, the damned seek revenge.

TLDR: The Dursley's are trash and abused an innocent child. No sympathy.

*** "Hi Petunia, remember your estranged Sister? Well, turns out she was murdered by an incredibly powerful and incredibly evil wizard. Here's her son, the reason why she was murdered. Oh! Beeteedubs, the murderer is still out there, probably, and the police would be laughably incapable of defending you. If he does get to you, he'll probably make you eat your own son before torturing you into insanity. Hmm, what else? Oh yeah, Harry will probably start up the accidental magic soon, so if he lights you or your house on fire that's perfectly normal, nothing to worry about. Although if anyone else finds out it might lead the murderer or his legion of fanatically devoted henchmen, most of whom escaped jail time, right to your door step. Last thing, if you or any of your neighbors complain, we'll just mind-rape you into forgetting about it. Don't try to contact us if you have a problem. Toodles!"

And that's all ignoring potential factors like horcrux influence or straight up Dumbledore meddling. You'll note at no point did I use the word 'justifiable' in the OP. Saying there were a lot of causes for the rise of Nazisim doesn't mean that Nazis weren't evil. I am looking for fics that postulate excuses, not proclaiming the Dursleys were innocent of all wrongdoing.

**** What makes it worse is that we don't even know what was in the note Dumbledore left for Petunia (was there actually a note in canon? Or am I just head-canoning that?). For all we know it was some cryptic Gandalf shit and the Dursleys spent the next three years imagining all the ways their lives could be threatened based on what little Petunia remembered from Lily's stories and Petunia's interactions with Snape. Not a strong foundation for building trust in the Wizarding World.

***** The whole situation is just all kinds of fucked up. They left Harry on their /fucking doorstep/. What century is this supposed to be? Petunia literally found him when she went to get the milk bottles! Not even an actual, sit down and we'll talk about your new responsibilities courtesy!

****** To be completely fair, the people involved in that situation are a hundred year old eccentric old man who works in a job actively trying not to play favorites (good job), a sixty year old woman who seemingly stays in character as a cat for extended periods of time, and a human-giant hybrid who, among other things, spent an extended amount of time partying it up with the dementors.

In retrospect, its kind of amazing things went relatively well. Any number of problems could have come up from all this. And not just the generic "Harry is taken from the doorstep after being left there" either. What if muggles had seen Hagrid flying a motorcycle halfway across Britain (12 foot tall giant riding a motorcycle is not exactly subtle) and this ends up breaking the statute of secrecy or revealing Harry's location? What if some group wanted to get ahold of Harry and just used simple methods to lure him out of the house (to many to name in HP universe)? What if anybody who met him just spilled the beans and said "your a wizard," and saved a lot of time (can anyone say "Dedalus Diggle")?

** Not sure if they're exactly what you are looking for, as they're more actively changing the Dursleys' treatment from Harry a little, but I'd like to recommend the following fics anyway:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4670484/1/No-Thank-You][No Thank You]] - Oneshot about what if the Dursleys had treated Harry well?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832676/1/Petunia-s-Boys][Petunia's Boys]] - It's more of a "good Dursleys" kind of story, with quite a few tropes and other possibly cringey stuff inside, but I admit I still really like reading it because it's so rare to have nice Dursleys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5165369/1/My-Nephew-Harry][My Nephew Harry]] - More canonical Dursleys (just from a certain point of view), also some part of their actions is explained and although it's actually more about Marge than Petunia and Vernon for me it still felt strongly like it could fit with their canon personalities too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12227738/1/World-s-Best-Mum][World's best Mum]] - This one actually fits your request best I think, as it's an insight about what Petunia might have went through to become who she was when raising Harry and Dudley like she did. Although it is very short.

Also there is this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11456392][Proud]] which seemed to keep Vernon somewhat in character really, despite a slightly changed backstory again, but I haven't finished reading it yet, so not sure how it turns out in the end.

Not sure if they're all your cup of tea, but maybe you'll find some you'll like. :)

** Idk if this really fits your request, but I thought the Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady did a good job of explaining the Dursley's side of things, without excusing it in any way. It's one of the only stories I've seen (including canon) that treats them like real people instead of caricatures. You can see why they made the choices they did, and that they aren't /irrational monsters,/ but that their treatment of Harry was still abusive and not okay. I think it also does a fantastic job showing the realistic consequences Harry's upbringing would have on him.

The series has 4 complete installments, and BrilliantLady only has 2-3 chapters to finish writing before she'll start releasing the 5th.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".
