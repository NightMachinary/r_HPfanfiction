** I would spontaneously say the Lone Traveler stories. They're very much an episodic format, but taken together they show a Harry Potter that's confronted with all kinds of situations in different locations while he travels the multiverse. The idea was originally conceived by /The Professional/ but was later also taken up by /dunuelos/, who is still expanding it.

linkffn(2673584;5751435) plus a list of longer episodes by /dunuelos/ that I haven't linked.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.
