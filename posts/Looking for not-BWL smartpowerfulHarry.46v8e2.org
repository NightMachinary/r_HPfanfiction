** You might like linkao3(The Art of Self Fashioning).

WIP but updates weekly. I really look forward to the updates, the writing is great and I think it's one of the more original fics I've read in a while.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** linkffn(7724057)

Harry is very smart (I would say a genius) and is not evil. There is a bit of Harry/Fleur and a fair bit of Quidditch. He is not recognized as the BWL.

** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), is imho the most enjoyable non-BWL Harry story. It contains some serious politics, intrigues, strategies, and war scenes. Voldemort is still the main antagonist and even stronger than in canon, but Harry is more than a match for him.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Have you read Cadmean Victory? While Harry is the BWL, it is fairly similar to Knowledge is Power. Plus, it satisfies your other primary criteria. On optional criteria, it has H/F and Harry, though he is not a dick, becomes sort of indifferent to others.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** I just finished this and wanted to thank you. It was one of the best fanfictions i've read so far.

I'm always torn when it comes to stories like this one but it's a little hard to explain...

Basically i really, really dislike it when reading something makes me as incredibly sad as this story did.

I spent my puberty with books that got me away from the confusing and cruel real world (as seen by a depressed teenager) and therefore formed an attachment to stories that made me happy.

A few bumps are always to be expected, obviously but generally the stories i liked had happy endings and were often divided into simple good and evil. I know that kind of thing isn't the epitome of literature and i've since read different kind of books but i've always had this attachment to these 'fluffy' (for lack of a better term) stories.

Now my problem is that i know that the stories are generally better if they get these negative emotions i loath out of me and i truly /want/ to read those stories but i also kinda don't want to feel the emotions that come with them...

Ughh i've made a mess of explaining this and i'm really just ranting. I think i just needed to get some of this off my chest.

Sorry for bothering you with my emotional drivel :D
