Wherein instead of his twin brother and parents being usually portrayed as these incompetent scumbags who don't deserve to live, Harry is the actual asshole. And it shows in the story with how Harry behaves around people and that's why people don't like Harry.

He has to be smart and amoral if possible.


** I was thinking the other day I'd like to read a wrong BWL where Harry is the one his parents dote on and is the fake BWL.

** The problem is, in most WBWL fics, while his parents and sibling are incompetent or idiotic in most ways, Harry is still a condescending, arrogant jackass, who's only the hero because the author says so.

** The Denarian Renegade trilogy has Harry as a complete and utter asshole, but he is still the BWL.

*** Wouldn't call Harry an asshole in this fic. He actually cares for his family and his brother. Also, it's been a while since I read it so I'm not sure if he is BWL.

**** Definite not the BWL.

He's an asshole to Ron though. It's hilarious how Harry hates him.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
