Well, it's been a while. Almost exactly a year since my last post, but I felt this was a good time to get back in the swing of things. Partially Kissed Hero is on the list to read, to make a proper review of it, but I don't know when I'll get to it - I certainly won't be doing it chapter by chapter like I tried last time, that was torture.

I've read a fair few fics in the meantime, most of them over on SB or SV rather than FF, but quite a lot of them from other fandoms. For some quick thoughts if anyone is interested - Shapes is fairly new, but an amazing read if you don't mind heavy AU elements, Fem!Harry, and reading incomplete fics. Shedding Lionskin, by the same author (BeaconHill) and with more or less the same warnings, is frankly amazing and everything I wanted since I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/18/The-random-craziness-file][this snippet]] about a Harry fucking around with metamorph abilities and a time turner way back in far-away 2017.

For Want of an Outfit has an interesting premise, that being Petunia making Harry wear Lily's old clothes because she's cheap and things diverging wildly from there, but it tends slightly too much towards generic fix-fic territory for my tastes. Spells in Silence was another fic I loved, for its portrayal of the natural, old magical world, both in Britain and outside, and the discriminated populace and their trouble - highly recommend giving that one a try, definitely among my most favorite of all time. James Stormcaller and the Walnut Court had a similar feel to it, though it veers much more into AU territory rather than exploring canon-adiacent stuff like SiS. Not like that's a bad thing, the author definitely put a lot of thought into making lore for that.

Something Wicked This Way Comes, which came highly praised, was something of a disappointment. I remember liking Jamie Evans, from the same author, but I've read it so long ago that all I really remember from that was Hedwig becoming an harpy and the last confrontation with DumbleWald. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I knew the Disgaea/Silent Hill stuff, but as it is it started relatively strong and gradually became a mess the further along it got.

Looking again at this list, half of them are some degree Fem!Harry. I don't know if that says something about my tastes, that those are the fics I remember liking the most, or if it's just a matter of me not looking in the right places. Looking at the list of what I read since last May, most other things I read were either abandoned shortly after their start, frankly mediocre, uninteresting things like generic SIs, or oneshots. I'm not going to talk about oneshots, even good ones, unless they are absolutely amazing.

But you haven't clicked on this post to read me waxing about fanfiction, just for me to wax about /one specific fanfiction/. So let's get to that.

* 2. Where I actually talk about the fic in question, without spoilers

  :END:
Alright, let's get the general information out of the way first. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary][Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary]], by 'The madness in me', is a completed fic, topping at 72k words divided in about 100 chapters of varying, generally pretty short, length. It can quite easily be read in the span of an afternoon - I started it yesterday evening, got 3/4 of the way in and finished it this morning. It's an easy read, the grammar is generally fine beside the occasional typo (typical stuff, like 'parseltounge'), and it doesn't overstay its welcome, which is a breath of fresh air after the sea of unfinished stuff.

It has a short companion fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925425/1/Secret-potions-club][Secret potions club]], which I have not read. It's not necessary for the main fic, and I was satisfied enough by it that I didn't feel the need to go looking for more.

It is, for the most part, centered around Diary!Tom and written from his perspective, though in the latter parts it mixes in more external PoVs.

In case the title didn't make it clear enough, this is an AU where the Diary is found by Luna before it could mess with Ginny's mind. It focuses, then, on the relationship between Luna and the little Tommy Horcrux.

It's a fairly lighthearted fic all in all, don't go in expecting possessed Luna or something like that. Very humorous, I actually thought it was light crack before the plot actually start to kick in - which I would have known, if I had actually read the author's synopsis that specifically says that.

In my defense, I was reading the first fic on my to-read pile on my phone and didn't particularly care what it was.

* 3. Where I actually talk about the fic in question, now with added spoilers
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
First of all, should you actually read this fic? Yes, it's pretty good. If you don't want to be spoiled, go do that.

It has a lot going for it. The premise is interesting enough to catch the eye, it has a really satisfying narrative arc about personal growth for not one, but three different characters, and I would recommend it on the sheer novelty factor of what happens with Pettigrew alone.

The only real drawback to it, in my opinion, are the early chapters. It does way too good a job at establishing a mildly cracky tone with the interactions between Tom and Luna, so much that when the shift to more serious plot stuff happens it feels a tad off.

Not to say they aren't good fun, but having Tommy try to trick Luna into cruciating her bullies only really makes sense if the story is crack and we aren't meant to take it seriously. It is pretty funny though.

The shift in tone happens when things finally come to a head, and Tom has to confess (this time seriously, as the first time Luna had taken it as a joke) to actually being Lord Voldemort. She doesn't take this well, especially since Tom has been coordinating with Voldemort Prime for both their resurrections (this happens in GoF). On the other hand, Luna has managed to sway Tom enough to put him against his future, insane self - with the help of Fred and George, who became aware of Luna when she asked them for help with pranking her bullies on Tom's suggestion, and Snape, who mostly got roped into it because he's the head of their Secret Potions Club, they make a plan to weaken the resurrected Lord Voldemort and at the same time finally get Tommy a new body.

By splashing the Dark Lord with a vaguely defined potion that does... I'm not quite sure. They didn't really explain that part.

Still, the plan works - Voldemort Prime has been weakened despite being resurrected (the whole plan with Crouch Jr. taking Moody's place was scrapped, as Tom called it insane when they were actually coordinating), and Tom now has a body.

They manage to get Dumbledore to help, after convincing him Tom was genuine about wanting a second chance at life, and Dumbledore and Snape fight and defeat the weakened Voldemort and Crouch, who are captured and sent to Azkaban while Tom lives his life happy with his friends.

The end.

Except not really. I mean, that's more or less the end, but there is a lot that went unsaid in that synopsis.

One thing that I really like about it, for example, is that Tom and Luna's relationship is entirely platonic. Yes, you heard me right, this is not a story where the evil, misguided person is seduced back into the light by +sex+ love.

Friendship is where it's at. It's really nice to see a redemption story that doesn't have romance in it.

As an aside, Luna is a great character. While writing this, I realized more and more that Luna doesn't particularly change during the course of the story - what she does, is affect change on the characters around them. Tom is saved from his anger through his friendship with her, and Snape too becomes a better person, leaving behind his grudge against Sirius in a startling act of maturity, even at his own expense. It reminds me of a video essay I saw a while ago, about static character arcs.

Snape should probably get more than a mention, especially since the author straight up says he's one of their favorite characters. And it shows.

While Tom is undoubtedly the main character of this fic and the one to change the most from start to finish, Snape is definitely second place on that list. I wouldn't say that he's been given a fresh coat of white paint, but it's also true that we don't really see the worst of him at any point. Generally, when Harry is the focus of a fic, it's really easy to show Snape's worst traits - but here they are not in the foreground, and a bit of re-contextualization of some bad-looking events, definitely helps in showing him in a better light.

He has a lot of great moments in this fic. When Neville is being menaced by Lupin's unrestrained transformation, he jumps in to protect him without a second thought. When he's given the opportunity to take revenge and really fuck over Sirius, by letting him get arrested with Crouch and Voldemort, he doesn't take it - even better, having to evacuate Sirius meant he couldn't take the credit for the Dark Lord's defeat, something that he apparently was /really/ looking forward to.

So yeah, he starts a bit better than you would normally see in a more Harry-centric fic, but the end-goal is so nice to see that I can't fault the author for it. It was very nice to read.

​

One of the things I really like about this fic, is that you can count the characters with your hands. Tom, Luna, Fred and George, Snape, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Crouch Jr. and Pettigrew. Rolf Scamander too, if you want to count him. Observant readers may notice the conspicuous lack of some fairly important people in that list.

Like, where is Harry? Why is Pettigrew an important character, without Sirius or Remus to contrast him? Other Horcruxes, Moody, the peeps from the Order, Malfoy Senior, Bellatrix, Fudge, where are all those people?

Those characters are not all completely absent from the story - only mostly so. Harry, for example, is mentioned a couple times at the start, in the more cracky chapters, and has a role during the part where Snape goes to weaken Voldemort, by providing his invisibility cloak.

Unwillingly.

Because Harry, in this fic, barely matters. He got kidnapped by Crouch and used for the resurrection ritual, then got saved by Snape, but that's all off screen. We don't see any of that, we are told it because it advances the plot. The only part where Harry actually does anything, is when the potions club decides, instead of going to Dumbledore and handing him little diary Tom, to plan a dangerous mission to weaken the newly resurrected Dark Lord. They call in the trio to ask for Harry's invisibility cloak, Hermione starts threatening to go to Dumbledore if they don't tell them what's going on, they get stunned and bound until the thing is done. Harry has maybe two or three lines in the entire fic, it's great.

I've made a few mentions now, about how Pettigrew has an important role in this fic. Now is the time for the dramatic reveal, that I have carefully not mentioned anything important about him yet so that you could be surprised. Surprise.

His role in the story is a bit strange. He first appears right before the plot starts to turn more serious, in what would have been Prisoner of Azkaban - there we're told that he has been looking for Diary Tom the whole year, checking every student's belonging, because he was aware of its importance because he used to eavesdrop on other Death Eaters with his animagus form.

Tom entrusts him with one of his pages, which he uses to communicate with him, and starts directing him towards making him a new body. At this point, Luna had already promised him to help him with that, but he was feeling a bit neglected, so he jumped at the occasion. Pettigrew eventually makes contact with Crouch and Babymort, and they start coordinating.

When Tom and Voldie have a falling out, because Tom cares more about Luna than that guy's insane ravings, Tom and Pettigrew go one way, and Voldie and Crouch go the other. Snape then potions Voldie, which weakens him and restores Tom to corporeality, blah blah blah.

The important thing to note here, is that Tom treats Pettigrew like shit. It doesn't matter that Peter could easily run away - his only point of contact here is a scrap of paper, it would be trivial to toss it and disappear. Tom is still a sadistic piece of shit, even if contact with Luna has mellowed him out a lot, and it's nowhere near as evident as in how he treats his only follower.

So he threatens, berates, orders him around, but Peter still follows him. He takes it all without running away, even when Tom tells him to go back to Hogwarts while Sirius was there looking for him.

Throughout the fic, you kind of have to wonder where it's going to go with it. It's weird how much we take it for granted that when Pettigrew shows up in a fic, the assumption is that he'll go to prison, so that Black can be free - and that's a good thing.

Peter, in this fic, is a tragic figure. A backstory is given towards the end, to tie off the last few knots left waving in the breeze. Of how he started off as a spy in the enemy camp, only to find himself too deep in without an out, and how the constant exposure to prejudice and rhetoric warped him into committing evil acts. He was young and stupid.

If I had to compare him to someone, Snape is who comes to mind. They have a similar story of radicalization to the dark side, followed by tragedy and regret. But while Snape's story ends well for him, Pettigrew's does not.

He does go to Azkaban to clear Sirius' name. Of his own volition. It doesn't feel nearly as good as it usually does.

* 4. Last thoughts

Well, that was a downer.

Should you read this fic? Again, yes, probably. The start is a bit cracky, but when the plot comes around it's really good.

There is a very cute piece of fan-art made for this fic, which the author linked in the last chapter. I'll re-link it here, save you the hassle of having to rebuild the scattered link. You may want to wait until you're a bit into the story before looking at it, since it could spoil you on who the main supporting cast will be, but [[https://twitter.com/rousaro/status/1264620484915683334][here]].

This ended up being much longer than I thought it would be. At first I thought I would have to pad it a bit, which was why I wrote that mostly irrelevant first section, but I'm pretty happy with the end result. I'll link my previous reviews here, at least the two I'm actually at least vaguely proud of writing - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ebv6rt/a_subjective_review_of_core_threads/][Core Threads]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fa4r2f/a_subjective_review_of_the_archeologist/][The Archeologist]] - I'm not going to link the aborted attempt at reviewing Partially Kissed Hero, since I plan to make another, more complete and concise try at that one.

This is unarguably the most positive review I've written. I don't know how to feel about that, considering I probably derived more enjoyment from reading The Archeologist, but there was simply less negative things to say about this one.

Well, see ya, hopefully sooner than next year this time. Any kind of discussion or criticism of this post is very welcome.


** Can you link Shapes, For Want of an Outfit, and the other fics you mentioned in section 1? Some of those sounded interesting.
