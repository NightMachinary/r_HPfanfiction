*** Would they all be adults? Lily Luna is at most 10 when the epilogue happens so Harry is 36-37 at that time. Give it 10 years so LL is 20, Harry is 46-47, and at best Lily could only be 20 or so if they go back to visit her.

Maybe 18ish Lily picks up "dad" at/near/just after the end of book 7 (to be her approx age) and then they both go back to when Lily was their age.

Or maybe Lily is sent forward in time and Lily Luna is sent back to when Harry was in school?

I am really overthinking this. Sorry.

**** Well, Passageways is garbage, so that's not saying much. Turning of the Sun is decent, though the author tends to get sidetracked with nonsense, like randomly spending chapters trying to explain why Merlin was in Slytherin (right after it was said on Pottermore) despite it not being relevant at all.

***** The author is writing it for his godson to enjoy; we read it as a consequence of that so keep that in mind.

I pmed the author complaining about how often the characters seemed to whisper and his replied saying that he wrote it like that purposefully because his godson has vocal cord problems and has to whisper. I felt quite admonished.

** linkffn(12317784) is a relatively new fic that I have been really enjoying. It's Harry/Bella and I find the plot to be rather original from the other fics that I have read.

If anybody has a good Lily pairing feel free to leave them here please. I don't think that I have ever managed to find a good one

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
