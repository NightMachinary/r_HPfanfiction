So I've recently started reading a fic on FanFiction.net called Tethered by kittenshift17. It has Hermione bringing Harry's parents and James's parents back from the dead through a ritual in the department of mysteries. It's a WIP and updates are sporadic. I'm looking for a good “Harry's parents return” fic. Preferably complete. Also if you haven't read Tethered i definitely recommend it


** Well, there's this one I read like a year ago, but didn't finish (not a fan of H/Hr)

Its called linkffn(The Last Casualties) or something like that.

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr

** Hmm, if you don't mind an AU based on an AU, then Truth Amid the Lies may scratch the itch. It's part of the Dangerverse series; pretty well known story of Harry being raised by Remus and Sirius and their OC wives (one of whom is an who Hermione's older sister, along with raising Draco and Sirius's fictional daughter. The main series is pretty convoluted and strange but this story is Lily and James coming back when Harry is still young and before things get too weird.

Honestly after writing it out I don't know how well it would be as a stand alone but you can give it a shot and if it's terrible don't feel bad about abandoning it. The main series is my guilty pleasure read, not the best but not the worst.

  Complete! AU, based in Dangerverse but stands alone. They were not killed that night, but cursed forward in time five years. Now their son is missing, along with almost all their living friends, and the only one left tells reporters she knows nothing...
