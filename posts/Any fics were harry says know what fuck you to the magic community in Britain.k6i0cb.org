Bonus points if harry either loses his magic to the goblet or he leaves to live a peaceful life while both side of the war try to find him


** There was one where Harry left England after his name got out of the cup, but it was Barty's magic who got tied to the cup, so Harry was not deprived of his magic.

He went to Spain with Sirius, they transfererd all their wealth from Gringotts to a vampire owned bank, and every one in England started hating Harry, calling him a coward.

Cedric got it very bad in the tournament, while Fleur and Victor started working together in order to get out alive and unarmed. And Voldemort got desperate because everyone was hatting the Chosen One, something he hadn't planned at all since he felt it was depriving him of the opportunity to kill the "wizarding world heroe".

Can't remember the tittle, and can't find it either. If someone knows what fic it is, thank you in advance.

  A fourth year fic. Harry is stuck in something he doesn't want to be in, Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Voldemort wants Harry dead, the school hates him...sounds like every year right? Well this year Hermione has a brilliant idea (or more than one) and her idea(s) change Harry's life, her life, and a big black dog's life too. AU and no idea which genre to put this under.
