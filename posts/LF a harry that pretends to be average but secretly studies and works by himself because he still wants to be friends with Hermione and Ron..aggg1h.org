Just looking for a fic where harry studies in the shadows and improves himself but doesnt tell his friends because he is scared if losing them.

Bonus points if ron and hermione find out and still accept him because they are friends and that is what friends are like

:)


** linkffn(10449375) This series has exactly what you're looking for, except that Harry does it because it's an ingrained habit from living with the Dursleys rather than him being scared of losing his friends.

*** This immediately came to mind for me as well. The series is quite trope-y but manages to be quite unique all the same and is overall a fantastic read. Couldn't put it down.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100][Perfectly Normal Series]] by BrilliantLady sort of has that. It's not really about Ron and Hermione though, more about the Dursley's.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?

*** I was definitely bullied for doing my homework properly and raising my hand in class to participate. I actually got laughed at for explaining that I'm bored just sitting there and would rather not waste my time if I have to be there anyways.

It's pretty normal.

****** Yes except when I didn't WANT freaking compliments or to do work so I yelled at people and also threw stuff. Then I got moved to the OTHER OTHER room and I was upset. But not really because it was really quiet and nice in there so I just drew stuff and chewed my rubber bands. :) You should eat rubber bands too if bullying gets you super upset and stressed! It's super de-stressing and tastes good.

When I am stressed or upset I do chew rubber bands and paperclips, and it makes me not stressed and lots more calm and happy. It is called sensory stimulation. :)
