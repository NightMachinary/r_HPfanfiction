:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay I barely remember anything. I think it was harry/severus but I'm not 100% on that. I think it was Dumbledore bashing, I remember a scene in the wizengamot and Dumbledore had promised harry to someone else in order for their help with the war or something. They were either a different species like an elf or a special type of wizard? I remember the hid invisible in the wizengamot but harry could see them, I think they had a tattoo or marking on their face. They were very angry with dumbledore because harry was already bonded to someone else (severus I think). Please help of you can!


** I'm pretty sure this is Haunted Jaded Eyes
