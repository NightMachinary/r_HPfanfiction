I remember a story where for some reason or another Harry is interacting with fleur's family and her parents really like him. Bill is kinda rough around the edges and doesn't put much effort in and eventually Fleur leaves him.

I am also looking for a story where there is a reoccurring wine tasting subplot with the delecours. I thought it was hope by jerconias, but I feel like it is another.


** I think this is the one you're talking about? Harry tries to help Bill with Mr. Delacour but gets angry and breaks it off. It also has wine tasting bonding to it. If you could could give me a bit more details on it I'm sure I could narrow it down.

I don't recall the Bill subplot, but that one definitely has the wine tasting.
