Dumbledore stole from him, the Weasleys drugged him, the wizarding world threw him in Azkaban, whatever. People were jerks of the highest caliber and he decides he wants to fix that.

Slash, Crossovers and dark!Harry are fine. Please no romance/smut-centric plots, harems, genderbending, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!

*** I tried reading Nightmare Man. Stopped. Read the prequel, and stopped around 70k words in.

Now that I think about it, I'm rather ashamed of myself. Nightmare Man is messed up, but I've read far more brutal fanfics in their entirety.

Will have another go.

**** If you wish to torture yourself, feel free. I'd suggest reading lulu42's path of decision, though, instead. The ending wasn't what i expected and the grammar is abysmal and pov shifts make it a bit annoying but it's a lot better than that.

*** awww I was going to rec that one

advice to OP though, you might want to read linkffn(11131988) which is the WIP prequel first, as it really goes into the bashing of characters etc

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
