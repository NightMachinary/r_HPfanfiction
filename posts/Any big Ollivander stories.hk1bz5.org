I've read some wonderful one-shots about Ollivander, wand lore galore, but are there any good novel length stories with Ollivander as the main character? Or at the very least a major character?


** Whole series linkffn(6297946,6882687), and of course nobody should ignore [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]].

  (Formerly titled The Ollivanders) Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming abundantly clear that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (I say which chapters are my best at the start of Chapter 1.)

** shameless self-promotion, but I do have a young Ollivander feature prominently in my story: linkffn(13626044). There's also some wand creation and runes in it. There will be more magical theory as Harry learns more though :)

  During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry falls into a cabinet of time turners sending him back in time to the 19th century. Stranded in the past, with a war against Grindelwald looming ahead, Harry must decide his allegiances before it's too late... GenFic, adventure in war, friendships.

** When you say 'Big Ollivander'... do you mean a fic where Ollivander is hung down there?
