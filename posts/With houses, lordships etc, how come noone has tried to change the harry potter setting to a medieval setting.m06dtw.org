Just something I thought about. Don't get me wrong, I have no issue with fanfiction doing the earl, lord, noble houses etc thing. I think it's a cool way to explore the magical world. I'm just curious why noone has thought to take the harry potter story (rewrite or AU) and send it back to the middle ages, where this kind of stuff truelly had much more meaning than it does in 1990s


** I read a fic where Harry was transported to the past and lived out a life as Salazar Slytherin's brother before coming back, and I've read some fairytale AU fics that would've taken place in medieval times.

** Because most people don't understand the true meaning of lordship and nobility. If you focus when reading nobility fics, you will find that the duties of a lord are basically to attend the wizengamot, manage a couple of investments, ignore a couple of estates, and strut around waving a ring in front of everyone's faces. So few of them understand the concepts of feudal society, like protecting and honoring your sworn men, owning and managing your fiefs, which is the largest source of income for a feudal lord, and lastly fulfilling you obligations to your liege, by fealty and taxes, and your sworn men, by protection.

A way to implement this during the current Harry Potter setting is for example to have muggleborns swear their services to noble houses after graduation, as administrators or warriors and in return they would be housed and fed in one of the many estates owned by the nobility. This way if lets say Voldemort gains the allegiance of House Malfoy, then he won't just get the three Malfoys, but also any retainers sworn to them. In addition, this will model will help in explaining the need for a life debt and a lord having many wives. This is because more wives means more children, and these children will grow up to bolster the ranks of their family, increasing their influence and power. Take the Weasleys for example, they were the biggest contributors to the order in terms of man power, providing about eight or nine members( depending on Charlie) to the order.

*** I have no self control.

The protagonist would be a muggleborn wizard, to best display the feudal aspect. He is the third son of a muggle knight errant. In this AU, knights are basically just soldiers, with Wizards and Witches taking the place their place. As the son of a knight, he was expected to take become a knight himself.

Also, magic is a good bit stronger than in cannon, because this is a high fantasy setting.

MC's father is a faliure of a knight, and embarressingly bad at fighting, though he is very ambitious, and willful. Since no matter how hard he trained, he never got any better than a slightly less than mediocre knight. So, he decided to put his hopes on his children. Unfortunately, both his first and second born sons inherited his clumsiness. Then the Blood Wars happened, and he saw Voldemort's Giants in action, and realized that a half giant would be exactly what he wanted.

So, the man seduced a female giant. He may be a shit fighter, but he is very good looking. And so, MC was born.

As a half giant, MC is already naturally predisposed to physical combat. So, as soon as he was big enough to hold a sword, he was taught to fight. And he was good at it, due to being a half giant. Unfortunately, he was a little dim. His oldest brother is a librarian, and his other brother a priest, so the worst of it was mitigated, but he was still pretty simplistic. In story, this comes off as charming, like a puppy.

Then MC got his Hogwarts letter. His father dropped his teaching of combat, and made him spend all his time practicing magic. MC did not like this. He enjoyed knight training, because he was good at it, and it was fun. He did not like magic training because he was bad at it.

The Knight Errant did this because a sufficiently skilled wizard can slay giants by the dozen(Dumbledore). Which he knows because, right after he saw giants for the first time, he saw Dumbledore kill them all, using conjured projectiles.

Also, as a wizard, MC can become a land owner, and gain more political power and respect than a knight ever could.

So, MC goes to Hogwarts, and gets sorted into Hufflepuff. In this AU, Hogwarts only teaches three years, starting when the students would have done 6th year in cannon, with the rest of the teaching suposed to be done by private tutors. This is because if it taught all 7 years, it would give too much power to the muggleborn chaff.

Unfortunately, he gets bullied by Slytherin upper years, since MC is a 'dumb giant' and an easy targt. One day, they push a little too hard, and MC lashes out, killing one accidentally, through a blow to the head.

So, the father could have had MC executed for this, because, as a half-giant, he has basically no rights. But, he demanded Trial by Combat, so he could legally torture MC. But, again. MC spent most of his childhood being trained as a Knight.

So, in the fight, since it was a gloried judicial torturing session, the father uses spells like the Crucio on MC, rather than ending it immediately. Exept, as a half giant, the spells do less to him, because magical resistance. So, the guy got within grabbing range, and MC managed to get his hands on him, and his knight training kicked in.

Since fights between knights in full plate usually devolve into grappling matches, since swords can't get through full plate, MC was trained heavily on it. So, he puts in the moves, and the wizard, who was dressed in robes, and not armor, gets ganked.

Just to be clear, MC did not stand a chance from a distance. If his opponent had taken him seriously, he wouldn't have stood a chance.

But, it is what it is. MC won. And, since the other guy went in fully expecting an easy win, he decided to add a clause to the contract that gives all property owned by the loser to the victor. Meaning, MC is now a landed noble. A minor one, as the guy was a Baron, but a landed noble, none the less. Unfortunately, the Baron's wife was the second daughter of a Count.

So, the Count was pissed, and wanted MC dead for this. But, MC was good friends with Neville. Who is the only grandson of Augusta Longbottom, who is a powerful Duchess. So, Neville decides to stand up for MC, and used some of his power to get the count to back off.

Daphne saw this. She knows that Half-Giants are very rare, and are known wizard killers, up there with Dragons and such. Half-Giant wizards are even rarer, with only one other in living memory. Hagrid. Who was terrifying in the Blood War, and a well known war hero. His kill count is rumored to almost be as high as Dumbledore.

And he wasn't very exeptional. By giant standards, he is very small, and both his parents were known to be short, his father more than his mother. He had weak blood, and he was a drunken simpleton.

MC was already taller than Hagrid, and his father was a knight. So, he is likely to be much stronger. And in this AU, strength of arms is very important.

So, she decided to try and get MC to swear loyalty. Which wasn't very hard, as MC was a bit of a dumbass. Then, she got to work.

As the sole heir to an Earl, she wasn't the top of the food chain, but she did have some power to throw around. She arranged for MC to get the best tutors money can buy, and seducing Neville through MC. Which wasn't a part of her original plan, but Neville is the sole heir to a powerful Duchy, and he is pretty attractive, so it was more of a happy accident.

The thing is, Voldemort returned the year before MC arrived at Hogwarts, and he spent all of MC's first year preparing to go to war. So, the Second Blood War begun as MC's second year started.

As the sole property of House Dumbledore, it was under Dumbledore's protection. Making it the safest place in the known world. As such, every important heir, from the Crown Princess to the lowliest baron's son was allowed to stay under the aegis of Dumbledore.

So, now, the castle was filled with the next generation's most powerful people, and basicly became a political hellscape and battleground.

MC ended up making friends with the Crown Princess, since as a dumbass, he didn't recognize her, and greeted her as friendly as he would anyone else. They hit it off, and MC basicly became her best friend.

**** MC showed her how to fight without magic, because its was his favorite past time, and he figured if he had that much fun, so should she. As it turns out, Crown Princess has a lot of fun with it. 

Then, Neville looses his patience with just hanging out in the castle. As it turns out, he has been getting numbers, and near constant updates on the war, from his grandmother, and he got frustrated from not being able to help, while his people get slaughtered.

So, he gathers the most powerful fighters he knows, MC, Harry Potter, Hermione, Luna, Ron, The Twins, and a couple others, and mobilizes them. They sneak out, and start appearing at the various battles they can find as a mysterious third party. 

After their first battle, MC asks for enchanted gear, since, while he is a mediocre wizard, he is an amazing melee fighter. 

On the second battle, MC is a game changer, with enchanted gear. So, they decide to invest more time and effort into enchanting his gear. 

On the Third battle, MC does more damage than the entire rest of the group combined. 

Then, Ron gets the bright idea of equiping House Elves with magical, dissilliousioning them, and having them do most of the fighting, while having the members of their group pretend to be using magic to make this stuff happen.

So, they do that. After a few battles they realize that they do more damage as a symbol, through psychological warefare. 

So, they decide to go through this angle more. They make it so only two members and MC are visible at a time, and have the rest be dissilousioned.

This works, with them gathering a reputation as wizards on the same level as Dumbledore and Voldemort, and as increadibly myserious. 

Then, MC makes a mistake, and lets the identity of one of them slip to Crown Princess. Which leads to her being let in on the secret. So, since she very much approves of their actions, she decides to give them her support. 

She has several foreign master-crafters called in, sworn to secrecy, and then put to work in crafting them gear. 

This works. 

Until a spat of bad luck leaves MC alone at a battle, in between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Voldemort using an army of inferi, supported by two dozen giants, and Dumbledore using conjured and animated swords to fight them.  

As both expect MC to be their peer, and both consoder him an enemy. So, they don't hold back in fighting him, turning it into what they would expect to be a three way fight. 

MC has a house elf sitting on his shoulder, teleporting him around, to make sure he doesn't get instantly squashed. In a battle like this, this is pretty much all he can do. He only has a half dozen more house elves supporting him. So, he just avoids them. Exept, he can't be seen running. So, he just hangs around, doing damage when he can.

Until, Voldemort makes a stupid mistake. He stubs his toe on a rock. As a powerful wizard Voldemort isn't used to pain, so he stumbles. His army remains, so Dumbledore is distracted enough that he can't capitalize. But MC can. So, MC teleports in, and nails him in the head with his mace, splattering it all over the floor. Without Voldemort holding the army under control, they go crazy. 

So, they are all put down in short order, leaving it to a one on one duel between MC and Dumbledore. MC doesn't stand a chance, but, again, he has a reputation to maintain. So, he fights Dumbledore, using his overwhelming mobility to survive, culminating in Dumbledore losing an arm, but managing to nail MC with a stunner. MC's armor has a fail safe that teleports him away if he recieves sufficient damage, leaving behind an empty suit of armor. Getting stunned activates the failsafe, leaving behind a suit of armor.

With Voldemort being publicly killed, the war is over, and now Dumbledore needs to pick up the remains, and execute the remaining Death Eaters. 

The end. 

MC goes on to marry the Crown Princess, after being forced to slay a Nundu one on one to prove his worthiness. 

Daphne goes on to marry Neville. 

Dumbledore dies of old age.

Harry goes on to track down Voldemort's horcruxes, meeting his end at the cursed horcrux that fucked up Dumbledore in cannon, though he did manage to destroy it, before keeling over. 

England goes to war with France, after Fluer, their Queen, tried and failed to seduce MC out of pure spite to the Crown Princess. This spirals out of control, and basically becomes a world war.

This is definitely not my best work, and definitely needs to be reworked, but whatever. Its not like I will get graded on this, like I will the paper I should definitely be working on, instead of dicking around on reddit.

*** Oof that's unfortunate. I started some work on a fanfiction not too long ago, but I'm thinking of restarting and dropping the whole story into the middle ages because I think it would be very fun and interesting to write and read because it's something so few people have done. It will deff be challenging though because it would be a whole lot more research to get the smaller details correct and/or believable

Basically, dumbledore only plays the good guy. Grindelwald? Lover and worked for dumbledore. Riddle? Worked for dumbledore. Dumbles is the ultimate dark lord hiding in plain sight (kinda like emperor palpatine. I would be lying if said I didn't get the idea from that character) however, instead oh harry being my "luke skywalker" (for comparison purposes), harry will be more like the han solo, a very important character, but not the main character. The main character is my own OC. It will have a different "trio", and will /not/ involve horcruxes. However, voldy isn't dead. Over time grindelwald makes his way back onto the scene. So does voldemort. Around the middle to 3/4 through the story is when I have it planned for dumbledore to be shown as the true dark lord, master of grindelwald and voldy

As someone else said, some people might not like that I'm making an OC the main character instead of harry, but tbh I see nothing wrong with it. All it is, is seeing the story from a different point of view. And if they don't like it, IDC, as I'm primarily writing the story for myself, so people can like it or dislike it, it's not going to change my story in the slightest

** I think it would work great your need to do a lot of would building tho. You could take it the secrecy route or you could be more ambitious and go into magical feudalism with magic in the open and wizarding families acting similar to the great families in GoT. The muggles would be smallfolk and you could really take it down a path of just how fucked up the world would probably be like that because of the massive power disparity.

Imagine medieval battles but with wizards amongst the ranks and acting as generals, info would be faster and a single powerful wizard could probably fodder entire battalions but the muggles have to fight these battles because the need the lord for protection.

People from families of little renown fighting in tourneys using different magical sports to gain recognition from their lords.

The great families fighting for possession of strong up and coming mages because a Dumbledore fighting for you is worth countless men. Maybe the fall of some of the old houses with upstarts like Voldemort emerging.

This is just some stuff I've been thinking about for a little bit.
