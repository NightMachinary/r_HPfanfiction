Everyone knows JUST how much Weasley bashing happens in this fandom, and to Molly especially, so I'd really love some fics where she is cool and appreciated as I'm not sure that I've ever actually seen any. Thanks!


** There's an excellent one, but I can't remember the same - maybe someone else knows it.

She's dead in it, but her hedge magic allows her to leave an imprint. Percy is able to see them imprint, learn the magic and support his younger siblings.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** Harry thinks very highly of her indeed in Nightmares of Futures Past. Unfortunately FFN deleted it and wouldn't respond to the author trying to question their decision, but you can get a PDF from Github: [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10300874/1/Weary-Wizard][Weary Wizard]], she has a cameo where she approves and assists Harry and Hermione in vacating the premises - children should not fight wars. I thought it was pretty awesome.

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

*** That's almost certainly Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity, in which it is explained how it is that Molly took down Bellatrix Lestrange, one of Voldemort's most feared fighters. The trick is remembering that Molly Weasley, housewitch, used to be Molly Prewett, professional duellist.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]
