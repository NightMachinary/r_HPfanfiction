** The hands down best is linkffn(On The Way to Greatness). Mira mirth's writing is excellent.

I've been reading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spiteful Sorting Hat) lately. A bit canon rehashy, but still very good.

**** Spoilers for first like ten chapters

The Dursleys abuse him and then send him off to an orphanage, where he basically becomes Tom Riddle 2.0, complete with talking snakes and hurting other kids. He gets found by Death Eaters and they were about to kill him, but then they watch him talk to snakes and have his snake kill another kid and then they adopt him instead, so he's basically raised by Bellatrix.

**** James and Lilly aren't bashed in that fic. None of the "light" side characters are bashed. They are all good people who made a terrible mistake and then ended up being too late to fix it.

Also, Harry in that fic isn't 'evil' per se. He has some deeply rooted self esteem problems that made him vulnerable to Voldemort's manipulation, so he ends up doing some abhorent things.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - A WBWL series that runs along similar lines to Prince of Slytherin at the start. The fic starts in year 1 and mostly follows the stations of canon with some unique twists. It is 531k+ words long and is currently starting year 5. Frequently updated. Currently no pairings. Dumbledore and James are antagonists. linkao3(12608820)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] - Harry is resorted into Slytherin after being nearly killed by a few of his Gryffindor classmates in 5th year. 684k+ words long, it starts at the end of year 4 and is currently in the second semester of year 5.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
