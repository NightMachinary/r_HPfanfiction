Is always super sexy, of course, because of Alan Rickman's phenomenally beautiful voice. But I notice that it tends to be a writers favorite way of making him a viable romantic interest...the fiftieth time I read the phrase "seductive baritone" or whatever have you, it's annoying and boring. I don't mind it being mentioned, but hearing it every five seconds is /annoying/.

I daresay I've taken a liking to the fics that don't mention it or somehow mar it. Don't remember it's name, sorry guys, but there was one (a Slytherin Harry fic iirc) that often described it as nasally. Personally I've taken a liking to Jim Dale's audiobook interpretation of Snape, just because it's different.

Don't get me wrong-- I adore Rickman-Snape, but there is also Book-Snape. What are your thoughts on fics that somehow alter the distinctive "baritone" (heaven forgive me for using so many author's favorite and apparently only descriptor)?


** My Snape hisses and growls and shouts and snickers nastily.

His voice can be deep, but it is often soft, or controlled, or silky too. I feel like ‚Äúsexy baritone‚Äù is hitting the reader over the head.

Like ‚ÄúSuper sexy Snape sauntered sexily across the Slytherin common room with his super sexy robes that were also billowing in a sexy and spoke in his sexiest baritone. ‚ÄòGood evening, kitten. Are you ready for Daddy?'‚Äù

...and I think I'm going to need to take a shower to wipe off that bad writing. Yuck.

*** I need to take a shower after reading that too, yikes, but props for so wonderfully capturing the essence of cringe-worthy writing... emulating it when you know better is a talent on its own, yeah?

And you bring up silky too. This is a wonderful adjective--and you sound as if you have the decency to vary it so cheers-- but I notice a lot of writers have an obsession with it, forgetting that he, yes, is very nasty in canon too and not some well-spoken man with a god-like voice misunderstood by us mere mortals.

**** I love the Sneep and he is my favorite character in the series, but I love him because he's so flawed and mean and often ugly by the usual standards of society but he's also brilliant and incredibly creative and in such control of himself.

JK herself uses ‚Äúsilky‚Äù a fair amount in canon when describing his voice, so I like using it too. ;)

The worst thing is that I am a huge Snamione shipper, but I'm ridiculously picky about it. Like, she can't be underage. I hate BDSM. I don't like anything that overly emphasizes their age difference or ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù talk in the bedroom. I don't like him being uncharacteristically nice or Hermione being uncharacteristically vapid and agreeable. So other than a few favorite authors I've found, the vast majority is really disappointing to unpalatable. -_-

***** I love Snape too for the same reasons. He's not Snape if he's rainbows and unicorns haha. Here's some of the Snamione fics I've read that aren't terrible, imo, but you've probably read them if you're a shipper

linkao3(A Room With A View)

linkao3(Time Immemorial by FawkesyLady (Tarma))

linkao3(Ghosts by SlytherPouf)

linkao3(Doing It For the Order)

linkffn(Love Bites) (I've only skimmed part of this one)

I'm not really a Snamione shipper, but I read a bit to see what all the fuss was about. Like anything else, if it's well-written, it can be done. These were some that were recommended to me in my perusal. I'm not viciously for or against it like so many are, but then again, I'm not really a person with strong opinions in general.

By the way, in case Doing It For the Order is the only Desert Sea story you've read, she has so many awesome stories! A couple of them are probably veering on crack fic territory (Grape Juice, Sense and Insensibility) but they're all beautifully written and generally include quite interesting twists, would definitely recommend reading more of her work!

***** Ugh I'm the same way with Snamione. My favorites tend to be either like linkao3(Suppressed by Jaxon) or linkao3(Unforgiven Pride by Laziza). Suppressed has them being work colleagues in the Department of Mysteries post-war, while Unforgiven Pride is a slowburn that has them ineptly dealing with trauma (which is, I'll admit, one of my favorite tropes).

  Post-war politics is just as deadly as ever, when you are called Severus Snape and you are accused of war crimes... But when past students who should hate you prove to be your staunchest allies, you might just decide that life is worth living. Many canon characters. Adult themes. Slow build. EWE. Continuation of Unforgiven Love but can be read independently.I'm not JKR, I don't own anything about Harry Potter, and I don't make any money.

It actually bothers me more that so often in fanfic I read dialogue which sounds quite plummy or fancy. When most often Snape is very plainly spoken.

***** Agreed. Alan Rickman is a great actor and he made the character his own... IMHO he was one of the slight miscasts of the movies - as far as the original books go.

I wonder how the characters of Snape or Draco would have been received if they had been cast more along the lines of Vernon and Dudley in terms of physical appearance.

So my fic Snape tends to be Adam Driver a la Kylo Ren with an English accent. But his voice is pretty deep, too. I guess Alan Rickman set a precedent and it's hard for me to imagine him with any other vocal tone.

*** I was thinking of this exact fic when I read the OP. The funny thing is that I think dragoon found something amazing when she took Snape's voice out of the picture. It's such a good fic...

** My Snape is absolutely not a baritone. He has the grating nasal voice of a cartoonish villain (think /The Great Race/'s Professor Fate with a more refined accent). And his whole thing is that he is very overdramatic and hammy in his manners; he almost never speaks in that monotone manner of Rickman's, instead putting waves of emotion in every sentence (and illustrating them with great waves of his cloak).

** I avoid things with Snape as the main character, so I've never run across this description, thank goodness. I don't think I've really described the sound of any of my character's voices, other than noting Harry is an untrained baritone when he sings in the shower. Most men fall into the baritone register, so I figure it works.

** I read a lot of slash, so I enjoy pleasing voice Snape. Once read a Snape/Harry fic where Harry asks him to repeat his speech from the first year because he found it so erotic

** I write Snape like he was described in canon. A member of the magical Waffen-SS equivalent with a disturbing obsession over a woman long dead and a petty grudge against the name Potter. He, just like any other Death Eater, is a war criminal, and yet a rather toothless antagonist because Dumbledore has him on a leash. He is an annoyance and an insult to justice (a good deed does not wash away a bad one), but otherwise rather inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Then again, I'm not touching any fic with him as the protagonist.

*** Yes I agree /Hellstrike/ Snape as a character is very interesting to write about but as a PERSON he is horrific and disgusting.
