*** But they write such marvelously substantial chapters--31k words this time around--that those two chapters could add up to more than your average book. (I LOVE long updates. I think that's why I can read this as a work in progress and still remember what is going on months later.)

**** Yeah usually for such long updates I have to reread everything, but for Violet's work I only have to reread the last chapter to get caught up.

*** It could be the kind of fic that ends in a cliffhanger of sorts to lead into book 5 (which is what I'm expecting), rather than a full conclusion.

** I've reread this series so many times it's not even funny. Every time there's an update I'm happy for about a week afterward!

** I just did a reread when the last chapter updated, so this time I'll probably just reread the last chapter or two before I start this one!

** I just had an online exam and I was genuinely daydreaming right before about a new chapter of this fic! Imagining how it ends is the only thing to get me through quarantine lmao.
