His motivations being his family's expectations of him, his belief that being a pure blood makes him better, the perks gained from working with death eaters (implementation of his beliefs in society and such), the status gained.

In the fic I'm writing I want draco to not necessarily suddenly start thinking muggleborns are great, but to at least decide he has a likelier chance of surviving to get what he wants by leaving voldemort and Co. However, I'm having a really difficult time of it trying to get inside his head, since we're such different people, and it's making it hard to understand what makes him tick and how to utilize that to give him a different trajectory.

Any thoughts are much appreciated.


** I don't think there is a way to /make/ him realize that it isn't in his best interest, outside of Voldemort killing his parents and all the Death Eaters he admires.

*** Except he does, in Canon. One of Draco's primary motivations is his family, and their expectations of him. In the final battle, after the RoR gets blitzed, and Harry is revealed to be alive Draco and his family split. They're not going and joining the order, but they are deciding that being with voldemort will get them killed. So when Lucius and Narcissa want to go leave and get away and not fight for Voldemort anymore, he goes with them. Draco's 2 primary dedications in life are protecting himself, and doing what is expected of his by his family and caste. And that, in the end, is what motivates him to leave, because his dedication to his family is overriding his dedication to his caste, and because staying with his caste and fighting will get him killed. But the only reason his family leaves in the first place is because Lucius is a coward and doesn't want to be out on the battlefield with Bellatrix and Cole, and Narcissa's only goal is to protect her family. So they leave, and take Draco with them.

** Possibly if someone else he sees as an equal --- say, Theo Nott --- also gets drafted into the DEs, commits a "mistake" that Draco feels he might just as easily have done himself, and is killed by the Dark Lord as a result.

** It could be that Draco comes to his senses when he realizes just how much suffering Voldemort is actually causing. Even as a bully, Malfoy usually tended to use his words or tricks rather than spells or fists.

Suppose the Death Eaters have some fresh meat, say a little ten-year-old Muggle or Muggleborn girl, and they use the Cruciatus Curse on her.

There's a big difference between reading /The Cruciatus Curse was declared Unforgivable. The use of it on another human being will earn the caster a life sentence in Azkaban/ and actually seeing it being used.

And it could fit your new timeline nicely. In the fifth book, Malfoy joked about the Long-term Spell Damage Ward in St. Mungo's and he almost certainly knows what happened to Neville's parents.

*** Yes, I certainly think seeing a 10 yo girl get crucioed would be cause for draco to rethink his stance on death eaters. On the other hand, that requires a 10 yo to get crucioed. Something to think about, either way, for sure.

**** True...that actually requires writing it...that could be tough...

But imagine the ten-year-old crying for her mummy and daddy while Bellatrix casts the Cruciatus Curse or asking what she did wrong for them to hurt her or looking in Draco's eyes when the curses are being cast.

****** We saw Draco laugh at the first act of Muggle Baiting he saw at the Quidditch World Cup, when Death Eaters levitated the helpless Roberts family into the air, but one wonders whether they intended lasting harm on the family. Or at least any harm that would be hard to get away with.

But if the little ten-year-old and her parents are captured by Death Eaters, maybe to use as practice for Draco.

The Death Eaters could kill the parents in front the ten-year-old (I'm on the fence as to whether or not the girl should be a Muggleborn witch or a Muggle outright).

And then Bellatrix could instruct Draco on how to cast the Cruciatus Curse (/You have to/ */mean/* /it Draco!/)...

And there's more ways to torture in the Wizarding World than just Cruciatus. Threatening to feed the ten-year-old to a werewolf would be terrifying.

That could certainly be enough to make Draco very uneasy...

******* Yeah, there's a big difference between watching somebody get tortured and doing it yourself. I'm sure draco would have loved Dumbledore getting offed by voldemort, but do it himself and suddenly he's crying in a bathroom.

** Him noticing early (2nd year the latest) that pureblood supremacy is bullshit because Hermione keeps trashing the purebloods in all exams and/or that the Dark Lord was defeated by a half-blood toddler and his Muggleborn mother. He doesn't necessarily has to become best friends with 20 Muggles or crawl into Dumbledore's arse, but some realisation at that time would be necessary to have a believable timeframe for his change of heart (and without too much water under the bridge). This, coincidentally, is pretty much the only way how I can see a Harry/Draco friendship or Draco/Hermione work.

*** The pivotal turning point of my AU is Remus recognizing scabbers on the HE in third year, causing sirius get aquitted. I'm working on the motto of 'Why bother changing anything, if you don't change anything' and 'A stone making ripples making waves making floods making tsunamis.' One ripple I'm trying to make is Draco and possibly his family leaving the death eaters early/never joining the death eaters in the first place. I'm pretty flexible about how it could happen, my only limit I'm setting for myself is that everyone has to stay in character. Any change I make to his actions has to some way be able to lead back to the original change. If it's a very convoluted and distant connection that's okay, as long as I can prove there is one. To put it simply, nobody is going to be making decisions or actions they did not make in Canon, unless I can prove that it was influenced by my Scene 0.

And as for why I'm determined to find a motivation for draco to leave the DE, as I said, why would I bother changing anything (remus recognizing scabbers), if I don't plan on changing anything (the wide reaching effects such a change would have, such as draco not making quite such terrible decisions as in Canon.)?

**** Malfoy Sr would still be marked and he was a quite loyal supporter (he had a Horcrux). There is no way Voldemort would let him slip away that easily, especially considering the Horcrux. It would be far more realistic if Draco would jump ship, maybe together with his mother...

Actually, Narcissa could be the driving factor here. Pettigrew gets arrested, during his trial he mentions that he believes the Dark Lord in Albania, Lucius wants to follow that lead but Narcissa is against him. It could boil down to Narcissa and Draco vs Lucius. Because unless you want to give Draco a realisation he would have never had in canon, that's pretty much the only semi-believable way I can think of.

***** I'm trying to give him a realization that he /did/ have in Canon, in book 7, just a book or two earlier. I don't have an issue having a family conflict come up, or an outside event happening differently, as you suggested, as long as I can believably say that said conflict or outside event had something to do with scabbers getting discovered, such as your idea that he let slip information at his trial, causing a family conflict. Come to think of it, I feel rather stupid for not assuming Peter would be spilling his guts with information to get a lighter sentence, and what I could do with the information spilled. Idea is very appreciated.

******* I perceived it as Draco defining himself by his family, by his blood status, by his caste, and then later on by his status as a death eater. This is even from the moment he introduces himself.

"Malfoy. Draco Malfoy." - somewhere in PS

I don't think he once defines himself just as Draco. His sense of extroverted feeling, how he perceives himself in relation to his status, I don't think he once stops to consider just who /Draco/ is, not Malfoy, in the first 5 books.

And then the sixth book happens. He is given a task. A task that feels impossible a task that, Iirc, is /meant/ to be impossible. As I remember, it was Voldemort's intention to punish Lucius for his failings by giving his son a task where failure meant his death. But to Draco, he is being given a reward, a chance to prove himself. To live up to the status of being a death eater. Get rid of Dumbledore, and you will be one of us. Draco regularly spends time in the CoS bathroom crying like a baby because he's under so much stress.

And then he has to go back to the home that has been taken over by voldemort, spending his summer obeying the every whim of a mad man with a fetishist for the cruciate curs Draco is a bigot with awful views, but even he can tell that voldemort is batshit. He had joined this group, thinking it could give him everything he ever wanted, and now realized that it's a dictatorship lead by a raging lunatic. So when his parents say Draco, come, and they leave, he goes with them. Because he's not that big of an idiot, to stay loyal to a man like voldemort.

*** Arguments to be used by Draco in case of Hermione-perfectness:

- She's cheating!

- Dumbledore must be giving her answers to make us purebloods look bad!

- She's probably an orphan from the war adopted by muggles.

- Her parents are squibs, so she's not a mudblood anyway.

- She's one of "the good ones".

This is the one to go with. It's hilariously common with racists of all kinds, and - as racism becomes less and less socially acceptable - they assume that because they've got their 'one good one' in mind they're not racist at all.

** He could overhear snape talking about lily somehow and realize that if lily had lived like snape wanted, Harry wouldn't be so special and that he would've been number one instead of Harry. Maybe that could make him see that while mughleborns are the worst type of witch or wizard, they still are part of this world and since he's wishing that one lived despite her blood status, he starts to get really confused about what he really thinks of muggleborns until the internal conflict is solved in whatever way you feel like ultimately resolving it

*** That's an interesting idea. A little bit convoluted, but it's definitely an angle I've never thought of before. That harry would just be a normal boy is lily lived, making him associate positive feelings with a muggle born, creating an internal conflict. It's really neat!
