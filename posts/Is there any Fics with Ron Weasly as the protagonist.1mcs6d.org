** jbern's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]] is good, a /For The Love Of the Game/ fusion. 15k words, complete.

  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.

I wrote a few-thousand word one-shot with Ron as (heroic) protagonist: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Ickle Ronnikins]].

Also, Ella/Deadwoodpecker's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4871753/1/Through-a-Dark-Mirror][Through a Dark Mirror]] is quite good, if incomplete; 16k words, abandoned.

  Some mistakes are nearly impossible to fix. AU.

Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Rons_Stupid/Rons_Stupid/][Ron's "Stupid"]] is another; 3500 words, complete.

  Ron might be a lot of things, but stupid is not one of them.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/Pinky-Brown][Pinky Brown]] has some great stories that focus on Ron, though many if not all of them are Ron/Hermione.

** This is a pretty short one-shot, but it's one of my favorites where Ron is the protagonist. Fair warning, though, it is still pretty Harry-centric.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2221913/1/Chess][Chess]] by Opalish. "Ron and McGonagall play a game of chess. Ron loses his temper, Gryffindor loses points, and McGonagall loses a few comforting illusions. But maybe something's gained in the end... Slight RHr."
