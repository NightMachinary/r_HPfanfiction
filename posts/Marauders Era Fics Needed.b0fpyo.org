So I've just finished They're Hiding Inside Me (Ao3) and there is a hole where my heart should be. Moving on from that, I've recently fallen down a Marauders Era hole. Basically, I need fanfiction recs, preferably either comedy or angst.


** Just to be sure, have you read that author's other works? Every one is excellent. Blackpool is commonly rec'd here, but FFN(the things that lurk in the dark by the Divine comedian) is MWPP era.

Another good one-shot author for that era, with Wolfstar if you like it (since it's in the fic you mentioned), is Lady Bracknell. Linkffn(the firewhisky incident) is cute.

For longer/multi-chapter, linkffn(against the moon) is super popular.

  In a lot of ways, it was Joni Mitchell's fault. In some ways, it was Sirius'. The Firewhiskey had a bit to do with it, Remus admitted, but when it came down to it, really, he had no one to blame but himself.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  It's 1975, and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Lily Evans, James Potter, and Severus Snape are about to be tested in ways they cannot imagine. A canon-compliant account of the First Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it. (Fifth year COMPLETE.)

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.
