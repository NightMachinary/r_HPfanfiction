I'd rather it be as believable as possible.

Surely there'd be Slytherin's who hate Harry, who would try to be sneaky/cunning while trying to hurt or get rid of him.

Snape can eventually see Harry as his own person or not, either is fine.

I'd rather NOT have Weasley bashing, as I love that family. Harry can be friends with Draco, but I do NOT want Weasley bashing.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on Fanfiction.net or another Site

I don't want Super OP Harry, Harem Harry or Super Smart Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then canon is fine, but no snapping his fingers and making things happen or whatever.

NO Politic Slytherin kind of thing going on.

Would rather it be completed, but if not am fine with it.


** Well, my fic qualifies for all of those except "completed".

!linkao3(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting)

!linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting)

Ron is not friends with Harry, but he's also not bashed. The Slytherins try to be political, but they're children/teenagers and are thus bad at it, and the political situation devolves pretty quickly. Harry is smarter and more powerful than most of his peers, but not those in his small friend group.

**** Yes, I am. Progress has been slow lately because winter has been kicking my ass (depression, illness, dry air causing breathing difficulties...), But the next chapter is almost done. Just one more scene and it should be ready for the editing process

*** Just finished reading it earlier today, absolutely love it! Funniest fic I've read in a long time, and your Dumbledore is my absolute favourite; his scenes are always my favourite. Do you know of any other fics with similar characterisation of him? I know you recommended that Hinny soul bond one in an AN, and it looks interesting, I'm just hesitant to read it given it's almost certainly abandoned.

**** Amplitude, Frequency, and Resistance of a Soul Bond is one of those fics that I consider to be so good that it's worth reading despite being abandoned. The fic is abandoned at a low point in the tension, so there aren't any major cliffhangers, and the rest of the fic definitely makes up for it.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** On the Way to Greatness has Dumbledore pretty much as his canon self. I'm not quite sure the definition of 'Politic Slytherin' but there isn't the whole 'we must unite our families' type stuff. There is still however the fanon idea of 'what happens in Slytherin stays in house' plus a hierarchy and stuff. Incomplete partway through year 6. Otherwise it fits your requirements.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/]]

Magical Relations has Harry and Dudley as wizards when Dudley gets sorted into Gryffindor, Harry does whatever he can to be in a different house than him, so he becomes a Slytherin. Besides it being incomplete (also ends around year 6), it also fits your requirements.

** My series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn), fits your criteria pretty closely. There are politics, but there are not child politicians. Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Slytherin.

#+begin_quote
  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.
