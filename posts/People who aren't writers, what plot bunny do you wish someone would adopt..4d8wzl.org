Personally I want a Harry has a twin story, he hears his parents talking about sending him away to give the other twin more times. He runs away to Gringotts and does a blood test (+ all the other stereotypical things from bad WBWL fan fiction), he goes back to 'Potter Manor' (or some such) to pick up his books (because WBWL are always Ravenclaws or Slytherins) and then....

Dumbledore obviates him, and takes him to his Aunts and Uncles and tells him his parents died in a fire (or something, while the parents actually go in to hiding training his brother) and that they couldn't find a wizarding family that would adopt him, only his brother. Then the story progresses not going back to any of the stuff mentioned in the first chapter, Harry doesn't find out he was obliviated any time soon and goes to school and meets his brother again.


** The Dursleys have a second child who is younger than Harry and Dudley by one year. They don't antagonize Harry like the rest of the Dursleys do, but they aren't quick to make a move in his defense, either. Harry goes to Hogwarts for his first year and everything ensues as normal until he comes home for the summer to find his younger cousin occupying what used to be his cupboard. Turns out they're a witch/wizard as well and any instances of accidental magic they've done as a child was blamed on Harry, until Harry was off at Hogwarts and the Dursleys couldn't use him as a scapegoat anymore. Harry helps his cousin adapt to the idea of being magical throughout the summer, potentially takes them to the Weasley's or Diagon Alley with him as well.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** I've got an intro for that:

"For a thousand years, they have stood apart. Hufflepuff, house of loyalty and hard work. Gryffindor, house of bravery and chivalry. Ravenclaw, house of wit and wisdom. Slytherin, house of ambition.

The four houses of Hogwarts, built in a time before government was little more than a lord sitting in a castle, became more than simple school dorms. Backed by the founders of their respective houses, they divided Britain into four lands.

In Scotland lay the land of Ravenclaw, its unending wilderness a backdrop to the greatest hub of magical research in Europe. To the south, Gryffindor reigned, their strength & bravery fighting off magical invaders where the muggles couldn't. Along the coastline of the east, in island chains far to the north of Raven's Keep and plunging far into disputed territories all over the island, the Hufflepuffs reigned, their steady efforts rewarded with the largest & most prosperous chain of magical communities left standing anywhere in the world. Finally, in Wales & along the western coast you would find Slytherin, birthplace of the Magical forces that helped secure the British Empire for centuries.

Now, after a thousand years, they stand on shaky legs. Centuries of feuds, a legacy of death & destruction, murder and vile acts committed everywhere, war, poverty and famine have destroyed the ranks of those of the erstwhile rulers. A last-minute truce struck at the end of the first world war ensured they would survive, but Dark Lords and outsiders looking to invade made any ambition beyond that a moot point. As the millenium of their countries' founding approaches, only the neutral areas are more than just ruins now.

The last hope for recovery died with Voldemort. It would not be long before the ICW made its opening move on the countries that had spurned its demands for so long.

But the heart of nations beats stronger in a skeleton than it ever did in life.

The old feuds and claims are not forgotten even though those who fought them died in Riddle's madness. Now, bastards and offspring of the disgraced looking for the riches of dead lines fight for the scraps left at the table, picking up where their ancestors left off.

And a throne built a thousand years ago, the ultimate symbol of unity, cries out for an Emperor.

In this, Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, last survivor of the survivors, last of a line spanning all four countries, the last ray of hope for the magicals trapped on a dying island, finally attends Hogwarts.

Only problem is, he is muggle raised, completely ignorant of his heritage. And that, according to the few houses with descendants still in them, automatically disqualified him.

Not all agree, though, and none less so than those who rarely had a champion worth the name. To the marginalised, the forgotten, the exiled and the bastards, muggleborn and pureblood and creature and squib alike, this boy was their last hope.

And if it took a rebellion to end it all? Well, some would say it was overdue anyway.

In the wings, the spectres dance. In the wind, the scent of decay finds all. In the sky do the clouds grow. In the silence do the drums of war beat again. In the school of four does the child of one lie perched on a wall, to fall either way. I these days, you shall find the end of a long & bloody era. In these words, you shall find the final fate of the four."

There used to be a rash of 'Harry Runs Away After DH' stories, so this is a subversion of a trope that isn't seen very much any more. Basically, Harry tries to run away from the magical world, but he's compelled by his duty as Teddy Lupin's godfather to maintain contact with him. His friends use this as a means to find him.

** I've come up with several:

- Hermione travels back in time and starts a relationship with Lily Evans.

- A self- or OC-insert, where someone with knowledge about the events about to unfold wakes up in the body of Cornelius Fudge.

- Harry Potter's name is known and despised by everyone. The purebloods seized the political narrative after the fall of Voldemort to claim he was a revolutionary willing to do what needed to be done, but unfortunately met his early demise at the hands of the anti-wizard extremists that were the Potter family.

- A Harry Potter / Mass Effect crossover, where the secret magical societies on earth decide to work together with the governments, once it looks like the Turians might kill off humanity in the first contact war.

- Ron Weasley travels back in time, to become the ultimate bro of Harry Potter.

- The Dursleys think that the best way to make Harry a “normal human being“ is to (instead of calling him a freak all the time) adopt him and cut all ties he has to the magical world: They change his last name to Dursley and his first name alo to something else, try to be loving parents to him, and also get rid of that scar by the means of laser surgery. A few misunderstandings make Dumbledore think that the Dursleys either gave Harry away or straight up lost him, and so Harry enrolls under a different name at Hogwarts. A story where The-boy-who-lived exists, just isn't very important to the protagonist and story in general.

- Hermione is a boy, and somehow, this changes everything.

- Gilderoy Lockhart is succesful in obliviating Harry and Ron about the events in the chamber, and as such he can claim the fame. As a result he is immediately re-hired for next year, and next year and continues to be rehired, as he steals the fame for everything interesting. A Hogwarts story from Harry's perspective, where Gilderoy is a complete moron, but somehow still always manages to save the day.

- Gilderoy Lockhart obliviates Voldemort and claims all his evil doings as his own, but explains them away as just more heroic deeds.

- There is no golden trio, Harry is just a loner with extreme case of split personality.

  A man is left trapped in time, while his world dies around him. Now awakened in the distant future, he leaves the planet of his birth and embarks on a journey to find that which was lost. But the new frontier holds many dangers, and the human race is about to face its first great challenge. A HP/ME crossover. Slow pace, rated M for safety, my profile has more details.

This is a challenge from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2620084/willyolioleo][willyolioleo's profile]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter learns muggle magic before attending Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

- That's the basic premise. Harry has learned muggle magic tricks, and thinks that Hogwarts itself is just another school for magic where he'll learn some more card tricks and stage magic when he first receives his letter.

#+begin_quote
  Other conditions:
#+end_quote

- Harry ran away from home early, abandoning the Dursleys because of the abuse.

- He lived on the streets for a while, learning basics of sleight-of-hand while pickpocketing.

- He learned to earn more honest money by performing magic tricks on the streets in the afternoons and evenings. (not during the day when adults would ask why he's not in school)

- Most of the "magic" he knows is much street magic and table magic: i.e. small tricks with very little setup and equipment required- mostly card, coin, cups-and-balls, that sort of stuff.

- After arriving at Hogwarts, students and professors alike mistake his skills for wandless conjuration/vanishing/transfiguration. He even breaks a few laws of magic by "conjuring" food and money. He ends up accidentally earning a reputation of being the most powerful wizard ever.

- However he defeats Voldemort, it's more through trickery than through actual magic.

- You can ignore the horcruxes if you'd like.

** What if Harry wasn't able to save Ron from being poisoned in HBP? I know it's been done once, but I feel like it there's more to work with.

Fics where one main character dies and we see the reactions from everyone else and how they move on with their lives.

Any story pairing Hermione with Lavender, purely cos that would make me laugh.

Harem stories for characters other than Harry, cos that would be good fun.

A fic where Harry ends up in Slytherin, but doesn't lose his personality. Same plot could be used for other characters as well.

At least one fic where Hermione gets accused of drugging Ron with love potion. I just want the shitty tropes to be reversed for once.

A fic where Harry gets loads of girls, but instead of embracing it and having tons of sex every hour, it becomes too much and he eventually goes insane. I would so read that.

The only time I could see Harry and Hermione getting together would be in the tent during DH, cos they only have each other. I think that would be interesting to explore, especially since they'd be struggling not to betray the feelings they already have towards other people.

Perhaps some sparks showered onto Harry and became harmless when they landed on Dudley's clothing, and she misinterpreted it as the "blood protections" and just insisted he always wore Dudley's clothes after that one incident. And she could be suffering from some sort of PTSD and that is why she is so high strung and anti wizard and she is just always on edge.

He didn't tell Vernon and Petunia this, but he'd kick up a fuss if they tried to make him go to bed in the actual second bedroom, so they let him sleep in the cupboard. Eventually he forgot that he'd /wanted/ the closet once, and thought that he was being locked up and punished. I thought that was a nice change from them beating him up for breathing.

I think other bits included all the 'canon beatings' actually just being normal physical discipline, and Harry was just punished more often because he back-talked more than Dudley did...

** I am sort of a writer, since I have about 10 fics in development stages, but none have been published yet. I'll post some which I think would work better if someone else did them.

Dumbledore is evil, but not incompetent. Voldemort was actually destroyed and he tries to make Harry his apprentice.

Harry grows up in a loving household which is not the Dursley's, but is magical, and he has a sibling. He becomes a Hufflepuff.

Harry, at some point, realizes he can speak to dragons using parseltongue. Cue Dragon Tamer Harry.

Being half-blood causes X-men like mutations, such as Voldemort's lack of nose, Flitwick or Hagrid's size, Tonks' Metamorphmagus powers, etc. Voldemort is a freedom fighter for half bloods, and there are no horcruxes. Nobody can work out what Harry's power is, either. His parents died, but not at the hands of Voldemort.

If the British wizarding world was stupid enough to enact something like that, there could be only two outcomes:

**** Agree with everything you've said, which is why I can't read marriage law fics involving Hermione, as she's always paired with someone she wouldn't want to be with (I believe the original challenge sort of stipulated that?).

I'd like to see it done with a pairing that would actually be good together but them having to overcome the fact that they didn't come together naturally and their relationship skipped some steps.

** A scenario where while Muggles/Nomag cannot use magic of their own, or magical objects created by wizrds/witches, they might be able to take part in rituals that utilize ambient magic from the world around them. Ancient peoples completing complicated dances to bestow good fortunes in battle, small trinkets that draw on the world around them to bestow increased luck or small boons to charisma, small sayings passed down generations that have gained a power of their own through the shared belief of the people saying them. Little things that are missable unless you know what to look for, but definitely magic of some sort.

Having a person who possesses their own internal magic (a wizard) take part in these small rituals or creation of these trinkets increses the power 10-fold, 100-fold, etc. The catch;

Many times the muggle communities that know about these small bits of 'mundane magic' hide it because they dont want to be witch hunted. The wizarding community proper does the same. So the two groups just never managed to find one another in any real capacity because they were both hiding themselves to some extent. So there are isolated groups of muggles across the globe who can access ambient magic, wizards in their own little communities, and then the general non-magical populace who /could potentially/ draw on ambient magic, but dont know about it or how to do so and who ocassionally stumble into both of the other groups worlds on accident.

Muggleborns would probably be a result of a family or group of people drawing on ambient magic unwittingly for a number of generations until it culminates in a child who has internalized the ability. Mr. Granger's family on one side or the other likely had some sort of quirk (always saying a particular phrase to keep doorways safe when entering or exiting a house or something equally passable as an old family superstition), and perhaps his wife had something similar, so when they got together, Hermione ended up with magic because their families had been unconciously drawing up small bits of magic so long it manifested.

IDK, it seems like a nifty idea, and it'd be funny to watch all the Purebloods lose their minds when they realize muggles are technically magical people too. :P

** I've been meaning to write about this for a while, but never found the motivation to do so.

Basically, what I want to read is a plot about Harry living as a member of the church, and the main theme being "faith". I always wanted to read a story when Harry asks himself why he's the chosen one, why his parents died and if he should believe "destiny" really exists. After reading Fate/Stay Night, I wanted to see the church as a ruthless faction that hunt down all the evil creatures in the world in others fandom as well, so I thought about Harry living as a member of the church, preaching in the day and then fighting against Voldemort in the night while wondering if he could ever forgive what Tom did to him.

** Lily escapes with Harry -maybe her readiness to die makes her impossible to kill too? Anyway, she raises Harry to live a fugitive nomadic life and to distrust everyone. Not trusting Dumbledor to keep her son safe, she fights to keep him away from Hogwarts and teaches him basic survival and defensive magic herself. Lily and Harry settle in some sleepy southren town in the US and rebuild their life.

When Harry is a teenager strange things start happening around them and muggles start suspecting them as they try to protect those same muggles. What happened was Voldemort came back to life with a horcrux and has found them but is unable to touch the potters himself because of the sacrifice. So he is hurting innocent people in the town to blackmail them into surrender. Normally Lily would escape with Harry but this time they feel responsible for the town they brought the wrath of Voldemort down on.

Some of residents keep trying to run them out of town not realizing it's too late and the death eaters will burn the place down for funzies when wizard protection is gone before hunting the Potter's new location and the potters are staying to protect then.

You can have Sirius show up and try to convinve Lily he wasn't the one who betrayed them and/or Snape helping them in secret as a spy (he keeps hoping Lily will love him back.)

Maybe the Potters finally agree to ally with Dumbledor when Harry demands it after his muggle friend/girlfriend is killed horribly. Maybe Ron and Hermione are a taskforce of talented teen wizards the order sent to help harry protect the high school. They become friends as harry is incredibly curious about life in the magical community.

Eventually the final battle takes place in that same sleepy southren town and in an unproceed step they decided to break the international code of secrecy so the whole town can help them win with clever non magical means mixed with magic. For example the magical defenders enchance flamethrowers to shoot magical fiendfire, that kind of stuff.

When Harry realizes he is a horcrux Harry kills himself and comes back to life as in the books. Lily actually is the one to kill Voldemort's current body in her wrath when she thinks Harry is dead.

When it's all over harry and the rest are up to trial for breaking the code. They end up proving muggles and wizards can work together and the old laws can be repealed. The place where the town used to stand becomes a huge monument "This is the place where everthing changed. "

Woooooo that came out in a rush... Half of this I didn't even realize was laid out in my head. Sadly I'ma terrible writer and will never be able to write this.

Lily may not know about Sirius of James did not tell her her changed the secret keeper, maybe to add a layer of security if no one knews about the switch. But anyway it's not a major point. If she knew Sirius would never have been arrested, but she may not trust him because if Peter betrayed them, who can they be sure they can count on? Nobody. In my mind Lily trusts nobody in the magical world after Jame's death until events (and Harry's urging) force her to accept help. Througout the fic she slowly regains her faith in people.

*** This plot has promise, but don't make Muggles too weak and stupid. Muggle weapons are actually more effective in killing, and with some magicals' help, they should take down enemy magicals with ease.

So I see Death Eaters getting some nasty surprise when the Potters and Order reinforcements working closely with Muggles together. The combine arms tactic wrecked havoc on Death Eater ranks and was mostly responsible for Voldemort's defeat.

******* Ok let me ask you a question: if the magicals were that powerful as you think, why were they chased into hiding by the Muggles of 1692? It seemed the Muggles from the middle ages, without any help of modern technologies, regularly roughed up magicals so that even Salazar Slytherin became mightily paranoid of them.

Now how much more powerful have the Muggles grown of the last 300 years since the Statute of Secrecy went into effect?

Also, attacks by trolls and giants were physical, not magical. If your little Imperturbable Charm is all that powerful, then why did they wreck so much havoc on Hogwarts?

************* Okay, here's the thing-a gun is of limited use under most circumstances against a prepared wizard. However, shotguns, rifles, SMGs, Assault rifles, Sniper Rifles, Artillery, Bombs, missiles, napalm, cars, trucks, tanks, planes, molotov cocktails, grenades, c4, semtex, claymore mines, mines and more are weapons too. And while a wizard may recognise a gun quickly enough to react, the same cannot be said when it comes to grenades. What use is a protego against a stun grenade, after all?

This is not even considering the idea of a wizard enchanting the weapon in the first place.

Now then, similarly, magical defences are not straightforward and should not be treated as such. To discount how quickly & easily you can cast something like a protego shield is idiotic. Imperturbable charms? Eh, maybe. That one's a cop-out argument when transfiguration, potions and alchemy exist. Why reapply an imperturbable when you can make it actively part of the clothing all the time? And wouldn't an imperturbable make clothing as firm as granite, given that moving clothes are clothes being perturbed by the motions inherent to walking? An enchantment on the clothes that casts an /arresto momentum/ field around the person's body when something really fast, small & sharp heads their way? So much better.

Can bullets kill wizards? Absolutely. Can spells protect wizards from bullets? Yes, the right ones can definitely do that. Now, does that mean that guns are the supreme leveller when it comes to magic? No. Explosives are. A large enough blast would either kill the wizard outright or, if said wizard uses an imperturbable charm, cook the wizard from the heat transfer/shockwave.

So there are arguments & counterarguments for both. Just go 50/50 (it helps that it really could go either way too) and forget about it.

This argument is the biggest headache in the fandom. If we could toss a wizard and a soldier in a pit and order them to fight each other, we'd know. But that's not happening any time soon.

******************* They can't. The muggles don't even know the magicals exist for the most part. Their unplottable spells prevent geo-positioning systems from acknowledging something is there. Their wards prevent physical detection of locations full of wizards. You would have to have someone sitting in space to detect magical areas because the spells that prevent you from stumbling across them probably only extend into the upper atmosphere.

In short, in an annihilation war, nobody knows the wizards are there. WMD's do not discriminate, nor do the other AOE weapons. Any fighting without WMDs would eventually peter off long enough for peace to break out. So, in short, telling the muggles to not target wizards makes no sense as they don't do so in the first place.

Not harming wizards? Well, that's up to how stupid the wizard is to get in the middle of a xenocidal war.

Snape's method works though. Talking the idiots out of being idiotic and killing them all is his profession, after all is said & done.

**** First, thanks! I'm glad you like the concept. Sadly I'm not capable of writing it or any other story. I'm a reader only :)

Second, I think you may be underestimating the physical resilience of witchs and wizards. Remember how Hagrid yelled a car crash couldn't have killed the Potters? There is no normal person I know of that can't be killed with a bad enough car crash. And Neville survived being thrown out a window and "bounced like a rubber ball." A normal bullet aimed at a wizard would probably bounce as well. Accidental/innate magic protects witchs and wizards from non magic damage. Now if Hermione enchants the bullets... that's a different story !

** Albus Potter, occultist and/or exorcist of the Holy See goes (even more) rogue and descends to R'lyeh to bring back Poppy Parkinson (that is just a suggestion, a young Pansy married off to old money in New England after the Malfoy disgrace that perhaps is not as pure of blood as it claims, and who returns pregnant to the safety of Hogwarts, where she has to stay lest she be found, which her daughter eventually is ... Or maybe Pansy and the squid have a thing ), a deep one who covered for him when he summoned a demon to address his seemingly weak magic and got another pupil killed in the process (hence why he became an occultist and eventually attracted the attention of the Church).

Conflict abounds - with his estranged family and the Auror corps that hunts dark wizards like him, with his brother and/or sister who either are Aurors or never forgave his betrayal, with the Holy See whom he betrayed also (perhaps there are conditions to being a court wizard to the Pope, or an exorcist, or even just am archivar in the magical library in Rome), and with himself, his belief and ethics, and the fairly impossible love-craftian task of going against deepest nature and the dreams of a sleeping Old God.

I don't envision lots of action here, and flashy magics, but rather character studies, the interplay of religious institutions and magic and the occult, and eldritch horror. I don't want an evil albus who throws the death curse about while his father replies with three storey high patronuses, but a kid that makes a mistake due to self-doubt, gradually becomes alienated and finally picks up a few questionable friends or interests and suddenly is confronted with things far beyond his ken, whose first selfless act is perhaps the attempt to rescue his friend and once protector. No romance necessary, but also not prohibited. Certainly not a wank story, should have some length, too.

I actually have a minor timeline for this and outline. Originally this wasn't a HP fanfiction idea, it was something I tried to write as a teen in the context of the Innsmouth stories, where a young boy falls for a Deep One (unknowingly), is educated in Europe where he falls in with the Catholics and eventually returns home and finds his teenage love only a rumour people barely dare talk about and investigates.

Back then I still wanted to go into theology. Three years later I stopped believing. I still think it could be interesting.
