What are the things one should look out for? What are the pit traps one should avoid?

Building atmosphere in fics is one of those things that I think is quite difficult to achieve, but when somebody's done it well, you immediately know. Drawing tension into scenes and between characters, building the stakes higher and higher, et cetera... But I think fear is one of those much harder emotions to elicit. A lot of the time, Voldemort isn't really /scary/ - he's a villain, certainly, and you know he does bad things, but you don't necessarily feel trepidation about what he's going to do next, or anxiety when you realize he's going to be in a scene.

What are things one can weave into scenes to make Voldemort scary? What fics have you seen that have best made him /terrifying/?


** Have the villain beat the hero. It's hard to be terrified when deep down you know the hero will win. So build the doubt.

*** This works especially well if you invert the hero and villain. Have the hero spend 5 chapters setting up a clever trap that handles lots of contingencies and is way more overkill than the reader thinks necessary. And then have it not survive contact with the enemy, because Voldemort discovered it ahead of time or anticipated it and had an Unspoken Plan for that kind of trap. Or have him escape or survive each escalating component of the Surely-That'll-Get-'im Sequence of Traps through inhuman reflexes and sheer grit.

He's Motherfucking Voldemort. People are afraid to say his name because he somehow knows things no one should have been able to figure out (Taboo, Potters' Fidelius) and wins or escapes when no one should have been able to. He has, presumably, fought Dumbledore more times than just that one duel in OoTP, and Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald and easily stunned a team of aurors /after/ delivering a one-liner that warned them he was going to resist.

*** The scariest Voldemort I've ever encountered was in landstradd's linkffn(the power of the mind) . It's pretty much the OP fic, but Harry just beat down a Balrog as part of TWT, where he has to face down 3 of his greatest fears, and the next one is a fully powered Voldemort. Dude has a presence you just feel when he enters the page.

** Show the perspective of one of Voldemort's victims as the dark lord chases them down. Show how futile each of their efforts is in stoping Voldemort, before he finally kills them in a fashion befitting his character. If he's crazy, an odd, creative death similar to the disappearing pencil gag the Joker used would be appropriate. If he's cold and logical, a quick, efficient death that seems effortless would be best. If he's sadistic, a drawn out, gory death would be best.

New plots, definitely, but a lot of fics are "single points of departure" whose AUness start /after/ the Horcruxes are already made, and it'd devaluate the whole "what if" scenario for me if background details were randomly changed. That being said, you could have Voldemort learn that people are looking for his Horcruxes and hide them in completely different ways.

Also, what do you need by "more focused Death Eaters"? Because to be honest, I don't particularly like Death Eaters in a story. You need them to be there in the background, but I don't find them really all that interesting --- Voldemort (forced to) act(ing) on his own or with just a single servant (like Crouch Jr.) is much more appealing to me.

** So Tom was charismatic in his rise to power.

He had to go off the rails for the books because the story sorta happened around Harry until the agency of the Hero's Journey kicked in (The loss of Sirius then Dumbledore).

So in writing a scary Voldemort have him stay charismatic in person and public.

Contrast that with brutal murder (horcrux creation but if it were me, I would stick with three. It's still a solid number magically but it's clear that splitting your soul over and over again degrades your being so seven is...excessive) and cruelty in his subordinates failures.

The Tom that sweeps you into his ideology even if you knew he'd try will feel eerie but comforting at the same time. The hairs stand on end across your body but your mind pauses. Agrees.

You only see the suave agreeable inner chamber. So Lucius and a non insane (but still fanatical) Bellatrix. Both LeStranges. Snape (his mind is brilliant even if his appearance isn't).

The shadows hold Dolohov and Yaxley, the Carrows, Rookwood. Any gruesome or extreme violence is their domain.

But slowly, in exploration, the true horror of what Voldemort does is revealed.

This allows the prophecy to come into play. Of course Tom wouldn't believe in such trivialities. However. We know that the best way to lose a war or battle is to engage the unknown. Best take the prophecy as true and work it into your plans. That way if it's false you've already accounted for it's failure and if it's true then you enact your plans to minimize its impact.

A Snape that discovers his masters plans in case the prophecy is true can give back story to the modern setting of the story.

Endless has it right. One of the greatest stories told was Final Fantasy VI. Kefka won. And playing through the weight of that and it's impact on the heroes was incredible to experience.

So at some point Tom needs to win against Harry. He needs another major loss but it has to happen after he's caught up in Tom's rhetoric.

Shatter his faith in his own mind. Break his spirit with the major loss. Force him to crawl back from that.

That's how I'd go about it.

*** Damn, thank you, I'm very tired and wanted to answer - you did that for me. I agree with every point.

From a different point of view, some of my favorite pairings are Voldemort pairings (or Tom Riddle). One excellent story is linkffn(5216059), a Voldemort/Hermione story with a very interesting start. Basically, the ministry has declared both the Order and the death Eaters enemies and a "truth" is made between both alienated groups. Vows are made and an emissary is sent to the other side - Hermione, of course. She discovers Voldemort as he really is in this fic - OOC obviously, since he's still the charismatic, powerful, charming psychopath he was in his youth (snake face aside). The fics that describe him like that are rare unfortunately, I think it was the first I read which portrayed him like that and I really loved it. Others do it well too - especially since I read about him as a main character in a pairing, he can't be a raging lunatic with no mind left. But yeah, he needs to have his mind intact, the charisma, the power, the charm... In Canon he's a shell of a villain, a boogeyman, he's not that real (which is also why we all hate Umbridge more than we hate him). Make him smart, make him twisted and sick but so intelligent... I always hated the fact that he believed in the prophecy, but it worked in the books. In fanfiction I search for AU where he's over this divination nonsense. Or maybe portraying it as a vice of some sort, he knows it's not real but can't help it and fear it. Makes him more real.

**** I would like a fic where Tom is Doom. And through the first defeat and resurrection he reflects on what happened. Let the connection happen like in canon (not a horcrux though) but Tom uses it to mold Harry. Into Kristoff if we continue the Doom analogy.

We can twist the prophecy to fit what we need. But slowly. Surely. The horror and terror.

Let Harry fully come into Toms trap after Dumbledore dies.

Pairing doesn't matter. Maybe through Toms manipulations Harry drags Ginny or Luna or Hermione with him. Or he courts Slytherin girls in secret.

Or no pairing at all.

But. The aftermath of the evil would be interesting to delve into.

** Here's a repost of a comment I made on a similar post a few months ago. Hope these help!

1 - Don't wheel him out unless it's absolutely necessary, and when he appears, have him really put the hammer down. Voldemort is both more and less than a person, and his inhumanity - both in physical resemblance and behaviour - helps set him apart from the rest. The issue with his showing up in any situation, however, is that canon Death Eaters are kind of weak, with the exception of maybe Bellatrix. Voldemort is their hope for wizarding purity, and his soldiers should be fanatical, skilled and extremely dangerous. If they aren't, then the reader will mostly wonder why Voldemort doesn't just do away with his incompetent henchmen and do it all himself.

2 - Have him really strike fear with his magic, for instance maybe use Legilimency as Snape described. Canon-Voldemort delights in pain and suffering, and although that is fun and can definitely be scary, a better way to do it is apathy. Voldemort should be so removed from humanity that he should be disinterested in being hilariously punitive, as making him reactionary to the protagonist diminishes his threat. The more terrifying concept is someone that is ruthless, yet utterly amoral and unfettered by laws or respect for human decency - that if you meet this person, they'll kill you because you're in the way if for no other reason. Maybe have him conduct experiments on prisoners, just to see what he can learn from magic.

3 - Tying on to his ruthlessness and need to not be reactionary to the direction of the plot, Voldemort should have his own objectives, and furthermore should truly embody his cause. Too many authors, I think, use the fact he's a half-blood and is sort-of insane to say he was just using the purebloods and their ambitions as a means to start a war, but I think he is much scarier when he is a true believer in the cause. The idea that a charismatic, physically unassailable and utterly ruthless Voldemort could be driven - and in turn drive suicidal loyalty into his soldiers - to achieve an ideological aim is much more interesting than "duh, he's insane."

4 - If he is targeting Super!Harry, and is unable to do it directly, then he should do more of what he didn't in the books: target Harry's friends and associates. He should operate with equal parts surgical precision and unfathomable cruelty, using death, torture, dismemberment and rampant destruction to force Super!Harry onto the defensive, or to draw him out into a planned confrontation. I'm talking heinous levels of shit here, for instance targeting Harry's friends' families - Hermione's parents are ripe for murdering in their (I'm assuming unprotected) household in the muggle world.

5 - More strategy, less grouping the Death Eaters up and letting them get caught red-handed in the Ministry. The Death Eaters should operate like any terrorist organisation, in cells that barely communicate and of which only Voldemort is aware of all. For every magical ready to fight directly, there should be sleeper agents, informants, mercenaries and creatures operating in loose communication and association with one another. Hell, even just encouraging your average criminals to get out on the streets and cause mayhem in Voldemort's name helps build an image of an omnipotent opponent, who can strike anywhere, anytime.

6 - Tying on to number five, there should be a total lack of clarity about Voldemort and his forces, a la OOTP. The news outlets should be flooded with false information and scaremongering, Death Eaters should fraudulently report emergencies to the Aurors to draw them out and at the same time spread distrust amongst members of the public. He should rarely ever show his face, and the crimes committed in his name would set the stage for his eventual arrival, once the time was right.

7 - In duels, make him perform incredible feats of magic. Throwing out AKs like they're going out of fashion is cool, sure, but I think Voldemort could really be served by a wider repertoire of spells.

8 - In the end, things are "monster" scary when you don't understand them at all. Things are "Hitler and the Nazis" scary when you can understand only too well their aims and how far they will go to achieve them. To me, Voldemort should sit firmly in the middle - real enough with achievable aims that make him an idol to his supporters and terrifying in a long-term sense to his enemies, yet inhuman and cruel enough that he doesn't lose the mystique of being something else, in the most terrifying sense of the word.

** I started my fic when I was only 15, so my portrayal of Voldemort started off very cliche and mustache-twirling, cackling and casual violence. When I returned and finished the story 10 years later, my interpretation changed dramatically and I wish I had kept it consistent:

I present Voldemort as a very rational, intelligent, convincing, borderline-charming figure. Like, the audience and OC protagonist KNOW he's the villain, but let their guard down around him after a while. Then when the climactic twist occurs, you see the madness behind the method.

Make your Voldemort dangerously clever...maybe even smarter than your hero. Make the audience question their own viewpoint and predictions.

** I actually liked Voldemort before he became Voldemort; back when he was Tom Riddle.

Tom Riddle was charismatic, charming, intelligent, persuasive/convincing; exactly the kind of villain that I love. While Voldemort on the other hand was more of a Hollywood kind of villain.

I love the smart villains, the villains that are able to talk you into joining their side and the ideas that they have actually sound good, even if the way they are going about the goal is bad.

And that was Tom Riddle, he got followers early on, and seemed pretty popular at Hogwarts. He worked hard to get his followers and clearly he must have done something right, otherwise they wouldn't have followed him.

I agree with what someone else said that Tom should win, at least one big win.

If you want to make an AU I suggest narrowing down the Horcruxes to two or three; so that way he's still a psycho path but he is still charismatic/intelligence/persuasive.

I'm currently reading: Solace in Shadows; and so far I'm loving the way the author is writing Tom, that is how I envisioned him or at least very close to it anyway. (At least from what I've read so far).

Bellatrix is someone who pulls the wings off of flies because she likes to and it satisfies something inside of her. Voldemort will pull the wings off because the fly was getting on his nerves. Nothing more, nothing less. That to me is far more chilling than an outright sadist.

***** Bellatrix throws out the Cruciatus like its going out of style.

Voldemort just kills anything that slights him.

** I can't remember which fic it was, but I remember seeing one where Harry is forced to make a choice between saving two different people while Voldemort taunts his petty morality. It wasn't really stereotypically scary but it did really put me on edge.

** Since readers will automatically assume that Voldemort is going to be the big bad, make his rise to power slow, logical, and inevitable. Imo, having several moments where characters could have stopped Voldemort's rise, but decided not to because they think he isn't a serious threat can really ratchet up the tension. Make the good guys suffer significant losses and fight for every inch of success, so the readers are convinced that there is a good chance the hero might not succeed. Having more than just a hint of desperation on the side of the good guys and making their road for victory helps round their side out, but also makes Voldemort more frightening because he truly is difficult to defeat.

  What are things one can weave into scenes to make Voldemort scary?
#+end_quote

You know the trope of a self-insert being good at magic because they can sense something new that wasn't there before?

The horcrux in Harry's head can do the same thing with love. Anything that Harry loves the horcrux can detect and corrupt like the book or the diadem is able too. The stronger the affection the more power the horcrux can express. It can do this because love is alien to it and allows the horcrux to easily follow the connections it creates.

** Of all the HP fanfics I've read, the best example of a scary antagonist is also my favourite fanfic and one of the best known ones out there; linkffn(5782108)

And even though it's 122 chapters long I can't really say much about it because it would spoil the story. It's an extremly slow burn thriller mystery kind of thing that ends up being very effective. I suggest you read it if you haven't already, and if you have, just think about it.

The author himself is happy to give tips on how to write an antagonist, though;

The author's first rule of fanfiction; Rule One: If you do anything to increase the protagonist's power, or make their life easier, you must also amplify their opponent or add extra difficulties to their life. You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star. Otherwise, even if it is well-written in all other ways, your story will suck because the reader will know to expect an unending string of easy victories, leading them to neither wonder or care about what happens next. The Mary Sue is not defined by her power being too strong, but by her challenges being too easily overcome.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Try to touch some of the "forbidden" topics, so to speak. Rape(men, women and children), body mutilation, burying alive etc. Maybe add a bit of emotional manipulation. For example presenting his victims with a choice: either they murder their friends themselves or an innocent child dies.
