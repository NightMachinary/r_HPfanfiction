Sometimes I read these promising stories, well thought out, lots of reviews, author notes on future plans... And then suddenly nothing.

I always wonder what happened to them... What made them stop?


** There are many things which could stop an author from writing, such as:

- Life

- Death

- "Writer's block"

- Loss of account

- Loss of motivation

- Plain forgot about the fic

- Change of fandom or interests

etc.

*** How can you forget about a fic? Like, it's there every time you go through the "my works" or similar pages, even if you are looking for a different one. You still get email notifications. You probably spent hours if not days working on it. How does that just slip your mind?

**** I've forgotten about one before - my first one. Found a 100% complete fic on my hard drive one day, googled it, and realized that I had started to post it on a ffn account I didn't realize I had, but never finished. It had been nearly ten years.

Boy was my face red.

**** I once found a fic on ffnet which I thought was interesting and got super into it. Around the 20k mark i began to read the ANs and realised I wrote it. Arrogant maybe ? Idk. It was really embarrassing later. But I've forgotten a lot of fics. Actually I recently discovered that I never posted around 30k worth of chapters to a story I wrote about a year ago.

** One of my stories a plot line I started writing accidentally became too close to home. I haven't yet been able to return to it, though I hope to at some point.

Another one I had plenty of positive reviews but a few really negative ones just ended up getting to me and I ended up hating it. Once something becomes a chore, it kills a story. I'm hoping to return to that one at some point soon too, but right now I have more fun writing other stuff.

** I am not an author of an abandoned story, but my sister is. For her the change was that her perspective in life radically shifted as she grew up and the stories she once found to be engaging and interesting suddenly seemed childish to her, including her own. Eventually she grew to resent Harry Potter as a whole depite loving it so much as a child due to the way people continued to harrass her for her unfinished work.

*** I will never get the entitlement of people who continue to harass authors to update. They owe you NOTHING. You are reading this for free, it's a hobby for the writer and if they choose to stop they can do that. Also, these people who always write comments on regularly updated Fanfics and ask for an update??? As if they will update their story after you demanded it. Sometimes I wish you could block from reading your story altogether

** For the Spiral, I stepped back and recognized that I had planned a tragic course for the characters and I could tell even the rare devoted followers were getting burnt out by it. Yet, I can't change what I intended to write. It's like the events have happened (more or less) and to move forward I would have to simply lay them out as planned or the story won't be 'right'.

For Polter, I hit a knot where too many things can happen next and I have to decide which path makes the most sense. Then I have to decide which path would be most interesting to recount; some things really are better if you just tell rather than show. It's like finding an error in stitching where you have to back out a few rows and you find another error which had caused the first one, but the fix for that opens up a whole different set of possible patterns to follow. Essentially a case of analysis paralysis.

** It got away from me. I had a great plot and some great ideas and the story just flowed from my fingers onto the keyboard. But then after 60,000 words in I looked at my outline and everything was different. The characterization wasn't what I wanted, things weren't happening how and where and when I had intended them to happen. So I read my own story, and I hated it. As I was writing it felt right, but as a reader it was trash.

** I have one fic with a bad case of author's block. Basically, it started out as a oneshot, but people kept asking for more and I had the idea for a longer fic floating around. So I decided to just use the oneshot as chapters 1 and 2 for the longer story. And that part worked.

But looking back, my intended plot surpassed my ability as a writer, leading to a few compromises I'm not happy with today. But the biggest issue is that a lot of scenes I envisioned work well in a movie or video game (long, panoramic shots with music underlying it, chases, tense spy stuff), but don't do so well in writing. I had basically envisioned scenes for a movie, but turning that into a written word without constantly repeating myself, well is still beyond my abilities tbh. I can write naval battles and space stuff no sweat, but give me a something akin to an Indian Jones Temple scene, and I'll stare at a blank screen for hours.

** I had a decently successful pair of fics (by decently successful, I mean 300ish favs, so not actually huge) on ff.net for Mass Effect, but had some weird technical issues to the point where I literally couldn't access the account.

As in, I attempted to log in with my old email and it gave me a brand new account. I didn't have the willpower to repost on other sites or under a new account, so they're just abandoned now. It's not really a huge loss, considering they were written some years ago, and I can see some pretty big flaws, but it's rather irritating I can't go back and fix them at the very least.

** So, coming from the perspective of someone who's just picked up their fic after about 2 years' abandonment, and in no particular order:

- I wrote myself into a corner and wasn't able to write myself out of it - I'm still not happy with its resolution, but it completely killed my ability to write the story.
- I was (and remain) unhappy with how flat the characters felt - as a fix-it, and predominantly featuring OCs, I didn't like how little conflict I was injecting into the story.
- I wasn't comfortable with the writing style - as I matured as a writer (partly through writing the fanfic!) I started to realise that it didn't entirely suit me.

I've picked the story up again in part because of lockdown and in part because I'm trying to get back into writing - but the mental load of writing fanfiction, especially if you get not very much feedback for it, can be pretty hefty!

** I either didn't have a clear idea of where I wanted my story to go next, got caught up in real life or another project, or just lost motivation. Then once I'd drifted away from that fic I just couldn't drag myself back to it. Doesn't stop me from feeling bad when I scroll through my Ao3 page and see that 'Chapters: 3/?' with the last update from 2 years ago, though.

Edit: just realized that this is the HPFanfiction sub, not the general fanfic sub. I've never actually posted anything on Ao3 for HP specifically but abandoning fics is universal throughout fandoms so I think? What I said applies

** For me, it's almost always depression stopping me. Not just because depression is inherently demotivating (it definitely is that), but also because like... When I write a tense or emotional scene, I also /feel/ that emotion, and when I'm already unstable then it's hard to write scenes that are emotionally intense, even though that's usually all I want to write.

That aside, I like what some of these other comments said because it's totally true: the plans I have for a story can fall through in the process of writing it, and I have to reassess. Or I can be bogged down by my own inability to tackle something in a previous chapter & it's put me in an untenable position later. Or I get frustrated that I can't put what's in my head on the page -- the unfortunate plight of all artists, I'm afraid.
