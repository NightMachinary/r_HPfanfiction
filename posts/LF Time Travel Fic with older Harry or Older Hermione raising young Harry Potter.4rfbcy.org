** linkffn(11494764) This fic has a 7th year Hermione travel back to Halloween 1981, and help raise Harry. I enjoyed it, but I have some strange tastes so IDK. It was well written enough for me

There's another one I can't remember the name of where Harry raises himself with Remus and Sirius, after the magical world is a dick to him in the future. I'll see if I can find it.

  The war is won, but at a terrible price. Seventy-six years later, Hermione decides to go back and make things right, once and for all. Time-travel fic. Eventual Harry/Hermione, some mature content. Reviews appreciated! NOT OLD HERMIONE/HARRY!

** I keep seeing people post "I want a fic like this!" and I'm sitting on about 15k words of fic like that that I'm unlikely to make much progress on any time soon. Should I post it with a note saying I'm unlikely to complete it ever? Should I make a miscellany story and post random things to it, as if they're serials in /Amazing Stories/ or something?

*** Post it now and get feedback on the first part, which could help you in continuing the story. You'll just have to deal with people begging for more in reviews. Constructive feedback can help you improve in general, not just for this story.

**** I'm not as much concerned about abandoning the story; it's more that I have another story to work on.

I don't have much hope for constructive feedback, based on the reviews I've gotten and the ones I've seen other people getting. I'll probably work out how to opt out of getting review, favorite, and follow messages by the time I publish the third chapter.
