  "And might I remind you that our officers were attacked!" Richardson proclaims in a scratchy voice.

  "And might I remind you that those were war staves the guards were carrying? Your so-called officers barely escaped being turned into glowing piles of something greasy."

  "Illegal weapons sir! Clearly against international conventions!"

** I had some ideas about that in a story. The minimum length of a wand would've been 8.88 inches and the max 13.13 inches and the longer your wand was, the stronger your abilities were. But the elder wand would have been 7.777777 inches long subverting the rules. Ne er got far enough to really get into the wandlore though.
