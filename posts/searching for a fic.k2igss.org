:END:
i think its on ffnet, where Harry and Hermione are transported into an alternate dimension and their souls emerged with their bodies, of Hadrian something and Sirius Black, combining the 2 personalities. there's also professor riddle/marvolo i think, and they found each other with Hermione reading the newspaper of the 'boy who lived' when Hadrian survived the avada curse again, and sent him mail that made him say 'i solemly swear I am up to no good'.
