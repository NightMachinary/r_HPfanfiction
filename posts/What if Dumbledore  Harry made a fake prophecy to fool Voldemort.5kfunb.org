Okay, so, someone linked one of my short mini-fics on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]...you know, [[https://redd.it/5gzk1j][the one where Dobby sends Harry to Beauxbatons]].

Someone in the comments said something about Harry being the prophesied chosen one, I objected, that happened yesterday, and today, I got an idea.

Now, as those of you who have read the books several times know, prophecies aren't binding; Dumbledore points this out in book 6 and observes that there's nothing forcing Harry to stand against Voldemort, except Harry himself (aside from, you know, Voldemort trying to kill him).

   :END:
But, think about Voldemort's experiences. He's muggle-raised, he doesn't know how prophecies work (Harry doesn't until Dumbledore sets him right, either).

He learns about a fragment of a prophecy that tells /"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies..."/

When Voldemort goes to try and avert this bit of the prophecy he knows, his unblockable instant-death curse is inexplicably /blocked/ by a 1 year old child (actually, by his mother), and Voldemort is disintegrated by the backlash.

10 years onward, Harry's at Hogwarts, Voldemort tries to take the Philosopher's Stone...he's foiled /again/, by the same damn kid!

4 years later, Voldemort implements his plan; he /finally/ gets a new body, one with Harry's blood in it to protect himself against whatever crazy innate power the child possesses...except the effing Potter somehow /blocks/ his killing curse again, this time with an Expelliarmus, out-matches him in a battle of wills (during the Priori Incantatum effect), and slips away from under his nose. Also, in the meantime, said Potter killed Slytherin's Basilisk and later managed to repel a hundred dementors at once.

   :END:
It's pretty understandable at this point that Voldemort would think that the foretold prophecy is somehow magically binding, hence why he spends book 5 trying to get to the prophecy orb in the Department of Mysteries so he can learn the whole thing and find a way to save himself.

--------------

Which leads me to my idea:

What if (knowing that Voldemort has been convinced of the power of prophecy) Dumbledore hatched a plan (possibly including Harry should the latter succeed in learning Occlumency) to swap the prophecy orb with a fake? One that says something along the lines of 'the Dark Lord's screwed, et-cetera et-cetera, if he gives up and repents he has a chance to live, otherwise he's a goner.'?

** I've read a few fics where Dumbledore did fake the prophecy, although those are manipulative/evil Dumbledore fics & Harry isn't involved.

** I can't really speak for pre-horcrux Volde, but the one we see in the graveyard and after seems like the type who would take that as proof that prophecies are bunk rather than proof Harry would beat him. Just my 2p.

That said, I like the idea, though when I first read it I thought it would be about faking the original prophecy - that is, there either was no prophecy or there was, but Snape was tricked into reporting the fake prophecy or in on it. So he could take back something other than the one we know, or the one we know could be the fake one? Honestly not sure which would be more interesting. Then again, I like prophecies as a non-central plot device.

** The idea is interesting, the only ones I read with a fake Prophecy have been that the entire Prophecy was fake or the Prophecy was "The Dark Lord will take yet another L to his name as will the leader of the light, he will bang infinite chicks, Gang Gang" and Dumbles changes it to Canon. I even read one where the entire Prophecy process is fake and because everyone OTHER than Dumbledore believed in it, it became true.

Needs a bit of work. There's no reason to hide that prophecy from the Dark Lord. But it shouldn't be too hard to come up with a prophecy that you /would/ need to hide.

*** ~nose boop~

The point of making a fake prophecy is to maneuver Voldemort to find it and adjust his actions appropriately, silly.

...Oh, wait, I get it. It needs to be believable because if it just said 'the Dark Lord's right buggered, he is', Voldemort would probably suspect something was up, and why was THAT being hidden from him?

Yeah, maybe it could be 'unless the Dark Lord finds (nonexistent item) in the (place where he'd be easy to ambush), he's done for'.

** While not exactly a fake prophecy, linkffn(Prophecy Averted) has a take that might interest you. One-shot.

  Single point of divergence, one-shot. The Death Eaters succeed in getting the Prophecy to Voldemort, and this rather changes matters. Lord Voldemort wants to kill Harry Potter, yes, but he won't be the toy of Fate.

** Nah, the original prophecy's already a fakey-fake. I wonder why Volde thinks that prophecies are all that though. He's oddly fixated on 'fate' being a thing despite his otherwise independent attitude about his own actions.
