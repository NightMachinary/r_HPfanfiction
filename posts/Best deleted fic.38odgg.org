What was the best fic you read that was deleted or taken down?


** VINCET and its sequel by nos tres reges. That was pretty damn good. There must be a PDF lying around somewhere. I have one, but I'm at work atm... will have a dig around in a bit.

*** For those of us who are unfamiliar with it, are you able to give a brief summary? Thanks.

**** The author's summary for VINCET:

#+begin_quote
  Some people, when crushed underfoot, simply buckle and lie dead still. Some find inner strength and fight back. Yet some others pawn their Aunt's wedding ring and hex their relatives. Shades of grey, argues Harry.
#+end_quote

And for the sequel, Vultus Serpentis:

#+begin_quote
  Every so often, a momentous individual makes their way through the world, making ripples in their path. Dumbledore and Voldemort were two such men, sending waves crashing, obliterating all else, and Harry grows sick of wearing a life preserver.
#+end_quote

I have a copy as well, if anyone's after it. (As an .rtf, but I can easily save to epub, mobi, and PDF.)

***** If you could post an ePub or Mobi, I'd appreciate it. I read it ages ago and thought I had it but turns out I don't!

Thanks.

** Pretty much anything by hgfan1111. "Brighter than Sunshine" and "Learning to Fly" are the first ones that come to mind.

Brighter Than Sunshine: Official Summary: The smoke clears from the Final Battle and the world is not the same. But even in the darkness, a light can still shine, leading lost souls home. AU Begun Post-HBP, disregards parts of DH. Canon pairings.

Basically, Harry and Ginny have all of their memories wiped.

Learning to Fly: Official Summary: Harry is nearly broken by casual, well-meant cruelty. It isn't until he falls ill that he begins to find his way back home. AU Fic

Weasley boys tell Harry that Ginny is a non-starter for him, even after he's gotten rid of Voldy. Lots of angst and a seriously pissed off witch or two in there.

*** I liked learning to fly. It was different and full of angst but definitely had some good moments. I would like to read the other one.
