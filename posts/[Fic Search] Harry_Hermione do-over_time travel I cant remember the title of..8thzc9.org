I remember it starts out on the train to kings crossing I forget which year but hermione gets a letter from harry during the ride she forgets about till later when shes with her parents which when she reads its written in harrys blood if i remember correctly. More details are that harry died writing the letter in blood and mentions hermione abbandoned him over the half blood princes potion book in the letter. During his will reading he leaves hermione the potion book and said she should ask the goblins what the will used to say before he changed it in which the old one stated he left her everything. All these points lead her to kill herself on harrys grave i believe by use of a reducto and ends up in the after life where she runs in to Lily potter. After a bit she sends harry and hermione back to 4th or 5th year I wanna say with altered memories so theyd keep some abilites auch as apparation. The altered memory made them think hermione died at the fight at the department of mysteries. Sorry about lack of commas and such in this post but its been bugging me for a while not being able to locate this story.

  Angsty story based on Broomstick Flyers story 'Please Believe Me'. Heavy Hermione bashing to start, but will be H/Hr. Timetravel, AU, and limited soulbond. Please Read & Review Upping the rating due to language.
