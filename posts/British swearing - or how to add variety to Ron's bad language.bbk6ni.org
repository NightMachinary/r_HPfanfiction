I quite often have non-Brits from this sub asking me for advice on whether their character's swearing is authentic, so I thought some of you might be interested in the below article, which also handily ranks some popular swear words into categories of naughtiness.

** I take issue with that article - not a single one of the 'mild' ones are swearwords! Certainly not 'ginger'! And 'bastard' certainly isn't considered a strong swearword here.

*** I supposed to do with context- it's Ofcom that's compiled this so they're talking about tv. Perhaps they're referring to ginger being used as an insult/slur, although I agree I raised my eyebrows at that. I would consider arse and bloody as very mild swear words though - wouldn't expect to hear them on cbbc for example!

*** Where is "here" for you? Everywhere I've been in the UK (am English) considers "bastard" to be a pretty severe swearword. It's a word my parents would have slapped me for saying up until being about fifteen, and one I'd rebuke a child for saying now. I'd put it on a rough par with "shit", "bitch", at an estimate. If "fuck" is A-list, "bastard" would be B-list.

You're right about "ginger" though. Though gingers are the collective butt of a lot of jokes, so there's probably a "social justice" thing going on there.

**** Cheltenham. As an adult it is really used in a humorous way as in ‘ah you bastard!'. I would never use fuck in my day to day language nor shit, I'd rate bastard along with bollocks as a light, barely curse word. I don't actually use any of the words I'd rate as actual swearwords at all (fuck, shit, c-word etc).

***** That's your own opinion though. I'm not offended by any particular swearwords - I consider them all simply to be words. I use a lot of harsh language in my own daily life... but then, I'm Northern. None of that changes what is and isn't profanity, though. A good measure of profanity is what would or wouldn't be acceptable to say to a child, or for them to say to you - and it's no more acceptable to call a child a "little bastard" than it would to call them a "piece of shit", "cockwomble", or "cunt".

Invariably? I knew a ginger girl at school, who grew up to be a huge whale with a bright orange afro. Not really beauty if you ask me :-P

** It's worth bearing in mind that with the more obscure swear words, rarely will anyone be using ALL of them. You're raised around a certain amount of them, and go onto to pepper your language with those. Eg. I say ‘prat', ‘twat', ‘prick' but have never gone round saying ‘pillock'. So don't over do it - pick a few funny ones and run with them for a character.

** That list omits the most important part: context. As a very simple example, were I to call a female colleague a "minger" I might well end up getting fired, but shouting "Fuck!" would probably make people laugh - unless clients were around. Like "minger", ginger, bint and munter are also insults rather than swearwords.

"Fuck" is so versatile. "The weather is fucking awful" will probably be allowed in most adult environments but "Fuck you!" wouldn't.

*** *Seven dirty words*

The seven dirty words are seven English-language words that American comedian George Carlin first listed in 1972 in his monologue "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television". The words are: shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.At the time, the words were considered highly inappropriate and unsuitable for broadcast on the public airwaves in the United States, whether radio or television. As such, they were avoided in scripted material, and bleep censored in the rare cases in which they were used. Broadcast standards differ in different parts of the world, then and now, although most of the words on Carlin's original list remain taboo on American broadcast television.

** I disagree with a lot of that list. Minging and munter were both acceptable to say in front of a teacher, which is the clearest definition of a swear word IMO.

And clunge was made up by The Inbetweeners as a fake word alternative to minge that could be said on TV - the whole purpose of it is that it isn't a swear word.

Equally, ginger? As a Scot I'm insulted.

There was even a good Guardian article on the modern evolution of language and how invented words catch on, and clunge was one of their examples (they charted use, it was quite impressive how it suddenly exploded almost immediately after it was coined in 2008).
