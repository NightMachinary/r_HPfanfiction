I've been in search of a story for a couple of years, and I don't know if the author pulled it or I just can't remember the title. But basically Harry and Draco could turn into dragons and were mates? Draco was a Spirit dragon named Kirios and Harry was a Wrath dragon named Tanek, and they were trying to defeat Voldemort. Last time I read it was 2009/2010 so I really can't remember the title of it, and I feel that the author might of deleted it, but I figured it couldn't hurt to see if someone had any clue about it.
