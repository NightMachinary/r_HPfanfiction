Ideally have this happen just before Sirius would've made his grand exit from life, if only because I'd rather keep him alive.

Bonus points if said Mage is a Human that looks identical to Lily Potter, if only for how much it would mess with certain people's /cough/Snape/cough/ heads.


** How about just making Lily Potter, Vanquisher of the Dark Lord Voldemort in an alternate dimension, coming out of the Veil?

This Lily lost both her husband and son on that Halloween night, but she managed to destroy the body of the Dark Lord. In the following week, she saved the Longbottoms and killed two Lestranges in the process. Over the next decade, she, Sirius, Remus, and Severus led the effort in hunting down Voldemort's Horcruxes. Finally on Halloween 1991, she managed to track down and destroy the Diadem of Ravenclaw. Voldemort, still lingering as a wraith in Albanian forest, was permanently vanquished.

However, this victory came at a steep cost. Sirius, Remus, and Severus all died at various stages of this dangerous quest. Lily locked herself deep in the Department of the Mysteries, trying desperately to bring her family and friends back. Eventually, she settled on the concept of dimensional travel. For almost 5 solitary years, she worked to modify the Veil into a gateway to a world where Harry and her friends are still alive.

She came out some time before Harry entered this room. This Lily was much more powerful than Bellatrix and slightly mad, the Death Eaters never had a chance...

*** Interesting idea, but probably would've been better off as it's own prompt post, if I'm being honest.

My original post was more about seeing just how much chaos a spellcaster from a world where their repetoire is almost entirely high-impact combat spells would cause on the Harry Potter world. I only included the Lily lookalike bit because funny.

** I would love to see a well written HP / Warcraft crossover honestly. I've been toying with the idea of writing my own for quite a while. But english isn't my mothertongue and I lack experience. Maybe I should still try.

A mage would be fun, but something with an even weirder magic, and who looks like evil incarnate, such as a Shadow Priest, a Warlock or a Death Knight would be even better I think.

(And actually mages from Azeroth do know mundane spells. Enchanted brooms that sweep on their own, and a lot more. Rommath did rebuild half of Silvermoon in a night with magic after all. But yeah, they do know a ton of destructive shit. I'd really like to see a wizard face in front of a meteor-shower summoning maniac who cast without a wand.)

  A Weapon. A Hero. But now... a loose end. Harry Potter resolves to destroy the enemies who betrayed him on his terms, only to find all his plans torn asunder when he's summoned to a new world plagued with the same enemies as his own.
