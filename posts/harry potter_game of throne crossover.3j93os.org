please, if you have a recommendation story in which harry is reborn in the game of throne's timelines. what will happen ? what family he will come from ? what change can he brings to westeros


** I think the reason you have so few answers and votes, is because what you are looking for is really niche and only exist in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Game-of-Thrones-Crossovers/224/8324/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10][right crossover section of ff.net]]. So if you just head there you can litterally read all fanfictions written with said premis in an afternoon.

But here are my four favorite crossovers between GoT and HP:

Ongoing:

linkffn(The Difference one man can make)

linkffn(The game of lord voldemort)

linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhall) /This one is finished, but the auther keeps making omakes and AU to the fic./

Semi abandoned

linkffn(A game of magic)

linkffn(11233702/1/Beyond-the-Wall)

  Harry did not intend to play these lord's games as people suffered. He was given a new chance, to be a nobody as he always wanted, but he could not ignore the suffering about him. So he would show them the power of change, of invention and, if necessary, of magic.

  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

** Yeah, as [[/u/KayanRider]] said, it's a very niche 'market'. I'd just head on to the x-over section on ff.net and read the longest ones and the ones with a good amount of reviews. I can only think of one fanfic which is /completed/ (plenty of good in-progress ones) and semi-good in that x-over. I'll get back to you.

edit: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11255223/1/The-Wizard-of-Harrenhal][The Wizard of Harrenhal]] Quite ridden with clich√©s but not a bad read at all, if I remember correctly
