The kind of fic I'm talking about is stuff like "C'est La Vie" or "The Long Journey Home" or "Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is".

Just experienced, powerful Harry (fem!Harry) that has prodigy-like skills.

No harems!!

Bashing is okay though not preferred. if the story itself is good. Preferably on the older side (13 and up) or characterized appropriately if aged down.

Alternate fics/other dimensions are a HUGE plus though not required.

Thanks so much!


** Well, I'll do my best.

The Pureblood Pretense, linkffn(7613196) -- fem!Harry, extremely magically powerful, potions prodigy.

Circular Reasoning, linkffn(2680093) -- a more experienced, powerful, violent Harry.

Wit of the Raven, linkffn(2740505) -- smart & talented Ravenclaw Harry.

Escape to Darkness, linkffn(4815342) -- older, more powerful & experienced Harry that trained with Grindewald.

Rather well-known, but Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, linkffn(5353809).

By the Divining Light, linkffn(5201703).

Magicks of the Arcane, linkffn(8303194).

Harry Potter and the Warrior's Code, linkffn(10673953) -- kind of fits.

Again and Again, linkffn(8149841) -- definitely fits. By the same author, "Rebirth", linkffn(6486690), "Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness," linkffn(6163339), and linkffn(12241492) "Mirror of Paths" also mostly fit.

So you claim that women are uncreative and lack emotions. That is some heavy prejudice against women, and therefore by definition misogynistic.

*********** Yes, it is very dependent on such things. A Female author can't write a male character, it's a rule of thumb. Either way, misogyny implies that I hate women, or dislike them. Even if the comment was really written how you interpreted, it doesn't show that I hate women, it just shows that I hate how they write. You people really need to learn the definitions of the words you throw about. I've seen too many people in recent time throwing around the word misogynist, racist, transphobic etc... when in reality they don't understand how it fits into the context. They just see the word woman and then when it's in conjunction with anything negative, they freak out and call you a women hater, that is exactly what you did.

**** Well, it's a good thing that you're not the one asking for recommendations, isn't it? The OP never mentioned anything in regards to romantic preferences.

Anyway, onto forced romantic plots -- I quite agree, it really is a bit contrived.

You know, I never quite understood why people wrote fics shipping Harry and obscure female characters with 2 lines or less in canon, or with Harry and fifty girls in a harem solely due to his overwhelming charm that makes people want to fall into bed with him, none of whom he has anything in common with, but that's certainly not at all contrived wish-fulfilment.

***** That is true, relationships in most Harry Potter fics feel largely forced, because the fact of the matter is, Harry was never meant to have a romantic pairing. At least, if he was going to be The-Boy-Who-Lived, Chosen One, Harry. If he's supposed to be all independent and intelligent, why can't he clearly see that him being who he is, means that he can never be with someone? It never worked in canon, it won't work in fanon.

There are lots of Harry/Draco stories where there's actual growth in their characters which gradually bring them together. I can recommend you some if you want.

That's completely wrong. There was a change in their relationship in the books themselves - Draco not denouncing Harry in DH, Harry saving him in the RoR... JKR herself said that after the war, Draco and Harry were on cordial terms. And that's cannon.

Unless you think you understand these two characters much more then the person who created them herself.

As for the hostility, it was abundantly clear that both Harry and Draco were heavily stressed about their respective sons. Does the hostility between Ron and Harry during the quest for Horcrux make them enemies?

** "Children's Crusade", linkffn(6989327): postwar, epilogue compliant, and dimensional travel. This fic is one I would consider 'hidden gem'.

"Harry Potter: Air Elemental", linkffn(11995519): Harry has picked up a powerful new ability.

"My Slytherin Harry", linkffn(6160345): Ginny's first person POV, she had all Tom's memory, and was unstoppable with Harry together.

"Ruthless", linkffn(10493620): Do you consider M/F/M relationship harem?

"Seventh Horcrux", linkffn(10677106): Hah! Another time this story fits someone's criteria well. Yes, this Harry was a prodigy.

"Stages of Hope", linkffn(6892925): Harry was definitely very powerful, but not too powerful. He was also severely damaged. Dimensional travel.

"The Accidental Animagus", linkffn(9863146): Harry became a cat animagus at age 5.

"Unspeakable Things", linkffn(6473434): Author introduced the idea that Harry and Ginny were 'sports', so DoM took the effort to train into super assassins/spies.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

  AU Harry is more money-conscious when he arrives at Gringotts with Hagrid. He's not going to let the wonder of magic take away his common sense and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics.

  In 1986, Harry meets his first friend, a tiny green snake. That friend will change everything. - A retelling of canon with a darker, smarter, more cunning Harry in possession of a pet snake and a sense of self-worth. There are some reworked canon scenes in the beginning, but almost all scenes are original after the first few chapters.

** I am kind of surprised that no-one mentioned FirePhoenix8's fic "The Black Heir" linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir]]) and its sequel, "Vindico Atrum" linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4582846/1/Vindico-Atrum]]) These fics have a quite powerful dark Harry is Durmstrang. It is slash, but well-written slash. Unfortunately, Vindico Atrum is unfinished, but in no way abandoned. Just on hiatus. Note that the first few chapters of The Black Heir have a pre-Durmstrang Harry, but after that the tale is quite gripping.
