:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a specific fic where Hermione and Narcissa post war had a one night stand but when Hermione wakes up, Narcissa is gone. I think they continue to have feelings for each other but they never acknowledge it. 5 (or so) years later they become teachers at Hogwarts. The close proximity forces them to confront why they avoided each other since that day. Eventually they do get together.

I believe it was quite a few chapters. If I had to guess maybe 20-45 chapters? Take that with a grain of salt.

I also may be confusing it with a different fic but Krum may have accompanied Hermione to a ministry ball wearing robes similar to his school ones and it was a bit awkward.
