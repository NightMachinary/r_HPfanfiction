I remember a old fic I read when I was flirting with Fanfiction years ago about 09-10.

Harry and Draco being the last viable males of the Black Bloodline are both viable to be the Black Heir. To bad for Draco Cygus, Druella and another pair of the elder Blacks are still around. Unwilling to allow the name and Black Moneys fall into the hands of Lucius Malfoy they seek out the only other available heir, Harry Potter.

I also remember Harry waking up in the Blacks home and running into I believe, Cassiopeia who noticed that Harry has been using his magic either planned or unplanned to produce a Notice Me Not Charm around him.

If someone can help me out I'd love it

** Honestly, there are so many "Black family doesn't want Draco to get their shit" fics that it's practically impossible to find it.

I wish you good luck though.

*** Genuine question: What fic? I've literally never read a fic that features the Black family not wanting Draco to get their money. I've read heaps where Sirius doesn't want to, but the rest of the Black family?

**** I couldn't name them, but there are lots of fics that explore the idea of Sirius not being disowned because they didn't want the Malfoy's to get their hands on their money.
