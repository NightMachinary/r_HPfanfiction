Yes please see the title, I am wondering because I love Harry Potter and I love DR SEUSS! I love the Green Eggs and Ham and Fish Out of Water and Horton Hears a Who and Grinch Stole Christmas and also yes Go Dog Go and Fox in Socks and Cat In The Hat! :) Is there any crossovers where it is Harry visiting all the DR SEUSS universe books? Maybe he does have to help fix things for everyone before he can go home? :)


** How would that even work? The Dr Seuss universe and the HP one don't exactly mesh well.

*** Skele TICKLES I thought the point of crossovers was that they are DIFFERENT TV SHOWS AND BOOK SERIES'? They are NOT SUPPOSED TO BE MIXED TO BEGIN WITH! It does not matter HOW MUCH or HOW LITTLE they would mesh, because they were not meant to mesh as a baseline. But people still do Harry Potter/Doctor Who, and harry potter/Star wars, and harry potter/marvel universe.

**** Certain stories are easier to cross with others. For example, something like Star Wars is easy; Star Wars is filled with action and adventure, which fits the HP series well, and already has canon examples of mystical forces. Because the two series are similar in that regard, it's easy to cross them. Similar applies to the other series you mentioned.

With Dr Seuss, it's essentially the exact opposite of the HP series. There isn't much to crossover in the first place. I mean, what exactly would even happen in a Dr Seuss/HP crossover?

****** Sure. I'm not saying it's impossible to do, but it's hard to form a coherent storyline around it.

******* :( Just because it might be hard to do does not mean nobody should ever try. Writers are super creative, yes I am sure someone can come up with something! :)

But yes, so nobody has ever done it before? :(

Well then I do want to be the first to do it if nobody has. :o Thank you Skeleticklies!
