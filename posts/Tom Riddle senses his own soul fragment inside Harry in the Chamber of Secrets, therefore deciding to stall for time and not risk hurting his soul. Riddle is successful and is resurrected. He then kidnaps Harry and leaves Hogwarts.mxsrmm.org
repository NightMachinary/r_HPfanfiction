I was thinking during the journey, while neither wants to get close to the other, an attachment is formed anyway and they become somewhat /friendly/.

Tom teaches Harry, Harry wants to kill Tom first but then warms up to him/gets corrupted by him etc.


** In most fics where Voldemort discovers Harry is a horcrux he intends to put him under the Draught of the Sleeping Dead or recruit him. Canon Voldemort would likely think "I can do without a portion of my soul" and would still aim to kill Harry.

*** Honestly Harry is not a normal horcrux.

I imagine you might be able to kill harry in a way that does not affect his soul

and just let voldemorts soul piece stay in the corpse

**** Well in Secrets of the Darkest Art it's stated that the horcrux is the opposite of a normal soul. While a normal soul remains undamaged even if the body is destroyed, a horcrux is dependent of its container and will also die if its container is damaged beyond repair (i.e. dies). The horcrux in Nagini is destroyed when Neville cuts off her head. It's true that we don't know exactly what happens when you have a human horcrux but I would think that all evidences we have so far point to the fact that Harry has to live in order for the horcrux to exist. Of course there is plenty of wiggle room there.

Judging by JK's biblical themes in the story, she could also ascribe to the theory that only humans have a soul and therefore when Harry died, the horcrux could still inhabit the body as a soul replacement, which would have not applied in Nagini's case (if we ignore the whole maledictus thing... for what we know the FB Nagini might not even be the same Nagini that appears in HP).

However, other than Avada Kedavra or maybe the eyes of the Basilisk, I'm not sure of what other killing methods would be there that could prevent the body from being damaged "beyond repair". It's implied that the Horcrux still needs a properly functioning body for it to exist.

***** Its important to remember Neville cut of nagini's head with the sword of Griff which had basilisk infusion.

the question is does a living container stop being a container if it dies.

Like if you used the basilisk sword it would, but whats if you used a normal knife and let the guy bleed to death

the person is dead, but the container is fine

****** That's why I thought that you have a lot of wiggle room with the idea. My interpretation was always that it was not the sword of Gryffindor's powers that destroyed it as much as it was the act of killing Nagini. Harry was bitten by the basilisk and the Horcrux still existed after being healed by Fawkes. Still I did think of the aspect you have suggested and as far as we know, you can't either deny or confirm that you're right.

** This exact prompt is written out in this fic, the only difference is that it's a Tomarry and the opening of the chamber happens during 5th year. It's really good
