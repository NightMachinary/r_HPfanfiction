I love Wattpad, especially all the Draco Malfoy fanfics. does anyone have any (*harry potter character name*) x reader storys/ any hp ships that you like that have a story? I need some more.

here's a list of my top 5 favourites;

1: potter, by lillybrooks ( about a girl named Lilly, who is Harrys fathers brothers daughter. dracoxlilly)

2: Drarry- it was all just a game, by write_me227 ( dracoxharry. goes from 4th year till after the war (8th year is included) and this one made me cry and laugh too many times ngl.")

3: potter? || Draco Malfoy x reader, by seselina ( this one is cool ngl, a lot of twists you weren't expecting.)

4: the dragon princess and the snake, by skippy6804 (ngl this one kind of cheesy and dracos a softie throughout the whole thing, but I still really like it. goes through years 1-7)

5: started with a Slytherin | d.m, by callmeav21 ( this one has no happy ending, and a lot of depression. its also kind of funny at the start.)

*books 2,3,4 and 5 all have smut, some being more detailed and for more chapters than others. if you do enjoy reading smut, Wattpad's being an ass and book, 2 has all the smut removed until further notice, book 3's smut has been moved to inkitt and ao3 under the same title, and 4 and 5 are still on Wattpad as I'm writing this (3/3/21) also if you are reading book 1 for the first time, do not go into the comments, people are horrible and spoil everything.*

let me know if you have any other story, I will read anything, as long as it makes sense. ( i read one once, it went from the 4th book to the first to the 7th and then to the 2nd. I stopped reading it because it was too confusing.)

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/108159581?utm_source=android&utm_medium=link&utm_content=story_info&wp_page=story_details_button&wp_uname=Canis_Major7&wp_originator=gci3XR14lnIf1auQhMtztqCP7PrdlkLZ%2FLmMdI5haY9XmMzoSo7Ah2b0ami0Op24AZzG1GvJjMzwGgZvfiXOCkY9tULUqMiwaFkPkU%2FMiNter2Da59z206s9bUIgneZY][Lollipops]] is fine I think.

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/133170298?utm_source=android&utm_medium=link&utm_content=story_info&wp_page=story_details_button&wp_uname=Canis_Major7&wp_originator=ocEV6kcecXfCfYBVWHTl3P3aBY4IszZ1Q%2B%2BVstVbJgbyKI%2FLfENE6MXYKnAEHoFr9v46AS6HPxMf3SsxbO14cKGVP6kN2xKchHsniOunxLbWT3Hy5yfNmIG8pi7CzHF7][Protego]] is a fun Harry's twin sister story. The pairing is undisclosed.

I read them all when I was 13 or 14 so don't flame me but for Wattpad Harry Potter fanfiction they're good enough I think.
