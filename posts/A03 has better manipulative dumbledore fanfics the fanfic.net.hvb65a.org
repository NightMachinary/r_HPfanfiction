*** Manipulative Dumbledore has so much potential (imagine Dumbledore acting like Tywin Lannister in a really Machiavellian fashion), but those fics never go there. Instead, he's a stuttering idiot who gets outsmarted by a teenager and is left looking like a fool in the political arena by Harry's big /wand/ energy.

*** The ao3 ones tend to have more hurt/comfort, with an emotionally compromised Harry who has panic attacks and needs to be protected by the aforementioned whitewashed Snape, Malfoy, and Voldemort. The FFN versions usually have more edgelord Harry themes, in my experience
