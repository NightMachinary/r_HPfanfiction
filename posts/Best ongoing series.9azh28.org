I'm looking for currently updating, WIP series. Please no Draco, Snape, or Voldemort slash with anyone.


** Lets see:

linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic): a decent Harry/Fleur from a new author who has a lot of support over on DLP. Doesn't portray infidelity as somehow acceptable, which is frankly staggering in the fandom.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): possibly the best world-building besides PotDK and the Skitterleap (my opinion) and the ultimate sub-version of the fandoms cliches.

linkffn(The Mind Arts): one of my top five displays of mind magic already, though with nearly three months of no updates I am beginning to see a direct parallel with Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived (almost the exact same stop point to).

linkffn(Victoria Potter): a revamp of the Alexandra Potter Series from the wordsmith that is taure. Just finished first year yesterday, but still not much in the way of overall plot.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me): possibly the best Harry/OC fic out there, and the author's tumblr shows she is still cracking away.

linkffn(Black Luminary): a pretty good world-building fic, though I am still working my way through this one myself.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Not a tumblr thing, pretty sure not using capitalization has been around for a long, long time (ee cummings, bell hooks).

As for her titles, I'm pretty sure they're lyrics to songs that have inspired each fic, so they don't need to be capitalized. Either way, it's not something I care about, or really mind. I'd much rather read an excellent, unique fic that doesn't have a capitalized title than a mediocre fic that's been done millions of times before and happens to have a title that's capitalized.

** The Innocent series by MarauderLover7. Don't let the OPs username fool you, it's not some sappy ode to Sirius and Remus, although they feature prominently in the story. While long at times, I love the story and am invested in a few of the characters and how things are going to turn out for them. Basic plot without spoiling: Sirius decides to escape years before canon, and "kidnaps" Harry. The story has definitely slowed down but currently on the fourth installment, Intensity. Seems like we've gotten bi-weekly updates lately, but you have plenty to catch up on before you get to worrying about update rate. And I'd be willing to bet it doesn't appear like it's going to break your "no Draco/Snape/Voldemort slash" requirements
