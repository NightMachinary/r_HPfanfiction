:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I feel like I'm so close to remembering this fic. Hermione is head girl and is secretly married to Snape (I can't remember why) after the war. Tonks and Remus, both teachers, keep trying to get an OC new teacher to go after Snape. The OC teacher doesn't like Hermione very much. Finally, Snape yells at the OC "I'm married!" and she gets really mad at Tonks/Remus for encouraging her to hit on a married man.

Maybe this fic was on AO3? It's been driving me nuts! Thank you for helping my poor brain out!


** Did you ever figure this one out?
