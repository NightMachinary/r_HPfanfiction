There are countless Fics (atleast i have the impression of it), that have Harry having an Affair or shags for fun. But are there Fics, that have Ron having a younger Lover too? Whether its an affair or they meet and know each other (long) after he and Hermione are separated doesnt matter.

With "young", i mean young enough to be possibly be his own daughter, but definetely Full age, so THAT shouldnt be a problem.

She is attracted to him and wouldnt reject him, because in her eyes, he is a strong and attractive Person.

Not quite the same, but in "Finally 17!" Rose is attracted to Harry, but she waits for her being Full Age to go for him.
