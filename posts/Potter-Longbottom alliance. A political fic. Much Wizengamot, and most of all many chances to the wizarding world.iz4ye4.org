"Harry, you can't do that." Neville sadly sadly. "You know I agree with you, but that is too fast and too far, especially coming from a Potter."

Harry did not show anything, but internally he agreed. The Potter seat was relativly new. Just a mere 210 years old. In the Wizengamtot it was as if he was an infant. Age and lineage mattered. Very much. Too much in Harrys opinion.

"But this is where our alliance comes in." Harry countered. In terms of age the Potter-Longbottom alliance was very young. Merly 120 years old. But it gained traction quickly. The Potters always pushed the envelope, bold ideas were always coming. Some called them radical. Most tried to dismiss them. Why even listen to such a young house?

But somehow they gained allies fast. The Bones, the Abbots and the Greengrasses were the first to join. And several others come along in the years to follow. However most of them were only minor houses or houses without any cloud in the Wizengamot.

So the Wizengamot mostly smiled and let them spout their ideas. Who cares about waves in a pond when they were the ocean?

But then the unthinkable happend. The Longbottoms joined. It became the Potter-Longbottom alliance. And none, NONE, can claim a more a more distinguished, a more respected, a more weighty seat than the Longbottoms.

Members still shudderd when they think about the time they tried to belittle Neville Longbottom and tried to call him a squib. The repercussions were very costly and reminded them again to not oppose the Longbottoms.

"Of course I will not propose this Neville." Harry was a little too calm for Neville. The other shoe was about to drop.

"You will propose this," Harry continued "obviously:" Neville just knew where Harry was going, He resigned to what he knew what was coming, "I could propose and they would ignore me, but when a Longbottom speaks, magical Britain listens."
