NO ROMANCE! No specific pairing either.I'm looking for fics where Harry has a different kind of relationship with a female character. EDIT: Harry as a big brother to a younger character or OC would be good too


** I would be interested in this too. So hard to find, purely because everyone's so focused on ships to the exclusion of everything else. Maybe you could search on Ao3 and specify gen? Then choose your characters?

Sorry I can't recommend any, I'm racking my brains trying to think of one!

** The only thing that comes to my mind is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2758982/1/Harry-PotterGranger-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][*"Harry Potter Granger and the Philosopher's Stone"*]] - AU in which Harry escapes from highly abusive Dursleys rather early in his life and moves to an orphanage. Later he meets Hermione in Muggle school and gets eventually adopted by the Grangers.

I've only read about half of it and it's been a while, but from what I remember it's really sweet and adorable and very emotional at times. They are really close and always get a bit upset when someone points out that they're not biological siblings. I know you asked for a "big sister" dynamic. While Hermione is obviously only about 10 months older than Harry, in this fic she teases him about that quite a bit and calls him "little brother" all the time. So that may be enough to satisfy what you're looking for. Like I said, I've only read about half of it. Roughly the first half is set before Hogwarts, once they get there it starts to become a retelling of the first year, albeit with a lot of things playing out differently due to Harry and Hermione being basically brother and sister.

*** That would be good too. I just want their relationship to be one of friendship and not one of romance.

** I read a nice story where Harry ran away young and was adopted by a college age girl who becomes big sisterish to him. It's an evil, or single-minded and manipulative, Dumbles, nice sirius and amelia bones story. But I have no idea where it is. It's on FFNet. Somewhere.

**** It is not. I actually think it might have been an abandoned story. Or not. I read it a year ago. Or more. That looks like an interesting story, though.
