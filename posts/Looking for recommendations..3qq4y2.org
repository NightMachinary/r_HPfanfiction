I was wondering if any of you guys know about any fan-fictions that have any special magic that just withes can do, like is touched on in The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville.


** Well there's "The Twenty" by Leyna Rountree, I think that was what you're looking for in a way, and I loved it, personally.

** Well, I have no interest in reading that fic based on its description and I'm not going to scan through 200k+ words just to see what you mean, so perhaps you could elaborate as to what "special magic" witches can perform in said fic?

*** They have this special magic only virgin witches have, and they find a book of spells involving said magic, and use the book to do a really complicated twenty-person virgins-only spell that protects Hogwarts. Any more details would spoil the fic, and I'm sorry but I don't know how to do one of those spoiler tag things.

**** I don't really know any fics like that, but Rule 5 in the sidebar details how to show spoiler tags.
