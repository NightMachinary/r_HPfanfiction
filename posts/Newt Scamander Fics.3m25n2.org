I didn't notice that... aha... "extra" 'r' until I had to type it in. This seems to be the only Newt-centric English-language fic of length so far*. I've only read a couple of chapters so far, but they're reading well. It seems to be very loosely based on the premise JKR gave us a while back.

EDIT: *on FFN, that is.
