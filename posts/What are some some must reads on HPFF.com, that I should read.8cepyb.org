As HPFF is shutting down, I am wondering if there are any "must reads" on that site. But I lack the endurance to sift through dozens of fics for a chance and probably wouldn't find them anyway. That's why I am asking you lot, if you know any really good stories that should be read.


** If you have to read any one fic, I'd recommend [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]]. It's an interesting adventure fic on what would the Wizarding afterlife look like? And what depths would good people go to for the possibility of seeing their loved ones again. Basically, Wizarding Heaven (though it's not called that) hosts a dueling tournament where the winner gets one day on Earth to see their loved ones, while the runner up is destroyed- to prevent overcrowding. Every year Lily Potter wins, but with a fresh slew of new comers from The Battle of Hogwarts, she has some stiff competition

On a more personal level, I recommend [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=226284][Running With Wolves]]. It was the story that won all the Dobbys in 2008, which looking at it now is the last year I spent on the site. I used to be a prolific reviewer and I wrote one of the first reviews on the story. Seeing the author's reply on how my one line of praise helped them feel less discouraged made me realize how important giving feedback is to the fanfic community. It's an odd premise, basically what if a female O.C. was Voldemort's secret child (along with Snape), bffs with Charlie Weasley, and fell in love with Remus Lupin

** HPFF was the site I first started on. I remember there being a lot of good stories that I liked... but then I discovered that they were nearly all available on FFN. But, I did find one that isn't, and that's [[https://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=80823]]

I have no idea how badly the story has aged, as it's been almost 10 years since I've read it, and just looking at the summary is reminding me that the story probably features a Mary Sue OC
