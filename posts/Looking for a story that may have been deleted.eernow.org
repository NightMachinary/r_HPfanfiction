:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a harem fic where the potters are the dukes and duchesses of an area of land and Remus is the mayor. Harry found out that all of his female friends were going to be auctioned off as concubines so he buys them all to save them and Minerva was a legacy concubine as well as one other... he married Hermione as well to save her from the auction.
