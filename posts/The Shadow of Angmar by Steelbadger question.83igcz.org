** Well, I'm still alive. I haven't had to visit hospital, or rehab, or anything like that. No horrible accidents involving chickens and compressed-air guns, really nothing very exciting at all.

All that's happened is that I've had something of a change of circumstance (a good one), which has left me with much less time free for writing. The time I do have tends to be in the form of hours here and there, which really don't suit my writing style. If I want to get anywhere with writing, it usually means sitting down uninterrupted for an afternoon or evening, that's something I find really difficult to manage now.

That said, I'm still trying to write. The next chapter is currently sitting at around 4k words written, and most of that was written in the last month or so.

Really, it's annoying. I know the story I want to write, I just don't have the time to really work on making it happen. It feels a bit like an itch unscratched.
