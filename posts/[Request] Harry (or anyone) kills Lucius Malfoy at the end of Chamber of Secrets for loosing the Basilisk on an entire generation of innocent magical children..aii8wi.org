*** I think this makes House Elves too OP, if they're able to kill an adult wizard.

Of course, canon has him blasting Lucius with a spell (I think this is sort of ridiculous too).

House Elves becoming too OP is one of my least favorite tropes. It's such a crutch when they can Apparate places Wizards can't, can cast powerful wandless magic, etc.

**** I think the apparition thing isn't because they're overpowered, it's because most places simply don't charm against their magic. But yeah, I was more thinking along the lines of Lucius not paying him any attention, or considering him a threat, and Dobby stabs him with the Sword or something. You'd have to alter it a little, to have Harry still clutching the sword when he ran out, but dropping it when pulling his sock off.

After all, during the final battle, they fought with knives, so they obviously don't have magical killing abilities.

**** I'm aware of this being exploited to hell and back, but it is kind of canon, though. What makes it interesting that most of the elves wouldn't dare use it against wizards. They're probably developed that way due to selective breeding (or at worst just selective execution).

There's real potential for a House Elf Uprising, but it would never happen because they're not in the correct mindset for it. That's what's the most interesting for me.

****** Well that was just a figure of speech. We don't exactly see it left and right. Maybe not ALL elves can be that powerful. Sure, Dobby is very OP, but what about other elves?

*** And it wouldn't be that large a stretch. In canon, Dobby attacks Lucius with a Knockback Jinx and sends him cascading down the hallway.

All you have to do is have Lucius be blasted out a window instead and then he plummets however many dozens of feet and shatters his skull on the stones below.

Edit: Dobby. Darned auto-correct

** There's one where Flitwick gives him a thrashing that he takes months to recover from. I assume that Harry was either a Ravenclaw or maybe Luna came into possession of the diary.
