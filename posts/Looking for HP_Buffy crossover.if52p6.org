As the title says. Preferably HP/Buffy pairing and complete or recently updated, but I'm not picky. No slash please.


** Look over at Twisting The Hellmouth if you haven't already! [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Category-1-5/Harry+Potter.htm#pt]]

Most of my fav fics on there aren't Buffy/Harry but there's plenty of great stuff.

*** I don't follow much there, but I did come across Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived a while ago, and then read the rest of the series. Seems like Diane Castle pretty much cornered the market on Alex Mack fanfiction; there's almost nothing out there that's not based on her work.

**** Yep - her stuff is great for Alex Mack - definitely replaced canon for me! I'm not on that site as much as I used to be, but that was where I /lived/ (along with LJ) in the early 2000s - and I still reread most of the “top fics” there every year or so.

Also - if you like one-shots, August is TwistedShorts month and a few really great authors put up a story a day. Well worth reading.

** A lot of the Harry Potter crosses I've seen involve him as Dawn's father (it's a common enough trope like Ice Queen Daphne, so no direct recs), though I have seen one where Lily was resurrected, Buffy-style, and had her mind, body, and personality modified to hold the Key by those asshole monks -- she became Dawn. And then became confused when she began remembering her prior life.

That was kinda nightmarish, to be honest.

There was another where Harry is mistaken for Lucifer (and he might actually be an unknowing host for him), and everyone panics; except Dawn, whom he sort-of begins dating, much to Joyce's amusement.

It got a bit stupid in later chapters as the author ran out of creative steam and introduced more shitty anime crossover elements, and I think there were one or two chapters that were on Caer Azkaban (lost during the move to groups.io) that weren't on FFn, but the concept itself was very amusing.

I'd like to see more fics like that, personally (Mr. Black's misadventures had elements of this, but they quickly grew into a complete mess).

They're all in the crossover archive on FFn.

  She is a slayer. Born to fight the demons, vampires and the forces of darkness. Now, because of bad luck and bad mistakes, she's running. He is The Boy Who Lived. Destined to destroy the Dark Lord. Now, because of a loveless home and a manipulative old wizard, he's more alone and frustrated than ever. Together, these two lost souls discover that they are far more powerful than they ever were apart. Brute strength meets magical finesse in a story of young love and...okay, I'm sorry, I just can't. It's Faith Lehane and Harry Potter, people. They don't do mushy. A slayer being dropped head first into Wizarding Britain? Shit's about to get real up in here and nothing and no one is going to be the same. Gloves are off and with Faith's help, Harry ain't buyin' what the dark lord is selling.
