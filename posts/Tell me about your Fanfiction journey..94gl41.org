Hey guys, I was wondering how you got started on fanfictions and how has your taste for fanfictions evolved through time.

When I started reading fanfictions it was looking for stories about Harry/Ginny life after the last scene in the books/movies, with time I discovered a lot of fics and Harry/Ginny is one of my least favorite ones, just to give an example. :p I used to love Dumbledore, think Ron was great and really canon compliant, but now, after reading a lot of different fics my views have changed a lot. I would like for you to share how it has been for you. (sorry for the errors, English is not my first language)


** I remember one of my first being one where Luna played a big part, but she wasn't 'Loony' to such an extreme as you see in most cases. Either way I remember that I loved it and cried actual tears at the end when it was over.

Though in retrospect it was most likely preetty bad and I've idolized it in my mind. I mean, I was 14 and my english wasn't exactly top-notch and I find several fics that I favorited and I'm just like "What The Fuck?!?".

But anyway, I wish I could find it :( since I barely remember anything. Just that Luna was a bit less odd than usual (but still the Luna we know) and that the ending was super-sad but highly satisfactory.

** Well I don't remember specifically how I progressed through the fandoms but I know I started with finding Not From Others and absolutely loved it. Then found Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince which was decent but not nearly as good as Not From Others. After that I pretty much stuck to pure Canon compliant stories (things like Just a Random Tuesday or anything by My Dear Professor McGonagall and the like). Read a couple nextgen stories too. Then I went through a period where I didn't really read much, but found this sub and hung around for a while. Saw the typical Black Comedy/Seventh Horcrux recommendations over and over so gave in and read them. That lead to my crack fic/comedy stage with the standard Rorschachs Blot and Oh God Not Again stories. After that I moved on to serious au ones like Hogwarts Battle School and Darkness Within. From there I admittedly went through a robst phase to my shame. After that I branched out for a bit and have a bit of everything thrown in. Most recent phase I've had was time/dimensional travel but otherwise it's been all over the place for me.

Edit:Looking through my favorited stories on ffnet sorted by date added is pretty nostalgic for me

** My journey started the same as many who started after the 7th book was done. I wanted /more/ and there wasn't any more to come. I wanted to know what happened after the final battle but before the epilogue. So, like many before me, I read a metric shitton of Harry/Ginny fics, but that wasn't enough for me. I quickly became bored with how samey all those fics were, though I do have memories of some of them being quite entertaining, even epic, but it just wasn't enough. I need something different, so I just started reading everything, and I started getting sick of the same shit in every fic there as well. Crazy billion galleon inheritances with megamansions, random elemental abilities, super wandless magic, diagon alley shopping scenes that feature friendly goblins super wands and magical trunks, "Hadrian", etc. So, within a few months, maybe half a year, I started struggling to find fics that were actually interesting. Like, it's great stumbling across something like Wastelands of Time, but when you're addicted to fanfiction, that sort of fic takes up maybe a day or two of your attention, so what about the other 29 days in the month? Well, when you can't find something to read that suits your interests, I figured out that you just got to write it yourself.

*** I know how you feel, I like the idea of the house of Potter having some power, but whenever I see one where he has 2 Billion galleons, 2 islands, 8 houses, 52 elves and owns 62% of Diagon Alley I lose interest.

** I got started on fanfiction after re-reading the series for the third time and really just wanting to read more. I read the start of G.Norman Lippet's series because I saw it recommended. I thought it was good, but it didn't feel very much like Harry Potter to me. I read another recommended story which I didn't really like (Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) but it definitely started me on the path to truly getting into fanfiction.

It took me a little while after to really start finding Harry Potter stories I enjoyed and branching into more uncharted territories, such as AUs (which I weren't really interested in before), but overall I have mostly continued to stick to the same tastes (canon-compliant-irrespective of characters in general).

*** I remember listening to the audio books twice and feeling a void when I was done, I searched for stories about the 19 years gap and after the epilogue, I remember feeling offended when I first read Dumbledore/Molly/Ginny/Ron!bashing.

** I started reading HPFF just after GoF (the book) came out. Read a lot of stuff that was cannon compliant for the time, but made non cannon due to the later books.

** Used to prowl around PJO fanfics at first and related crossovers. My first foray onto HP was the prophecy of two boys, a wbwl fic. I loved it and I began searching wbwl fics, I would read anything like that. Then moved to fics having more than 500k, would read anything that was not slash. Then Imoved towards Haphne and HOC fics. Now, I pretty much read fics with good characterization, plot and good reviews and favourites. I used to like Ron and Dumbledore amd Gonny, but now I don't, the first image that comes into my head when I think about them is, pig, a secret dark lord and a slut.

** I didn't know that fanfiction existed until about 6-8 years ago. I read on the hp sub about a fanfic where Harry polyjuiced himself into Ginny and vice versa so they could see how the other feels during sex. I thought it was funny and then dove down the rabbit hole and haven't looked back. My tastes have ebbed and flowed from cannon shippers to Harry with major other ladies except Hermione. I've never personally shipped those two. I'll read a good fic with them but it's not my favorite. I do not like a gay Harry as I like to identify with the Harry in the fic and I'm straight. I don't mind when authors make Colin Creevy gay or other minor characters.

*** That sounds like a fun fanfic to read, I have read some Harry/Hermione fics but it is not my favorite fic. I am Bi myself so I don't mind gay fics but I have to admit I have read few of those, in my head Harry is straight and I have a hard time picturing him with a guy.

** I wrote my first "fanfiction" shortly after OOTP came out - "Harry Potter and the Green Flamed Torch". It was hilariously awful. I was 12.

I then actually discovered fanfiction, started reading stories on MNFF and then progressed to writing when I was 13. I became a huge H/G shipper, wrote two novel-length stories and lots of one-shots. I was even a mod on SIYE for a brief period. After that, I spent lots of time on HPFF. I went through a writing slump in high school (especially after Deathly Hallows was published), which continued into university. Everything I started, I couldn't finish despite having the whole story planned out. I started writing a post-Hogwarts/next-gen slightly AU novel in 2011 which I FINALLY finished last year.

Now that I've graduated university, I'm trying to pick up again with writing/reading. It's been fun.

** My fanfiction journey started on wizard101 Central, a site dedicated to a kids mmporg, where some people wrote fanfiction about charterers in the game. I'm pretty sure I didn't know that was called fanfiction at the time, but I'd bet that site had something to do with why, years later, I ended up reading spn fanfic after watching supernatural. I expanded from there to Merlin fanfiction, then to HP. (With a smattering of Hamilton in there somewhere). HP has been pretty recent for me, just over the past couple of years.

**** Depends on what your tastes are. Because so many (well, almost all, really) of the main characters are guys, much of the best/most popular fic is slash. Gen fic can be harder to find. But there's a lot of good fic that is rated G or T, so there's definitely plenty out there for those who prefer not to read heavy slash. Overall, I think it's a lot easier to find well-written fic for spn, probably because the intended audience for SPN is a bit older than that of HP. When I started reading HP fic I was astounded at how many of the top favorited HP fics on FF.net are just, well, really badly written. Clunky sentences, etc. But that's important to me for a fic, sometimes more so than plot to me, so ymmv. SPN fic is also skewed more towards AO3 fics than FF.net. Another quirk is the vast amounts of AU fics (coffee shops, college, space, just about whatever you can think of). The magic is such a huge part of HP fanfic, and is why I started reading it in the first place, incidentally, that you don't see as many non-magic AUs. SPN fics can be more character-driven for sure. Of course, lots of SPN fics have the same annoyances of some HP fic tropes like AK eyes (jesus how many times do people need to say "blue-eyed man" or "cerulean orbs" we get it Cas has blue eyes). But Sturgeon's Law applies to any fandom so I can ignore some of that and find fics I like. I can happily provide some recs if you're interested . . .

** I started reading HP fanfiction in late 2000/early 2001 but I don't remember what I read back then, probably a bunch of really bad fifth year stories. Lurked a bit on HP4GU, read fics on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], and later The Sugar Quill and the Werewolf Registry and a bunch of other small-ish sites. Checkmated, The Howl Kingdom... And of course on FictionAlley and its "siblings" or children sites or whatever to call them. Oh, and that smut site, what was it name? The Restricted Section? Oh, and a ton of fics from a bunch of LJ communities.

Mostly read canon compliant and Sirius/Remus, and still mostly do, but I have read and will read any pairing and any premise if the writing seems good enough.

I have not read many - if any at all! - fics that really IMO nail Harry. I think it's because the books are written from his POV and it's really hard for other writers to capture that what makes Harry Harry. I have read fics with excellent Harrys that I've enjoyed reading very much, but they are still not really Harry, to me. I keep looking though... :p
