In the title. I'm looking for fics similar to Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d. Looking for anything where Harry is learning skills in the same way either from gods or other very powerful people. Thanks for the help. And a thanks to Enterprise for making the first day of 2021 a good one.


** "And a thanks to Enterprise for making the first day of 2021 a good one" Last thing I knew of was xmas eve. Did I miss something?

*** Maybe OP has been busy with holiday/family stuff and just now got around to reading the new chapter. Or maybe they just discovered this delightful fic (I almost envy that).

** I have a fic sort of like that, would Harry learned an entirely new style of magic from a dragon (who is himself somewhere between the 'apprentice' and 'master' ranks) be what you're looking for? It /is/ a crossover, but I think it's a good one.

  There's change afoot at Hogwarts! Thanks to Elune, Azeroth's moon goddess, Harry Potter has been gifted with a great boon and responsibility. The ripples from Elune's gift have already grown large, and they've just started. Come see the adventures of the Potter Dragonflight, no Warcraft lore knowledge needed! Features many dragons, a HP/HG ? Ship, and Cursed!Dumbledore

** I don't have a link to it, but "when wand and sword collide" is pretty great. The plot is basically last hero/ son of neptune, but instead of switching with the Romans, Percy gets swapped with Harry. Percy has to do a year at hogwarts solving mysteries, and Harry has to do a Quest. It's written pretty darn well, as I recall. The Harry chapters are written in Riordan's style, and the Percy chapters are done in Rowling's.
