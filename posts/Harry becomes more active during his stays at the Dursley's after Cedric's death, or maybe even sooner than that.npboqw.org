** Always, when I see "the Summer of Training"-trope I ask myself how the hell that one works with the Trace still working (Harry doesn't become a great wizard through books - he is a practical learner; he is great when he has someone who teaches him practical like Lupin in PoA or Hermione & Ron in GoF but in academic work he is only average - it's not like he was a lazy or bad student, he was above average at his OWLs even with Slytherin, Umbridge and Voldemort pressuring him; he just doesn't have the right temper to learn by only reading a book) and how he smuggles everything into Privet Drive without the Dursleys realizing it. The Dursleys hardly allowed him to do his homework - I don't see them lying low when owls start bringing books even with their fear from Sirius.

** Hasn't this been done about 500 times? The Summer Of Training has been done to death and back! They tend to go into loving, intricate detail about exactly how and what Harry trains in, but the stories never actually go anywhere beyond that training. He never does anything BUT train, and occasionally pick up chicks for his spatially expanded, time-dilated training trunk of DOOM! Training-fics are boring because they're just a laundry list of "I wish I knew how to..." and have no actual plot.

*** Yeah exactly, I've read that sooo often literally in that exact order- “he does his schoolwork, he works out and becomes fit, he gets his money and learns about politics and blah blah.” One, that's quite unrealistic considering Harry was almost canonically going through a depressive episode that summer, even if Rowling didn't specifically mention the word depression.

And two, he didn't earn it. Yes, there were the scenes about working hard and getting up at 5am but it all seems so effortless even if the writers described how hard it is. It's because he doesn't give anything real up in exchange. He becomes Mary Sue-ish, improving physically and magically but there's no actual character growth. A great example I can think of an author doing this well is Antithesis. The Harry in that gets powerful, almost to God-like levels but there's always a cost, a simultaneous emotional spiral downwards the more powerful he gets.

*** I want to read a fic where Harry goes through the summer of training (lifting, running) to get buff and fit, and then when he returns to the Wizarding World, people are like “Harry, there's a potion for that.”

Then Harry realizes that potions are actually pretty neat, and while he still hates Snape, they engage in a grudging alliance to actually train him, but with the help of potions and rituals.

It would be revealed that Snape himself altered his abilities with potions rituals, and Dumbledore with his mastery of alchemy. You could legitimize other branches of magic, too - combat divination could actually be a thing. Divination as a working, useful tool could explain both Snape and Dumbledore's trust in prophecies - linkffn(0-800-Rent-A-Hero) does this super well.

Most of the Wizarding World doesn't perform such rituals because, well, they don't have need for it. And perhaps there are downsides, like eternally greasy hair or a permanent aura of grandfatherly mystery.

Really, I'm just looking more fics that incorporate the disparate elements of magic into a cohesive whole, like linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure). Rather than tossing time and training at a single thing (like duels), it would be revealed that true strength and power comes from fully understanding and utilizing the tools already at your hands.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another!

**** It's still just a training-fic, though, no matter the window-dressing. Those tend to focus on how powerful/cool/capable Harry is without him actually using all of his new abilities to accomplish anything. I don't think I've read even one training-fic that goes on to actually use the results of that training. The more focused a story gets on training, the less it is on plot. It's a steady grind upward with no goal, like the endgame of most ARPGs where you're only competing against your own record. It just feels hollow.

***** And you're completely welcome to that opinion, and are for the most part right. I have read a couple stories that OP is asking for though that fit the requirements. I can't remember them off the top of my head, although one of them had him go to a quidditch camp as well as a sort of just doing what he loves while also incorporating training into it as well. That window dressing is important after all. You can describe two stories as the same with one hyphenated word, but they'll be completely different. Getting off topic there a little though.

Basically there are legitimately good training fics out there that don't focus on making Harry "powerful/cool/capable," I don't know what fics you've been reading, but I wish you luck in finding the good ones out there.

  He still relies on his friends, maybe even a few other people he believes he can trust, Just a Harry that realizes moping around and doing nothing, isn't going to do anything, change is.
#+end_quote

A part of me think that there isnt much Harry could have done (magic wise). He wasnt allowed to go to Diagon Ally, so he couldn't have bought books to prepare. And his friends were ignoring him, which is the reason he was moping around in the first place.

*** They couldn't talk to Harry about the Order, because someone might have read their letter. But they could help him with other stuff, and not talk about the Order in the letters they send out.

Could also be before they find out about the Order as well. Ron and Hermione worry about Harry, talk to each other, and then talk to Harry about wanting to help him, while he's at the Dursley's.

If only those devices were mostly unknown to magicals, who have no means of tapping them anyway. Oh, wait, phones do exist, and Hermione never bothered using one to contact her BEST FRIEND after he was TORTURED and watched a friend be murdered in front of him!

No, I don't excuse the "letters might be intercepted" bullshit that JKR fed us.
