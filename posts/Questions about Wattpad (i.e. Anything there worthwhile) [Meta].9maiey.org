So I've known about the site's existence, but I never bothered to check it out until just earlier today when googling for new fanfic for a different fandom. I wasn't sure what to make of it. The ads popping in are a little annoying but that aside the design wasn't terrible and/or boring like FFN and Ao3. I don't see the site brought up often, and when it is its usually in a bad light. What's the deal?

Are there any HP fics there worth checking out? Are there enough fanfic readers there to justify cross posting to it? Or is it just a dead end?


** Most fics on there are very cringey, cliche self inserts. Even the well written stuff has a very cliche plot. Go there if you like that, I guess

** Wattpad's userbase tends to be /much/ younger than that of FFN. As in middle-school young. In contrast, AO3's tends to be older than FFN.

** Personally, Wattpad is where I started. I didn't know about any of the other main fanfiction sites, so I started reading there. I like the site and the app; they're easy to use, only really brought down by the fact that the ads are there. I think there are some works worthwhile there, although the first that comes to mind is The Ribboned Witch and I know that author also cross posts to at least one of the other two sites. I'd like to think my work there is worth viewing, but again, it's also on AO3.

**** No prob, Bob. Just bear in mind I had been napping and was half asleep, so that's why things are a bit jumbled.

** Wattpad fanfiction has always seemed to be made of teen girls to me. I use(d) wattpad more for original fiction, never really fanfiction. The good stuff is usually cross posted to the major sites.

I started reading it as a teenage girl and I found a lot of the stuff tedious. Going back as an adult I cringe that I ever considered some of it readable in the first place. Don't get me wrong, there's some talented people, but a lot of them end up taking their stuff down to self-publish and they are almost never fanfiction authors.
