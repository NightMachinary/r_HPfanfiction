I was thinking about this, since there is a theory that HP and GB take place in the same universe.

If Dumbledore were to meet them, they could blackmail the death Eaters into giving up. According to Egon, if the streams of their Proton Packs were ever to cross, every molecule in the users body would explode at the speed of light. Which would in fact destroy the solar system, I believe. They used it on Gozer's dimension, and it destroyed both her home and Gozer.

Not only that, but they defeated Gozer, an eldritch entity from beyond time and space. Voldie should be small potatoes for them.

Also, imagine the comedy. It would make for an awesome fic all around.


** "Surrender or we destroy the planet" isn't really a great threat, especially coming from the good guys. The Death Eaters would definitely call their bluff.

But the idea of a HP/GB crossover does have some potential. The Ghostbusters could come to Hogwarts to get rid of Binns, Peeves, or maybe some Death Eaters who became ghosts after the final battle.

** This one hasn't been updated since 05. It was pretty good back in the day if I remember, but it's not current past ootp. The same writer had one crossing over with Hellblazer that was great but not updated. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1928428/1/Who-Ya-Gonna-Owl]]

** I'm just thinking abt a crackfic where the four guys unload on a Dementor thinking it's a ghost and they end up finding a new way to defeat them. Or Filch calling in the Ghostbusters to exorcise Peeves at last... so many options here. Minimal fudging of canon facts to get it right. Could totally work.
