*Headcanon*: Your interpretation of canon, stuff you think is genuinely part of canon, it just never got explicitly stated. Has strong implicit support from the text.

*Headfanon*: Stuff that you think it could very well be canon, but it lacks textual support.

*Fanon*: Absolutely anything that doesn't directly contradict canon.

*AU*: Stuff that directly contradicts canon.

Example of headcanon: you can't apparate across large bodies of water. This is directly supported by Voldemort flying across the English Channel at the end of DH, rather than apparating. But it's not canon, because other explanations are possible (e.g. Voldemort just really loves flying).

Example of headfanon: House Elf magic is limited to Charms. This isn't implied by canon, but we've never seen a House Elf use anything else, it fits with the nature of House Elves, and also explains why wizards are the dominant species.

Example of fanon: Emma and Dan Granger bullshit. There's no particular reason to think that this is the case, but it doesn't contradict the books.


** That the vast amount of protective magic on Hogwarts has given it a certain degree of ... not sentience, exactly, but the the ability to actively protect the inhabitants rather than just passively. i.e. by encouraging Colin Creevey to lift his camera as soon as he got approached by the basilisk rather than having him go "hmm, what's that noise, lets go have a look", and nudging Nearly Headless Nick to float through a wall at just the right moment to save Justin Finch-Fletchley. This is why Myrtle is the only fatality out of Voldemort's two releases of the basilisk.

*** I quite like this idea, almost like a very mild Felix Felicis over the school. It nicely explains various coincidences.

An interesting addition to the idea would be that Voldemort's curse on the DADA position is parasitic on that protective magic, reversing its effect for the DADA teacher. Instead of protecting the DADA teacher through lucky coincidences, fate conspires to ruin them.

**** I suppose I should add my headfanon here (perhaps it falls into headcanon but I can't recall seeing it around before, but that could be just my ignorance or everyone assumes it to the extent no one says it).

That is the DADA curse was made possible because Dumbledore, as Headmaster, broke a promise. ie. It wasn't the refusal for a job Voldemort was quite capable of doing, or Voldemort being so evil that he can just do things like that, but that Headmaster Dippet, who was 'very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty', only refused due to his age (18) and 'invited' him to reapply in a few years. To me I read it as a promise where it was fully implied and expected that should he return and reapply Hogwarts would welcome him home*/give him a job. So when the successive headmaster refused the (implied) promise of the former it burned Voldemort with, at least partially, a righteous anger. This injustice allowed his sheer malicious will and magic (perhaps works with your unsanitised/dark magic) to truly curse the position (again works with the Hogwarts good will magic- and as you said turned ill intent).

- 'Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.' I don't think being a founders heir gives any special cursing ability but perhaps there is again an ancient magic of house and home and welcome etc. (bit hypocritical given my dislike for the old magic of 'love' at the centre of HP)

*** Drawing on this as well; you could say that it draws off the headmaster/mistress's magical power. Dumbledore, as one of the most powerful wizards of his era, siphons off some of his magical strength to fortify Hogwarts - the wards are tied into him.

Hence in COS, no-one dies, because Dumbledore's power indirectly creates chance coincidences. Dumbledore is stronger or more competent than Dippet, and so is able to indirectly prevent fatalities, and this is why Dumbledore's presence at the school is so important and he is hailed as one of the school's greatest headmasters.

Incidentally, is it as soon as Dumbledore is called away that Ginny is taken/Voldemort gets a chance? It certainly is that way in PS/SS, when chance allows Quirrell to go for the stone.

** A few items of my headfanon:

- The Dark Arts is a less standardised area of magic than, say, Charms or Transfiguration, and large parts of it consist of magic that isn't "wand magic". It's less modern, less sanitised, and more deeply embedded with symbolism. More like Brothers Grimm sort of dark fairy tale magic, with hints of the occult. Not all of it is about directly attacking people, but there's always some immoral or primal element.

- If you get good enough at casting a spell non-verbally, you don't have to annunciate the incantation mentally any more, you just have to think /of/ the spell and it will cast (providing you want to cast it, of course).

- The global magical population is quite unevenly distributed.

- By the end of DH, Harry had become proficient in occlumency and legilimency.

- Wizards don't have a single power (magic), but rather a collection of powers (charms, transfiguration, apparition, etc). Over time, these powers have become a standardised set known as "witchcraft and wizardry". The powers are not completely independent, but are largely independent, like different limbs on the same body. Some people have additional limbs, such as being a parselmouth or metamorphmagus. Different magical species have different sets of powers, with some overlap. Wands are a magical tool that can be used in conjunction with any magical power, not just wizarding ones, but wizards have banned other species from owning them or sharing the secret of how to make them.

- Every active piece of magic is essentially a spell. A potion is basically a spell with a lasting physical presence. The ingredients and stirring etc are no different in principle to incantation and wand movements. You're just using a different set of external tools to cast the magic. That's why Muggles can't make potions: the wizard is still casting magic.

**** The basic reasoning is from the role of Britain in the magical world.

A) Apparently there is something about Britain that prevented the rest of the magical world from intervening in Voldemort's war, a humanitarian disaster.

B) British wizards seem to have a disproportionate influence over global affairs, with the Statute of Secrecy itself resulting from the Glorious Revolution and the refusal of British monarchs to recognise wizarding rights. The British Ministry of Magic is also able to exert unusually direct influence in other nations (HBP, the British Ministry of Magic arranged for a foreign President to forget to call the British Prime Minister).

Given this, it seems that Britain has, at the least, one of the most significant magical communities in the world. But if wizarding numbers were uniform, British wizards would be hugely outnumbered. With such a tiny proportion of the global wizarding population, it wouldn't make any sense for Britain to be so influential and immune to other global powers. So that means that Britain can't be too badly outnumbered by other wizarding nations, which means wizarding numbers can't be equal.

****** There are of course alternative explanations. One could be that British wizards aren't more numerous, but rather more powerful (either inherently or due to superior education). I tend not to like this as it's a bit racist lol.

Another explanation would be that there aren't any large wizarding nations. The USA, China, India: their wizarding equivalents aren't unitary states but rather divided into smaller states (eg. New England would be a magical state). This would prevent there being any single magical state that is large enough to be a "superpower" and able to dictate terms to the rest of the world's wizards.

A third possible explanation is that wizards don't feel any real loyalty or patriotism to their state, and have a much more anarchic and international outlook. The idea of one magical state intervening in another would be a completely alien idea, because states don't mean much to them.

** Given that Gringotts acts as more of a U Store-It for physical currency than a real Muggle bank, I imagine the reason for this is a prohibition on usury. This helps explain why the Weasley twins had to save all of their money for a long time in hopes of opening their own business (although Ludo and Harry made that moot).

There are no laws forbidding libel in the magical world. Given how The Quibbler is able to cast aspersions on the Ministry (and eventually Harry Potter) without any reprisal, there must not be a mechanism in place for the courts to rein in the press. I strongly suspect that the entirety of the fourth estate's portrayal in canon is a reflection on tabloid journalism that JKR despises. Rita Skeeter's entire career is founded on libeling her subjects after all.

*** I don't think there can be a straight forward ban on usury, as Ludo Bagman owed the Goblins money. That was the reason why he had the problem with Fred and George, remember. That said, I don't think there's anything like a standardised financial sector. For a start, with a population of ~10k wizards, there just isn't sufficient accumulation of capital, nor demand for loans, for a proper financial sector. And without double entry bookeeping, the Goblins can't leverage deposits, so have to loan entirely out of their own vaults.

Regarding magical law, I've always speculated on this. I have two main thoughts:

- Magical law appears to be made by executive decree, not a legislative body. All the legislation we know of has a name that hints towards an order/regulation, not primary law. The Wizengamot acts as a check of the Minister's power, but does not actively legislate.

- Magical law is concerned only with magical affairs.

From the above two points, my headfanon is that:

A) Muggle law applies to the magical world, and is augmented, not completely replaced, by magical law.

B) Magical law is essentially all delegated legislation made by the Minister for Magic. Parliament retains legislative primacy, which is why no magical law we know of is called an Act. But since Parliament is made up of Muggles and has no knowledge of the magical world, other than the Prime Minister, there hasn't been any primary legislation concerning magic since the Statute of Secrecy. In light of this, the power of the Minister to issue executive orders has massively expanded to fill the legislative gap.

As far as the magical government, I've always suspected that she modeled the Wizengamot on the House of Lords (before that body's power became more restricted e.g. Parliament Act 1911) but it's entirely possible your analysis is correct. I haven't bothered keeping up with Pottermore. Perhaps she'll provide more information through that medium.

It has to be more.

Way too much infrastructure in place for only 10k people.

When Black escaped the minister dispatched "hundreds of Witch Watcher Special Forces to the Village" these witch watchers were joined in the DMLE by Magical Law Enforcement Patrol (bobbies), Auror Office (Detectives and protection detail), then Hit wizards (Tactical response) and finally Azkaban guards (Corrections).

All that manpower on enforcement without even looking at the groups responsible with policing artifacts or the secrecy statutes.

Even assuming the DMLE was only 1000 strong using the muggle police per capita you would expect around 230k magical citizens. Leaving you with roughly 1 wizard per 250 muggles (or 500 if you account for 2x life expectancy).

A) We have no idea of the size of these departments.

B) Some of these departments don't exist.

Each individual Ministry department seems to be very small, focused on a specialist function. I doubt there are more than 20 Aurors. There's probably more like 10-15. They're extremely specialised: Dark wizard catchers. There can't be that many dark wizards out there. We certainly know that they only take on a single new recruit every few years.

The Azkaban guards are the Dementors. Wizards don't perform any functions at the prison. We know Dementors both feed the prisoners and bury them.

There's no evidence that the Hit Wizards still exist at the time of PoA. They certainly play no role in the second war with Voldemort.

I think you're missing a couple of key elements of the Ministry in canon:

A) The Ministry does not have a significant distinction between the civil service and police. The same people write laws, administer them, and enforce them. (See: Arthur Weasley). Each department has its specialist area, like Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, and is wholly responsible for that area. There's no generic police force which enforces the law in general. The Law Enforcement Patrol seems to be the closest thing, but we have no idea how big it is. Unlikely to be very large, going by all the other Ministry departments we've seen.

B) The Ministry of Magic forms a large part of wizarding employment. I imagine at least 50% of working wizards are employed at the Ministry. Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade are the only commercial areas in wizarding Britain, and they're quite small, filled with independent sole traders, consistent with a population of 10k.

**** Why do you need that sort of offensive spell in the HP world?

You have the disarming charm, and the stunning charm. They will deal with someone who attacks you efficiently and in most circumstances harmlessly.

You don't need to use a bone-breaking curse, or lop off someone's limbs, or boil their blood, or cruciate them; in order to defend yourself. You just do that because you want to cause pain. So the spells that do that are called dark magic because that kind of wanton use of pain is inherently evil.

A possible objection to that might be the existence of the Dementors. If you send your criminals to a prison where they are tortured into insanity, why would you consider it wrong to torture someone who attacks you? There are various replies that could be made: such as giving up the right to punish to the state, or letting the Dementors do the dirty work for the sake of your virtue.

Another possible objection is that the Imperius Curse and Memory Charms seem very similar. Is it really so different to control someone by editing their memories, or to control someone by giving them commands? Yet one is used routinely on Muggles, and the other is one of the most prohibited crimes in the wizarding world.

Well, one reply might be that the Imperius Curse supplants free will. I think that is tenuous, but I'm sure thousands of words would need to be written to justify any position on it.

Another is that memory charms are routinely used on muggles, rather than proper wizards, so they don't have the same stigma.

***** I disagree with your logic in that there may come a time when you do need to use those spells. It is the same principle of Defense Against the Dark Arts being a required class until 5th year. I would also argue that while the likelihood of you being attacked by a dark wizard/magical creature is slim during peace time, the books of HP are set primarily in a war. Also, the spells you mentioned are both easily blocked, and are not spells that end battles. Especially in the situation that HP is set in. If you want to ensure that you survive the attack should one happen, you should at least be knowledgeable on the spell you have the ability to cast, be them "dark" or otherwise.

****** Yes, a stunning charm is easily blocked, but it is no more difficult to block a Cruciatus or presumably any curse. When we see a high level duel, between Voldemort and Dumbledore, they aren't fighting by using a better version of point and cast spells, but by manipulating the battlefield. When Death Eaters fight the Order the Order in the ministry stunners and the Death Eaters use nastier curses. That's because the Order wanted to incapacitate the Death Eaters efficiently, and the Death Eaters wanted to torment the order.

Sure, Harry doesn't do so well against adults, but that's not because he is unwilling to boil their blood. It's because he lacks duelling skills other than nasty curses. If anything nasty curses are worse. If you get disarmed or stunned you are out of it. If you get your arm cut off you might continue fighting for a few seconds.

Of course, I've only talked about dark spells that are nasty versions of normal spells, rather than doing things other spells can't. What about the Avada Kedavra? That can't be deflected, so it seems to be the only curse suggested that is better for fighting that Expelliarmus/Stupefy. Fiendfyre also seems like an occasionally good thing.

Well, Fiendfyre is uncontrollable, and Avada Kevadra is permanent. I think that Wizarding Britain has looked at those spells and said that they are so destructive, and so easily lent to malefaction, that they should always be illegal. I think they decided the Cruciatus curse was so cruel, and the Imperius so controlling, that it should always be illegal.

That being said, I think that if we talk about "Dark Magic" as a legal term, then we have to remember that the law isn't always morally correct. For example, I don't think it was morally wrong for Harry to use the Imperius Curse to break into Gringotts.

On the other hand, you could use "Dark Magic" as a moral term. In that case if you killed someone by using Wingardium Leviosa to levitate an extremely thick book about an angry fifteen year old over someone's head and dropping it, then you could call it Dark Magic; even though Wingardium Leviosa isn't normally a Dark spell.

As for Harry, he's got in more than one debilitating hit in the course of the books. Rowle, Lucius Malfoy and Jugson come to mind.

******* Well granted we don't know numbers or many details in the HP world there are several goblin rebellions for example. It may not go into it in detail but this means war and this means battles and this means unpleasant death. I don't think casting a single stupefy (which I am almost certain has a varying duration- ie he'll get up and fight you again) on a horde of goblins continuously really does the trick. Also prior 1692 with the Statute of Secrecy witches and wizards may fight against muggles/ alongside / in muggle wars (can't remember any canon references but I think there might be one or two). Now this might be incorrect but Hogwarts is built as a /castle/- and I don't think that was for the benefit of kids centuries later thinking old timey castles look cool. Godric Gryffindor is supposed to have been the best duelist of his time. I am not sure of the exact details but I am sure there were general conflicts in and around England and Scotland during Gryffindors lifetime and around Hogwarts/magic folk/home town that he could have been involved in. (Also in my mind I don't think fielious or charms to disguise Hogwarts as a defunct castle would have been in effect yet) These conflicts might have led Gryffindor to require what would be termed as Dark Magic. ie. lasting damage, lethal damage, dangerous (probably wide area effect) magic etc. I know it doesn't go with he books in tone well but if we are to join together a not yet separate magical world and the muggle conflicts of the times and of the various dangerous magical creatures and conflicts then heavy duty 'dark' spells might be necessary. ex. say a truce with the giants goes wrong well we know a /half/ giant shrugged off several spells and that a tickling charm isn't going to cut it (and TBH I don't think its effect is certain ie. a determined witch could feel the effects but not react/give in to the effect even though that might be hard) anyway so as gruesome as it is a bone breaking, blood boiling hex isn't anything not seen in the horrors of muggle war so why would we expect different in the magical? What if a Giant trying to break down the wall/gate well instead of boil oil or pitch we have a thing called fiendfyre maybe Godric is really good with it or maybe he only makes its blood boil or but it is going to be unpleasant, probably horrible, and by the books nomenclature dark magic.

I forget what fanfic it was but in one the DADA professor says that whatever the MoM was saying politically when it authorized Aurors to use the Killing Curse they had effectively gone to a state of war. No longer were they fighting a criminal but in a civil war. In stakes like that hitting someone with a stupefy and then binding them with magic ropes etc. is 2 spells- you might not have that chance or time or opportunity to 'collect' depending the tides of battle (and reinforcements) so 1 spell which is dark (and causes some horrible disablement or very likely lethal if not treated ASAP) would be necessary to fight, and have to chance to win, an equal war.

I often see messages on the subject of how the magic (or characterisation) in any one of my stories is 'wrong' despite not specifically contradicting canon. It seems a pity that many people become so sure of their head-canon and -fanon that they relegate themselves to an echo-chamber of stories that use all the same ideas over and over again.

I have preferences, of course, but those are derived from personal experience or ease of relation rather than because it fails to meet my imagination. Even something as taboo as magical cores can be explored in an interesting way and in some story might be a brilliant addition. What if all the ministry propaganda about 'stealing magic' in DH was actually possible (well, for a certain interpretation of 'stealing') and there were a set number of 'cores' that were redistributed into the population at the moment a witch or wizard died? That could be interesting.

Preferences are rarely there solely because of loyalty to the source material. Preferences regarding magical theory normally exist because they reflect story preferences.

For example, my dislike of magical cores isn't primarily because they're non-canon. It's because magical cores facilitate a characterisation of Harry in which he is a magical brute, all power and no finesse. I want to read about a Harry who is quick-witted, clever and creative (in his own, practical way), not about a Harry who just blasts his way through every situation until he runs out of ammo, then through some bullshit about willpower happens to find some more ammo.

The reason why I love canon compatibility isn't for its own sake. It's because I enjoy the themes and set-up of canon, and dislike much of traditional RPG-esque fantasy.

**** I had one other concern: "are squibs magical?". I'd say they aren't, but that would mean that 2 purebloods could have halfblood/mudblood children if they have squib parents, which is a tad weird.

If they are... A squib is the child of a one or 2 magicals that can't perform magic themselves, if they are considered magical, then their children should be too. That would mean there are muggles out there that officially count as magical. If they then have 'mudblood' children, and they were to procreate with another 'mudblood', their children might actually be halfbloods. But it could only be proven with excellent record keeping or magical lineage tests (not a canon thing) or something, since I haven't read anything in the books that indicate magic can determine if someone is a mudblood or not (fanfics like to go by the idea that the basilisk can smell it, but as far as I know this isn't canon, and Ginny could just as well have informed Riddle of people's blood status), so it seems to be purely a social (class) thing.

Someone like Bellatrix Black has used Dark spells at every turn and lost her sanity as a result.

The Ottoman Empire's Muggle politics mirrored its magical politics. When Bulgaria became a mostly independent vassal, it also formed its own Ministry of Magic, for instance. This pattern repeats for most countries -- so the British Ministry manages England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. My preferred fanon says the opposite, however -- Magical Burgundy still exists, the British Ministry controls some continental territory and has Brittany as a vassal, and a secular Mamlukean successor state holds sway from Tubruq to Aleppo.

** Okay, a few from me.

a) That muggleborn children aren't purely muggleborn, but children who have squib ancestors higher in their family tree that they don't know about. I'm /pretty/ sure this isn't canon but not 100% on that.

b) In a similar vein, that due to generations of inbreeding, Pureblood families have few magical children and many squib children, who they either farm out for adoption or (darkly) kill or otherwise get rid of after they've tested them to not have magic. Don't forget, Neville's uncle was happy to drop him out of a window on a drop that would have killed him if he hadn't bounced.

c) That the reason most witches and wizards don't say Voldemort's name isn't because of fear, but because using the name has a connotation similar to talking about the Holocaust; or that the Taboo Voldemort enacts in DH was previously in effect in the first war so people got in the habit of not saying it. It was both disrespectful and dangerous. Hence why people react not just with shock at Harry's use of the name, but with absolute horror.

The only voices in favour of using the name in canon, at first, after all, are strongest-wizard-of-the-age Dumbledore, who presumably could deal with Voldemort if he came to the summons, and muggleborn and muggle-raised Hermione and Harry, who don't know any better, and don't proceed beyond their first assumption that the name isn't spoken out of "fear of a name".

Pretty sure those last two are drawn from fanfiction originally but have seeped into my general conception of the series.

Headfanon: Overall, the wizards in the United States are a lot more ingrained in Muggle culture. They acknowledge the president as the leader of the country and follow American laws. In fact, there is a secret branch of the government dedicated to upholding the Statute of Secrecy. So, instead of two different governments like in Britain, it's just one slightly dysfunctional entity that has a lot of secrets. However, because America is so large, they have not been able to hide everything. Area 51, the Salem Witch Trials, Bigfoot, Voodoo...are all issues that got too big to control. Also, Native Americans (who are self-governing) have no concept of the Statute of Secrecy, and it's just a well known fact in their culture that some people are born with magic. There are quite a few wizarding schools. Some follow the more European tradition while others are just day schools.

** Headfanon about /avada kedavra/, to account for various seeming inconsistencies or problems with canon without contradicting canon at all.

We know that it is unblockabe, and leaves no mark other than death. It requires a lot of power to cast, though: Fake!Moody tells us that if the entire class cast it at him, he wouldn't get more than a bleeding nose.

There's a few things to unravel here. Firstly, a weakly cast /avada kedavra/ causes physical damage, while a strongly cast one leaves no mark other than death. So my model of this is:

- A super-weak /avada kedavra/ does nothing at all. (And can be blocked easily)
- A weak /avada kedavra/ does physical damage where it strikes you. As you increase the strength it does more and more damage, until:
- a sufficiently strong /avada kedavra/ will cause unsurvivable physical injuries. It can be blocked by a strong shield.
- once you increase the strength beyond this point, the amount of physical damage it does decreases, but the curse is fatal. So long as the curse causes some degree of physical damage as well as being fatal, the curse can be physically blocked. /So a full-strength *avada kedavra/ causes no physical damage, and correspondingly cannot be blocked.
- As an additional comment, the strength required of an *avada kedavra does scale with size, but not linearly. It takes much more strength to kill a human than it takes to kill a flea, but it only takes a small amount more strength to kill an elephant or a giant than it takes to kill a human.

Now, regarding potential ways of blocking /avada kedavra/, several comments. Physical objects are not enough to block it (at full strength, although they will block a weak curse). You need something that is alive to block it. Dumbeldore is able to give life to the statues with the Elder Wand in /Order of the Phoenix/; this is consistent with the power of the Elder Wand to defeat Death. Nobod, not even Voldermort, could perform such a feat without the wand. So without a living creature to take the curse for you, /avada kedavra/ goes straight through physical objects.

Furthermore, you cannot block the Killing Curse with a small creature like a spider. The spider will die if you hold it in front of you, but that only takes a small portion of the power of the curse, and the rest will still hit you. You need a creature that is large enough to block all of the beam of green light from the curse.

Note, this does *not* mean, as some suggest, that /avada kedavra/ keeps going in a straight line forever until it hits something. Another aspect of the curse beyond power is that it has a focal length, which is part of casting it. The caster needs to get the focal distance right in order for the full power of the curse to be realised - so if your opponent is 10m away, your focal distance needs to be around there. If you get it wrong they won't feel the full power of the curse -- as per my bullet points above. Longer focal lengths also take exponentially more power, so no-one can go past about 30-50m. Any /avada kedavra/ cast dissapates past its focal point, so it doesn't go on forever, and once it dissapates far enough it stops going through physical objects and instead damages them.

I know you say it's not forever, but the way you describe it seems kind of like Newton's first law of motion--an AK in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force, only in this case an outside force is either a living being or the focal point rather than air resistance and whatever.

Hypothetically then, if you had a wizard who did have infinite power and they focused on the end of the universe, would their spell continue to soar through space unhindered by rocks and space debris until it reached the end of the universe? (Or, y'know, crashed into an innocent, unsuspecting alien.)

Also, re: the spider thing--what if you used lots of spiders one after the other? Each one takes a little more power out of the spell so that by the time it reaches the actual target it's super-weak and therefore easily blocked.

Sure. But in a practical sense this doesn't mean anything.

Sure. But that's no different to using a single big animal anyway in terms of the effort it would require.

*** So you are also suggesting that a wizard has a deliberate control over how much power he pours? Overpowering spells is canon I think, some stunning spells merely stuns, while others throw the target off his feet as well, and that's while being cast by the same person, I could be wrong here though. I imagine it has to do with how intimate the mind and magic is, a great wizard who is lot more tuned to his magics should be able to manipulate it to control spell strengths. But then the ramification is that it would make AK a far more powerful tool in duels, because it would enable the wizard to bluff. He can cast less powerful AK, thereby preserving his strengths, but at the same time keeping his opponent on his toe because the opponent can't afford to guess wrong. With that sort of benefits, duels would be strictly fought with AKs.

But that doesn't happen. So in addition to your observation I think in general strength is somewhat recognizable by the complexion of the spell. Like weak spells are paler compared to darker shade of more powerful counterparts. That could diminish the information parity. Okay, the obvious retort to it, which also poses some questions about strict canon, is that there are just way too many spells, the sheer number should easily fill up the entire color spectrum while accounting for every light and dark variations. Is there anything to say spells have exclusive color? Otherwise you could simply be bluffing with a green colored tickling jinx. Maybe there is some other kind of exclusive signature like multicolor or a whooshing sound or something.

**** My headfanon also incorporates aspects of HPMOR. In particular: to cast AK takes more than /just/ magical power, although you need magical power. It also requires this (from Moody in that story): " You've got to want someone dead, and not for the greater good, either." And further than that, (from Quirrel in that story): "To cast Avada... Kedavra twice... you must hate enough... to kill twice... to cut their throat with your own hands... to watch them die... then do it again. Very few... can hate enough... to kill someone... five times... they would... get bored."

This strongly prevents the over-use of AK.

***** Yes that sort of barrier to entry makes sense. Anyway my worry about spells of the same signature also stems from HOMoR. In Ch. 101 Quirrel said, "Centaur spears can block many spells, but no one tries to block if they see that the spell is a certain shade of green. For this purpose it is useful to know some green stunning hexes." Except he was lying and he did kill the Centaur with an AK anyway. But if multiple spells can have the same appearance, then that barrier would loose some practical significance. Like not being able to cast AK wouldn't stop me from bluffing, and you would have to steer clear unless you are really sure that I can't cast AK. I wouldn't fancy being put in that situation.

*** I sort of like it as a subtle nod towards my favorite pairing. On the other hand, so many H/Hr stories seem to use those that I occasionally have problems where the personalities from each story start blending together.
