Any fics of life in Hogwarts/the wizarding world that take place during the Renaissance or in actual Victorian times? Or any like, historical setting I guess. Just thinking about how Hogwarts has been around for a BIT and what life would be like through the ages of Hogwarts! Time travel fics okay but I am looking more for OC worldbuilding. Thanks!!


** Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5494034/chapters/12692627][All the Important Words Unspoken]], by blamebrampton. It's HPDM and Astoria/Charlie, set around 1900. It's got HP-era characters, obviously, but it's not a time-travel fic --- Harry etc. just live in Victorian England, post-Voldemort. Blamebrampton's an excellent writer.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Narcissa Malfoy and Amarantha Greengrass just want what's best for their children. But since it's 1899, their children are 32 and 27 respectively, and sundry magical and Muggle crises are erupting across Europe, the chances of their plans progressing smoothly are close to zero.

** I really like linkao3(7460772). It is actually medieval fic (one character in the story is Robert Grosseteste who really lived and who was very interesting philosopher in between 1168-1253) with really lovely background story for the Fat Friar.

  Long before the Statute of Secrecy, when Kings still sought counsel from wizards and scholars debated magic at the great centres of learning, England seethed as her nobles struggled to check the power of the King -- and one young friar found his new path taking an unexpected turn.

** Linkffn(Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas) it's in the 1590s, but it doesn't revolve around Hogwarts.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
