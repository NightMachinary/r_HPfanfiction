Hey guys,

I am searching for a fic where Harry doesn't explode at Umbridge and shows self restraint.

*** To be fair, most of that's canon. Umbridge was the one to send the Dementors to Little Whinging to Kiss Harry, she was instated by Fudge (and thus had his support) to her position in Hogwarts, and of course Malfoy (perhaps under orders from Voldemort, perhaps not) supported Fudge to keep him in power as he was inept and easily manipulated. And although I can't remember much about this story's decrees, canon Umbridge made up a fair few ridiculous ones as well.

** Linkffn(Magical Relations), for all its other flaws, writes an /amazing/ Umbridge. The only fic I've seen that makes her as vicious and loathsome as in canon. Harry generally tries to keep his head down.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
