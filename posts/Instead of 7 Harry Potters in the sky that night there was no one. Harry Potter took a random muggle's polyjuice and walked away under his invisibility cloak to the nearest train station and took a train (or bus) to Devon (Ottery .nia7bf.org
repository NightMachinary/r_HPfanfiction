*** Addding to that, have the Dursley family leave in the morning and prevent them from returning for a full day. Have Tonks and Polyjuiced Order members return in disguise to give the illusion of everything being normal. Then take Harry out.

We've also seen human-to-animal transfigurations in canon (Crouch Jr. turned Draco into a ferret). That could be a way to take the extra Order member out of the house.

But this relies on logic, and we know how crap wizards are at that.

** Oh, this is my cue (i had a similar idea like you):

cat "escaping privet drive.txt"

Methods for Harry to escape from Privet Drive in DH.

1.  Moody says: "A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out.". They think the Minister is loyal to Voldemort and they are worried to commit an imprisonable offense? WHO CARES AT THIS POINT?! Just make a portkey. They are out to kill you and subjugate all of your loved ones, it literally doesn't matter if they want to imprison you too.

2.  Invisibility Cloak: Harry just walks out of the House on a random day and takes a bus to anywhere. Portkey from there.

3.  Polyjuice/Animagus: McGonagall walks in to visit Harry and leaves an hour later. During the night a cat jumps the fence.

4.  Polyjuice/Metamorphagus: Nymphadora visits Harry and leaves an hour later. No one takes notice of "Petunia" going on a shopping trip she never returns from later.

5.  Polyjuice: Dudley Dursley takes a ride on a bus. He never returns.

6.  Harry takes off his glasses and wears a fake moustache. Leaving the house in broad daylight he takes the bus to the next town. Or just takes a long walk.

7.  Polyjuice: Order members take polyjuice and get their pictures taken anywhere outside of Surrey pretending to be Harry. Leak picture to the daily prophet. If you want be really elaborate get seen in Hogsmeade or somewhere else. Be real Harry: No one care about Privet Drive anymore

8.  Vanishing Cabinet: Acquire a pair.

9.  Dobby or Kreacher take Harry to the Burrow (thanks [[/u/abnormalopinion]])

10. Build a giant wooden horse with festive decoration that spells in huge letters "HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY!". Roll it in front of the entrance of the house. Roll it away a day later. [still makes more sense than that Seven Potters crap]

DH is such an incredibly shit book.

*** I completely agree,

That line about not being able to make portkeys made absolutely no sense. They were at war, in a later screen someone tells harry to stop using expelliamus and basically kill death eaters.

Can't really worry about them being able to track the maker of a portkey and not worry about someone being killed.

It's even worse when you actually try and apply basic logic to every plan in that book.

Why were they camping for months, doing absolutely no training.

Why did they not tell anyone else about the horcruz in case they died. (Not even any plans to reveal the truth after their death or capture) which should have been on their list right after their capture at Malfoy manor.

Why did they decide to have a final stand at Hogwarts. They pitted 17 year olds against experienced (and probably trained) killers. It should have an absolute blood bath.

Surprisingly I actually like their plan for breaking into gringots. Despite their warning about not trusting goblins they had a fairly decent plan. An inside man is by far the easiest way to break into anything. But if they had told an adult they could have at least had their plan checked over.

Overall every plan in the final book reeks of someone who doesn't believe they can die. Which is classic for young people. But to someone who has had so much experience with death (Harry) you just hope for better planning.

It's even worse, the whole Horcrux Hunt as a concept makes no sense. It's putting the cart before the horse. Their problem /right now/ isn't Voldemort's immortality, it's that they don't know how to defeat him and how to destroy his followers & power base. Destroying the Horcruxes doesn't fix that and in the end they only defeat Voldemort due to pure dumb luck (a miracle). If Voldemort had used Sectumsempra instead of AK in the end it would've all been for nothing I guess?

If they capture, maim, obliviate the fuck out of or even kill (it took him years to come back) Voldemort, they (with the help of the new government) would have more than enough time to hunt and destroy his remaining Horcruxes. Getting to some of them would be ridiculously easy in comparison.

It's bonkers. Imagine if the Horcrux Hunt took them years "Great, Volldemort is mortal now, now we just have to take back Magical Europe which is under his thumb and find a way to fight the strongest Wizard ever. No biggie." But for reasons of plot everyone pretends if they destroy the Horcruxes they automatically win?! Maybe JKR forgot that the Horcruxes aren't the One Ring? It's even stupider when you realize that they have no way of knowing whether they actually got all the Horcruxes, so it doesn't even work on it's face if it were an "I Win" button. They easily could've missed one (like Harry's).

DH constantly drives the plot along, desperately asking us "please don't think about anything that's going on. Just be excited about the action, drama and cool set-pieces!"

** I like it. This is the kind of plan that Harry would agree to. If the Order insisted on sending someone else with Harry for protection in the unlikely event that he was found out, one person is a lot better, and a lot less conspicuous than 13 people. You'd think someone like Moody would come up with or agree to a plan like this to minimize complications and to plug any possible holes that may have been left with the death of Dumbledore. They all thought that Dumbledore trusted Snape and knew that Snape killed him, so Moody's paranoia would likely have had him wondering if Dumbledore told Snape of the plan before that and cause him to change it on principle.

Harry hated the canon plan and protested it until the issue was forced on him without his consent, mainly because it put other people in harm's way because they'd look like him. He wasn't wrong, either. Moody and Hedwig were killed. George lost an ear. A plan like the one described here could have prevented that from happening and avoided some of the later complications that arose from it.

The canon plan was a plan that reeked of Dumbledore's influence and involved at least one person who had no desire to go through with it (other than Harry, of course). If they were going to go through with this plan, they couldn't have found someone in the Order other than Mundungus Fletcher to participate? He was a liability in more ways than one, as it turned out. There was no way that the canon plan wasn't going to be ambushed, whether Snape knew about it or not. Even the people in the Order knew that an ambush was possible and at least a skirmish was likely. I am not sure how they expected Harry to go along with it without protest.

**** I can't remember how far away the DEs were supposed to be in the book, but the wiki has Moody telling Harry that they might not be able to get at Harry at #4 specifically because of Lily's protection, but that they knew the "rough position of the place". Whether that means they're staked out on Privet Drive itself or they're spread throughout Little Whinging looking for signs of magical transportation, or of Harry specifically, isn't made clear. What also isn't made clear is how far beyond #4 itself the protection went. It had to have extended a fair bit beyond #4, otherwise Harry would have been left unprotected whenever he went beyond the property line for any reason.

I also don't remember how far the Order contingent and the 7 Harrys were able to get away from #4 before the DEs were on them. The further they were able to go before being ambushed, the less likely it is that there were DEs staking out Privet Drive.

Either way, I think there'd be an abundance of caution with Harry putting the cloak on before he even leaves the house, and with the polyjuice being used as an added security measure in case something happens to the cloak on the trip.

The canon plan practically invited the ambush, had a lot more moving parts and took a previously unseen/unknown phenomenon involving his wand (the 'wand moving on its own' part, not the 'priori incantatum' part) to save Harry from being hurt or killed by Voldemort right then and there. A lot more could have gone wrong than actually did go wrong, and they were lucky to get out of there without more casualties.

****** They would probably constantly have to be using Homenum Revelio to actually catch Harry though. Harry could've also gone out the back door and even if the ambush went exactly the same as it did in the books, all they would've seen was the house suddenly appearing. Even with 30 death eaters all simultaneously casting Homenum Revelio, they're going to probably be casting at the house which would show, well, nothing.

If Hedwig left early, if the luggage was transported separately, and if Harry took off the invisibility cloak once he sees other muggles (because the only possible counter I could see to this plan is if the death eaters set up muggle repelling charms for a good distance beyond the house and put polyjuiced muggle plants within the range of the charms), nobody would suspect a random muggle going for a walk.

And for extra security, just fire off some Peruvian Instant Darkness in the house and directly around it to hide your traces. It wouldn't be that hard to rig something up that throws it around the house and yard just as Harry leaves and the house appeared.

I always thought they were stupid for not sending him immediately to the safe house from the train! Yes, he's at a higher risk while staying there instead of the Dursley's, but it avoids entirely the potential for an ambush.

Instead of it being a random guy, why not have it be Dudley? Harry impersonates Dudley and leaves the house normally. Maybe two other adults could impersonate Vernon and Petunia?

Of course, this is assuming that the Death Eaters didn't know about the Durselys leaving.

**** Something else I hadn't considered was the time of day that this all took place. I honestly don't even remember what time of day it was in the movie. I want to say it was nighttime, but that's just a guess. Assuming it was nighttime in both the book and the movie, I think that would be an extra advantage for this plan.

Even if DEs are scouting the area, which again could have been as nearby as Privet Drive itself or just the general area of Little Whinging, they don't know exactly where the house is. If it's dark outside, then sneaking out of the house under an invisibility cloak without being spotted would be that much easier.

I also don't remember if Harry, the Order members and the people disguised as Harry left #4 under disillusionment charms or not, but if they didn't, it wouldn't have been that difficult for DEs to spot them, even at night. Especially as one of them was Hagrid riding a noisy flying motorcycle.

So, a polyjuiced Harry who is under both a disillusionment charm and an invisibility cloak leaves #4 at night, either by himself or with one other person taking the same precautions, while the DEs think he's going to be surrounded by Order members and leaving some other way. Even the DEs scouting the area would have a difficult time finding him under those circumstances as long as he isn't stupid about it.

I think that's one if the main reasons why muggleborns are hated. They are considered a link between the 2 words. I mean, all muggleborns are taken from their world and thrust into the magical one and "supposed" to stay in it.

And to save all muggleborns and so called blood traitors like my two best friends! And because the prophecy said so!... ah yes, he is also killing muggles...

Not saying they weren't being idiots by not memory charming/confounding/imperiosing muggles to provide them the means to live like kings while they are risking their necks to kill Voldemort, only that all in all the muggle side of thing was always sidelined by all sides, so not really hypocrisy... to be fair though I definitely enjoyed cannon and other stories which focus on the Wizarding side of things more than I enjoy stories which try to give muggles protagonism or which explore the muggle world in-depth.

** I can't argue that the 7 Potters plan was dumb because it was but there are ways to reveal someone under the Invisibility Cloak. For example Dumbledore does it in Book 1 and Dementors (who were on the loose) can detect you. As a matter of fact I wonder why didn't the Death Eaters summon the Dementors when they saw there were multiple Harrys and for the real one to reveal himself by casting a Patronus (seems like the shape of his Patronus was common knowledge amongst the DE).

I would assume that if the Death Eaters who surveilled the area didn't know who else lives at that address they were not very diligent and thus deserve to be fucked over by a 17 year old. But assuming they did their job properly then one can assume they only saw the Dursleys get out and didn't care much about them since they were so sure Harry will come out eventually and they'll catch him.

Also why they chose that plan over other methods of magical transportation is explained in the book.

Anyways... that's my in-universe explanation. Realistically it was for plot reasons same as Harry's wand attacking Voldemort's all of a sudden despite Ollivander saying he never heard of such a phenomenon.

** In the fanfiction that I'm currently writing, the main character is a girl that the Death Eaters aren't allowed to hurt, because if they do Voldemort instantly dies forever. So what I did was, since Harry didn't want to endanger everyone's life with the 7 Potters plan, she proposed to have 7 people who looked like her.

*** wow. Umm, do you get a lot of people asking why Snape doesn't just slap the main character and end the war a few years early?

**** She learns about that at the end of Goblet of Fire. And it must be an order of Voldemort, not out of free will. And people don't know that Voldemort will die if she's hurt/she dies because of him. She only learns why in Deathly Hallows.

And the story isn't published yet. For now I just constantly daydream about it x)

***** well, hopefully you will manage to get it written. That certainly feels like a very exploitable weakness though...
