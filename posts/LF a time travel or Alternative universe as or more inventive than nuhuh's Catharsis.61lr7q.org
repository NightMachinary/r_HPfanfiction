Catharsis' is a pretty damn inventive story, with both arcs, the complete first and the incomplete second, choke full of interesting and inventive ideas. There's very little pointless angst, no real adherence to the stations of canon, no creepy psudo-romance and grooming of some child, no head-of-a-100-noble-families via Gringotts nonsense - ie. the usual pitfalls are avoided, and the awesome is liberally seasoned.

Are there other stories of this nature in this sub-genre? I've already read Strangers in an unholy land and Imprisoned Realm.
