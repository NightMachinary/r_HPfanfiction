Okay to understand the kind of harry fic I'm looking for, read the first chapter of "Last Second Saviour" if you haven't already and you will understand what I mean by a powerful and skilled harry. Any help would be great, but no fem!harry or slash please.


** Linkffn(Defiance by The BlackStaff and NightMarE) It's unfinished but has what you're looking for and is Harry/Daphne

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
