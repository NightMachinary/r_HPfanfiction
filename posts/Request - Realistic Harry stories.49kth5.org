This maybe a bit of a stretch since we are talking about Fanfiction where the most popular of stories are the powerful Harry or Genius Harry stories.

Is there any good 'not completely canon' Harry stories? If he's somewhat powerful its after he's 17 and he has worked to be there. Not a smartass like Hermione, but he is quite knowledgeable in the books when he thinks about things properly (he can be a bit of an idiot as well), so that level of intelligence.

Cheers!


** Harry in linkffn(Almost a Squib) is, as the name suggests, not overpowered at all. It's also complete. linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) is about a lazy Harry, who focuses more on comfort than super hardcore marines training all day like all the other eleven-year-olds. It's also complete and has 2 sequels, both finished.

*** Just finished the 3rd year of Harry the Hufflepuff, after reading lots of 150k+ stories, these short ones were funny as hell. Brilliant!

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
