Are there any stories with Harry or someone making a deal with say the devil or some equivalent? No crossovers because i know someone is going to recommend Denarian (hope i spelled that right) Renegade and its sequels and no slash. (Sorry for spelling and grammar i wrote this at church on my phone)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]]

- Harry makes a deal with Voldemort to end the war. Te fic picks up 100 years or so after it when both him and Voldemort are dragged back into events when Minister Draco Malfoy sends them to France to solve a rash of disappearances. It's a buddy cop fic starring Harry and Voldemort and it's fucking fantastic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal with a Devil]]

- Same sort of basic idea as Renegade with the denarian in the head but without the whole Harry is a massively overpowered unchanging asshole thing it has going. Get past the first few chapters and it gets better. That first one was boring as hell imo but the rest was pretty fun. Especially liked what the author did with the Chamber of Secrets plot line.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5871255/1/Fictional][Fictional]]

- Crossover with Fate/Stay Night. Yeah I know you said no crossovers but this one has a good enough premise and execution that everyone should read it. Harry is stuck serving an evil witch and in return she will keep him alive and supply him with energy or something idk specifics but the fic is fucking fantastic. You don't need much background knowledge of Fate but it doesn't hurt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]]

- Harry makes a deal with some sort of demon things. They sound sort of like the ones from [[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0632.html][Order of the Stick]] but idk if they're from something else or whatever. Anyway they fuse his soul with a couple others and he goes mad with power.

What would you say is the cut-off? I'm not really enjoying Lash's "I know what's going on" attitude when she doesn't even bother to check if rules are different in her new universe.

Edit - Never mind. Although the author has this story marked Complete it is abandoned by the author for being too bleak and depressing.

There's actually an author's note at the end of the first chapter that specifically addresses this!

Now if only that fic would be updated...

** I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for, but I have to mention it: linkffn(2452681)

It is not really devils deal like something for something. There is a box. Who opens it should go to hell. Harry opens it..

Just a warning - the story is bloody, disturbing, insane, awesome and memorable (I don't remember most of the stories I read, but I don't think I will ever forget this one :))

** linkffn(Breach of Contract: Twelve Signs by Matt Silver)

It's a metaphorical devil in this case. Harry and company did some fucked up shit during the war and to dodge prosecution he performs a ritual to remove the knowledge from everyone's mind. But the ritual needs payment to remain active... in blood.

A chilling story, but very well written.

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood.

** I swear I link someone this fic every month, but its so damn great! I have a feeling its exactly the kind of thing your looking for. Something Wicked this way Comes: linkffn(5501817) by The Mad Mad Reviewer

Basically Harry and Co get the bright idea to summon a demon to help kill Voldemort, but it doesn't exactly go as planned.....

An absolute knockout of a fic, solid pacing (slightly rushed in the last chapter or two) quite funny at times, but also can be very dark and depressing. It also has some of the best characterization I have seen in fan fiction. particularly that of the supporting cast, like Ron, Snape, and Dumbledore.

Now It is technically a cross over, which you said you don't wont, but the crossover series is minor at best, and can be safely ignored without it impacting on the story in the slightest. ( I didn't know about the crossover series when I first read it, that's for sure)

Hope this helps ! :P
