** Considering the author it probably should have been a little expected, but the sudden vulgar xenophobia, racism, and all around hatred towards muslims and middle eastern people found in the middle of the already clusterfucked story of Partially Kissed Hero caught me off guard.

[[/spoiler][Hermione's]] death in HP&t Gift of Memories probably fit the narrative the author was trying to pull off but it practically scarred us readers and many many people reacted with extreme hate, ultimately leading to a long and then probably permanent hiatus.

In Not Normal/New Normal by Radaslab the justification of barely-teen aged kids having sex lives was pretty gross but not that unusual unfortunately. The memorable part was how insanely world breaking the trunks were and how the author just kept adding and growing them. It got stupid quick.

Other than that most of the extremely silly deus ex machinas, wish fulfillment, and shopping trips have been done so much theyre basically standard for unreadable shitfics these days. Ive gotten a feel for bad fics and can generally tell within the first 1000 words if it's even worth starting let alone finishing, so I've missed a lot of later insanity on sure.

** Everything in For Love of Magic was ridiculous tbh.

The most memorable was the second last update of Prince of Slytherin where the author introduced the concept of "nomenography" aka the magic of names.

It's the first time I've seen an author try to explain Rowling's naming to an adult audience rather than expecting people to believe that wizards are okay with names like "Bad Faith" and "Flight from Death" or name their -not yet a werewolf- children "Remus" or "Fenrir".

I'm still waiting for an explanation into the other names and choices.

*** Tbh I really like how that author goes about creating logical ways for the things to happen. Also I'm pretty sure in that story, Fenrir is a made up name and his real name is Bob or something?

**** Yup. Same with Malfoy where it was something gained as a result of ancient dynastic politics, rather than just a way to let the audience know subtly that this family is bad and not to be trusted.

Fanfictions that mock this by having people insult Draco/Lucius/Voldemort etc. are even worse, because it makes it even more painfully obvious.

*** My headcanon for Malfoy is that it comes from "MÃ¢le Foi" (male faith) : the family came into this name because of the last aknowledged master of a roman mystery cult was their ancestor.

**** Damn, how long has this been canon?

Also, my comment was about what The Sinister Man comes up with, though this is interesting.

I still maintain that Rowling did this afterwards because of too many questions though.

Also, it doesn't explain other things. Why would a canon Malfoy family progenitor allow himself to be named that? It's like telling people that him and/or his descendants are gonna be untrustworthy self serving people.

I also doubt Tom went to a seer to derive Voldemort.

The part about parents fretting about theirs children's future based on the name given is quite in line with the latest update though. Guess I know where author is getting these ideas.

**** Malfoy. In french, mal is bad and foi is faith. Though, according to google translate, it'd be more grammatically correct to say "mauvaise foi."

***** It would be in modern french. Medieval french accepted "male" as the feminine form of "mal", and it is still used in a few set expressions.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue) was a delightful fic, that started off great, and went on to be even more interesting, somewhere in the realm of, but not close to linkffn(Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus) (also one of my favourites).

I don't want to spoil anything, as I highly recommend that fic, so reading it would be great.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
