I've always had a soft spot for Grimmauld Place, and I especially enjoy fics where somebody (preferably Harry, the trio, or Sirius in some combination) cleans up Grimmauld and makes it a well loved house again. Bonus points for befriending Kreacher. I'd appreciate some fics in this genre if anyone knows some good ones


** My one problem with cleaning up Grimmauld Place is the permanent sticking charm. If there was a way to remove it, Sirius's mum would have found it and pulled down the posters in his room. So, my take was that after the war, Harry buys a similar house in London and they turn Grimmauld place into a museum or something.

Also, Kreacher and Harry worked things out in Deathly Hallows.

House-elf magic, as easy as that. There is multiple evidence in canon where house elves bypass Wizard wards (e.g. Dobby popping in unnoticed during CoS, Dobby's rescue mission in Malfoy Manor, Kreacher apparating out of Voldy'y cave) and Wizards being either un-knowing of that or ignorant of the possibility a "lower" being might have magic supreme to theirs.

Sirius' mother simply never thought of asking Kreacher.

*** The best idea I've seen is removing the wall itself. It could work if you cut out the wall with some spell, and quickly replace it with a new one. And of course magic.

As for why Sirius' mother couldn't remove the posters in his room, I think the idea of damaging her noble ancestors' house, even temporarily, would've appalled her. Also, she may not have gotten magical assistance in fixing his room, because the Blacks kept dying as years went on. It could be that she wasn't magically gifted to pull off the reconstruction on her own.

As for living in it, I do think Harry would redecorate the house and live in it for a while, but I think he'd want to move out after having childrens because the house would be too conveniently big for them to pull off shenanigans. I imagine he still has it as a safehouse or a worst case scenario where they need a highly protected house like the Order did.

edit: misspelt appalled.

That actually makes sense. It also fits with the hints at mental instability due to inbreeding that are in the books.

*** In Strangers at Drakeshaugh linkffn(6331126) the Potters move to the country when James gets old enough to start school. James tells people they used to live in a 'Grim Old Place'.

Grimmauld Place is being used as a kind of hostel for auror trainees. Kreacher stayed behind to look after the place.

*** I always assumed that she just never went in there, or at least he put them back up again every time just out of spite. Then when he left home the family just locked up his room and left it rather than actual confront the consequences of their actions. Also, it is a large house (at some points it seems as if half the Order is living there and a Hippogryph) probably as she got older, less mobile and more introverted and the only one left living there with no visitors, she probably just spent her entire time in a couple of rooms and just left the rest of the house to moulder, which explains the state it is in.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

***** Low drama stories where everyone just acts sensibly are the best kind of stories. I've ragequit a bunch of fics - most recently about 5 minutes ago - due to the MC being so idiotic that it's depressing to read about.
