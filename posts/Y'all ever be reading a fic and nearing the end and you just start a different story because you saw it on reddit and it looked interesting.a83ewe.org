** I am an obsessive type of reader. If I find a good story, it's not uncommon for me to have my head buried in it all day... and most of the night. I'm also a slower reader.

So if I do come up for air, it's likely the story has fizzled or was in need of a good edit/prune. Plus endings are incredibly hard, so I don't expect most writers (of any work) to nail it.

Additionally, I start about 1/3 of the fics I do, for sheer novelty. Once that wears off, all that's left is the quality of the story. There are close to 800,000 stories on Fanfiction.net alone so why waste time?

*** 10? Ha! I had just over 100 open on my phone a few weeks ago, built up over a year, and I finally decided to clear them all out since I was obviously not going to get back to them all. Even in the last week I've gotten it already back to about 15 tabs. :P

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** Yeah it happens, but then the original fic I was reading wasn't as interesting as I thought if I'm that easily distracted. So usually I'm not super concerned about it.

** Yeah I was reading After the Epilogue, but wanted to find a couple of cracks oneshots to read. I ran into Rorschach's Blot's work and was lost.

** I tend to drop out when the writer reaches a part where they feel they have to write it, but aren't that enthused. Then a new fic will grab me and I'll close the old one.

It's the one real flaw in the publish-as-you-go model, the middles turn into a slog that need, really, to be edited down to nothing or almost nothing, but the writer needs to write them to see how things pan out.

THAT SAID, I'm not knocking those writers! Because, free entertainment and usually it /is/ entertaining or I would never have read Chapter Two. I am pretty excited for fics marked as a 'rewrite'.

** I got to book 6 of that story. It's one of my favorites because it combines literally all of my favorite tropes and plots. I've actually gotten to book 6 2 separate times. God knows how much cumulative time i've spent.

I always lose interest when they're deep into the war stuff and all the characters have really developed. (If anyone has read that far when they're living in Woodhouse and the stuff with the ministry)
