It is funny how minor, throwaway actions which the person won't even remember if asked about a week later can have big consequences later on. Like when Dumbledore thoughtlessly gave a young Tom Riddle the idea of making an Horcrux by commenting during one of his explanations in transfiguration that a half of a duck, if made living, would be kept alive forever since it needs an entire body to die properly, but this is not this mat story, no, instead we will talk about how Minerva McGonnagal, bane of miscreants everywhere inadvertently created the first magical gang of thugs of the magical world.

Our story begins in the spring of 1962, when a raging McGonnagal was alerted by her then head-boy that a sixth-year couple were caught having sex in the boys dorm. After a thorough verbal lashing and taking away enough point to assure Gryffindor wouldn't get the cup that year the still foaming professor had the same charms on the stairs for the girls dormitory applied to the boys in order to prevent girls from getting there. The public shaming of those students and all the fire they got first from their own house and then from the other three as the initiative caught on is irrelevant to us, indeed, such incident only had it's greater impact around thirty years later when a young girl tried without success to access the boy's dorm in the much more noble quest of robbing a family friend of the dark artifact she threw away, without anyone knowing -naturally- so she wouldn't get in trouble.

But alas, thanks to our intrepid professor's efforts decades earlier such a quest was doomed to fail, which didn't discourage our brave red-headed from trying again and again, setting off the alarm each time and pissing her head of house progressively into a towering fury that resulted in the first recorded case of a house's point going into the negatives. Incidentally, such an incident and it's cause coupled with the stop in attacks shifted the school's gossip topic from “Who is trying to kill us all” into the much more interesting and of vital importance one of “Why the actual hell is the weird fristy so intent on going to the guy's dorm?”, a discussion which just so happened to take prominent place on the golden trio's debates, making them completely forget their search for the heir and subsequently dooming Tom Riddle's diary to a lengthy stay in Harry's trunk among Vernon's old socks and Dudley's faded t-shirt.

Said diary probably felt a lot of relief upon being carelessly thrown under Harry's bed the first day of summer, though less so about being completely forgotten there upon Harry's hasty departure. Such an ignoble fate was not meant to last however, as Dudley -annoyed at his favorite aunt's forced departure- braved upon the confines of his old second room in search of something valuable owned by Harry that he could destroy in revenge. After an hour-long search Dudley then kicked the bed in frustration, revealing then the diary thrown haphazardly left under the bed.

After his attempts of burning down the house proved incapable of even scratching the diary Dudley then had the most brilliant and risky idea he ever had to date, to actually /read/ the diary believing it to be his cousin's. After hours spent going back and forth the slim book to ascertain it's blankness Dudley then was hit with an even more cunning plan, to /write/ embarrassing things in the diary and then /say/ Harry wrote them, and considering that he was by that point off the Smeltings he would have lots of time to put in practice his oh so evil scam. And since Dudley never bothered reading the things after writing them he never noticed when the diary tried getting his attention before exasperatedly choosing to just wait the stupid kid finish pour his whole soul to attain his resurrection.

Now we must all stop a minute to appreciate Voldemort's compromise to the empirical method and all the great amounts of knowledge it brought the world, it is only because of him that we were able to discover beyond doubt that making confetti with ones soul to throw around is surprisingly bad to the person's sanity. He was about to make another such big scientific discovery as he entered the final steps of the process to come back to life, which consisted of fully consuming the target's soul, take complete possession of their body and using the target's magic to remold their body in his original one (a process which leaves the target bereft of magic so they have no way of throwing away the possessing soul), this ground-breaking, utterly unexpected discovery that surely makes the somewhat dubious practice of experimenting on oneself a perfectly reasonable and sound step to take is that muggles, surprisingly enough, don't have magic.

And so it is that Tom Riddle ended up squatting in the body of the boy previously known as Dudley Dursley with no way of re-shaping it while maintaining his own magic, and to make matters worse even his own wandless magic was greatly weakened by being on an unfamiliar body. Complicating even more things for him stealing a wand proved to be more difficult than he had thought for a magicless teen, turns out that Wizards are surprisingly overprotective of the little thing which enabled them to make the laws of reality a joke, who would have thought? On top of that Olivander was unwilling to sell any wand at all to him unless he had authentic confirmation from either Hogwarts or the ministry of his ability to use magic; all the illegal wand-sellers demanded outrageous prices for their wares and he had to run from seven hags on a roll.

Alone, poor, miserable and with no prospects Duddlemort ended his brilliant day sulking on a side-alley like some common bum where he come to meet his savior, which was none other than Mundungus Fletcher.

The alleged and confirmed thief approached our hero to politely enquire about his health while looking for something to rob. Voldemort for all his many faults was a leader capable of inspiring legions to follow him, Tom Riddle charmed his way to power with his stunning good looks and cunning... for this exchange thankfully his cunning was enough to do the trick. A long talk and many promises of loot and alcohol later and Tom Riddle was now looking at his first new follower and mentor in the noble art of petty crime: Mundungus Fletcher... at this point I trust we have established that beggars can't be choosers.

It was definitely not much, pitiful really, but with Mundungus' contacts, skill in robbing unwitting targets and Tom's cunning the both of them managed to start their own gang, soon Duddlemort got himself a ‘borrowed' wand that didn't completely hate him, and with hours upon hours of practice in casting magic with the body of a muggle he slowly regained enough of his abilities to reach a level where he could have potentially out-dueled Gregory Google himself... well, first year Gregory Google at least, but no matter, for his true value was on his planning and ordering around skills which resulted in great robberies, such as a little kid's chocolate-frogs collection, a hag's fake jewelries and Fenrir Greyback's torn trousers, all of which sold for high enough a price that they got to live in a rundown pub in knock turn, they were very proud of such an achievement. Eventually their little two-men gang started gaining attention and more members, going on more and more risky but rewarding heists, pet-stores, apothecaries and beggars quickly learned to fear them, all the while Duddlemort slowly worked on achieving enough power to eventually conquer Britain.

Then the Triwizard Tournament came and went. And suddenly there were whispers of the Dark Lords return and of a new war. Duddlemort was indecisive of what to do with this information, but one thing was for sure. Neither Duddlemort nor Voldemort were willing to share even the smallest more inconsequential bits of potential power, they were going to war.

... Now to break the news to his gang...

So what do you think?


** For some reason, I thought of having a Dark Lord Dumbledore be named Tomus Dumblemort, would that be the most ridiculous name you would ever read? (I also thought for a platformer sequel game where Harry has to go through levels based on fics and common fandom plots and gets to blow the levels up to complete them and can find upgrades like a alternate Elder Wand which allows the magic shot out of it to deal more damage and you don't lose after you get hit or lose a life, that the fandom plot of evil Dumbledore being the main focus of one of the worlds, as the boss of that world.)

** I like it. I like it a lot. Also, ". Like when Dumbledore thoughtlessly gave a young Tom Riddle the idea of making an Horcrux by commenting during one of his explanations in transfiguration that a half of a duck, if made living, would be kept alive forever since it needs an entire body to die properly," Mad-Eye would like a word with dumbledore.

** I'm not sure if “Gregory Google” was intentionally spelled that way because of autocorrect, but I find it bloody hilarious.
