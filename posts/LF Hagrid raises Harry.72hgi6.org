I have no idea if this exists anywhere but I'll ask anyways. Does anyone know if there's a fic where Hagrid raises Harry instead of dropping him off at the Dursleys? Thanks!


** Never considered this but that'd be cool to read. Hagrid is so capable of looking after his creatures. Not to mention the conflict between others who would feel that hagrid is incapable of a nurturing environment because of his suspected heritage and Hogwarts expulsion. I think this could definitely be a cool read. I guess the question is whether the wizarding world would know that Harry lived, or that hagrid was raising a child or that that child was Harry. Probably not a Darklord! Slytherin! Neutral! Harem! Fic but definitely one where harry grew up with solid support/affection and either a natural instinct/empathy towards creatures or a crippling fear of whatever hagrid was doing before shrewts. Alternatively Harry grows up doing many things within the household that hagrid isn't as good at. This could be because hagrid didn't bother, the work too delicate or he has different tastes (rock cakes!) so Harry is still independent and responsible for some household duties (see cake making) but does it out of love/duty rather than forced labour. Anyway just some thoughts.

** We might get an answer to the age old question of "Can a 3 year old ride a hypogriff?" Or, "How does an acromantula interpret 'googa gaaga'?"

Or how about "What happens to a kid raised exclusively on tea, because its food was a hitherto unknown state of matter harder than diamonds?"

This and more in "Fang stop licking the baby!"

*** Sounds fun. And the Acromantula one is a valid question. /Do/ baby acromantulas make baby noises, or are they just silent until they are taught to speak?

***** Probably. By the way, I wonder if acromantulas attach special meanings to certain types of clicking, like a secondary language, or if it's just an emotional reaction like laughing or crying.

****** Hey it's your fanfic.

Realistically speaking, since they can learn to speak, they have to be at least kinda smart, and Hagrid was able to communicate to Aragog when he was young so they must at least be able to understand more nuances than just emotion.

I know, I know, I was just curious about whether someone else had a headcanon about this already.

Oh, in my headcanon, /all/ the Forbidden Forest acromantulas spoke English, not just Aragog --- he was just the only one to make himself heard during Harry and Ron's brief visit to the Colony. They speak English among themselves and everything. I see the clicking as an additional, more instinctive process. The question being, is it /purely/ a nervous reflex, or is it something controlled with nuances to it.

******** You have to consider, the nervous reflexes of animals and people still have meaning. Like when we get sad, our facial contortions are a nervous reflex, but it still carries meaning.

The question is, why did Aragog teach them English? Maybe they were organizing a coup? maybe they're part of the Rotfang Consipiracy? What's the truth? Find out in next months Quibbler!

This just in: experts debunk the Rotfang theory; as Acromantulas are the possessors of the largest-known fang among all sentient beings, it is easily determined by the naked eye whether those are rotten or not, and Professor Rubeus Hagrid, an eminently trustworthy witness, confirms the Acromantulas' fangs are, in fact, not rotten.

More seriously though, he just taught them English because... you teach your kids to speak? Obviously? And English /was/ Aragog's first language, since Hagrid raised him from hatching.

Yeah I imagine if spider isn't sufficient to communicate then he might just.
