I've got no real red flags. So long as it isn't completely unreadable, I'm fine with pretty much anything that falls in my specifications.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After]]).

Basically the characters become self-aware of the fact that they're in a cliched story. Highlights include Ron and Harry discussing Ron-bashing, Snape looking for a way to avoid a Snarry chapter, and McGonogall with her own subplot to get more screentime. It's probably my favorite crackfic alongside linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) and Harry the Hufflepuff (linked below).

Then there's onshots like ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1661579/1/Intelligent-Conversations]]) (Crabbe and Goyle become intelligent and have to hide it from Draco) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8555329/1/A-Kiss-of-Clich%C3%A9d-Proportions]]) (A parody of "Lord-Potter" fics), and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7079665][Slytherin Career Day]] (a funny take on the 5th-year Career chats from Snape's perspective) that are also pretty funny.

#+begin_quote
  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  It had all started with a kiss. Not just any kiss, mind, but a kiss he never expected. If that sounds like a cliché, that's because it is...and it's far from the only one. Oneshot, Harry/Multi.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
