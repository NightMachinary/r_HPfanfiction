** For some reason, that trope shows up a lot in WBWL fics.

  Albus Dumbledore stepped into the court room, old tome and stack of parchments under one arm, looked around, and raised an eyebrow. He supposed he shouldn't be surprised.... He'd tried several more times to get Harry Potter to confess, even going so far as to stall the trial to give the boy longer to stew down in the cells. His contacts told him the boy didn't seem to react well to such an environment and he'd hoped that would sway him, but it was all to no avail. The boy had stubbornly refused to sign anything.

  Mr. Dumbledore frowned a little. “Why would it be your concern what they did to anyone else, m'boy?”

  He could hardly believe the man who had taught him all about compassion and the greater good was saying this. But Dumbledore continued to frown at him, as if he assumed that Jonathan would agree with him and was just temporarily out of his mind to not do so.

  "I have to keep them at a lower level, when they are not the people who can save the world,” Dumbledore said gently. “But if he truly despised the Dark, he would go ahead and destroy Voldemort of his own free will. Has that happened? It has not. He's too sympathetic to them. I don't know if he's uncertain about what he should do or actively plotting to overthrow the Order of the Phoenix, but either way, it's not something I can trust.”
