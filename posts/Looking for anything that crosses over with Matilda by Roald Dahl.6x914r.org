So I was watching one of my favorite childhood films today when it hit me. Through out the course of the movie Matilda pretty much learns how to control her accidental magic. My mind was blown by this sudden realization, and for the last several hours I've been thinking of ways in which the Matilda universe could possibly conflict with Potterverse. (I mostly focused on just the movie, though I have read the book, but it's been years since I've read the book and I've seen the movie thousands of time so I know that better.) I couldn't really think of any conflicting things that would prevent the two from combining so I got exited about the potential crossover fics. I would try to write something myself, but my past dabbling in fanfic always ended in writers block and unfinished stories because of it. I'm hoping that if a crossover doesn't already exist I can plant the seed for one to spring up.

The only thing that conflicted in my mind about this idea, that I'm sure I haven't been the first to think about this crossover, is what country this story would take place in. I know that Roald Dahl was from the British Isles and while the things that I can remember about the books of his that I've read are muddled, thanks to many of them being made into movies and it having been years since I've last read one, I don't remember what part of the world Matilda is set in. I very well could have been some where in the British Isles in the books, but in the movie it's obviously the US, what with all the cars that Harry Wormwood sells having the steering wheel on the left and everyone having an American accent, but the Trunchbull. So in my imaginings of what kind of fic I would write, if I ever wrote one, I've pictured Matilda going to Ilvermorny. Though if there are any out there already I would certainly never turn my nose up at Hogwarts or any other fictional American school if it had been written before we knew about Ilvermorny.


** I've actually thought of the logistics of a massive Roald Dahl crossover once.

- You've got Matilda covered (and for me it'd definitely take place in England). There have been one or two attempts at melding /Chocolate Factory/ with HP, such as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5iea86/eu_willy_wonka_and_harry_potter_exist_in_the_same/][these ones]].

- And /The BFG/... with a few changes, it could /easily/ be said that Giant Country is the Giant Colony we see in canon. This fits right down to most giants being uncivilized brutes and bullying a smaller giant whom they call "runt". And maybe the reason the Queen wasn't that surprised about the Giants is that, like the PM, she already /knew/ magic was real, so it wasn't much of a stretch.

- /George's Marvellous Medicine/'s Granny Kranky is obviously a potion-skilled witch who married muggle, and George himself is a not-yet-Hogwarts-age muggleborn who stumbled upon a very potent potion recipe without realizing it.

- You could make a case for /The Magic Finger/ to be kicked off by unusually powerful accidental magic.

- It's a tougher sell, but what about the "witches" of the eponymous book really being Hags? It would fit with their ugliness and hatred of children. And we do know Hags can do "rudimentary magic" such as potions. The Grand Witch with her frying eyes could be a Half-Hag who went to Hogwarts and is great at wandless magic.

*** Fantastic Mr Fox - a bunch of animaguses who decided to stay animaguses and reproduce while in their form.

Stretching it too far? Fine. :( That particular community of anthropomorphic animals are squibs who had been turned into animals by their despicable families, and set free in the woods to be hunted by muggles. Being squibs, and animals, they are unable to transform themselves back, or seek help, but they find they are able to communicate with each other, if not ordinary animals and humans. Or perhaps they're muggles, who again, as a form of muggle-baiting, have been turned into animals.

** I have a theory: Trunchbull is related to Umbridge, who was a Half-Blood and had Muggle relatives.

** This crossover would work so well, though. Matilda already lives in England ("She travelled all over the world while sitting in her little room in an English village" -Chapter 1 of Matilda) so she can go to Hogwarts. Her ability to move things could be accidental magic - the first time she used it was when she was angry at Ms Trunchbull ("Matilda felt herself getting angrier..." - Chapter 14 of Matilda) and accidental magic is triggered by fear or anger ("Never made things happen when you was scared, or angry?"- Hagrid, chapter 4 of HPatPS). Matilda is around five-and-a-half years old when she enters school ("She was five and a half when she entered school for the first time."- Chapter 7 of Matilda) and the book ends several weeks after that, so there's plenty of time between that and 11 years old for worldbuilding and such.

Tldr, HP and Matilda would work amazingly together.
