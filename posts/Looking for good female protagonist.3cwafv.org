I loved many of the fics listed in this post: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/31pjsk/hermionewholived_is_that_a_thing/cq3wfm2]]

However, they are all only about Hermione. Can you recommend similar good fics that feature other female characters as protagonists.

I'm generally looking for: -Strong and consistent plot -Smart characters (as in, acting reasonably, not as in booksmart) -Significantly different from canon

Though I'd also read a good mary-sue badass-y fic.


** Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) is probably the best.

Linkffn(Starlincht) is another good OC centric one.

Linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) is an excellent Ginny-centric Fanfic.

Linkffn(The Rebirth by Irina) is pretty good, even though it has a rather clich√© start. It was written Pre-OoTP, which is something you have to keep in mind. It's sequel linkffn(Galatea) is much better than Rebirth, which is more of a guilty pleasure for those who like a badass Ginny than a really high quality work.

After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(The Spiral Path by wordhammer) is excellent. The idea behind it is along the lines of "In the Graveyard Scene, Fem!Harry would have been raped, so how can we make a Fem!Harry who nonetheless would survive that scene."

Obvious warnings there, but the writing is great and the story is thoughtful and very well done.

** This is one of my faves, but yes, its Hermione centric:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3553046/1/Spellcaster]]

Here's one that OFC-centric [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1724293/27/The-Family-Clock]] I was re-reading it after a couple of years, and the first couple of chapters are very, very rom-com but eventually there's some action/intrigue.
