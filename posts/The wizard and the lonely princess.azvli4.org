Harry Potter was a lonely boy who one day wished for a friend. Luna, trapped on the moon, wished for the same. And so their wishes are granted. How will the two deal with each other? And what about Nightmare Moon? Needless to say, their lives are going to change in both expected and unexpected ways...

A good read has a sequel but it isu finished.

*** Oh it's definitely smaller than it was in the heyday, but it has no more chance of disappearing than the HP fandom does. Though with Hasbro doing a complete franchise reboot soon I think it's definitely going to shrink in the near future.

**** The mlp fandom knew that hasbro was going to reboot fim sometime, the only thing thats going to suck is if the new franchise isnt good then the fim fandom will just stay seperate, but if the new franchise lives up to FIM then im sure they'll just allow the new generations content to be posted along side FIM content
