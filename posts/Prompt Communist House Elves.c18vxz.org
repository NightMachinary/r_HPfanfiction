With elves actually liking work, disliking money and being rather selfless, communism might actually work.


** But first, they need to overcome their oppressors, preferably in the bloodiest way possible.

** One of the many interesting parts of linkffn(Strong Blood by CooLibrarian) is a Marxist elf (I think, she is a female) May who fought for the dignity of elves. I have very ambiguous opinion about that story. Some parts are absolutely unique and awesome, but whole story is seriously convoluted and confusing. For example, it is one of very very few fanfics with some family history of Evanses; what happened to grandparents in the HP universe? Almost all of us knew or know at least some of our grandparents, but except of Neville and some few others, there are no grandparents in the HP universe (and same goes for the fanfic world) or older family histories.

  Harry and Dudley learn about their muggle grandparents, and the struggles they faced while facing challenges of their own. Rated M for serious issues.
