** */Dear Diary,/* wrote Ginny into her new exercise book, the feathery end of her quill tickling her chin. It hadn't been on the school supply list, but she'd found it with her things that evening after dinner. The shopkeeper at Flourish and Blotts must have put it with her school purchases during the rush that day when Gilderoy Lockhart had visited the shop.

*/Today I met Gilderoy Lockhart./*

Lockhart had a bright and charming smile, which her Mum had always sighed over when she pulled out his household spellbook to tackle the doxys in the attic, or the jarvey in the chicken coop. He had sparkling eyes and gleaming golden hair, but Ginny had decided years ago she liked boys with dark hair better. Yes, dark hair.

And green eyes, too.

*/But Harry Potter is much better,/* she wrote. */He gave me his autographed textbooks today, Diary, the whole set just like that. He's living in our house right now, and sleeping in my brother's room.../*

"AAHHH!!!"

Her scribbling was interrupted by a loud scream from across the hall, which sounded like Ron whenever the twins hid a spider under his pillow for a joke.

"MUUUUUM! MUM!!!"

Ginny ignored it, and kept writing about Harry, her true love and future husband. In fact, she didn't put her quill down until her mother barged into her room and told her the whole family was taking Harry to St. Mungo's.

** Assuming Ginny just uses it as a diary, not knowing what it is either, I'd bet Harry's name makes it in there pretty quick given her obsession with him at that age. Probably some of her brothers' names, other Gryffindors too. Honestly, this seems more effective than the actual diary was.

It's actually super effective.

The only trouble is that this premise doesn't make an engaging story outside of a short oneshot, when all the sympathetic characters are killed off in Chapter 1, while the worst characters like Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort live, because they've been careful to their faces and true names hidden for years. And the HP setting lacks logical/intelligent personalities with grand-scale ambitions who could make use of such a plot device the way the original Death Note characters did.

In fact, if you'll allow a bit of armchair-worldbuilding, you could have it so that the /HP/ Death Note is a third Deathly Hallow. Voldemort was thus always aware of it, which is the real reason he tried to bury his real name.

Such as? I really don't get that. There's room in canon to make the argument that his actions only make sense if we assume he's much more /amoral/ than Rowling meant for him to be. But incompetent, I've never bought it. Gimme some solid evidence so I can refute it.

He mostly gets defeated through a combination of random luck, Dumbledore outwitting him in advance, and overconfidence. More generally, though, the fact that a character is hit by the Idiot Ball by authorial /fiat/ at a critical time in the plot should not be given too much weight when discussing the character's intelligence in general. Setting aside the few times in the books where he does overlook a clever solution to his problems, he is written /with the intention/ of coming off as manipulative and calculating.

#+begin_quote

That's not quite what he did. He put forward a plausible story to be acquitted, and /then/ used generous bribes to convince the involved official to buy said excuse. But regardless, how does that discount him as clever and ambitious enough to use the Death Note in interesting ways? Whether the /HP/ legal system is a "proper" one is besides the point. It's Malfoy's skills we're discussing, not the Wizengamot.

"The first two books"? I can see /Philosopher's Stone/ (though I think there are many ways to rationalize his actions), but what did he do in /Chamber of Secrets/ that so clearly betrayed lack of interest in the children's safety? And again, ruthlessness and incompetence are different things anyway.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

/That/ argument I don't think holds any weight whatsoever. Dumbledore, like everyone else, thought Sirius was guilty and had no /reason/ to try and "help" the man he believed had been yet another treacherous friend in the mold of Grindelwald. (Dumbledore has a tendency to see Grindelwalds everywhere; it is his greatest and most persistent character flaw.) In the post-War era, I think he was more concerned with making sure Death Eaters who belonged there /were/ sent to Azkaban, rather than combing through the files to see if there was any chance one of those who /did/ make it to Azkaban had done so by mistake.

#+begin_quote
  Same with Hagrid.
#+end_quote

To what incident are you referring? In /Chamber of Secrets/, it's made explicit that with his rapidly diminishing hold on Fudge, he /doesn't/ have the political clout to help Hagrid. As for the 1943 incidents, Dumbledore /did/ in fact do quite a bit to help Hagrid, what with fixing his wand in secret and giving him a convenient excuse for staying at Hogwarts even though he had to be expelled and all that. Remember that?

#+begin_quote
  He also chose to make Harry's trial a political affair instead of simply defending Harry.
#+end_quote

He didn't really. Umbridge did. From the moment she decided to have him judged by the Wizengamot, I think it became clear to /everyone/ involved that what was happening was underhanded politicking, not a mere trial for a minor breach to the Statute. Ignoring that context and acting like /anyone/ was trying for due legal process wouldn't have achieved anything except make Dumbledore look like an idiot.

#+end_quote

Yeah, but /why/ are you talking about the books? Why /shouldn't/ we take /FB/ into account when talking about Grindelwald's characterization? That is after all where the bulk of the characterization happened. Doing anything else is kinda like discussing Horcruxes based only on /Chamber of Secrets/, or Scabbers based only on /Philosopher's Stone/. Whether or not you preface it with "In the first two books...", it still comes across as a pretty inexplicable choice that doesn't get you much of anywhere.

#+begin_quote

Granted. But ignoring that particular display, there remains the fact that Lucius is shown to be an ambitious fellow with a knack for manipulation. I'm not claiming he's a Vetinari-level mastermind or anything, you understand. Merely that if he got hold of the Death Note he would have both the will, and the ability, to do interesting things with it. Maybe not optimal things. But interesting things. Same for Voldemort and Dumbledore.

Mark also that I said, when mentioning Malfoy in that first post, "if you'll allow a bit of fanon-creep" --- meaning I was dealing with the fanonical interpretation that Lucius is better-versed in politics than canon strictly suggests.

The /senior/ Crabbe and Goyle did. We really have no evidence that they're as mentally diminished as their offspring. But also and conversely, if we assume that Draco's Crabbe and Goyle are basically equivalent to the previous generation's, we might further theorize (as I've seen done) that Crabbe Snr. and Goyle Snr. are henchpeople of Lucius Malfoy's, and that /he/ got them out without their doing anything of their own.

Well, it /worked/, dinnit? I don't think you get to call up /gambits that worked out as planned/ as evidence that Dumbledore is incompetent.

Keep in mind also the nature of stable time loops. By the time Dumbledore suggested time travel as a solution, Sirius had already been saved using time travel. I find it entirely plausible that Dumbledore /knew/ this by that point, and was ensuring the stability of the time loop, which was the best thing he could do at that point. This 'theory' has the advantage that by its logics, Dumbledore's gambit didn't even count as endangering the kids, since /he already knew things worked out fine/.

#+begin_quote
  The supposed greatest wizard of his time cannot solve a mystery a 13-year-old girl figured out?
#+end_quote

Another worn-out argument. The simple fact is that Hermione had access to data that Dumbledore didn't: that Parselmouth Harry kept hearing weird voices coming from the pipes. Without that info, Hermione certainly wouldn't have figured it out; with it, Dumbledore surely would have.

Now setting Hermione aside altogether, ('cause, again, she cheated), you may still deem it a stretch that he doesn't figure it out /anyway/ due to sheer "Slytherin's Monster is probably some kinda snake", and that's a somewhat better argument, but the twofold counterargument to that is that A) it's not too well-known that Basilisks can Petrify rather than kill, and B) as far as even Professor Scamander knew prior to 1993, Basilisks' maximum lifespan was only about 700 years.

#+begin_quote
  Also, not figuring out that Lockhart was a fraud/allowing him to teach what he did.
#+end_quote

Canonically, that was all a ploy to exploit the Curse on the Defence Professorship as a way to expose or otherwise incapacitate Lockhart whom Dumbledore knew (but without hard evidence) to be a fraud. So again, you can see this as ruthless-amoral-bastard-Dumbledore, but not as incompetent-Dumbledore. He worked out a scheme, and that scheme worked like a charm.

#+begin_quote
  Did he get the others in the inner circle as well? Nott, McNair and so on.
#+end_quote

Macnair, I would definitely imagine, yes. He doesn't strike me as a particularly wealthy fellow if he has to /work a job/ as the Ministry's executioner; nor does the nature of said job make me terribly confident in his social skills.

Nott on the other hand probably did it all by himself, since we're told that Draco and Theodore are 'equals' in terms of social standing --- which I don't think they'd be if Nott Snr. was indebted to Malfoy Snr. There is certainly room for more than one clever, very very rich Slytherin in Wizarding Britain, however, by my reckoning.

Not "in those twelve years", for he hadn't the slightest inkling (nor any way of having the slightest inkling) that Sirius wasn't guilty for most of those 12 years. As for why he engineers Sirius's escape rather than force a trial /then/, I think you're underestimating how much political clout Dumbledore retains in 1994 with Fudge no longer listening to him and Umbridge on the rise as Fudge's new top advisor. There is every reason to think, given what we see of the Ministry's handling of dangerous and potentially-politically-devastating criminals in the very next book, that the Ministry would have had Sirius quietly Kissed before any scandalous trial could be held.

Not to mention that even if he was innocent of the crime he was first jailed for, Sirius was still guilty of having escaped unlawfully from Azkaban, a crime which carries a Dementor's Kiss sentence all on its own. I don't actually know, even with an unbiased court, if his lawyer would've had a leg to stand on.

***************** Sorry, yeah, 1991. I've read so much fanfic that gets wonky with the year I couldn't remember if '91 was canon or fanon.

I think the Room of Hidden Things shouldn't be considered part of the castle as it seems to be Unplottable and have its own set of highly defensive wards..... as it is past of the Room of Retirement. Even if we factor it, nothing barring the Diadem that you listed is dangerous that we've seen barring the sword because, y'know, sword. We don't know what's in the RoHT so we're can't definitively say there's anything more than the horcrux that's a dangerous magical artefact. Also, the Map isn't dangerous.

I'm pretty sure Hermione would have mentioned it or it would have been overheard. Seriously, I don't buy that literally no one heard, particularly any Gryffindors, and didn't go to a professor thinking that Potter's cracked.

The Castle as a whole is Unplottable; the Room isn't any "more" Unplottable than the rest of it. The reason it wasn't on the Marauder's Map isn't that it's Unplottable (the Marauders already got around /that/ to make the Map at all), it's that they simply hadn't found it.

And wards aren't canon, so whatever you're thinking of when you say that, you've got your canon and fanon mixed up. The Room isn't any more protected than the rest of Hogwarts; indeed, Umbridge eventually gets in by bashing in the wall, which doesn't strike me as an example of terribly efficient protective enchantments.

The Map isn't 'dangerous' in the sense of being cursed, but it's definitely an extremely powerful and useful magical relic, in the same sense that the Cloak of Invisibility is (speaking of which, that's another ancient relic already hanging round Hogwarts long before '91, though admittedly Dumbledore is still the one who brought it there).

Whether she made it explicit on Pottermore or Twitter (I don't recall), there is certainly not a shred of evidence in canon for Dumbledore having known about the Peter/Sirius switch. That's the whole point of the switch whenever it's restated by Sirius: only Sirius, Peter and the Potters knew. Even Remus didn't.

Besides which, I don't think we have canonical confirmation that Dumbledore was even the one who cast the Fidelius in the first place. It could be the Potters did. Or perhaps the Secret-Keeper is the one who casts the Charm, and Peter was the one who did it. We just don't know.

********* I am followiing this argument with great interest. Please continue, because so far I gatta say Hellstrike makes some very solid arguments. Also thought i'll throw my own hat in the ring, Philosophers Stone, and the Sirius Black matter were all handled quite poorly, and terribly by Dumbledore. In regards to the Philosophers Stone, I don't care what "rational arguments" he had, he had no right to put the safety, and welfare of hundreds of kids on the line while protecting the stone. There are ways to hide such a thing without doing that crap.

Also as Hellstrike pointed out, he is the Chief Warlock. While I can't see him just freeing Sirius, it should be well within his power to at least make sure the law is followed by putting him on trial. That he didn't brings serious questions into why. Was he just incompetent, was he doing it to keep some form of control over Harry, to allow him to die. After Deathly Hallows the whole keeping Harry under his thumb becomes a strong argument when you realise that he was setting Harry up to die.

I actually think the whole greater good Dumbledore trope to be exaggeratedby many, but I don't think it's too far off. He will always choose the needs of the many for knowledge, or over the few. Examples such as the Philosophers Stone, and Deathly Hallows being great examples. While it does save more lives in the end, it's not the good thing to do, the right thing to do in the end. Prove me wrong.

/Did/ he really endanger the kids all that much? I can't really imagine any scenario where the welfare of the Hogwarts student body as a whole would have been threatened by the scheme. It is made clear later on that Voldemort doesn't like to senselessly murder wizards, especially young ones who may yet grow up to save him. And that's assuming Dumbledore even expected /Lord Voldemort himself/; a saner belief is that he simply expected Voldemort to send a minion like Quirrell as the Defence Professor, one whom it would be well within Dumbledore and Snape's power to best once he revealed himself.

And certainly, the aim of the Third Floor Corridor wasn't to /protect/ the Stone per se. It was to use the Stone as /bait/, if not to capture Voldemort, then to capture a minion who might lead Dumbledore to Voldemort. It's quite a well-designed trap too.

#+begin_quote

We don't really know what powers come with being Chief Warlock. I've seen interpretations where it's purely a honorific title with no actual power, a sort of glorified secretary who opens, moderates and closes Wizengamot debates but isn't even allowed to vote in them.

Even assuming he did have the required powers to get Sirius a trial in '81, though --- why /would/ he? He has every reason to think Sirius is guilty, and furthermore, if there's one cause that demands he use his political clout, it's rather to ensure that /other/ accused Death Eaters (like Malfoy, the Lestranges, etc.) /do/ get sent to Azkaban ASAP, due process or not, before they can bribe their judges and slip away. It would politically-damnable inconsistency on his part to say that on the one hand, then turn around and raise hell if due process isn't respected for /Sirius/.

Further: it's a bit of a wilder interpretation, but I've seen one fanfic point out that if Sirius had truly been a Death Eater all along, one could assume that his being disowned from the Black family was just a façade. He would therefore have access to the Black fortune, and bribe his way out of Azkaban as easily as Malfoy if it came to a proper trial. It would have been almost guaranteed he'd be freed. And a free Death-Eater-Sirius would have wasted no time claiming his right to become Baby Harry's legal guardian, then proceeding to chuck the Boy Who Lived down a well.

  Examples such as the Philosophers Stone, and Deathly Hallows being great examples. While it does save more lives in the end, it's not the good thing to do, the right thing to do in the end. Prove me wrong.
#+end_quote

That depends on your moral system, is all. If you subscribe to most variations of utilitarianism, for example, then /by definition/, whatever he expected to save more lives in the long run /was/ the right thing to do.

*********** In a world of magic with Voldemort being so feared that they don't even refer to him by name kind of disagrees with the whole "did he /really/ place the kids in danger." Unless he's so arrogant that he believes a fight breaking out between them will have no danger to the /kids/, or he's just plain stupid enough to think that Voldemort(again most feared wizard of his time with a known hatred for Muggleborns) wouldn't try anything, especially with Harry there(jinxed broom anyone). So yes the kids were in danger,even if it was a minion. Also with Sirius, why didn't he try something in POA. Lastly when you look too much at the greater whole, you miss the smaller details.

In the end you have not refuted any of my arguments, nor offered any argument on /why/ the kids would be safe. Again he's either incompetent, or a manipulator. Also let's not forget that those "genius" traps were beaten by 11 year olds. Talented 11 year olds in their fields, but 11 year olds none-the-less. So I ask again for you to prove me wrong, not spout theories, or what-ifs.

A full-scale fight couldn't possibly break out between Dumbledore and Voldemort at this point. We're dealing with pre-/GoF/, "phantom" Voldemort here. And before you suggest that Voldemort /might/ for all Dumbledore knew have gotten a body back without his knowledge, then that would make getting the Stone moot in the first place, so it all works out.

#+end_quote

Actually, it's Voldemort who would be pretty stupid to try anything /before/ he's gotten the Stone, as that would run the risk of exposing him and ruining his best shot at the Stone. And getting the Stone is /far/ more important to him in the short run than picking off a couple of Muggle-borns. As for Harry, the only target whom Voldemort or some agent of his might realistically care enough about to try and kill him, Dumbledore was counting on the blood-protection.

Besides which, something like the Broom Incident is nothing that couldn't have happened with any other evil Defence Professor, regardless of whether the Stone was there or not. With the Curse in place, it's a known and unavoidable risk that the Defence Professor might secretly be a maniac, and there isn't really any way of getting around it.

#+begin_quote
  Also with Sirius, why didn't he try something in POA.
#+end_quote

He did. He gave the Trio the idea for a plan that /did indeed/ get Sirius out safely. As I said to Hellstrike, you do ¨not* get to cite /gambits that worked according to plan/ as evidence that Dumbledore is incompetent.

/That's the entire point of the Third Floor Corridor traps./ The first challenges are laughably easy for someone like Quirrell, let alone Voldemort. Puzzles, not protections. Then blam, last trial is the Mirror of Erised, from which Voldemort could not in a million years get the Stone. Cue Quirrellmort puzzling over the Mirror, wondering what obvious answer he's missing, and letting the effect of the walking-through-flames potion wear off in the process. By the time he realizes he's trapped, Dumbledore can swoop in and take him into custody.

Really, Harry & Co. blundering into the Corridor thinking they might be helpful was a /horribly bad decision/ on their part. Due to Harry's interference Quirrell and Voldemort came much closer to getting the Stone than they would have in any other event. And even then, Dumbledore thought he had planned for that contingency too, having earlier made sure that Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised; thus was Dumbledore safe (though mistakenly) in the knowledge that even noble Harry would see his family in the Mirror, and not the Stone, if push came to shove.

#+end_quote

Well, I haven't been arguing against the possibility that he might be a rather more dauntingly ruthless manipulator than he makes himself out to be. I have only been arguing that he is not incompetent. Whether he's a /good/ man is an entirely other question.

************* That's what I was trying to say, he's a manipulator with a pretty gray moral code. He's willing to put kids in danger just for a chance at a scrap of information. Hire a defence professor who half the female student body has a crush on. The same mn who is pretty damn good at memory charms, and is willing to use them for selfish purposes(if he isn't a rapist at the least, i'd be very shocked) just so he could get rid of the man in some way.

The whole Sirius case from POA onwards stinks, i'm almost certain that even without his Chief Warlock title, he's still influential enough that he could have gotten Sirius a trial. I mean this is the guy who trained under Flamel, got rid of Grindewald, and has been making impressions on young minds since he was a young mind himself. That guy could definetly get a trial for a supposedly guilty man just by asking. Without a doubt he is a manipulator of the highest order. Again just look at Deathly Hallows, or Philisophers Stone just to get hints of such things.

Eh, no, I don't much like that interpretation of Lockhart. He seems to me much too foppish for that kind of thing; it'd wound his ego to have to use underhanded trickery to bed a witch he liked.

/Maybe/, but would Sirius have /won/ the trial, considering the state of the Ministry's corruption throughout /PoA/, /GoF/ and /OotP/?

*************** He would have probably won the trial. There are multiple ways to find out the truth with magic, and while Pensive memories can be faked, Veritaserum is 100% foolproof according to canon. Don't forget things like oaths, and magical contracts. So i'd say that he would have a very strong chance of going free, after-all until Voldemort returned most of the spies would try to stay under the radar, and unlike Fanon, there aren't so many Death Eater, or Death Eater sympathisers actually in positions of power, or importance. Also while Lockheart is foppish, it wouldn't wound his ego just like him stealing those stories don't.

Edit: never-mind about Veritaserum, I myself got fanon mixed woth canon. I will still say though that pensive memories backed by Veritaserum, and oaths would still hold a strong argument. Not to mention that they can take the memories of that night under the Willow from Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Sirius himself. While pensive memories could be faked, them coming from so many different sources, and three of those sources being from children, i'd say with almost 100% certainty that Sirius would go free.
