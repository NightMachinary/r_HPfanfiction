So basically:

When Malfoy dies it resets

Its groundhog day like

Harry develops feeling for Malfoy

I forgot how its called.

Please Help me. Thank you. Have a nice day.

PS: Problably on Ao3 or FFN (like most fics)

and it probably had more thank 100k fics.

At the very least more than 85k


** I read something like that I think it was "Harry Potter and the Resurrection Veil", it wasn't complete when I read it though

Edit: it was on AO3, I just searched it and he didn't die, it was when Harry used sectumsempra in 6th year

** Hmmm I've read a few Groundhog Day fics where Malfoy is the one who keeps living the same day, like in Tea and No Sympathy, but I can't think of any where Harry is the one stuck in the loop. linkao3(2734082)

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
