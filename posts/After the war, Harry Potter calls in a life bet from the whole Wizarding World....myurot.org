Getting sick of lack of progress on creature rights and muggleborn equality, he curses wizardring world to be 'good'


** While i don't know any where he forces positive change. I remember one where he was about to be thrown through the veil and calls in the debt, to strip everyone of their magic that had betrayed him. He then gets thrown through the veil before he can see just how much chaos he created.

** I think I recall one where Harry was at a Wizengamot meeting and he announced that he was calling in the life debt from Malfoy being "released from the Imperius" when the Killing curse rebounded.

Everyone freaked out when they realized that Harry essentially had single-use ironclad blackmail material on every single death eater who'd used the imperius defense.

*** AAAAAAH I'm so glad you linked this! I loved watching Harry's bullshit tolerance run out so hard. Also I kinda of wanted to slap the shit out of Hermione for parts of this She doesn't just not understand, she /refuses/ to understand Harry's point and it's infuriating. Also I like Ginny, but whaaaaat a bitch.

Edit: Drunken gremlin, autocorrect, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.
