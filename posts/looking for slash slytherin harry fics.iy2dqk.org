but not drarry. snarry is preferable but tomarry is okay too, anything but drarry really. also, not dark? like, a little bit is fine, but not 11 years old harry plotting murder, and no snape bashing.

now that I wrote it, it seems too picky, but surely there'll be a fic or two?


** 1)The Intruder. A nasty business for Auror Harry Potter. A remedy against boredom for Tom Riddle. When two opposing forces collide, something new is created. HP/TR Oneshot [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10911494/1/The-Intruder]]

2) The All Seeing Eye Glass by seacaptain A time travel story were Harry goes back in time and doesn't even try to hide it but everyone just thinks that he's crazy. The relationship is definitely slowburn but it feels earned. It's funny to see Tom try and fail to make Harry love him. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13377375/chapters/30637173]]

3) you belong to me (i belong to you): Bamf Harry Potter who takes no shit from Tom deals with the Mod aspect amazingly! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11270490/chapters/25203408]]

4) When a Wizard Wishes Upon a Star by RandomBirdEvent this looks like your typical Harry goes back in time to slytherin but I really enjoyed it because Harry actually seems more canon and in character while still having slytherin traits. He is funny sarcastic and lively rather than morose and dark. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23221393/chapters/55595515]]

All of these are slytherin Tomarry fics and not too dark
