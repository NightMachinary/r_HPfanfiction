Looking for fics that are Harry-centered and have epic combat sequences that involve creative use of magic or just awesome/new spells. Like "The One He Feared". It can be any straight pairing.


** linkffn(The Skitterleap by Enembee) is about 60% battle sequences. It's /extremely/ AU, and the ending isn't so much an ending as a stopping point, but it's really quite a wild ride.

Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

** Sitra Ahra has some pretty good battle sequences. Unfortunately it hasn't been updated in a couple of years, but there are still 300k words of pretty good writing for you to sink your teeth into.
