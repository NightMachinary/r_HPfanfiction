** If that location was part of a network of caves where they were born, then yes, it makes sense for oldest vaults to be at the lowest point. But if they opened a bank there, the oldest vaults would likely be near the surface unless they dug deep to create their high security vaults first then built up.

Goblin psychology degree required.

** For security reasons it makes some sense. What we lack is an understanding of what the tunnel network looks like. I think in the Philosopher's stone Harry described it as going on for miles underneath London. Being an eleven year old we don't really know if this is factual or exaggeration. Where I'm going with this is if you originally dug straight down then the best (rich families long ago) vaults were the deepest at the time Gringotts opened. Then over time you fan out sideways. The oldest vaults may be deeper but the newer vaults might be further from the Gringott's building. We also don't know if they are using any form of magical expansion.

** The only indication we have that important vaults are very deep below the surface is one line:

#+begin_quote
  They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking...

  Deathy Hallows; Chapter "Gringotts"

The problem with your reasoning, at least the one I immediately saw is: What if they just kept relocating the vaults deeper the further down they dug? I mean, even for muggles that's not an entirely unreasonable idea - relocating the truly valuable accounts into safer, newer vaults. For magical beings it should be even less of a problem.

I mean, I think Lord Potter fics are pretty stupid, some more so than others. But the claim that since the nature of how caves are built, the oldest vaults (in terms of ownership) must be at the very first levels, is easily debunked by the fact that gold, once placed somewhere, is in no way an immovable object.

** Personally, my thoughts are that Goblins were probably subterranean dwelling, so they dug their way up to the surface, therefore the oldest would be at the bottom. Or at least that's how I make sense of this idea.

**** What if Goblins already lived there before it was a bank? What if the caves had existed before they were vaults?

It doesn't require a lot of imagination to explain it away. It requires a complete lack of it to not be open to counter-explanations.

Why so hostile? When did I say I wasn't open to counter-explanations? I read and write fanfiction. If I wasn't open to counter-explanations then I would most definitely /not/ be doing that. I thought the quote was funny, so I posted about it here. From what I've seen of you around here, you seem to have a sense of humour and know whether or not something is a joke or not. Why are you going on attack here? Bad day?

****** No, not a bad day. Your line just read as if you were mocking him. Therefore the hostility. Text-only communication can be unclear sometimes.

But since it wasn't your intention to mock, I apologize.

  “I have visited the Lestranges' vault only once,” Griphook told them, “on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . .”
