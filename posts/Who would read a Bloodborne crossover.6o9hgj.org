** I think the only thing to do is to try and bulletpoint the beginnings of a story. I've played a more than a few hours of bloodborne but I can't say I understand the story behind it. The dialogue is sparse and the characters are all pretty mysterious. Just off the top of my head the way I'd approach it would be to have Harry ( and maybe a few friends ) wake up in a Yharnum but with a few locations and characters from the HP universe popping up along the way.

*** There's not so much story as there is lore. And everything about the lore is both integrated into every single part of the game, and as hard to figure out as possible. There is one area in the game where you learn a tidbit of lore from the music. Basically no item location or enemy drop is not deliberate. Virtually every NPC or note on the ground line can have more than one interpretation.

All of this means that the average person will not understand anything about the lore/story on their own lmao, you will almost assuredly need to seek outside sources to learn it. I recommend the short "Paleblood Hunt" by Redgrave, Vaati's videos on YouTube, and epicnamebro's walkthrough on YouTube.

**** Harry and Sirius is always a good combination. It could be interesting to have them wondering if they're really in Yharnum or if there in a dream controlled by Voldermort similar to Harry's dreams in Ootp. Possible pitfalls would be whether you'd have OC's as the villagers / other hunters. OC's are much harder to write and give depth to but simply throwing in other HP characters has its own challenges.

** How would that even work if the Potterverse is supposed to have our own history and culture? The thing about the Soulsborne series is that it's more than likely of one continuity, DarkSouls 1-3 being the age of fire, Bloodborne being the age of Dark. What would that make the Potterverse then, the age of Magic? There's also the fact that in Bloodborne, Magic itself is scarce, only appearing in Weapons with no catalysts, so either conventional Magic is gone do to Hunters taking out all the Sorcerers or the Wizards were already in hiding/are separate from Sorcerers.
