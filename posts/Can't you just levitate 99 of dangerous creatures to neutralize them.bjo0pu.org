If you're being attacked by a werewolf, just float it up into the air. It can't fly, it can't propel itself while floating. It's basically powerless. The same should work with most other creatures, aside from flying ones or hugely heavy ones, right?

Maybe Wingardium Leviosa can't levitate creatures, but what about the spell Sirius used to move Snape at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban? Does it break if resisted? What about the spell James used on Snape (again) to lift him upside down? Would that work against a werewolf or acromantula?

*** I made this while reading the events at the end of PoA, where Lupin was attacking everyone. You wouldn't want to AK him, but just sticking him in the air where he can't hurt anyone would work super well

**** Because literary characters don't do the hacky cheat exploits of their universe like we can come up with on the Internet. Seriously, it's why zombie movie protagonists NEVER do the rolled up magazines arm trick, or luring zombies into spikes or whatever. It'd make the story way too easy.

***** You should read Rot and Ruin. It's a post apocalyptic zombie book thing where they do things smart. People wear carpet to protect themselves from bites, bedrooms are locked from both sides so people can that die in their sleep can't escape and infect other people, because new zombies are smarter. Everyone carries slivers to sever the brainstem if they get a zombie stuck. They do zombie apocalypse smart, it's great.

  Have you tried this before and tried to go about for a day? It can get annoying really quick.

  Have you tried doing some light sparring with this on? It tears off pretty easily unless you have a huge mass of tape that makes you pretty much immobile.

  Did you know that the sheering strength and tensile strength of most forms of denim fabrics used in work clothes are stronger than the scientific maximum bite strength of a human? Adding in socks, boots, gaiters, inner shorts, and kneepads and you basically have something that is more if not absurdly more effective protection that is purposely immune to rain, mud, cold, heat, and are more flexible.

  Also, what if you have to run through a stream? Screw that, what if it's raining?

I think you're forgetting the biggest thing: that as far as disasters go, zombies - unless supernatural - aren't very threatening, dangerous, or even halfway feasible as a Doomsday event

******* exactly my point!

I mean, I could theoretically imagine some sort of virus or parasite that infects the brain and causes spooky behavior, and with some suspension of disbelief that this can spread at any noticable scale

But after that, yeah, it's retarded

They are if the cause is something disease-like with high infection chance and a long incubation period. Most of the world will be infected before anything starts to happen, and most countermeasures will be ineffective because people are already infected, they're just not showing any symptoms yet.

Say what, now?

If you meant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millwall_brick][this,]] then the blunt damage wouldn't work against a zombie. Just not enough penetrating force to damage their brain.

****** I'm relatively sure he means wrapping your limbs in rolled-up magazines, then shoving that part toward the zombie so they bite that instead of exposed skin. I've never heard of it before, but I guess it could work.

******* Unless they were fully covered, things like nail scratches, drool, vomit, etc would still be a big enough fatal hazard. And even a full set of protective gear could get pulled away to expose skin or overwhelmed by large numbers of zombies and brute force, etc.

Thanks for the clarification though.

** I haven't done it in a Harry Potter fic, but this is one of my go-to strategies when I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons. It doesn't work all the time, but when you're able to simply levitate the big, strong mook, it's a great feeling. Completely takes them out of the fight.

Now that I'm thinking about it, while not exactly levitating the monsters, something similar is done in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][/Seventh Horcrux/]] by Emerald Ashes. Instead of fighting the troll (and other monsters), Harrymort just vanishes them. It's rather effective.
