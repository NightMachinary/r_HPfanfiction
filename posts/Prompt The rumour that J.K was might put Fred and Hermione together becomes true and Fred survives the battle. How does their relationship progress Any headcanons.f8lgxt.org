*** I know that rumour too. And I could see it happening. I mean the twins are smart and inventive. Something Hermione would appreciate I guess. And there have been a few scenes in the books where Hermione and Fred interact a bit more

***** It's less the interactions, and the way in which they interact, really. Like I love Ron, but I never really saw him as a good match for Hermione - and so it's hard to really imagine them sticking together. That's not an indictment on either of them.

You're right that just having her end up with Fred with no other changes to their interactions would seem odd - but I would hope there'd be a bit more to it than that were that the final pairing, particularly with establishing Fred as his own character (instead of just one half of the Twins)

** If you want to pull this off even somewhat convincingly, you need to depict the impact the war had on them. Maybe mutual dissatisfaction with the way the Ministry handled the aftermath and a common vigilantism to bond.
