Hey, everyone! I was wondering if one of you could help me out with finding a story, well stories. Years ago, maybe eight, I read one of those "reading the books" fics and cannot find it anywhere! The author completed books 1-5 and was working on book 6 but then Fanfiction deleted most of those kinds of stories. It involved adult Harry (his son Albus), Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Neville, Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus etc. but it also involved the child versions of themselves (Harry, Ron, Ginny etc.) but I for the life of me cannot remember the author and I'm having difficulty navigating Fictionhunt. Thank you all for any help! Happy holidays to all of you!
