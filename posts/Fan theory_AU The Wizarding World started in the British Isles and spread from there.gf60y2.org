Canonically, there are [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizarding_school][only 8 magic schools in the world]]: Hogwarts for England, Scotland, Wales and, presumably, Ireland; Durmstrang and Beauxbatons for continental Europe; Koldovstoretz for Russia; Uagadou for Africa; Mahoutokoro for Asia; Ilvermony for North America; and Castelobruxo for South America. In other words - 4 for Europe (3.5 since the one in Russia seems to be a later addition) and then it goes to being 1 per continent, and even then it's stated that Hogwarts, the one servicing the smallest population (presumably), is the best of them. Having Wizarding culture originate from Great Britain would explain how Anglocentric it is and the distribution of the schools.

You can take this even further and assert that the Wizarding World is one of many magical "worlds", with a varying distribution along the globe and their own spheres of influence; each with a distinct set of methods, traditions and governing institutions. Doing this lends itself to crossover fiction and may be used to solve the "population issue" people run into.


** While I'm 99 percent sure that I will never actually write the fic, I've had the line "while Roman muggles conquered the Britain, Brythonic magic conquered Rome" in my head for a while. I've always liked the idea that wanded magic originated among the native Britons and spread from there.

*** That sounds very familiar! Is it a paraphrase of something something Christianity? If not, where is it from? I'm pretty sure I've encountered it somewhere before but the inability to recall exactly where is going to drive me batty.

** Rowling herself claims that while there are 8 schools of international acclaim several other schools exist. Found in the history section of Uagadou

Pottermore not even once.

** That is my headcanon. I always found it weird that the Wizarding World is so British or European. When wizards and witches have so many easy and fast ways to travel (even if portkeys etc have been invented only recently, just a broom already makes traveling so much easier). There would have to be a larger amount of cultural exchange over the years.

Why would Chinese warlocks use pseudo Latin for spells? If they invented their own spells they would use a language closer to their own culture. And with the many ways to quickly travel, at least some of those inventions would have made it to Britain over the centuries.

*** European influence makes sense if you assume that:

a) Wands are really useful and wandless magic is ridiculously difficult with worse results in comparison

b) Wands were invented in Europe, probably ancient Rome or Greece

These assumptions give a in-universe explanation for why the Roman empire was able to conquer most of Europe: Druids without wands are simply no match for battle-mages with wands.

There's also a simple explanation for why the Roman empire collapsed a few centuries later: Eventually the barbarian druids were able to reverse engineer their own wands which enabled them to fight back.

Dark ages in the magical world was a time when most magicals were peasants who only knew a few spells and only a few had good wands and books containing the knowledge of Roman wizards. Until Hogwarts came along and made advanced magic more accessible. Before Hogwarts many magicals weren't capable enough to defend themselves against muggle mobs, which explains Salazars paranoia.

By the Renaissance period muggles had developed better guns which made them dangerous to unprepared wizards again (pulling a trigger takes less time than casting a spell) and the European wizards decided to make magic a secret.

Around the same time European muggles were exploring the world thanks to their advancements in shipbuilding and navigation with little respect for the natives who had no chance against guns, and European wizards had to make sure the muggle explorers don't run into any native wizards so they told the native wizards that they couldn't use magic to defend themselves against the invaders. Most native wizards didn't like that but they had no chance against wands.

In short, the European wizards pretty much did the exact same colonialism thing with the native wizards that the European muggles were doing with the nonmagical natives. All in the name of Secrecy, because it's better for everyone.

** So um not sure how to properly block quote on here, but this quote from your source seems relevant. “There were eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools throughout the world, all of which were registered with the International Confederation of Wizards. Smaller and less well-regulated institutions were rarely registered with the appropriate Ministry and are difficult to keep track of.[1]”

*** I saw that. I may be overly critical, but the way I interpret it is that since they're not registered with their ministries, they can't give their students any kind of official certification. The way around that would be to have people show up for ministry certification independently, but that still leaves questions on how each ministry would enforce the Statute of Secrecy, if they can't even keep track of who's teaching whom.

Sorry, overthinking stuff seems to be a hobby of mine, but that is a good catch on your part. "Official sources" seem to only provide enough information as to assure a thing exists and/or is being handled, without going into details.

Anyway, this is a prompt (though I don't mind the discussion), so the information provided can be taken as a given, for the purpose of building an AU or crossover.
