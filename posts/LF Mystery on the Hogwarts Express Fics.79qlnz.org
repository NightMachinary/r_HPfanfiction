Wondering if there are any fics set mostly or entirely on the Hogwarts Express. The train suddenly stops (but not anything Dementors related) and everyone is essentially trapped there (perhaps survival elements included) for a while. The plot is due to Voldemort and/or his Death Eaters. And maybe a murder is committed on the train. Really don't care who's POV the fic is focusing on.

*** Wow. I thought the idea was already out there. This just came to mind after thinking about the Oriental Express book.

** Disclaimer: have never read it but have read the authors other works and they're fabulous. So not sure if entirely on Hogwarts Express.
