What if Harry had been raised by the Addams family or Munster family? Both families are zany and creepy with a love for all things ghoulish and dark. How different do you think Harry would've turned out? I for one know he would've been more inclined to be sorted into Slytherin.


** There /is/ a story where he's raised by the Addams Family somewhere. It's average. But it exists.

***** The most famous Addams raised one is garbage IMO. It stars an edgy OC named Harry and bashes Ron a lot. The author has an essay on their account where they say how Ron matches the 7 Deadly Sins

****** No idea which one you're talking about, botz.

Personally, I've found all of the Addams-raised fics to be mediocre; edgy, generally gory, and most damning of all not funny. The "Harveste Addams" series is a printer example of this. Some of the Munster ones were decent, but the only one coming to mind is linkffn(Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy Bears and Spot).

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  Sometimes, an average family has secrets. The residents of 1313 Mockingbird Lane have more secrets than most. Perhaps their biggest secret is how family comes first and foremost. Once he turns 11, young Harry Munster is offered a place at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he isn't interested, for four reasons. Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy bears, and Spot.

******* Harveste shows up again in linkffn(The Potter Plot) where s/he proves to be the deadliest Harry around. I think I agree with the "not funny" assessment, but humor /is/ rather subjective.

** I could see him developing an Addams' near immortality and have a super twisted sense of what is normal. Hagrid becomes the best teacher ever as he know how things really work.

Fluffy becomes a beloved pet and visited often. As is the basilisk. Draco's hostility is interpreted as a friendly rivalry and they're best friends. Death eater attacks? Hell, that's just fun and games at family reunions.

** I was raised with the Addams Family TV show. That was quite possibly the most loving family on TV, the Munsters were up there as well.

Raised by the Addams', Harry would politely take-no-shit from anyone, and would question authority at every turn. Politely. And with charm.

So, really, all I am saying is that all the others that I know of are worse. Now, way back when I read it, I thought it was at the very least amusing, but that might have been a decade ago, so I don't know how I'd evaluate it on reread.
