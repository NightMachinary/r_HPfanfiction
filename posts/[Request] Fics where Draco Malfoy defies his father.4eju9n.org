** There's one story where Harry was raised by the Malfoys alongside Draco and the two were best friends. I think they went to Durmstrang but ended up 'running away' to Hogwarts and cutting ties with Lucius and Possibly Narcissa after Lucius wanted to sacrifice Harry [to bring back Riddle?].

** "Draco's Redemption" might qualify, though it's a Draco reliving his time at Hogwarts after dying old and alone and full of regrets.
