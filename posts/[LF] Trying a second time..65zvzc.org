Yesterday I tried finding a fic but nobody could figure out what I meant.

It's a Harry POV, that includes dimension travel. In the alternate dimension things are different, including a Slytherin Hermione who is an advocate for pureblood ideals.

I don't remember much else of the fanfic but it absolutely has those elements I have listed.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** I do believe both of those are time travel fanfics. The first one isn't Harry POV (Though I love it) And the second one is also not Harry POV The fic I am looking for is Harry travelling from Canon Universe, to an Alternate dimension, that has a Slytherin Hermione who is an antagonist at the start (I dont remember the rest though)

Thank you for the suggestions however <3

** I remember the fic but forgot the name. Basically, Harry having ownership of the Elder wand wasn't enough to stop the Killing curse so it hits him and sends him to an alternate dimension. He also takes a potion involving phoenix ash which protects him from Legelimency at the cost of his own ability in the art. I think the fic started with a P.
