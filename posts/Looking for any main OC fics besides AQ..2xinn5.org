I'm looking for any fic that has a OC as the main character besides the AQ series.


** Do you have a genre or era preferences/limitations? Do you mind next gen? OC fics can mean just about anything :)

**** I hope you like ensembles! And hijinks.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]] - next gen, humor; Professor Archibald leads the Muggle Studies class. Hijinks ensue.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] - next gen, humor; some Potters, Weasleys, and OCs run a radio show. Hijinks ensue.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=330655][Background Noise]] - next gen, humor; "It has been predicted by Renowned Mystic and Genuine Seer, James Potter, that him and Jo are going to wind up all happy together." Hijinks ensue.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]] - next gen, adventure; a sweet-tooth inventor and a rich Malfoy collaborate on a magic-electricity converter. Insert title. (my story)

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil]] - historical; in 1691, a Salem minister's daughter discovers she's a witch.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293489][Off-Kilter]] - Oliver/OC; a razor-sharp, manic rom-com... of sorts.

- There's also a trifecta of self-aware, semi-satirical Albus Potter/OCs that I'd rec if you like rom-coms/daily Hogwarts life. Each story subverts the genre differently: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=311081][Welcome to Blunderland]] (feat. a clumsy wallflower), [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]] (feat. a hopeless romantic), and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295950][etc. etc. (and life goes on)]] (feat. an ice queen, also mine). Pick a flavor.

If you find anything you like, I can rec some more fics based off that :)

** Other than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & The Natural 20]] /(Words: ~300,000; regular updates),/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] /(W^{T} -- ~400, 000; regular updates)/ is the only one I can think of that doesn't involve BWL's siblings of some manner and isn't a self-insert.

The Natural 20 is very good---even more so if you're into D&D stuff and RPG mechanics. The Black Princess has its flaws but overall is also a rather interesting story (just get through the first chapters).

I've never played D&D or any other RPG, really. Will I be confused by the plot?

**** I think it should be fine if you don't skim through the explanation sections since canon heroes are often getting confused by the OC's logic too, and he explains it all to them.

** There really isn't anything that's good besides AQ. Since there are so few OC fics anyway, AQ is pretty much the only one that's high quality.

** One that I've been reading is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me]]

It's a Neville/OC set in sixth year and I think it's fantastic

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]] by Marquis Carabas

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

I vaguely remember reading it a while ago and recall it being a nice change.

** I came across a three-book series on Wattpad. It's based around the OC and the third book is during the Deathly Hallows DA revolution. It's honestly a marvellous story.
