Presumably, whoever searched the ruins of Godric's Hollow would have found Harry alive and well (Hagrid, Sirius, possibly Dumbledore, etc), but what if they didn't publicise his survival to prevent him from being targeted by Death Eaters in retaliation?

Who would inherit in the event that all three Potters were believed deceased, anyway? Sirius, Remus and Peter, possibly the Dursleys, and who else...?

(Also, I know that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To The Waters and the Wild]] has everyone believe Harry dead after Hagrid accidentally drops him into a forest, so I guess that's one fic.)


** The dogfather linkao3(31624473) /almost/ fits. Harry is brought to the Dursleys, but they immediately bring him to an orphanage. Sirius escapes earlier than canon and helps raise Harry. It's a lovely little story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily were prepared that night and got Voldemort with a trap. They burnt down their own house, fled to Germany, and raised Harry there. Most in Wizarding Britain thought they had sacrificed themselves to defeat Voldemort, but Dumbledore knew better. Sirius still ended up in Azkaban as the scapegoat, and it took the Potters more than a decade to bribe him out.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkffn(What We're Fighting For by James Spookie) starts like this but it's not really a factor in the story and none of the questions you ask are answered.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
