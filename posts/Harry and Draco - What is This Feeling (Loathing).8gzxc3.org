Has anyone come across a Harry/Draco roommate story based on the song "what is this feeling? (loathing)" from the musical Wicked? I can see the two of them in this song. The oddball and the blonde. Harry as Elpheba, Draco is Glinda. I'm open to slash or just friendship. Give it a listen, see if you agree. If you've seen a story like this, please let me know!!!!!


** I love this song, and often think of Harry/Draco when listening to it. It feeds into fanon of Draco as a very vain and sartorially inclined person, too.
