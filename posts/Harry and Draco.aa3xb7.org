What do you think of Harry and Draco being a thing? Any fics where they are together?


** I just can't read any fic with it.I love slash and Remus/Sirius is my favorite pairing(I even made a sub for it.)I never got it.It's the whole “enemies to lovers” taken WAY to far.

**** The Shoebox Project is basically /the/ fic for this pairing. [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/]] It's sort of tropy because it is the origin of most MWPP tropes.

Stealing Harry [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/987408]] One of the earliest examples of the Remus/Sirius raise Harry genre.The author actually abandoned the Hogwarts part of this fic.I don't know anyone who continued using his own notes or put out their own version using his notes(or changing them a bit.)

** If you're looking for recommendations I have read a lot of Drarry, and can suggest a bunch of fics. It would help to know if you're looking for anything specific though. Just a quick few of the top of my head - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879835][Salt on the Western Wind]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irresistible Poison]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12627042/chapters/28770501][Like Clockwork]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]].

I do not see Draco and Harry as ever getting together in the canon universe, but that's the beauty of fanfiction. I like the idea of exploring the idea of two people with a complicated past learning to overcome that and becoming friends and/or lovers. I love getting to explore Draco's character, the depths of who he is, who he became - something we really only get a glimpse of in canon. Plus, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I like to read about relationships that aren't hetro, so that's a bonus. I also hang out in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/][r/HPSlashFic]], and if you're looking for other recs you're welcome to post there.

**** Agreed. It is a brillant fic, both heartbreaking and heartwarming, and one of the most unique Harry/Draco stories I've read. I almost never read first person POV, but am glad I made the exception for this one.

** It disturbs me. I like sausage and I like tacos, but I never liked Draco/Harry, much less Draco/Snape or Voldemort/Harry- more because they're racist bigots against Harry and his Mother than anything else, and usually don't change.

Are there fics, tons- but none that I think are good enough to recommend honestly- well, "Rise Of The Wizards" Linkffn(6254783) (Read it's prequel first, linkffn(6206646)) and "They Shook Hands" Linkffn(7659033), the latter a series, were good but they didn't decide to start whispering to each other's trouser snakes.

*** I totally agree with not liking the Draco/Snape. I see Snape as Draco's mentor or a father like figure kind of like a godfather, only their relationship is much different to other godfather and godson's relationships due to Voldemort. The Voldemort/Harry thing is just wrong on all levels. Thank you for your suggestions....

**** Tom/Harry makes more sense as crazy as that sounds, particularly when it's not Voldemort- such as the being from the diary before Tom went completely batshit insane - or from the scar- Harry's soul purifying the part soul or the part soul learning and growing from Harry- I've seen it done decently more often than I've seen Harry/Dracos working out- such as Moratorium Linkffn(9486886), a criminal/female Harry and a relatively sane Tom.

Unless the story is vastly AU, I'm not even entertaining the possibility. Anything remotely close to canon after 5th year that results in H/D slash is an abomination.

#+begin_quote
  Any fics where they are together?
#+end_quote

Literally 216k stories in ff.net with Harry/Draco romance.

If you're asking about H/D stories I've enjoyed... there is exactly one. linkffn(Snakes and Lions by Gatewaygirl)

Beyond that Lomonaereen (of The Art of Self-Fashioning fame) has a bunch of mostly AU H/D stories. I've perused some of them. I found all of them at most mediocre, though highly superior to all the garbage H/D fics on ff.net
