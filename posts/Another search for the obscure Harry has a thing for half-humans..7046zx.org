So basically any fic in which Harry finds half-humans (of any sort) attractive. Obviously Veela would be a cop-out here. What I mean is centaurs (centauresses?), lamia, harpies, mer, giants,... anything.

Frankly, I'm unsure if I actually /want/ to read it or if I'm just interested in whats out there. Any of your +recommendations+ findings are welcome.


** Hmm. There was a crackfic floating around where Harry married Ginny and the marriage bond prevented either one from cheating. Then Ginny got fat and Harry found a loophole in the bond where he was only forbidden from cheating with human women. So he gallivated around the world with Neville, banging every female half-breed he could find. There were mermaids, vampires, werewolves, veela, sphinxes and I wanna say a banshee but I can't really be sure.

Anyway I think I read it on Potter's Place 3 like twelve years ago.

** linkffn(Weeb) matches this. Harry grows up watching anime (the Dursleys are not abusive or neglectful like in canon), and this shapes his general attitude towards everything, including seeing mermaids as just "monster girls".

#+begin_quote
  Hermione threw her arms in the air. "Fine! It's all good if there's love, but all you're doing is fetishizing non-humans!"

  Harry adopted an affronted expression. "Fetishizing? I simply don't discriminate between something as superficial as species. Do try to be more open-minded."

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** In linkffn(8541055) Harry has a centauride stalker named Calypso. It's more a case of half-humans having a thing for him. And he has a way with magical creatures as a Listener.

  lamia
#+end_quote

...? Pretty sure lamias don't exist in the Potterverse (though they admittedly wouldn't look too out of place with Sphinxes and Manticores).

Anyway, looking for fanfics involving Sphinxes, I came across what is probably one of the worst fanfics of all times --- a horribly formatted lemon where a Dark!Harry ends up raping the Triwizard Maze's sphinx. I don't even want to do the thing the honor of linking it. But as far as your acamedical interest goes, then know it's out there. Lurking. Begging to be mercy-killed.
