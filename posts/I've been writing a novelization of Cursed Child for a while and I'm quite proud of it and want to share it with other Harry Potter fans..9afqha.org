**** Two of the main things I wanted to change were how the Time-Turner worked and Delphi's plan/identity. For example, Delphi can't use the Time-Turner herself, thus her need for Albus. Additionally, the Time-Turner can't be set exactly, and the destination is a mystery (to the characters at least).

From that, other parts of the story (hopefully) fall into place better, such as the events that spurred Voldemort's AU victory not being dependent on Cedric becoming a Death Eater.

***** With dimensional travels, you can tap the relatively unexplored world of meta fics, fanfictions that cross with other fanfictions.

Some excellent HP fanfictions have developed fairly interesting AU worlds after 1998, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]] (the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]. In each one of this AU, Harry is paired with someone else than Ginny, Ron and Hermione has (or had) been together, and Astoria Greengrass should be still alive by 2022. These facts should hold some appeals for a dimensional traveling Trio Albus, Rose, and Scorpius.

In "Emperor", Riddle was still alive in 2022 and actually in excellent strategic position.

In "Para Bellum", Bellatrix was still alive in 2022 and doing very well.

Authors of all three fics are still active and respond to PMs.

Heck, I'm scared of actually trying to read it because the original was just that terribad and some things that make it so are the very basis of what the story stands on.

** I've taken your post as inspiration to finally read that damn play in its entirety. Never made it past the mecha trolly lady and just couldn't muster the courage to go on, considering that it was supposed to get much worse.

I can certainly appreciate and respect the time and effort you invested into doing something like this.

To be perfectly honest: I have no idea how you intent to salvage this mess of a story. Here's a few of the major problems and I'm curious whether you address them in your novelization:

1. The timetravel is entirely inconsistent with canon. Do you do something about this?

2. The time travel is internally inconsistent. It treats two points in time as two distinct "physical" places ("meanwhile, in the future" ... that's ridiculous). Something might or might not happen in 1981 and Cursed Child shows us people in 2017 who contemplate what might or might not happen in the past (as if it is yet to occur, or occuring at the same time?! like 1981 and 2017 playing out in parallel?!). The past is the past. It already happened. Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione are either dead or alive, not half-and-half. If they're alive there's no point in traveling back anywhere (except to pick up Albus and Scorpius), because clearly Delphi has already failed (and somehow things worked out alright... maybe they should read some history books if for some reason they are suddenly unaffected by a changed timeline that they occupy) and if they're dead they won't have the opportunity to travel to the past, because Voldemort already rules and *they are fucking dead*.

3. Ron is a complete joke. I couldn't imagine wrecking his character even more than canon, but CC manages to top it: "Hermione: We have to be better than them. Ron: Yeah, it's annoying, but it's what we learnt." I don't even. He's just there for comedic relief. Albus acts like a complete imbecile when polyjuiced as Ron in front of Hermione, and she finds that behaviour to be perfectly normal and appropriate for the Ron she knows.

4. How does everyone see the Potter's house? It's under a fidelius. They shouldn't even remember where the Potter's live as soon as they travel back in time. Why are the Potters leaving their house to have a stroll?! That's utterly insane and brain-dead.

5. Everyone is convinced they know what Riddle looked like. They only ever saw him past resurrection (and Harry&Ginny saw him as a teen). Makes no sense.

6. Why is Albus in Slytherin? He shows zero cunning. Okay, neither did Draco, but at least he has the family tradition. Albus is even more Gryffindorish than his dad.

7. The themes are all over the place. Albus wants to distance himself from his family, despises his father for the fame and wants to prove that he can stand on his own: He won't let his life be defined by being a Potter (basically he's Ron 2.0). He also believes that Scorpius couldn't possibly be Voldemort's son, because Voldemort's son would have to be evil, because sons are always exactly like their fathers... or something. In any case, he (and possibly the play) fails to notice the contradiction. If the story had any idea what it was doing Albus would have told Scorpius that it doesn't matter who his father is. Well turns out Albus was both wrong and right (because the themes are so muddled) and he's exactly like dear old dad and he just has to accept that and stop being a stupid rebel... or something. What is the point of his arc besides Harry having to learn to be a better dad? What are you supposed to take away from this story besides a giant shrug ("we are who we are because of who our parents were and there's really no point to try to do anything, because you'll only end up making things worse")? And what makes it even more confusing: We find out that people like Cedric can switch from being good to evil as a matter of circumstance and on a whim. So I guess you aren't really who you are and can become whatever, except if you're a main character? Nah, turns out Scorpius was evil too in the other world.

8. The finale of the story hinges on the fact that our *heroes* stand *heroically* by while a young, innocent, married couple is murdered in cold blood, because it's for the greater good. What a load of tripe and utterly morally bankrupt reasoning. Stinks to high heaven. [*]

9. There should really be a scene (maybe for the Cursed Child sequel novelization) where Harry travels to his younger self in first year to tell the kid not to rescue Hermione from the troll. After all, Harry could have died or been crippled and everyone would be doomed. It's really not worth it to do something as risky as that. [I really didn't expect to find the core of the story so offensive]

It's unlikely that I'll read a novelisation of this stupid story, but I'm curious how you handled these things.

[*] Don't forget that a major point of the story is that "prophecies can be defeated". But why bother and fight/capture/kill Voldemort right then and there? That would be too much work and apparently part of being an adult is becoming complete and utter sad losers, who are happy with "this is as good as it gets".

*** 1) Yes and no. I lampshaded it as being a feature intended by the Death Eaters who developed it and changed a few features, but they still create AUs. I did make some subtle (and some not-so-subtle) hints to time trying to repair itself.

2) Theres some confusion but there's a line by Draco about how they can search for the rest of their lives so the past and the present aren't treated as parallel, but with the villan unapprehended and the boys missing, the danger is still felt.

3) Ron's still the ham-fisted comic relief character unfortunately.

4) The Fedellius Charm actually becomes a plot point. Only Albus (as Harry's descendant) can see it. I changed it to where the Potters are just playing in their front garden.

5) They don't transfigure him into Voldemort at all.

6) I've emphasized Albus's ability to formulate plans (not always good ones) on the fly to illustrate his cunning, but it's a “the hat knows what it's doing” kinda thing. And he's ambitious, he just lacks direction. Albus's characterization is something I put a lot of care into, because he otherwise had no personality other than being a foil to Harry.

7) I've hopefully made it more consistent. Self-discovery and foraging your own path are still major themes, and are represented in different ways. Albus's would expect Voldemort's son to be evil because, at that point, HE still believes he has to live up to Harry's legacy. Harry is still discovering how to be a father, though I've downplayed his complete ineptitude and made him just hapless.

8) I kept it as/is, because otherwise things were wrapped up too neatly and someone (besides a random background character) had to suffer. Also, Voldemort needed to make some sort of appearance after being built up the whole play.

As someone who's reluctant to read, your feedback would sure be helpful.

Yeah that's one of the major malfunctions of that whole thing, I didn't really expect you to change it, because then you'd have to write a whole story about them trying to defeat Voldemort early, going after all the Death Eaters, etc. I just needed to say that the Harry I know would have tried to save Lily, James, the Longbottoms, Sirius, Remus, Nymphadora, Ted, Moody, Dobby, Amelia, Lavender, Cedric and all the other [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_deaths][victims]] and not just shrugged them off.

Again, I abhor the philosophy implied here: "Be happy with what you got. Don't strive for a better world". Where do you draw the line? If Hermione would have died, would it then have be justified to meddle with time - because our protagonists love her? Or is it a certain ratio of muggleborn that have to be murdered before it's too much? Clearly Voldemort's terror regime was too much and needed to be changed back. But it could have been so much worse no? Britain could have been a nuclear wasteland!

Take Cedric's death. It seemed a noble goal to want to bring him back, he didn't deserve to die, but the result was a world where Voldemort won. (I hated the idea of him being a Death Eater, Cedric was one of my favourite characters).

There are a multitude of ways to save him and still winning the war. Albus & Scorpius are stupid teenagers and went about it in a stupid way. They certainly lacked vision, having this time turner could have prevented the entire second war, not just save that one kid.

In any case, sure, you can have theoretical debates in an abstract way about this kind of intervention - asking yourself whether you should use the time turner or not. But it is very different if you are actually present and someone innocent is murdered right next to you. In my ethical framework you are obligated to help in such a scenario and not hem and haw about bullshit temporal mechanics. Not doing anything means human lives are worth less to you than stupid thought experiments: You have no idea whether saving Lily&James will make things better or worse... and telling them where all the Horcruxes are will almost certainly make things better. I lose all respect for everyone involved there, they are just as bad as Dumbledore.

Ironically, I would normally agree with you completely.

And that shouldn't be their decision to make, to decide which world is better, if they do nothing they are leaving the world as it was.

Again, that's a matter of perspective. Do I need to rattle off all the victims again? Peter Pettigrew killed 12 muggles, what if one of them (or one of their children) would have cured cancer? Or solved world hunger? Maybe the world that they are in *right now* is the bad one because everyone will die because of global warming and the Wizard who would have prevented it was a Muggleborn murdered by Voldemort. You don't know at all and this kind of reasoning is utter bullshit. That's why utilitarian ethics are severely flawed, yet very few people realize this: You need to actually know the full consequences to make a valid judgment.

No. They are alive right now. They are in 1981 and they are seeing them right in front of them. Again, perspective. Just because they are another generation from the protagonists they are worth less? "Well, in our outcome/world we are all alive [which is the default and means nothing, because if you were dead you wouldn't be discussing this], so of course that's the best possible world because we all just care about our own hides". I wonder what the 50/60 year old Lily would say if she stood right next to them. Or Harry's potential siblins? His adorable younger sister or his sweet little brother? Just because they don't have a voice doesn't make them worth less.

The kind of subjective bias at display here is just useless: The child of Ron & Parvati from their realty would probably have considered her world to be ideal and would rather not be destroyed/unmade. But hey, gotta bring back Rose, because, reasons I guess.

Now you are arguing complete metaphysics. I have no concept of what "meant to be there" even means in a world where time travel exists and allows people to change things. Clearly they were meant to be there to bring back Albus & Scorpius. Why is that action allowed and other's are "not meant to be"?

You are appealing to some kind of God or Gaia or "Universe as it naturally should be" and I'm not the least convinced that anything like that exists, or if it exists I have no idea whether that Universe intelligence wouldn't want our heroes to change things for the better, because in it's natural course they are meant to do exactly that.

So either (a) I think that the concept of "meant to be there" is nonsense or (b) I can just as easily argue that they are meant to be there and are supposed to intervene, because they are part of the "universal dictate" and not separate from it "messing up its plans" (they are part of the plan). In such a (b) scenario I'd always work under the assumption that what I decide to do is meant to be, unless I have a way to find out if it's not?!

Which again, (to me) is a meaningless concept in a world where time travel exists and is functional (in terms affecting past and future). Or if it isn't a meaningless concept I will come back to (b) again and point out that you have no idea how things are "supposed to turn out" because time travel and our protagonists involvement are part of the natural world/order. Why do you conclude that a world unaffected by time travel is somehow superior to a world affected by time travel? Sounds like a really bad [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature][Appeal to nature]], even though time travel appears to be perfectly natural in their world. Should Wizards stop using Magic because it could affect the course of the world in a way that it isn't supposed (whatever that means) to go?

That's the whole point of applied ethics though. It's rarely about figuring out what you personally want to have happen in your own life. That's ... I don't know, life coaching or something. It's almost always about how your intervention into other people's lives is justified or not. Like... "Should I wack this robber over the head with a bat in order to protect my house and family? He clearly doesn't want to get wacked, but I'm probably morally obliged to do it because of ethics [protecting my family, self-defense, whatever reasoning may be]" "A trolley is going to run over 5 fat strangers or 3 family members and I have to decide which way it is going to roll, what should I do?"

Only as far as they have experienced it. Maybe one day after the end of CC nuclear holocaust occurs, because they didn't have all the information. Maybe in the "Tyrant Voldemort" world humanity binds together, because they see a common enemy, defeat Voldemort and realize a 10.000 year long lasting paradise on earth with Muggles and Wizards coexisting happily.

I don't know any of that shit. The only thing I do know that I have the opportunity to save two people, and everything being equal saving two people is better than not saving them. I have no good reason to assume that the world with Lily and James will be worse than the one without them. In fact I have many good reasons to believe the opposite (the canon outcome isn't bad, but it isn't as grand as everyone makes it out to be just because Harry and friends survived) *and* saving them is also the right thing to do (in terms of virtue). "Oh, I guess, maybe James will become the next Dark Lord if he survives this night. Who knows? Anything could happen. So I better let him die!" How insane is this?

I have no reason to believe that the survival or death of 2 people is any more important to the universe as a whole than taking a leak against a tree. In fact the inverse may be correct. Maybe the real world changing event was Albus deciding whether to fart or not.

"Everything"? To "everything" in their limited human experience. Maybe introducing their future microbes changes the whole fate of the planet. Of course the Potter's fate is significant to the narrative, but there's no reason to belief that the world cares one way or another.

Coming back to my previous argument: What if their world is the 3rd worst outcome for all of them? How do you know that it isn't? Why do you think the canon outcome is above average? Voldemort is pretty pitiful and Dumbledore was an idiot.

I don't know anything and you don't know either. That's my entire point. I know there's a world where Voldemort is defeated. I also know there's a world where Lily and James survive + something else that may or may not be better than the other world.

The argument we're having is that you assume the original world is some kind of ideal and I vehemently disagree, because you have no rational basis for that belief (besides that it is "natural" and how things "are supposed to go" because of our or the protagonists perspective bias).

*I'm* admitting that I have no idea. The only variable that I clearly understand, is that I could save the lives of two people right now. I have no knowledge how good the world I come from is in the grand scheme of things /(though I have a strong suspicion that is way less than ideal)/, or whether things are likely to get better or worse if I intervene /(though I have an even stronger suspicion that saving two of the most promising people in the order and giving them all the knowledge how to defeat Voldemort is going to be a 3 day war)/, none of these are variables I can *control*. The only difference I can grasp with certainty, all other things being equal in their uncertainty to both of us, is that 2 innocent people will either die or survive. The right decision is easy and very obvious. And the other option is morally wrong and reprehensible. Preserving a certain timeline isn't the be-all and end-all of wisdom and of no moral value.

They know one way, they don't know the other. I'm not saying the world is ideal, I'm saying that it's the world they know that at least results in something good (Voldemort's defeat, a largely happy wizarding world). They can't even guarantee they can save Lily and James, I mean Voldemort is not someone you can just deal with.

They are not doing that. Stop with the cherry picking already. Ron is a loser, Harry is a shit dad. He literally told his son that he wish Albus weren't his son. Maybe they all end up miserable and Hermione and Ron kill each other. Seems to me Ron and Parvati were quite happy as well.

#+end_quote

It also results in a lot of bad. Again, cherry picking and perspective bias. Would the child of Parvati & Ron argue so vehemently to preserve that particular world? Of course not. Furthermore the line of argument that their world is somehow special and amazing and worth preserving just because Voldemort has been defeated is invalid. Maybe defeating Voldemort isn't even a big deal and they stumbled by accident on one of the only scenarios where he succeeds?! Again, the unknown is unknown.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You're using a super explicit variant of guarantee here. Yeah, you can't guarantee shit. The police can't guarantee that they will be able to stop a mugger, so better not even try? Our protagonists have a 99.9999% chance to save Lily&James ("yo, you have been betrayed by Peter Pettigrew, Voldemort knows your secret, gtfo") and in my guesstimation a >90% chance to defeat Voldemort within a week of work. Your paranoia comes solely from the fact that you've seen *one* really terrible world, that was created by two stupid teenagers with no plan whatsoever advised by the evil daughter of Voldemort (shocking how things turned out to be worse!). Concluding from this that Time Travel is a bad idea or more dangerous than it would be useful when applied with some kind of plan is just ridiculous.

** I have started on it and I enjoy it so far. It's a good Cursed Child novelization, I read another one and it changed next to nothing except for making Ron a failure of a businessman, this one changes a lot of the more abhorrent aspects of the play.

However, because this follows the structure and style of the play so much it doesn't feel much like a book, more like a script with more words.

A few things: Albus shouldn't really be able to hear what they're saying in the other House tables, there's certainly no indication in the books that this is the case. In a play that's fine, but in a novelization it feels wrong.

#+begin_quote
  Ron turned toward them and sat down Hugo as Rose jumped into his arms and he hoisted her high. Albus noticed several people in the crowd beginning to stare and whisper asHarry Potter and his family met with the Granger-Weasleys.

*** Yeah, it was a difficult balance to strike and I'm not confident it was the right decision. I made the decision early to include all the dialogue as it appears in the script (the back-and-forth in time scene is particularly jarring because of it). For the sorting scene, it didn't make sense to include dialogue that Albus didn't hear, so I made it into a “he overheard them, not that they were being discrete” sort of situation.

Not that it excuses Harry's comment, but that was a pretty emotional scene and Harry was really trying to open up to Albus, except Albus used that opportunity to hurt and embarrass Harry as much as possible, just out of spite. Albus is just a child, but he was so far over the line, the line was a dot to him[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgp33-EVqXk][.]]

*** Not the OP, but...

I just watched his "fix"... it's so bad. An affair between Harry & Hermione as a solution? I'm an avid HHr shipper and think that's retarded (he talks a lot about theme, Hollywood love triangles aren't Harry Potter). The play isn't about them. It's about Harry connecting with his son, not him being a home wrecker. The fact that he thinks this could be some kind of "side drama" to his version is all you need to know that his version would be even worse.

The rest of it is just an entirely different story that has nothing to do with CC (besides the name Delphi appearing). How is that a fix? Now it's a bad mystery instead a bad time travel story. Delphi being Voldemort's daughter and the Augurey is certainly more interesting than her being the "big bad" of the week (generic evil sorceress). Also, in his version the next generation would be constantly overshadowed by Harry, Hermione, Ginny and Ron. At least CC was clear about who the protagonists are (Albus & Severus) and kept them in focus.
