I'm writing my first fic and I have a doubt about character perspectives. do I need to write all the situations? for example, I am sending a teacher to Harry's house, I left him in another room. when he understands what is happening the teacher has already cursed the Dursleys as hell. do I need to write the conversation they had? if I hide it the reader will think I am lazy? Thank you and I am sorry if it's a stupid question


** No, you don't. Ask every time, “is this action/dialogue/whatever necessary for plot/character development”?, and if the answer is negative either just skip it or summarize it with “meanwhile the quarrel with Dudley deteriorated into Snape cursing him into a small toad”.

Every fanfiction longer than one chapter (and often even those) could be in my opinion cut to half (at least). All of them are horribly long, sometimes grotesquely so. To mention just one example (and a good one, if cut substantially, it could be one of very good stories): “Breakfast In New York by Radaslab” linkffn(5141159) is lovely Harmony story, which in my opinion has enough plot for some five, perhaps seven chapters of the same length as it has. In reality, unfortunately, we have thirty one of them. There are whole chapters which are completely useless for the storyline (e.g., whole trip to Hogwarts and ZOO), and whole text is so repetitive (many scenes are described from the POV of the all-knowing external observer, then from POV of one of the actors, and then even sometimes one of the characters present describes the scene to some others) that even author is many times lost in what information were already given, and for example Harry as great surprise explains her he is a Roman-Catholic like her, and there is even a priest who will marry them, although he already told her five chapters ago.

Cut, cut, cut!

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

** I think you can summarize the conversation as a good compromise, for example: “They discussed ...”

** It helps to view the fic like a presentation or a speech. For everything and every scene you put into it, ask yourself, what is the purpose? What do I want to show the audience with that?

And if the answer is, I dunno, cut it out. People even go further, and demand any one scene has to fulfill at least two purposes. I try to adhere to that in my writing, but it doesn't always work out.

Hard-and-fast rules aren't the point anyway, though. The above is what you want to aim for, generally speaking, and then you make judgement calls on an individual basis.

** nope. Sometimes it's far more effective to cut to the result. There will generally have to be some reminiscence of the events, but you can write it in a few sentences rather than a blow by blow. If you are doing stuff from just one perspective and he wasn't in the room, then you won't need to have the details in an imperfect narrative, but there will have to be some sort of ‘what happened?!' As the reader will expect to be informed somehow, and if you are too much of a thing about not telling them, they might assume it's a big key to the plot

** I am less likely to think of an author as lazy than to become frustrated with them because I have to go through endless plot irrelevant conversations. If it serves a purpose, you have to include it, but if not then it's not necessary.
