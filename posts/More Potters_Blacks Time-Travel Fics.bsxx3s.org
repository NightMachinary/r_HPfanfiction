Any recommendations for a good time-travel fic that features a lot of interactions with the adults of the Potter or Black (or other, for that matter) families- ideally with some focus on combat/politics?

*I'm already familiar with Wind Shear, Passageways, and Delenda Est* and they're the kind of thing I'm looking for/what inspired the request. I'm not looking as much for fics where Harry joins the Marauders/grows up as a kid with them.

No need to be Harry/Bellatrix (that just happened to be the theme that all of these shared); also doesn't need to be during this time period (e.g. I think a fic that goes back to the Grindelwald war with the Potters could be interesting).


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6762790][Future's Past]] with female!Harry Potter time-traveling back and being courted by Orion Black. The a/n in the beginning is background to the posted fic, and should be a separate fic in its entirety imo. and female!Harry Potter is named Ianthe, I just rolled with it.

** My favorite of the Lone Traveler spinoffs are linkffn(Lone Traveler: Building a Better Burrow) and linkffn(Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense). I think he interacts with the Black Family in the second one. Lots of Weasley Family in the first one.

For the time of Grindelwald you could try linkao3(Papa Lion, Mama Snake) though that is unfinished sadly.

  In Canon, Septimus Weasley and Cedrella Weasley nee Black were either dead or played no real part in events.What if they had? What if they had made different choices, made different stands? What if they stood between the Light and the Dark and did everything in their power to see the Dark defeated? What would have changed?This is that story. A story of a man and a woman from completely different sides of the fence politically and socially. A man and a woman who joined forces and changed the fate of the Wizarding world in general - and of more than one person in particular.

  The Better Burrow arc from my Lone Traveler compendium: The Lone Traveler encounters the Burrow before it was expanded. Maybe it can be made into a safer and more comfortable home for this version of the Weasleys. It's amazing how much a building can change history.

** A Step to the Right by CatsAreCool on AO3 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14949759/chapters/34641246]]

It throws an alternative dimension on top of the time travel but the world development is really interesting.

*** I have no idea how people make it through TBR's stuff. They all read like they were put through Google Translate a few times, while throwing in (or removing things) at random. Like commas. Have they gotten any better? I tried to read Honour Thy Blood, and that's when I noticed everything. Went to Stepping Back to see if they ever improved, and it was just as bad/worse.

TBR is apparently remastering Honour Thy Blood, so I guess I can find out myself.

Edit: I just read the first chapter of the remaster. It's still just a wall of mistakes he made in his other stories.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
