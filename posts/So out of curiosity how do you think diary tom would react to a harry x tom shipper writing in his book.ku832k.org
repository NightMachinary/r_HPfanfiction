So I'm going to be honest I'm reading a fic and it's getting to 2nd year so my mind came up with the wonderful image of him trying to start his whole soul absorbing thing then haveing a 12 year old writing a tom x harry fic in his book

Here's a one shot w/ Ginny writing in the diary. It manages to capture what an 11 y.o. writes like and is super funny!

*** That's a difficult question to answer part of me can see it being fluff with tom just seething at the fact his terrifying image has become so low that a child is writing about him and his enemy being friendly

While the smut i have the amazing vision of tom sitting in a corner and trying to ignore the cringey smut

** He would be horrified.

Maybe throw a temper tantrum, go into a fit of rage, does something dark and kill the shipper from inside the book? Idk if that will actually work but it's fan fiction right?
