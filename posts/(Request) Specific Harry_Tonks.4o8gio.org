Hey all!

Some time ago I read a fanfic on FFnet, pairing Harry and Tonks together. They also used Simulacrums in their war against evil. It was an M rated fic, I believe, however I can't seem to recall the title.

Anyone who knows this fic, please reply with the name and link :)


** Was it linkffn (Renegade Cause) by Silens Cursor?

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
