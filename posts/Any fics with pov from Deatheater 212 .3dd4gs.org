Doesn't have to be long, but please nothing with him finding out he was wrong all along and switching sides in a crucial moment saving everyone and becoming the hero.

Just a simple pov, good pacing no happy end needed.

*** just an arbitrary number that implies he is of no importance. He isn't the number 1 death eater feared by all the wizards. He isn't the right hand. He is just some death eater following the cause, probably never doing something that will change history.

**** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=228809][Well, here is a selection of oneshots]] about several Death Eaters we know from canon (Doholov, Mulciber, Karkaroff, Avery, Regulus Black, the Lestranges, among others). They have been written by different authors, and some of them are quite good.

** I always imagined the average Death Eater joined because he lost his job to a muggleborn or something and was pissed off, just like the EDL (English Defence League) and their hatred for immigrants.

Small minded bigots who grew up hearing how Purebloods are royalty even if he lived in poverty like the Weasely's.

Would be interested in a fic exploring this for sure! :D

*** Read the stories I linked above. They explore exactly what you describe here - the varying reasons the Death Eaters had for joining Voldemort.

**** kind off, while I appreciate the links and i've not read them all, most of them seem to be way too high ranking. Having personal connection with voldemort, beeing known and feared. I was more looking for the minion who would never get mentioned in a normal book. The pov of a stormtrooper, not some sith or boba fett.
