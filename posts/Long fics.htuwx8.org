Looking for long fics that don't have long boring stretches where nothing happens. Other than that I'm good.


** May I suggest several fics by GreenGecko, three of which form a trilogy (with the first also a pretty satisfying standalone, if you squint) ?

The trilogy:

Resonance [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]]

Revolution [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2569561/1/Revolution]]

Resonance (Mostly finished) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3470741/1/Resolution]]

And also Brighter Morning: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1846319/1/Brighter-Morning]]

She also posted a lengthy, novella-length one shot at The Dark Arts, in Fiction Alley; Reconcilliation

Hope this helps. Resonance and a Reconciliation are still my favorites, a decade and a half after first reading them
