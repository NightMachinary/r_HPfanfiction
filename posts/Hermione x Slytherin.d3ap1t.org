Recently I've been on a Hermione x Slytherin trip. Hermione as a Slytherin, in love with a Slytherin, related to a Slytherin. I love all of those. Sadly, it's difficult to find anything without Hermione x Draco or Hermione x Snape. I hope you guys know of some good fics that fit this. As long as Hermione is the protagonist I really don't care.


** linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or) is a classic. I also enjoyed linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist), which actually is complete. linkffn(Who's Afraid of the Dentists' Daughter?) is really funny, even though it never really got anywhere.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

*** /Mudsnake/... is a fic I really, really want to like. It's well written, and it has one of my favourite premises (Hermione Sorted into Slytherin), but it's also an exemplar of how bashing and bad fanon being spread around ruins otherwise good fic.

As with a lot of bad Hermione-in-Slytherin fic, there's constant Dumbledore-bashing (complete with his still being into "Greater Good"), and Gryffindor-bashing (because there apparently aren't enough bullies and other sources of conflict for a Muggleborn in Slytherin during Voldemort's second rise, so instead there's a gang of Gryffindor bullies out to get the protagonist).

At the start, Hermione's character seems designed to remind Dumbledore of young Tom Riddle: brilliant, powerful (whatever that means), ambitious, and deeply, deeply troubled. What would he do? Would he try to preemptively cripple this prodigy, to prevent another Voldemort? Would he try to instill in her the caution about imposing his will on others---that he himself has had to learn the hard way? Or, perhaps, teach her to fear of her own power, like he fears his own? Would he try to recruit her as an ally---perhaps an eventual successor, since Voldemort would be a common enemy? Or, would that be risking replacing one tyrant with another?

What he actually does is stick lemon drops in his ears and dance around singing La-La-La. Because that's the kind of fic this is.

Meanwhile, Hermione, initially set up as a brilliant, powerful, and ambitious young witch with emotional scars she is trying to hide is quickly reduced to an unrecognizable woobie, who doesn't actually do anything interesting with said brilliance, power, or ambition; and that's probably the saddest cut of all.

**** I didn't notice a whole bunch of Dumbledore-bashing, though it has been awhile since I read the work, so I'll take your word for it that it was there. Yeah, I'm not a big fan of bashing at all. In a partial defense of his inactions though, I will say though that given that the fic ends in December, there wasn't exactly a whole lot of time for him to do stuff, especially given that he runs a school, and (iirc) he only had Snape saying that 'she hadn't the best home life' to go off of. I feel like many people who have suspicions on something would rather not act too early on them for fear that they would be seen as behaving too rashly.

#+end_quote

Oh certainly I would have preferred that angle to have been taken, with Hermione dealing with a bunch of anti-muggleborn discrimination through her own house, though my own personal headcanon says that that Gryffindors also bullied other students because this is a school and people do that. But yeah Draco and Pansy seemed like much nicer versions of themselves compared to canon. It'd have been more interesting if Hermione had directly faced anti-muggleborn prejudice from the outset.

She's 11/12 in the fic. She's at Hogwarts for all of three and a half months. That's not a lot of time to do brilliant stuff especially if she's still learning the ropes.

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies.

** linkffn(13051824) New Blood is a newer one I've enjoyed so far. It's a Hermione in Slytherin one where she's using the term "new blood" to describe herself rather than muggleborn, because she's more ambitious and willing to stretch the truth/rules than she was as a first year in canon. Because she basically made up the term, she's defining it so that she can infiltrate pureblood society and reform it from within.

I am worried it will end up as Hermione/Draco, but so far it's only in 2nd year and can also just be read as a friendship so far.

*** I checked that out once, but it seemed to me more like "new blood" was a real thing, and Hermione's just a new-blood supremacist, rather than her making it up to turn pure-blood bigotry against them. These quotes from chapter one establish it as an actual thing:

"New Blood? the hat queried. ...why, look at that. You are New Blood. But your journey will not be an easy one. "

"Even though she'd been called the term before, it was still a jolt to hear it confirmed. She'd almost wondered if she'd made the whole thing up after all."

**** I've had similar thoughts. Hermione in this fic has Dumbledore-grade talent (or greater) and can often power right through her problems, but all her ambitions are so /small/. I mean, she's destined to create a new "House", whatever it means. Not, say, reshape the system so that "Houses" no longer matter, just join it.

Also, I'm still waiting for her betrayal of Harry to catch up with her: her getting away with things is bordering on Suedom.

The recent turn into Dumbledore-bashing doesn't help either.

  Hermione Granger, with her world in shambles, decides to pay Tom Riddle a visit in the past. After all, he is the root of all evil. It is a mission that drives Hermione on and she will do whatever it takes to see that mission accomplished. Riddle, though, wouldn't be a Dark Lord in the making if he didn't spot something suspicous in the new girl at Hogwart.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
