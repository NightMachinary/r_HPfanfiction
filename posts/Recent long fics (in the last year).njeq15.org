Looking for recently started long fics. Can't have started later than jan 2020.. long fic as in 80k wording. Looking for tropes like Lord Potter, betrothals, mild Weasley bashing and time travel. Have read most of the fics that sound interesting on ff.net, but since you have limited letters to write a summary I might have missed some time travel stories... Looking for either Hermione or Harry centric. Please no Harry slash or Ginny pairing. No Ron/Herjikne pairing, but everything else is fair game.

Thank you!


** The bashing isn't exactly mild, but [[https://keiramarcos.com/category/fandom/harry-potter/][Keira Marcos]] has written some good ones in the last year. the Absence of War is great, the Harry in it is precocious and the sort of Main OC is enjoyable to read

I also really enjoyed All the World. Both of those were posted may 2020

** Also rough trade is about to close, so you'd find some finished long ones there, but it's getting toward the end, so they won't be there long

*** Thanks for the suggestions but I've already read all of Keira Marcos HP stories. And Rough Trade has like 99% which isn't what I'm looking for this time :) but thanks
