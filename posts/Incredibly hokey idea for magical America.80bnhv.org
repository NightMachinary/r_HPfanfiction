That quote about, "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants," is 100% actually true.

- There is a literal magical Tree of Liberty that the American wizarding community keeps alive with periodic blood sacrifice.

- So long as the tree lives, the US Constitution is magically binding.

- Not on the muggles, obviously.

- Ever since the 13th amendment was ratified, the Imperius curse has been impossible to cast on US soil.


** The 13th amendment leaves open the possibility of slavery "as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted".

Imagine if instead of the death sentence you had the option to sign a slave contract binding you to the command of the office of the Chief Warden of the Magical States of America.

****** Like I said, easy words to type. Slavery happens. If slaves commonly revolted to the death then slavery wouldn't happen. So you can say whatever you want but unless you're in front of an executioner telling you to sign something or die you don't really know what you're made of.

******* I mean... yea, I guess. It's just kind of not what america stands for, ya know? But then again, this is /magical/ america, and wizards in general aren't exactly known for their moral fiber.

** Spoiler-y AF, but a major plot point in [[/spoiler][Alexander Quick]] is that the magical USA is secretly maintaining their infrastructure through regular human sacrifice

*** I was thinking of that one too. Just a heads up; It happens several books in and you really can't skip books or things won't make sense. There's a lot of world building in those.

** I like the last bullet point - that magic enforces the values or specific laws of the country. This can be played for laughs (like all French wizards immediately surrender in magical conflict) or seriously, like the idea with the 13th Amendment.

** O dang. That's a pretty cool idea.

What if there was a version of the Constitution for magicals, that was slightly different. Since there are much fewer magicals, their government is still pretty small. The whole 'blood sacrifice' is actually a popular event - every fourth of July, the members of MagiCongress, the Arcane Court, and the magical President (hey, clever names are hard) all give blood for the tree? Or some sort of hyperpatriotic Blood Drive system?
