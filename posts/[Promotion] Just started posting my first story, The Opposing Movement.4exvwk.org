I've always liked fanfics that play out away from Hogwarts, and that's where this idea started. I've already completed and edited part 1 (55000 words) of what is going to be a 3-part series, so expect regular updates.

Please do let me know what you think!

EDIT: after some good advice in this thread, I've decided to delete it for now and tweak it a little before I start posting again. I'll make a new thread once I start uploading again. Thank you to everyone for all the advice!


** Gave it a try. The lack of knowing who the character reading the clipings was, and that made me lose interest. I couldnt figure out why the character cared, and thus why i should care.

Not badly written, from what i could tell. Good luck.

*** Ah, yes, that was shat I feared. It's a type of story that generally and through some hints reveal a lot of backstory, but that does take some time. I know what it's like to lose interest quickly in a story.

Shame you didn't like it, thank you for being kind, though!

***** Well, looking back on it, no.

Thing is, this is actually the third version of the story. The first two started during the summer after CoS and followed Harry while he was at Hogwarts. But I felt like I was just writing exactly the same fanfic as everyone else was. It felt boring, too slow and repetetive.

But that first version did mean that this mysterious character was constantly in the background for four months, being threatening to the reader.

But then I changed the story and decided to have this as a starting point. I really liked the opening scene so I just copied that in. Now I see that I should have changed that. Ah well. I'll have to keep such things in mind for the next stories that I write.

Thank you for the feedback!

****** You only have 1 chapter up. Fix it now. Or don't. It isn't my intention to tell you what to do, I'm just saying you don't have and favs or follows to lose by taking this story down and posting it in a week after you've giving it an edit.

Have you considered a beta? On the sidebar is info our IRC, lots of good people on there always willing to read and critique new fics.

******* I did have a beta (after some rigorous searching), but he/she got injured, so she had to quit. I'm also terribly impatient and just want this fic out in the world so that I can finally start writing new stuff.

I'll have to think about your advice, because it does sound good to have a new beta read it through. Thank you for your comment!

** Promising start. I like the idea; it reminds me a bit of linkffn(Down the Rabbit Hole by Accusatrix). I think you could've done better by including more of the newspaper clippings that would give a better idea of the events of Harry's life and how the world views him. The version you have here feels a bit rushed, and Ginny feels unrelated and tacked on, but may be I'm being influenced by the former fic.

The character reading the clippings seems to be Nicholas Flamel. Flamel training Harry could be good, but I've seen a lot of fics using it as an excuse to turn it into yet another heavy handed 'independent' Harry story.

Both Dumbledore and Snape feel like Dumbledore and Snape, which is very rare and very good to see.

You might want to work on the formatting for the newspaper articles. The spaces missing between some of the paragraphs makes it a bit hard to read.

Pretty good overall. Will follow for future updates.

*** Thank you for your comment!

I did use Down the Rabbit Hole as inspiration, specifically with Rita Skeeter and the newspapers spreading rumours about Harry. It's a crying shame that it never got updated.

Maybe it does feel a bit rushed. I originally had more clippings, but that kind of took the tempo out of this chapter, so I removed it. Maybe a gossipy article from /Teen Witch Weekly/ would have fitted in and made things more clear.

Why Harry and Ginny have become such good friends? Well, ask yourself what those two have in common. There is a reason that Harry and Ginny are both main characters.

I'll just tell you now that the character isn't Nicholas Flamel. He's actually an OC. He'll make himself known in the next chapter and over the course of the story you'll learn more and more about him.

I'll change the newspaper formatting. Thank you for that tip, and thank you so much for the feedback!

** Sadly it seems I didn't get here in time to see if before you pulled it, but I've followed you on FFN so I'll know when it goes back up. Sounds like you've got a good plan of how you want to move forward though, so good luck!
