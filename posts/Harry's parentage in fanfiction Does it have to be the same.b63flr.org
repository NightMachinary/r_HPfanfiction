Especially in the case of crossover fics. Do Lily and James Potter have to be Harry's biological parents?

What about one of them, with the other parent being somebody else? If Lily remains his biological mother, the blood protection still applies via Petunia. If Harry isn't their biological kid, so long as his personality remains more-or-less like his canon counterpart, does it really matter if they don't share any genes? What if a fanfic has James and Lily die later, so that they can be proper parents to Harry, even if it's only for a little while longer?


** This is fanfiction. Nothing has to be anything. If you want Harry to be the offspring of Darth Vader and the Genie from Disney's Aladdin, go for it.

** if the prophecy is to still be valid then yes. "Born to THOSE who thrice defied him" unless you make the new parent also defy him three time then it wouldn't apply to harry anymore.

** A tricky question. Some people subscribe to the idea that the MC has to at least start as the person they were in canon to be considered the same character. I agree in that regard, but I don't think it matters much.

For stories like Harry Potter or Naruto, it doesn't really matter in regard to their parentage. The two never really had contact with their family. Who you are depends on your genetics and your circumstances. I may raise an eyebrow at an identical Harry being born from a different couple, but I wouldn't put the story down unless he wasn't still an orphan. A person who was raised in an abusive home simply can't act identical to someone who was raised in a functional home. That contradiction would be a sign of bad writing to me.

Go ahead and consider if you want to have Harry or a character wearing Harry's face. Both are valid, but it will be a good idea to cement it to start with. The younger you change the involving Harry the greater the effect will be as character is more susceptible to circumstances when you are younger. Harry living with another family at three with be significantly different than Harry living with another family at ten.

*** Eh... No. You think Genetics are the only things that are passed off? Especially in regards to Naruto. Remove Kushina as his mother and you remove all the cool Uzumaki concepts. Remove Minato as his father and you basically remove the one thing that redeems Hiruzen's withhold of information.

Also, Jiraya no matter how noble you might think he is. Wouldn't be as interested in Naruto if he wasn't Minato's son. Basically every important character that was from Konoha knew his heritage except for he himself and those of the younger generations.

Now for Harry Potter this isn't as catastrophically easy to simplify so I won't try. But I'm sure somebody could manage to deconstruct rather properly how his heritage from his parents shaped him. Could you write a "Harry" without that heritage, sure. But it would be a "Harry in name only" fic.

**** I never said genetics are the only things that are passed off nor did I imply it. You are just pretending I did to have a reason to talk about it. You don't have to do so; if you want to talk then don't try strawmanning me so obviously.

** Non-crossover:

Harry Potter is the son of James Potter and Lily Potter (Evans), if author(s) remove even one of the parent he becomes nothing more than an OC.

Crossover:

If he is reborn he should have his memories at the least otherwise OC to me.

Environment, who raise him, how they raise him (if they raise him with love and care he accept their world view more likely) and similar things are the most important (%98) that effects personality.

** If the parents stay a while longer, his personality is inevitably going to be affected. Nurture is a huge part of someone's personality.

Beyond that: give him another mother and the blood wards is going to be affected. Give him another father and his vision will likely not be poor. Changing biological parents in general needs to remain consistent with the Prophecy (they defy the Dark Lord thrice).

The most common parent switcheroo is James->Severus (Severitus), but fics generally only have him defy Voldemort once (turning spy against him). The 2nd most common is James->Sirius, which is far more explainable Prophecy-wise (Sirius is an Order member and probably defied Voldemort plenty of times). Neither of them wear glasses, so Harry's need of them is left unexplained.
