So I was discussion a fanfic plot with my friend and commented how ginny read children adventure books about harry in canon and she refuted me saying that those dont exist. My googling was fruitless. So I turned to reddit.

Am I crazy? I could have sworn that there is mention in the books about Ginny reading books about harry and that's why shes such a huge fangirl in the beginning??


** He was mentioned in books, but no books that are like what you mentioned.

*** Yeah I found that reference in my searching too, but I thought there had been children's books too.... guess it's just fanon?

**** Pretty sure it's fanon, yes. Your typical Indy!Harry will demand half the profits from the publishers and send Dumbledore to Azkaban for permitting it.

*** Considering the government owns the media and the media can seemingly say whatever they like without actual proof and garner no negative repercussions for it either, then it's not much of a stretch to imagine the Wizarding World doesn't have defamation lawsuits or much of a concept of owning one's public image.
