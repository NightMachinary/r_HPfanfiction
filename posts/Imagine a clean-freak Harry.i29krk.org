Like while in the final battle against Voldemort he just screams

Harry-"Now this won't do! I MUST clean this place up! Excuse me for a little before you try to kill me Thomas. Ahem, Wingardium leviosa, Accio Rubble, Depulso."

Or in an hour or so in a battle, hell just say

Harry-" Oh, excuse me, I must tend to my hourly wand cleaning."

Wouldn't it be amusing if he just berates everyone in school because their rooms aren't to his OCD standards.

Harry-"Proffesor Snape! HOW DARE YOU! How dare you keep a room this, this, This UNHYGENIC! Now, chop chop, we need to clean this filthy mess up!"

Snape-"wha-?"

Harry-"NO ARGUING ON THIS PROFESSOR! Now, let's get to cleaning"

Snape-"bu-"

Harry-" I SAID Let's get to cleaning!"


** In his first Hogwarts year, when he doesn't know all the cleaning spells yet, he just walks around with a bag filled to the brim with cleaning utensils and wipes all the tables and chairs in the classrooms first before sitting down.

** After he was brought up by Petunia Dursley, wasn't he? (I heard that pathological obsessive need to clean sometimes happens with the victims of rape; just saying, that it could be good prompt)

**** The only wizard she knew was Severus Snape, who in his Death Eater period wouldn't mind much to abuse a hated just-Muggle, would he? Just a thought.

** Or maybe the opposite? After being forced to keep the Dursley's house clean all his life he develops a pathological hatred of cleaning to the point that he actively sabotage the elf's and Flich or even outright tries making the worst messes possible -clue frequent food-fights.
