A "friend insert" is similar to a "self insert", except that the former has zero knowledge of the setting they're being inserted into. Said friend can co-author the story and is responsible for decisions and dialogue while the author builds the world around them and responds to those decisions. Are there any such fics?


** Really interesting!

** I hate SI, but I think this is a really interesting way to write a story. Kind of like a premade ttrpg, but using HP instead. I dig it.
