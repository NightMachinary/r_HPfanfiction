“Inside a locked door at the department of mysteries there is a room where a powerful force is studied” Dumbledore said passionately “A force so powerful and complex that it even the best Unspeakables in the whole department fall to understand” Harry looked at Dumbledore with confusion in his eyes, the Headmaster smiled softly and calmly answered his unspoken question “Love Harry”.

Harry being fifteen naturally jumped to the most likely conclusion “Wait! So the reason we got inside the department of mysteries so easily was because all the workers were busy having an orgy?!?” Asked Harry disbelieving and slightly interested as if contemplating a new career, /being paid to have frequent orgies sounds like a really sweet deal/ he mused.

Dumbledore promptly choked on his lemon sherbet.

“For now go back to your room Harry, it does no good to lose yourself in dreams and forget to live” Said Dumbledore to a thoughtful 11 years old Harry.

Four days later a furious Madam Pomfrey appeared before him demanding to know why he told a first-year to steal all her supply of pepper-up potion so he could stop sleeping.

“So you see Harry, a Horcrux is a very dark piece of magic that is achieved using an act of merciless murder and I believe that Voldemort May have made many of them. Do you understand where I am going with this?”

“Of course sir! Now everything makes sense!” Exclaimed Harry. /Now I know why he was so insistent that I go back to the Dursley's while unable to use magic! Why he let Snape torment me so much! Why he allowed Umbridge to torture students! It was so I wouldn't feel regret!/ Thought Harry happily, /Now what should be my first Horcrux?/ mused the sixteen years old.

“Ah, Harry Potter, or new celebrity” drawled Snape maliciously.

“Oh! Fantastic, a Fan!” Answered Harry exuberantly to the bewildering of everyone else “I am kind of new to the whole being famous thing but I saw enough movies to kind of know how it goes! So you want me to sign something for you, right? Oh, don't be modest it was written in your face, in fact it gives me an idea, here” said Harry interrupting a furious Snape from replying that /no, he is definitely */not** a fan* before taking a brush and ink and writing his name in big letters all over the professor's face.

That was the beginning of a beautiful friendship, at least by Harry's point of view.

Harry saw the scene before him and couldn't resist the urge of groaning out loud /not again/. Because of course the tournament wasn't enough excitement for a year, no, of course not, Hagrid absolutely had to try getting a new pet dragon, and of course instead of getting another cute baby dragon he just /had/ to get four different breeds of /adult/ dragons /and/ their eggs /in the middle/ of a tournament with */international coverage/*.

/Nothing for it now I suppose/ thought Harry resignedly /best to do sneak them out of Hogwarts without him knowing, this way he can't try to stop me or tell anyone later/.

The morning of the first task was an uproar as the ministry and the organizers tried to figure out just /how/ they managed to lose four /full-grown dragons/ in a /school/. Many were fired in the following blame-war and no one in Hogwarts or Hogsmead (besides Harry) got a good night of sleep for weeks.


** After getting clue for the second task, Harry learns the shrinking charm, and shrinks literally all of his possessions and carries everything on his self.

After someone mentions they could put a person close to Harry at the bottom of the lake, Harry begins to petrify Hogwarts students with connection to him, transfigures them and keeps them on his person too.

Soon students start disappearing one after another. Then, professors start disappearing tool. The ministry had to cancel the tournament, because after a while Dumbledore himself disappears.
