One where Harry basks in his fame, sleeps around, and enjoy's life.

Basically just does whatever he wants now that he's free.

Comedy/Romance/e.t.c

Something to wind down after a dark fic.

** Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5)

Political Drama between Hermione and Neville.

Turns out that not every hero who fought against Voldemort has the same political opinions.

Neville wants to return to the pre-Voldemort status quo and Hermione wants extensive democratic reforms.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  One disastrous breakup was all it took to convince Hermione dating your best friend was a terrible idea. So why is she having such a hard time staying out of her other best friend's bed? Her mind already knows its a mistake. If only she could get her heart on board too. This piece was written for The Harmony Shag-A-Thon, hosted by the Facebook group, Harmony & Co. All canon characters, plots, dialogue, and situations from the Harry Potter series belongs to JK Rowling. I am not profiting from this work.
