For me, languages. I know people like to wank over fanon inventions like Language Lozenges¹, but like, even in worlds where a universal translator is a huge thing, language study still exists, as not everything can be translated exactly, particularly when examining drama and poetry.

Even if one wants to hand wave and say that human languages all have individual potential translations, that doesn't take into account magical languages like Gobbledygook or Mermish - Bartemius Crouch Snr, for example, is said to be a very accomplished polyglot, and it's put across as something impressive... And yet nobody seems to want to learn languages at Hogwarts. I rarely see anybody even mention language acquisition as something that requires tutelage, which for many people it really does - languages aren't easy to study on one's lonesome, without practice.

Alongside foreign language acquisition, there's language skills to be approached in English.

English language courses tend to teach people how to pick apart language for its implicit meanings, whether they be unintended biases or intentional attempts to convince; one learns about the development of language over time, and how it has changed. It would make sense to have priming classes in Latin and Greek in first year, at least, too.

At any point in the series, do we hear of any students presenting a project or delivering a speech to their classmates? Rhetoric is something we've considered important for students to learn since Ancient Greece, and yet at Hogwarts they don't appear to study it all. This could either be a skill learnt with other classes or as part of a literature course, but truly, it's /mad/ to me that no one seems to learn how to give a speech - or, most importantly, how to /listen/ to one, and pick apart the salient details.

Literature is pretty crucial to study, partly because it improves the way individuals talk and express themselves to each other, but also allows people to approach social issues and analyse them from that regard. Classics, especially, could be quite important to wizards, given that so many of their spells have their roots in Latin and Greek words.

Mathematics would make a lot of sense, too, as Arithmancy is unlikely to teach a student how to do their accounts; classes in art and design would probably be very useful for many students; music is implied as being tutored in the background, but whether it's practical only or includes theory, we know not.

More physical classes make sense to me - whether they be in flying, gymnastics, aerobics, swimming, et cetera, et cetera. The wizarding world is not without its exertions, even with magic easing the way.

Are there any classes that feel conspicuously absent in the series, magical or otherwise? Do you think that the Hogwarts education is well-rounded enough, or do you think there are private tutors making money on the side and the like?

I personally tend to write Hogwarts as /previously/ having taught more classes (particularly languages, musical theory and literature), but that after the population dropped after the war, they didn't have enough students nor staff to support teaching the less essential classes. I write Dumbledore, for example, as having OWLs in Philosophy and Musical Theory (alongside all the rest), and Snape as having a NEWT in German.

¹ /"Language Lozenges. You took it like a cough drop, only instead of soothing throats it taught a language, just like you'd been born to speak it. They cost only a handful of galleons (no more than seven apiece), and it took about a week to absorb the knowledge properly, better if you used it during that period."/ (Partially Kissed Hero, Perfect Lionheart, Chapter 1, 4240771.)

The Hogwarts curriculum is seriously lacking. No one could possibly deny that.

In general, Rowling presented a highly dysfunctional school. Only one teacher per subject? A complete lack of concern for student safety? (Hiding the Philosopher's Stone at the school? An inadequate response to the basilisk? Dementors patrolling the school? The Tri-Wizard Tournament debacle? Physical torture as a punishment for students? Letting known Death Eaters stick around? Letting Death Eaters teach classes and torture students?) Seemingly little or no accountability for teachers and administrators, nor anything in the way of standards for hires? (Binns? Snape? Hagrid?) Neither capable of removing a curse on a teaching position nor thinking up a way around it?

If Hogwarts is a [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/hogwarts][celebrated School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] then education across the magical world is pathetic.

That 6 hours per day/5 days per week doesn't take into account prep time, grading, supervising detentions, office hours, faculty meetings, and whatever other miscellaneous duties the Hogwarts faculty have.

It's unbelievable that anyone would want to teach at Hogwarts for an extended period of time. Even if the pay is good and it makes for a nice entry on your CV, you're going to be ridiculously overworked. And that's not even getting into the constant dangers that threaten the school. Really? No one quit over the prospect of having to put up with dementors for a year, even though they all lived through the last war with Voldemort and thus have plenty of bad memories to be dredged up?

#+end_quote

The Hogwarts curriculum isn't lacking. The only thing that is truly lacking is multiple professors to teach subjects, since having one teacher per subject is just absurd. Even if Hogwarts was lacking, it doesn't need muggle science since magic renders muggle science and its laws completely worthless. Wizards don't "need" calculus or algebra, and given that wizards would already know basic math (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) upon entering Hogwarts, any maths that is GCSE or beyond is pretty worthless for wizards.

As for english, most of the Hogwarts subjects we actually see involves writing essays. There is no need for an english/reading class given that it is embedded into most of the other subjects when essays are set. Given the personalities of Snape and McGonagall, they wouldn't let grammatical errors slide. Some classes like Care of Magical Creatures might not care for english since its mostly practical, but I expect stuff like Potions/Transfiguration/Charms to be heavy on reading/writing for theory, and History of Magic is entirely written.

#+begin_quote
  In general, Rowling presented a highly dysfunctional school. Only one teacher per subject?
#+end_quote

To be fair, the only real way Hogwarts was dysfunctional was only having one teacher per subject. The actual education itself is clearly well-rounded and of a decent quality. The only actual problem is when we are expected to suspend disbelief that McGonagall single-handedly teaches 22 classes per week... before even counting the fact that she is also Gryffindor's head of house and also the deputy headmistress of Hogwarts.

What's even more absurd is that Umbridge somehow managed to not just teach 22 classes of DADA each week but also observe 159 classes each week (132 for the remaining six compulsory Hogwarts subjects, then 25 for the five optional ones). Granted I doubt she was watching each class from start to finish, but either way its still ridiculous.

#+begin_quote

The Tri-Wizard Tournament debacle? Physical torture as a punishment for students? Letting known Death Eaters stick around? Letting Death Eaters teach classes and torture students?)
#+end_quote

None of those are a lack of student safety though. Physical torture was not accepted at Hogwarts under Dumbledore, and Umbridge only did it because none of the professors ever knew what she was doing. IIRC, some scientists who worked for the Nazis found work in America post-1945 so Snape being a known Death Eater isn't that bad by comparison. The fact that Snape never killed anyone until HBP would have helped Dumbledore justify letting Snape stick around. The fact Karkaroff never mentioned Snape torturing anyone arguably implies that Snape's only real crime was being a Death Eater itself, but not stuff like murder or torture.

#+begin_quote
  Seemingly little or no accountability for teachers and administrators, nor anything in the way of standards for hires? (Binns? Snape? Hagrid?)
#+end_quote

Binns wasn't actually an unqualified teacher, he was just a mind-numbingly dull one. His forgetfulness of student's names is due to him being a ghost, but a ghost teaching at Hogwarts is the actual problem with Binns rather than his boring lectures. I don't see why Snape is an example of low hiring standards given how knowledgeable of his subject he is. He's clearly a better professor than Slughorn, given Slughorn's indifference to students not in the Slug Club. It doesn't help that Snape is shown to be more talented/knowledgeable than Slughorn when it comes to Potions.

Slughorn showed more favoritism to the Slug Club students than Snape does to any Slytherin student; compare Slughorn's favouritism towards Harry to Snape's treatment of Draco, and its undeniably that Slughorn is much more biased than Snape when comparing how they treat their favoured students. Slughorn's bias in favour of Harry, let alone his far greater bias had once had for Tom Riddle alone, is far more biased and unprofessional than Snape ever treated Draco or other Slytherins.

I'm not even going to defend Hagrid much aside from the fact that his main job at Hogwarts was being the gamekeeper. Dumbledore just hired Hagrid because he was already employed at Hogwarts and was very experienced with magical creatures. The only bad teachers that Hogwarts hired while Dumbledore was headmaster was Lockhart and Umbridge, and even then, Umbridge was forced onto him.

#+begin_quote
  Neither capable of removing a curse on a teaching position nor thinking up a way around it?
#+end_quote

The DADA curse was done by Voldemort, a wizard who is arguably the most talented dark wizard of all time, and is at bare minimum one of the greatest wizards of all time. So I really think you're downplaying just how impressive the DADA curse was supposed to be in-universe.

Its strongly implied in DH that the DADA curse was caused by Ravenclaw's Diadem being in the Room of Requirement as a Horcrux. When the Diadem was destroyed, the DADA curse would have come to an end since the thing keeping the curse active was destroyed. Especially since in HBP, Dumbledore says that the DADA curse started after he refused to give Voldemort the job of DADA professor, while DH states that Voldemort put the Diadem Horcrux in the Room of Requirement the day he applied for the job.

In other words, it was literally impossible for Dumbledore (or anyone else) to remove the curse on the DADA professor position unless they found the Diadem Horcrux and destroyed it at the very minimum. There was no finding a way around that curse without destroying the Diadem Horcrux, let alone knowing its a Horcrux, let alone knowing even finding the Diadem itself.

You miss my point. Regardless of whether Hogwarts is a secure place to hide the Stone, it's wildly irresponsible to use a school for children as a vault to hide a valuable object from a powerful dark wizard.

Edit:

#+end_quote

I was referring to Draco Malfoy as the known Death Eater, not Snape. With Snape you have the excuse that Voldemort was (assumed) dead and the war over, so it's okay to have a reformed ex-Death Eater around. But Draco was allowed to return to Hogwarts even though Voldemort had publicly returned and Dumbledore knew that Draco was a Death Eater. Several people nearly died because Dumbledore let Draco stay at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  As for standards, those three individuals mentioned know their subject really well.
#+end_quote

There's more to being a qualified teacher than knowing one's subject. Hagrid is incompetent at teaching, even if he does know how to take care of magical beasts. He also never got his OWLs, let alone his NEWTs, getting expelled from school before then. Binns can't get students to pay attention in class. Snape is unprofessional in his interactions with certain students. E.g. he treats Neville---whose parents were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange---so badly that his greatest fear is Snape.

#+begin_quote

Why didn't they do ever this? Surely Dumbledore has the connections to get expert curse breakers to take a crack at it.

And even if they failed to remove the curse, we saw from canon that a DADA professor can leave without dying or being seriously injured. (Snape isn't hurt at all from his tenure as DADA professor.) So why not set it up so that the position rotates to a different person each year, sidestepping the curse?

#+end_quote

Remember that Bellatrix tortured Neville's parents when he was around 2 years old, and since I doubt Bellatrix's face was plastered everywhere while Neville was growing up, it wouldn't surprise me if Neville never knew what Bellatrix looked like until he saw her face in the Daily Prophet article in OotP.

Boggarts show a person's biggest fears, yet what fanon always seems to forget is that *Neville was never afraid of Bellatrix, so she would never have been his Boggart even if he knew what she looked like.* He hated her, he despised her and wanted to get his revenge on her for what she did to his parents, but Neville was afraid of Bellatrix for the same reason that Harry wasn't afraid of Voldemort.

Another factor is that Neville is exposed to Snape seven days a week for seven academic years. That is what really matters. Neville is scared of Snape for similar reasons as being scared of his grandmother, but the difference is that Neville's grandmother still loves him and is his family, whereas Snape isn't family and reminds Neville of his own incompetence.

In other words, Snape being Neville's Boggart means far less than you make it out to be. Bellatrix was never someone who Neville feared, therefore Bellatrix wouldn't have been Neville's Boggart. Neville didn't fear Snape for who he is or what he does, but for what Snape represented: an harsh authority figure who was a constant reminder of Neville's own weaknesses, one who Neville spent more time with at Hogwarts than he spent with his grandmother in the Summer.

Snape being Neville's boggart isn't just "Neville fears Snape the most" but is moreso "Snape's authority, consistent reminding of Neville's incompetence, and the high expectations represent everything that Neville fears most in life". The problem is that Augusta held Neville to really high standards, placing major pressure on him to live up to his Auror parents and their legacy. The pressure she placed on Neville reduced Neville's already low confidence even lower. Snape doesn't treat Neville much worse than Neville's own family when it came to how much pressure was put on Neville. So Augusta reduced Neville's confidence and made him feel like nothing he did was ever good enough for her, and then when Neville attended Hogwarts, Snape basically treated him the exact same way Augusta did. Snape reminded Neville of his failures, put major pressure on him, and nothing Neville produced was good enough for Snape.

Snape is also very present in Neville's life. From 1991-1998, Neville saw Snape much more than he saw his own grandmother. Meaning that Snape was more present in Neville's life for that period of time, so Neville would be more afraid of someone who he saw every day for seven academic years than he would of someone he only saw for 2-3 months out of the year. Its the same reason that Harry was more concerned with Umbridge than he was about Voldemort during OotP, since Umbridge was at Hogwarts seeing him every day for an entire year whereas Harry barely ever encountered Voldemort himself. Even though Harry never feared Umbridge or Voldemort, its clear that Umbridge was a more active and consistently present threat in Harry's life given how long Umbridge was at Hogwarts.

*TL;DR: A boggart only turns into a person's biggest fear and Neville never feared Bellatrix therefore she was never going to be Neville's Boggart. Snape wasn't responsible for the way Neville's confidence problems (that's Augusta's fault), but Snape just continued to add salt to Neville's wounds and made it worse for him. Snape told Neville that he's incompetent and lacked talent without giving him advice on how to overcome his lack of confidence or how to improve his magical ability.*

#+end_quote

The exciting thing about this subreddit is getting to see rationalizations of awful things, whether that's people defending magical racists, arguing the merits of slavery, or---as in this case---making light of emotionally abusive behavior towards a child.

So let's look at how Snape treated Neville, up to the boggart scene.

--------------

*Book 1, Chapter 10*

It was the first day of potions class for the first years. They were paired up to brew a potion. Neville made a mistake, doing a step in the process out of order. The effect is the botched potion melted a cauldron and filled the room with "clouds of acid green smoke". Neville, who was drenched by the potion, "moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs". How does Snape respond to Neville being injured by a potions accident? By yelling at him and calling him an "idiot boy!" while "boils started to pop up all over [Neville's] nose". Snape next told another student to take Neville to the hospital wing---no first aid potions/spells at hand?---and then turned his attention to chewing out other students, doing nothing to ensure that Neville's injuries are cured.

*Book 2, Chapter 11*

It was the Dueling Club meeting. Lockhart was looking to volunteer some students for a demonstration and picks Neville as one of them. In response, Snape said "A bad idea, Professor Lockhart. Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox." Snape insulted and humiliated Neville in front of a large crowd of students ("Neville's round, pink face went pinker").

*Book 3, Chapter 7*

Back in the potions classroom for the first lesson of the third year. The narrative informs us that "Neville was in trouble" and that potions "was his worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse". Neville, predictably, messes up his potion. In response, this happens:

#+begin_quote
  His potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned---

  "Orange, Longbottom," said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.

  "Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one cat spleen was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?"

  Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge of tears.

  "Please, sir," said Hermione, "please, I could help Neville put it right---"

  "I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger," said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. "Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly."

  Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.
#+end_quote

Once again, Snape insulted Neville and publically humiliated him. He then threatened physical harm to Neville's pet. (Remember, as we know from the scene in Book 1, misbrewed potions can cause painful physical injury.)

At the end of the lesson, Snape made good on his threat, telling the class "Everyone gather 'round and watch what happens to Longbottom's toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don't doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned."

Later in the chapter, we get to the first DADA lesson. They went to the staffroom to see the boggart and Snape was there. As he left, he stopped at the doorway to say "Possibly no one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear."

We soon get to see Neville's boggart, which as we all know is Snape.

--------------

It should be manifest that Neville's fear of Snape wasn't just due to some abstract fear of failure and not being good enough for the authority figures in his life. Rather, Neville's fear stemmed from the consistent bullying he received from Snape---insults, public shaming, indifference to injury, and threats of harm to a beloved pet---going far beyond merely telling "Neville that he's incompetent and lacked talent without giving him advice on how to overcome his lack of confidence or how to improve his magical ability".

******* I never "made light" of Snape's emotional abuse of Neville, though I suppose it does seem that way. What I actually meant is that Neville's Boggart was never going to be Bellatrix because he wasn't frightened of her just as Harry wasn't frightened of Voldemort. Fear and hatred are different. Comparing Neville's view of Snape to how his views Bellatrix is like comparing Ron's view of spiders to how he views the Malfoy family. Even though Neville feared Snape, that fear is massively dwarfed by his hatred towards Bellatrix. Similarly, Ron's biggest fear may be spiders but he probably hates the Malfoys more than he fears spiders. *I'm not trying to excuse Snape's treatment of Neville. What I'm saying is that Neville hated Bellatrix far more than he feared Snape. While Snape's treatment of Neville was pretty bad, it nowhere even remotely close to what Bellatrix did to Neville's parents, so Bellatrix is a bad example to use for the Boggart point.*

Ultimately, I think Snape's low point as a professor is his indifference towards his failing students. *When I said Neville doesn't fear Snape "for who he is or what he does" since it was terrible wording; I really should have just said Snape was a bad teacher not for what he does but for what he didn't do.* I'm sure Neville found Transfiguration as challenging a subject as Potions, but the difference is that McGonagall encouraged him and never belittled Neville despite his struggle with the subject. But when Neville consistently struggled with Potions, Snape considered him a lost cause rather than trying to help Neville improve. *I'd actually argue that Snape's neglect of Neville was far worse than Snape's treatment of Harry. Snape treatment of Harry is ultimately petty but Snape's treatment of Neville is just terrible.*

If Hogwarts were to have multiple teachers for each subject, then Snape should only teach NEWT Potions and let a different professor teach up to the fifth years. Snape clearly never wanted to be a teacher; Voldemort wanted to apply for the DADA position and later Dumbledore stuck him as the Potions professor. So its no wonder a person who never wanted to be a professor is terrible with children.

Obviously there is no teaching qualifications to be (willingly) hired as a Hogwarts professor other than being good enough at your subject. Snape, Hagrid and Trelawney are very good at their subject despite their flaws as teachers. But I think Snape's treatment of Neville is exactly why the wizarding world should have a basic qualification to teach. To prove that the soon-to-be Hogwarts professor is good with children and help them develop their magical ability. Since unlike real life teachers, you don't need to be good with children to be a Hogwarts professor and that is where the root of the problem lies.

Specifically, Snape was honestly the worst professor that Neville could have possibly had. Neville was a student who lacked confidence, had difficulties with Potions and was overall not that good at magic, but Snape never tried to help Neville with those issues (unlike McGonagall). By contrast Snape was overconfident, was a Potions genius and overall very talented with magic. Because Snape was so good at Potions as a student himself, its clear that Snape was incapable of showing empathy towards students who weren't so good at the subject. If Snape was a good teacher, he would have accepted that some students just aren't as good at Potions as others and that those students like Neville need additional support both academically and emotionally. But he failed to accept those things.

*TL;DR: Snape's treatment of Neville shows that Hogwarts professors should need to be qualified to deal with children first and/or have multiple teachers for each subject so professors like Snape are only stuck with the NEWT students.*

Most of us probably couldn't write a really good essay until our last two years at school (if ever). it seems the teachers in HP leave the students to figure it out through trial and error (and what a perfect chance it was for Snape to continue belittling students he didn't like when they handed him sub-par essays that they were never in fact taught how to write).

***** I never said that Hogwarts students come as first years knowing how to write amazing essays or anything. What I meant is that having a separate subject specifically for essay writing and/or reading is redundant. Each of the subjects themselves would teach essay writing skills, just like how the humanities and social sciences all teach essay writing skills for their appropriate subjects.

There's a reason that writing essays isn't a separate subject in real life schools. Each essay-focused subject teaches the structure of essay writing to some degree or another. For example, in a subject like English Literature, you would be taught in class how to structure an English Literature essay alongside learning the actual content of the course.

For example in Potions, Snape/Slughorn would set them essays and likely tell them a writing structure, in addition to teaching Potions theory and practicals. When looking at real life, subjects like English and History (among others) have paragraph structures like PEEL (point, evidence, explain, link). The same would go for Transfiguration, Charms, and the other subjects. Most notably History of Magic, where writing an essay would be like writing a History essay in real life.

What I'm saying is that by their OWLs, students would know how to write at least basic essays because each subject would have taught them how to write their essays along with teaching them the subject's content. I feel that by their OWLs, the essays should be somewhat comparable to GCSE essays whereas the NEWT students would be handing in essays somewhat comparable to an A-Level essay.

Hogwarts students obviously don't turn up with great essay writing skills, but first-years would be able to read and write to the same extent as the average 11 year-old. The Hogwarts students aren't going to be illiterate and most would be average just like how most of us are average. It goes without saying that each subjects teaches students to write essays throughout their time at Hogwarts for their OWLs, NEWTs, and general assignments; actually stating in-text would be redundant since any subject that requires essay writing will involve the teacher actually teaching students how to write the essays (especially for OWLs and NEWTs). Unless you are suggesting that Hogwarts students never improve their reading or writing ability from when the first enrolled, but since Hogwarts students do improve those things, its being taught in-class even if we don't see Harry doing it (since Rowling knows it would be boring to show stuff like "Professor McGonagall was teaching the class how to write OWL-level Transfiguration essays. She explained the best method is... [blah-blah-blah]"

As for Snape, I don't think he is really an accurate representation of how most Hogwarts professors conduct themselves. Especially since Harry isn't exactly the best at paying attention both in and outside of the classroom, so just because Harry doesn't pay attention doesn't mean it wasn't taught.

Case in point: Snape explained Polyjuice Potion in Harry's second year and also telling the class what book the recipe can be found in. Harry and Ron weren't paying attention to Snape's words but Hermione was, showing that Harry being ignorant to something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. So if Snape did explain how to write essays for their Potions OWL written exam, its likely Harry and Ron wouldn't be paying attention and Hermione would have to remind them.

#+end_quote

He never told McGonagall about it. The only ones who knew what Umbridge was truly doing at the time were Harry, Ron and Hermione. None of them told anyone else. While other students suffered similar torture under Umbridge, its pretty much confirmed that none of them told anyone about what Umbridge did to them either. So none of the Hogwarts professors ever learnt the truth of what Umbridge did to the students. As for the Ministry, Umbridge herself brags that she hid her true colours from Fudge, the implication that she knows Fudge would have immediately have her sent to Azkaban if he knew the truth of what she did throughout OotP.

The only other person to know the truth was Scrimgeour when Harry showed him the scars Umbridge left, but its implied that Scrimgeour didn't take Harry seriously. Even if he took it seriously, Scrimgeour was a pragmatist who believed that maintaining a strong Ministry to fight the Death Eaters was more important than punishing Umbridge. If Voldemort and the Death Eaters weren't around, Scrimgeour would have just had Umbridge arrested himself. But with the threat of Voldemort looming during HBP and DH, he basically ignored Umbridge to focus entirely on taking down the Death Eaters.

Especially since other students aside from Harry were tortured too, albeit probably much less so than Harry's punishment with the Black Quill. Its pretty much confirmed through implications that none of those students told anyone about what Umbridge was doing either; whether they feared Umbridge, doubted that the other Hogwarts professors had the power to do anything about it, or personal pride. If Scrimgeour found out that Harry was tortured by the Black Quill, let alone what Umbridge did by setting the Dementors on Harry at the start of OotP, he would have arrested Umbridge to disassociate himself and the Ministry of Magic from her.

Especially since whether Umbridge used the Black Quill on other students aside from Harry is left ambiguous regarding whether she tortured them with it or just gave them regular detentions, so possibly a dozen or more students could have potentially got tortured by the Black Quill depending on how you want to interpret things.

** Okay, so I've actually given this matter a lot of thought while worldbuilding for one of my fics. I was in the middle of working out schedules for each year when I realized, like you did, that a) there's not enough teachers and b) that there's not enough course offerings. Since in canon Hogwarts seems like the highest institution of learning, it would make sense that post-O.W.L.s students would start to specialize, especially since not everyone would get the prerequisite O or EE to make it into the N.E.W.T class. I not only added post-secondary education (not very common, and reserved for those who want to be professors/researchers/other skilled professions such as curse breakers, etc.) but also added more classes and more teachers to Hogwarts.

The classes I added are for 6th and 7th years, as I figured that students would figure out their interests, then specialize.

- Alchemy, taught by Professor Dumbledore. Requires Outstanding grades in Potions, Transfiguration, and Arithmancy
- Ancient Studies, taught by an OC professor, is a blended class of Ancient Runes (EE minimum) and History of Magic (A minimum)
- Dueling, taught by an OC professor, requires an O in DADA, and an EE in Charms or an O in Transfiguration (or vice versa)
- Ghoul Studies, taught by an OC professer, is a blended DADA and Care of Magical Creatures Class that focuses more on Dark/dangerous creatures, requires an EE in CoMC and an A in DADA
- Languages of the Magical World, taught by an OC professor (no pre-requisites)
- Magical Theory, taught by an OC professor, requires an EE in History of Magic, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, Potions, and Charms
- Muggle Art and Music, taught by an OC professor, requires an A in Muggle Studies
- Muggle Culture, taught by Professor Burbage, focuses on how to blend in in the muggle world, requires an A in Muggle Studies
- Politics and Economics, taught by an OC professor, no prerequisites
- Spell Crafting, taught by an OC professor, requires an O in Charms, Ancient Runes, and Arithmancy, and a EE in DADA
- Xylomancy, taught by Professor Trelawney, a more specialized form of Divination, requires an EE in Divination

For me, Muggle Studies is more general -- ie, what is electricity? what do muggles do in their spare time? what are common muggle jobs and why do they exist? Muggle Culture is more in depth and would cover material such as clothing and how to blend in, pop culture trends, how to use public transportation, how the money system works, and possibly include things like how to drive a car. Essentially, it's a more throughout class for those who are actually interested in muggles while Muggle Studies is more of a "soft option" for O.W.L.

Any sort of course on how the government works. They've got a bureaucracy, so there are rules for how to be a person in society. Students need to know those rules by the time they can function independently -- by the time they finish their OWLs. (I'm peeved that my school didn't do this.)

Enough maths to get by. You should at least be able to sum a column of numbers and do multiplication and division at a bare minimum, ideally going into basic algebra. You know, what you need for basic accounting.

- Unbreakable Vows. A magical oath that will literally kill you if you break it? The long-term consequences of this have to be discussed more.

** Well, I'm a little late to the topic, but this was posted when I was at work playing with controlled substances, so whatever.

I would say that the question isn't "what classes are missing at Hogwarts" but rather: What kinds of classes is Hogwarts supposed to teach?

I posit the following: As Hogwarts is fully Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the classes being taught would be ones that teach primarily of magic, or in relation to magic. As such, the Hogwarts education is highly comprehensive. There is coverage of all the major schools of magic that we are aware of (Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts [which by its own nature would include the Dark Arts to a degree], Herbology, etc.) as well as other more minor schools such as Care of Magical Creatures, Divination and Arithmancy. Of course, those are the ones that cover magic itself. As far as I can tell from canon, Astronomy and Ancient Runes pertain /to/ magic but may not necessarily be magic themselves or may only affect magic.

So what would I do if I was in charge of the Hogwarts curriculum? I probably wouldn't change much. Magic as seen in HP seems to be more philosophy heavy than the scientific!Magic we see in things like the Inheritance Cycle and Brandon Sanderson's works (or so I've been told). So I would include a philosophy course/courses, and /maybe/ make a couple years of Ancient Runes mandatory (depending on where, how and why Ancient Runes are used). Alchemy is already an elective (depending on demand) according to some WoG that I'm too lazy to look up. Not really sure what else is missing magic-wise.

I don't think that follows. If it did then Jesus College Cambridge, for example, whose full name is The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the Glorious Virgin Saint Radegund near Cambridge (yes, there's no mention of Jesus in the full name), would teach nothing except theology and obscure hagiography and stuff related to those. It certainly wouldn't teach [[https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/subjects/chemical-engineering][chemical engineering]].

It is entirely reasonable to expect Hogwarts to have updated its offering in the last thousand years and to have classes in, for example, the arts, languages, and physical education, which are missing from its curriculum, in addition to the magical subjects.

I also entertain the thought of a class on Magical Beings, studying the customs and history of Goblins, Dementors, Centaurs, Merpeople, House-Elves and the likes.

I don't think more physical education classes are really needed, though. Those who want to move around can form clubs, and physically keeping in shape isn't really necessary in the wizarding world unless you're a Hit-Wizard or Auror --- all muggle diseases can be treated with potions and such, and that includes even obesity.

**** Well, more advanced things needed for numerology would probably be introduced, but Arithmancy isn't math, it uses it

***** My headcanon for that one is that it's an open secre that Arithmancy is just as useless as the rest of Divination, but it's an open secret that Dumbledore uses it as an excuse to teach maths when the Malfoy-headed Board of Governors would never allow for a purely muggle subject to be taught as such.

****** The fact that arithmancy uses math means that math isn't purely muggle. Ergo, your headcanon makes no sense.

******* By "muggle", I meant "not related to magic". I think Malfoy and Co. feel every Hogwarts subject should be directly related to magic --- for that same reason, even though wizards have houses, they presumably wouldn't accept an Architecture course, but might if you slapped the word "enchanted" onto it and said it was all about building charms and space-extension spells.

But if it is needed for arithmancy then it is related to magic.

You can't normally use space-extension spells on buildings, need a special permission from the Ministry.

You don't seem to understand what I wrote in the above message. Maths used for Arithmancy are related to magic in the same sense that medicine is related to magic because Healing, and English is related to History because you've got to write essays. It goes into the school of magic, but is not magic in and on itself.

So what? Children aren't supposed to cast curses in public without special circumstances, but they're still taught them at Hogwarts.

** For a next gen fic that I am still in the process of brainstorming, I put together the following class list, with the idea that after the end of the War, a fair amount of restructuring happened at Hogwarts due to population growth and changing societal demands.

Students in all 7 years are required to take the following eight compulsory core subjects:

- Herbology

- Potions

- Transfiguration

- Charms

- Defense Against the Dark Arts

- History of Magic

- Astronomy

- Healing

Students in years 1-2 are required to take four basic learning courses:

- Maths

- Sciences

- Language Arts

- Social Studies

Students in Years 1-5 take two culture courses:

- Muggle Studies

- Wizarding Studies

Students in Years 3-7 take a minimum of two of the following four elective courses:

- Divination

- Arithmancy

- Ancient Runes

- Care of Magical Creatures

Students in Years 6-7 with sufficient OWL scores may take one or both of the following electives:

- Alchemy

- Magical Theory

The four basic 'muggle' courses for years 1 and 2 would help make sure that all incoming students would have a good educational grounding for the rest of the Hogwarts career. Language Arts would focus on essay writing, rhetoric, etc. Maths would be arithmetic, basic algebra, maybe some trig. Social studies would focus on geography and a smattering of major events in muggle history. Science would focus more on the scientific method, observation and analysis, and critical thinking, rather than on any specific science (as I don't think physics, etc. applies to the magical world, but the underlying principles could be helpful).

The two culture courses for years 1-5 would make sure that all students, regardless of background have a reasonable understanding of how both muggle and magical societies work. These would include discussions on government, economy, art, literature, music, etc.

The two NEWT level electives would be advanced courses that require high OWLs (E or higher) in multiple lower level courses, as well as continued study of said courses at the NEWT level. Alchemy would require Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, and Ancient Runes. Magical Theory would require Charms, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. This class would be geared towards teaching studies the underlying concepts behind why spells work so that they could go on to work as curse-breakers, spell-crafters, etc.

** All the classes that would enable the students (at least the muggle-raised) to function in the muggle world. It's as if the syllabus was specifically designed to force everyone into a magical-only society.

You want to go to university? Tough luck. There's no such thing in the magical world, and you don't have the necessary education to attend a muggle one.

** Hogwarts Syllabus is lacking from Dumbledore headmastership, muggle-lover and light biased. Hogwarts should like Dumstrang teach Politcs, law, wizarding custom for the muggle raised, when a student exit Hogwarts he must have the same knowledge and links to the magical community./ And should teach the darks arts.
