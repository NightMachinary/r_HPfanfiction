Just that. Time-travel, dimension-jumps, whatever. Not Harry changing his name, looks, or species permanently, in other words no pretense, but Harry as himself or his female self. Big plus for Harry and fem-Harry romancing each other, like that one Silver Aegis wrote. Huge plus for more than two Harrys.

Actually seems to be a rare trope. I've encountered a couple examples with dimension travelling, but it is usually quickly brushed off in a chapter, and the two Harrys dont meet again, or their duality is of no particular importance.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** linkffn(harry potter and the other path)

In this he does get a pep talk from canon Harry.

linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power)

Harry and the OFC get tossed into canon-verse and chill in Grimmauld for a while with the Order.

It's not a huge part in either of these stories, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head.

Oh wait, there's one who's name eludes me where Harry gets transported to a dimension where everyone is genderswapped except for Luna. I think it's femharry/manhermione and going towards Harry/altLuna

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
