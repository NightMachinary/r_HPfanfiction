Hi, as the title says, I'm in search of f/f fanfics. I would prefer for them to be of a decent length and completed, but I'm open to oneshots and works in progress.

bonus points to anyone that can suggest a pairing with Luna Lovegood.


** Also, the correct flair here is Request, not Discussion, just so you know. :)

** A personal favourite is Crazy Little Things. Essentially, it's a post-war, canon-compliant, pre-epilogue romance between Hermione and Luna that actually convinced me it could work and was utterly notable for being the only Hermione-Ron relationship ender that was amiable and friendly and not bashing of either one of them. The fic is Americanised to hell and in serious need of a Britpick though - Hermione talks so much about her 'majors' and I still have no actual idea what a 'sophomore' is.

Another weird favourite is the Yule Ball Panic series. It's a trilogy where fem!Harry and Hermione get together amidst Veela Ritual Orgies and a Feminist Revolution.

linkffn(11197701)

Mistakes and Second Chances has a powerful fem!Harry and a fem!Harry/Fleur couple.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15951056]]

linkao3(15951056)

The Silent World of Cassandra Evans has a mute fem!Harry going through all the difficulties you'd expect that to entail, along with a romance with Susan Bones later on.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11637611/1/]]

linkffn(11637611)

A Witch and An Amazon has a Fem!Harry (I think she goes by Rose?) meeting Wonder Woman in Vegas and getting drunk-married to her. Has a lot of homophobia from Magical Britain, but generally handles the concept semi-well. Fun fic with some relationship drama and superhero drama mixed into the plot.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12514982/1/A-Witch-and-an-Amazon-Walk-into-a-Bar]]

linkffn(12514982)

Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool - Harry gets punted to an alternate universe where he's a woman. She gets with Tonks in this universe and there's a weird ending.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool]]

linkffn(8175132)

Season of Change - Harry starts male, becomes female, finds out some family shit and there's family drama while she fights Voldemort. A fem!Harry/Tonks relationship.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928419/1/Season-of-Change]]

linkffn(9928419)

Son of Potter, Daughter of Black - Basically Season of Change, but with more Sirius. Fem!Harry gets with Tonks here too.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11653847/1/]]

linkffn(11653847)

Dahlia Evans - I haven't read this, but it's marked Harry/Hermione and it's in my fem!Harry folder, so I'm assuming this fits. Apologies if it doesn't.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

**** In American High school we have "special" names for Years 9 through 12. They are also called Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior.

Huh. I'd never heard of Junior either - unless that's what "Ugh, that's so junior high of me" refers to? I read that in a pitch perfect fic once and assumed it was a type of sub-set of school (Elementary, High, etc). Thanks for explaining! :)

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
