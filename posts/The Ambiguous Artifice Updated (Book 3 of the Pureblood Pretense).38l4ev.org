Gods, it must've been two years since the last update.

On a related note, are there any "dead" fics that were miraculously revived as of late you'd like to recommend?

** I was so excited when this came out and decided to reread the series so far so I knew what happened. I think it's only been like a year or so. I remember reading it last summer when the last chapter had just come out.
