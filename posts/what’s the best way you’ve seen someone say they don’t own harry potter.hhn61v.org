** I can't recall the exact phrasing, but it was deliciously sarcastic and something like this -

'I totally own Harry Potter. Yep, it's me, JK Rowling, writing fanfiction on some website for free, instead of writing another set of books for a multi-million dollar Hollywood movie deal.'

** In The Ghost of Privet Drive, AndrewWolfe uses the foibles of the Potterverse in his disclaimers. (Oddly, there is no disclaimer on the first chapter.) Some examples:

#+begin_quote
  (Chapter 8) DISCLAIMER: Does Gringotts call itself a bank when literally none of the services it offers---secure storage rental, gambling and curse-breaking---are core banking services? If so, I don't own Harry Potter.

  (Chapter 19) DISCLAIMER: Did the Family Tree JKR published for the Blacks directly contradict material in the books as well as not making any sense on its own merits? If so, I don't own Harry Potter.
#+end_quote

My other favorite one is from Dementor Delta, on her cross-over with Peter Pan for the classic literature challenge. /(Note that some archives --- including HPFandom --- used to require disclaimers on every chapter of every fic. This particular work no longer has a disclaimer attached to it, so I'm glad I saved it in my funny quotes file.)/

#+begin_quote
  Disclaimer: Author already knows she will be burning in hell for defiling not one but two beloved children's classics. What's the threat of a lawsuit compared to that?

******* Well, yeah. That's how Fanfiction got legal protections in the first place. :D

[[https://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2016/10/10-copyright-cases-every-fan-fiction-writer-should-know-about/]]

In more modern times, I don't really know. I know some authors who don't like fanfiction of their work regularly get sites to take stuff down, but in terms of actual legal 'we gonna take this to court!' stuff, I don't know. I'd assume not, given that everything seems to have gotten a lot nicer to fanfiction since that time Warner Bros made a teenager cry after they tried to take her HP site.

******** In regards to the actual legal case, fanfiction (in North America) would be incredibly difficult to bring down as most could argue it counts as transformative (this is the same thing that protects parody artists such as Weird Al). This isn't the case in the EU because their copyright laws are incredibly strict so there is probably a lot more that'd fall.

********* Heh. Does that mean the canon purist fics would be the ones likeliest to get taken down? Since they're extending the canon and not changing it? And the ones that change everything significantly would be okay?

"In the great fanfic purge, the only HP fics left will be... the Indy!Harries." :D

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

***** Not sure, the structure much more closely follows something like what Silently Watches did: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes]] (Though 2012 vs 2010)

So while HPMOR's disclaimers are funny I don't know if they're the progenitors of the style, though they may have inspired someone to invent it.
