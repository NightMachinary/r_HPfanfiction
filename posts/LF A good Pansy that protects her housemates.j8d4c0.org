:END:
Hello all,

I'm looking for a fic I read a long time ago. I remember very little; mainly that it featured Pansy protecting her Slytherin housemates from their own side. It also had a rather strange relationship with Draco, I think they were dating.

That's all I remember, so if that rings any bells, please let me know.
