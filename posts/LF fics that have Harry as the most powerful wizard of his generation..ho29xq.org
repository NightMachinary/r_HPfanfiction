Preferably featuring; honest development of his knowledge and power (not just powerful because the author said so and innately talented in every subject), a Harry clearly head and shoulders above his peers but not as powerful as adults, heterosexual or no pairings. Also preferable is the fic being complete, but it's okay if it's not.

(The mind arts, for example)

Thanks in advance.


** Not complete, but I'm updating on the reg.

*** Oh hey, I just finished reading it! I really enjoyed the early chapters and the fic is very well-written. That said, I'm a feel-good kind of reader and I get really down if the good guys don't survive and overcome, so when it got a little dark in the later chapters I couldn't continue.

That all said, you've clearly done something very right considering the following your story has amassed! Nearly two hundred thousand words and over a thousand follows? I could only hope to be so successful if I ever wrote a fic.

Thank you for the recommendation- your story certainly fits what I had in mind... just a little more light-hearted.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater. Good Dumbledore All Years
