I'm bored of "every Weasley is bad. Except Fred and ageorge becauae prqnks".

Slash and crossovers are fine. Please no mpreg, genderbending, harems, romance/smut-centric plot or pottercest


** The Lie I've Lived Harry doesn't get along with the twins and has Ron dislike them as well. The first few chapters aren't romance centric and are the ones that deal with the twins but the later ones are Harry x Fleur. linkffn(3384712)

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
