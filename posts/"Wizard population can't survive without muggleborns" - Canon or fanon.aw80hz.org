I see this in a lot of stories - that purebloods have low birthrates, or that magic is "dying off", and I can't think of the reason for it. Where does this idea come from?

Not to mention that it's usually used as a BTFO (usually by Harry or Hermione) of the pureblood traditionalists, but regardless, it's a pretty weak argument and plot device respectively, so I'm not sure why it's so popular.

Does anyone have any idea where this idea of pureblood wizard extinction came from? Is it a completely made up fanon idea to make writing "stupid, bigoted" purebloods easier, or is there any Canon behind it?


** I think this mostly comes from what Sirius says in OotP: “The pure-blood families are all interrelated. If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left." There's no hard canon evidence that pure-blood families have lower birthrates, but it's well-established that inbreeding can cause all sorts of health problems, including reproductive issues, so I don't think it's that much of a stretch.

We literally see Ron have all that at specific times. He's been mature, serious, and even knowledgeable in the right circumstances. And the topic being pure-bloods, which is family is, is a right circumstance.

Not everything Ron has to say has to be comedic, and someone like Hermione can have funny, lazy, or stupid moments. That's how human beings work.

******* 'Not very good writing' is kind of JKR in a nutshell. I still don't understand why an idea that wasn't really all that unique (it's not like she created the concept of the 'secret world alongside our own, but unnoticed) which is not all that well executed, managed to turn into a phenomenon, beloved by millions, myself included. It's kind of like '50 Shades of Gray' - ...how they hell did THAT happen?

As an aside, the level of disdain I have for her personally has increased about a thousand-fold since she started ret-conning things to better fit the latest books/movies/plays that are all money grabs. And yes, I feel the same way about 'The Hobbit' although at least Tolkien isn't alive to suffer through the complete BS they turned that into.

Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies professor killed in DH, was a proponent of wizard-muggle marriages. It is unclear whether she believed them /necessary/ or simply acceptable, but there is room in canon for wizards to believe muggleborns and half-bloods are necessary, even if there isn't PROOF that they are necessary.

** Pure fanon, made to help writing the bigoted pureblood angle easier + bash on background "dumb" characters like Goyle. Part of it stems from people not really understanding the issue in real life- it is not significantly more dangerous to have children with a 2nd cousin than a random stranger. First cousin marriage is still somewhat common in parts of the world, and it only becomes a really significant issue after a few generations of first-cousin only marriages.

For real life/worldbuilding information:

So whatever threshold you take, within Wizarding Britain alone, inbreeding is not close to being an issue whether you count muggleborns or not. And we know that there's an element of globalization to these communities as well (from stuff like the Quidditch World Cup), plus people with family from other countries, which again reduces the risk of any legitimate issues.

**** Umm, since when is the Middle East third world? Qatar and the UAE are both wealthy with good infrastructure (schooling, tech, etc.). The issue in the Middle East is double first cousin marriages - when your spouse is your first cousin from both your parents - which I would think really ups the risk factors. Also, 25% of marriages being between closely related people is an issue if that's an average over multiple generations.

Generations of first cousin marriages would cause issues no doubt, but once in a while (like every 5 generations maybe?) is not a huge risk, especially if there is ethnic diversity involved (i.e. you're half-Spanish and your cousin is half-Russian). Honestly, up to the World Wars, first cousin marriages were still very common in the West. It's only when young people started moving around (jobs, colleges, etc.) and meeting way more potential life partners that it started to become taboo.

On the contrary, it scientifically makes more sense.

Roughly, for every 10000 muggles, there is a wizard. That means there are around 5000-10000 wizards in UK during 1990s.

In that majority are halfbloods. Like, 65% Halfbloods, 20% purebloods and 15% muggleborns, for instance.

That means, there are 1000-2000 "pureblood" wizards in UK. Now I put it under quotes because, even in sacred 28s there are some generations who married halfbloods and muggleborns (like malfoys).

So, in reality the number of "true pureblood wizards" are extremely small. (Gaunts, Blacks etc.) On top of that, there are witch hunts in 16th century to consider.

The numbers are just too small that after 3-4 centuries, the diversity of gene pools are simply exhausted with their isolationist and insular policies. They have no other choice but to marry outside muggles or halfbloods or muggleborns lest they want their children to be born with genetic disorders.

*** Firstly, did you write two comments? That's annoying.

Secondly, can we stop for a second and both accept that you pulled those numbers out of your ass? I'm not even contesting the population size, just the ratio.

Why in the world would you think that it would break down like this? I can easily imagine a world where the majority of the population is pureblood (meaning magical parents going back over 3 generations), or close to: it would explain why it's still such an insular culture, and hence why the people tolerate and accept the nobles and pureblood ideas. If most people consider themselves pureblood and there is relatively little intermarriage between wizards and others, it would logically result in these things.

It simply wouldn't make sense for the demographics to break down like you outlined.

Even if we take your estimate of 20% purebloods, two thousand purebloods is more than enough to sustain itself indefinitely. Also, there's no such thing as "exhausting" the gene pool.

**** Two thousand purebloods are enough to sustain themselves independly, IF there is proper genetic diversity between them. Heck, even 160 genetically diverse people selected from 7.5 billion people is sufficient to survive independently.

The population of UK in 1990s is 50 million. So the probability that whomever you choose to marry is closely related to you is extremely low. The sample space is wide enough to choose from.

But in case of wizarding world, the sample space is less. And those numbers which I supposedly pulled out of my ass, those ratios are estimated based on number of children going to hogwarts per year. I could write a comprehensive post on population of UK wizarding world and ratio of muggles to wizards, but that is not the topic of discussion here.

Now, if we take 5000 pureblood wizards (it might be even lesser), the probability that whomever you choose to marry isn't closely related becomes higher. A lot higher. Imagine a village or a small town completely isolated from outside world. Now if they keep marrying among themselves what would happen?

Atleast they should marry foriegn purebloods, if they don't want to marry local half bloods/muggleborns. But that's extremely unlikely as we have seen. Please don't give the example of Malfoys. Armond Malfoy after migrating from France due to Norman invasions during 11th century, there are NO mentions that his future generation married foriegn pure bloods, particularly after 17th century. They are as insular as you could get, only exceeded by Blacks and Gaunts.

Infact it is extremely uncommon in UK pureblood wizards to marry foriegn pureblood wizards. Just see any pureblood family tree. They might have migrated from other countries centuries before due to several reasons, but rarely they have married foreign purebloods.

Weasleys are an exception, not a rule. They are treated as blood traitors because they are sensible enough to not follow their senseless dogma. +Though I don't understand why they aren't sensible enough to limit their spawn according to their salary+

Anyway, I don't think you're properly educated on this topic: there's infinite examples of isolated tribes which number far, far less than 2,000, with less genetic diversity than the entirety of Great Britain.

Hell, small tribes of under 50 people was the status quo for many populations across the world for many thousands of years before agriculture societies started springing up.

Which is why I think it's kind of ridiculous saying that a population of 2,000 can't survive.

******** Which means you have none. The fact is there is no purely insular tribe in history that survived for longer times (greater than two-three centuries). The need to bring in fresh blood was constant pressure in any tribe.

Let me quote an example (which I am most familiar with). There are some indigenous tribes (Onges, Jarawas and Shompen) in Andaman Islands which comprises of about 50-200 population today and has been living there for over two centuries. They are one of the most insular tribes you could get.

If we consider Onges, there used to be around 1000 population in 19th century, but now, it is just barely 10-20. Also, about 40% of married couple in Onge are sterile. Why? Why this huge drop just in two centuries?

Constrast this with North American tribes like Apache or Sioux. Their tribal customs regarding sex were extremely severe precisely to prevent inbreeding.

To avoid inbreeding, bands comprised of a few strong bloodlines were continually enriched by wife/husband swapping with other bands and other allied tribes, as well as by the enthusiastic adoption of any stranger from a different tribe or even race. *The need to bring in fresh blood was a constant pressure.* That's why they survived for longer time until colonials invaded them, but that is a different story.

********* I'm sorry, but you're just wrong. Human migratory patterns often led small tribes into completely unpopulated areas, where they did just fine. The "out of Africa" theory is pretty much based on this, where small groups of people migrated to untouched areas across the globe.

The crossing of the Bering strait to move into north America, the many isolated island tribes which traversed the seas (Hawaii is one such example), they are all examples of this.

And you seem to think that other people is the only way to get new genetic data. I'm sorry, but do you know the first thing about mutations? They're much more frequent than you imagine, and affect people that spend the majority of their time outside much more than us today due to solar radiation.

The fact that I'm not willing to spend hours of my time sourcing you for what are really basic, common sense ideas, doesn't mean it "doesn't exist", absolutely laughable.

I'm done taking here, since you seem to be convinced you're right, but I will sincerely say that you should educate yourself more on this.

** It's certainly not canonical. We do know that a pureblood population wouldn't make it past three generations because deplorable inbreeding, but "magic dying" doesn't enter into it; it's just a matter of generally maintaining a healthy genetic pool. The introduction of half-bloods (the half-Muggle kind) do esthe job as well as that of Muggle-borns does.

The "magic dying" is an element of worldbuilding that used to be popular in AU fics not particularly concerned to sticking to more than the basics of canon. Conspicuously imported from a bunch of other fantasy universes where magic is in decline (starting with Tolkien's Middle-Earth mythos), it's a decent enough idea if you know what to do with it, like, say, /HPMoR/ and some of its spinoffs did. Or it can be done terribly.

The idea that magic makes it harder to produce children is somewhat rarer, but I suppose some people felt an explanation was needed for why the Malfoys only had the one kid if they're so convinced of blood-purism. The "proper pureblood marriage" of Bellatrix in canon certainly suggests blood-purists are expected to try to produce pureblood offspring.

Somewhat related (though you don't mention it above) is the idea that the blood-purists have got it all wrong and interbreeding of already-magicals gives the child /weaker/ magic than if there's Muggle ancestry. Though absurd, in that it relies on the fanonical "magical power is an inborn, quantifiable power-level" raving, it claims to base itself in canon, in that its chief example is Voldemort, the most powerful Dark Wizard in his whole family line, even though he was a half-blood and the decadent, incompetent Gaunts earlier in his family tree were purebloods. Though the idea clearly is more along the lines of "blood doesn't matter; it's perfectly possible for purebloods to be terrible at magic and for half-bloods to be powerful", it's easy to see how you could misread it in this way.

Isn't this also a fanon idea? Or at least, the degree and extent of this inbreeding?

Also, I'm going to have to press X to doubt on that second part, as I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that there's more than 2,000 purebloods (depending on the definition) : and even if every single one of those families was only marrying within this group, it wouldn't be an issue as there would still be enough genetic diversity, especially with mutations taken into account - a population of this size is genetically stable.

Maybe some of the notable pureblood families (also part of the fanon "ancient and Noble" shtick) would be seriously damaged or die off, but that's only the rich, affluent purebloods like the Blacks.

There must be many, many more common purebloods within the upper middle and lower class (although I don't know why there's economic classes when magic exists, ask Rowling): I've seen pureblood defined as broadly as having magical parents going back two or three generations, which was labeled as "first/second/third generation" pureblood, and so forth.

**** It's not that the purebloods are all that inbred, it's that there's very very very few purebloods. Like, maybe 400. Maybe. Probably much less. (This is going off a 10,000 population for Wizarding Britain; if your headcanon figure is different, adjust the percentage.) So /if/ they had to sustain a population by themselves they would have to turn to deplorable inbreeding.

When someone from a highly upper class family says there's few pureblood choices, I read that as few [eligible] purebloods, meaning of the same or higher status as these Noble families. Meaning there could be many "lesser" purebloods, whose lineage doesn't trace as far back, who have varying degrees of wealth, that are still considered ineligible, but are purebloods nonetheless.

** Put it this way. If every Muggle in the world disappeared tomorrow, there'd be more than enough wizards left to continue the species without dangerous inbreeding. That said, pureblood culture seems to prefer a single heir, and then they all marry back into the same group of families, so they're not exactly breeding intelligently.

There's certainly nothing supporting the "magic is dying off" thing.
