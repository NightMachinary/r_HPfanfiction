Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is a play based on Shakespeare's Hamlet about two minor characters who cause the events of the play offscreen

The prompt is two minor canon characters accidentally cause the events in the Harry Potter books and movies

This would be in a universe that doesn't deviate from canon


** Well Trelawney and Aberforth are minor characters, yet it's them that set the whole action of the novels in motion: one makes the prophecy and one prevents Voldemort from hearing it all the way to the end (albeit I think Voldemort's course of action would have been the same regardless of whether he heard it in its entirety or just partially).

** Crossing Lines is an excellent fic that does this. I'd love to see how other people use this prompt too though.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** Pettigrew and Snape are stupid-the story of how two bumbling morons both cause and sabotage the rise of the Dark Lord.

...

I would read that.

** It's a shame the universe can't deviate from canon, because I could easily imagine an argument between Umbrige and Skeeter changing the course of history by motivating Skeeter into a tell-all about the Fudge administration.

By the time Goblet of Fire comes around, the Minister of Magic is Amelia Bones and she gives Harry three drops of veritersium before announcing that Voldemort has returned.

Zero changes on-screen, nothing is superficially different. But a single argument between two vindictive and petty women could cause an absolutely tectonic shift that could change the course of history by the time Voldemort returns to a physical body. Nothing appears superficially different to the narrative that follows Harry Potter... until suddenly everything is different. Because of one little argument.

** Something like “Daphne Greengrass, Side Character” by LinzRW linkffn(11145058), or actually “A Different Perspective” by StellaStarMagic linkao3(22953583)?

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.
