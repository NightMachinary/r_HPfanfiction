Looking for fics where Harry is sneaky or uses underhanded methods to win duels or the war. Fics where he lies, cheats, and steal in order to win.


** linkffn(5199602) Although the parts I read he didn't seem to motivated for most of what OP is asking.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.
