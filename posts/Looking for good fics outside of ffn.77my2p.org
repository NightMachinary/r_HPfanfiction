Looking for good stories outside of fanfiction.net. Some of the authors i follow also post on livejournal and AO3 but they are not very search friendly. Pairing can be any Harry/Any, Tom/Hermione. Novel length, complete or being updated regularly. Rating : Any( NC-17 preferred)

Thanks


** Try [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] and basically all other works by the same author.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/][Sink Into Your Eyes]] has some unique good fics if you are into canon pairings.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/][Portkey Archive]] has its own unique H/Hr fics such as [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7460][Love Lost, Love Found]] and a finished version of [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]].
