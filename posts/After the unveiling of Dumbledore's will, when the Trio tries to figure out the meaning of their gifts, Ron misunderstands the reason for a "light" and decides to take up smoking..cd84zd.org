** Ron hacked as he was surrounded by his loved ones at the ripe age of 42. His lungs irreparable from damage from the smoking, the smoking causing emphysema and lung cancer.

As he lay there dying, he realized that perhaps he should have quit.

** Shortly after ron gained his lighter, he discovers a copy of escape from new york in hermiones magical bag, it had been accidentally added during hermiones rushed packing

So ron now smokes cigars and wears a eye patch, hermione thinks its ridiculous. Harry finds it brilliant and is looking into getting his own thing and after discovering an old nior film while on the run decides to settle on dressing like a hard boiled detective

Hermione decides to Join in because honestly she didn't want to get left out Hermione will never admit it, but she finds Ron with an eye patch and a beard super hot though she wishes he was acting like a pirate instead.

Voldemort will never admit it, but during his childhood detective stories where his favorite, so he is quite envious of Harrys detective outfit though he does think that redheaded friend of harry looks great with an eye-patch and suddenly wishes he had spent more time designing the death eater costumes instead of pawning the task off on some malfoy.

six years after the battle of Hogwarts a young american walks into a detective agency to track down his mother when a black haired man dressed like a detective walks and introduces himself as Tom Riddle the great detective,

***** Well a good example would be Hagrid in the movies. He speaks with a West Country accent. That being anywhere from Wiltshire to Cornwall, though Cornish is a bit of a peculiarity. The West Country accent is often, and wrongly, associated with poor, dumb farmers, often like how Goofy's accent is associated with rednecks.

The thing about secluded places like say the Appalachians or the West Country is that they don't progress the way more densely populated areas do. Something interesting is that the US southern accent is actually closer to Old English accents from four/five centuries ago. Same with the West Country accent. It's a much older dialect than the received pronunciation (RP) so often associated with England these days. Funnily enough, James and Dumbledore are from Godric's Hollow, which is in the West Country.

Harry and, while never explicitly stated but often assumed, Hermione both grew up in London, so they'd obviously have RP accents. So not very different than the accents Daniel and Emma used in their roles. Dean is also from London, so he might have a bit of a [[https://youtu.be/ZN239G6aJZo?t=34][Cockney accent]].

McGonagall is Scottish, though I don't think she'd be Glaswegian. Something more posh, like an Edinburgh accent, which is what Dame Maggie Smith used in the movies.

Seamus is from Kerry, but speaks with a Dublin accent in the movies. [[https://youtu.be/pit0OkNp7s8?t=22][And Kerry is one of the most interesting accents in the world, but it's hard finding people speaking it who have the majority of their teeth.]]

Snape, Lily, and Petunia came from the Midlands, and a poor area at that, so I'd say they had something akin to a Brummie accent, like Ozzy Osbourne.

I know you said obviously... but isn't this just a bit too obvious? Obviously - *obviously* -prompts are optional, lmao.

Also, triggered by the thought of smoking? Can't say I've ever heard of that one. In fact, I'm not sure a person like that can exist, since they'd be largely incapable of going outside.

That being said, I do like the prompt!

I think there should be another one, but for Dumbledore, puffing mad clouds. I've always like the idea of the wizened wizard, smoking a long tobacco pipe, Gandalf-style. It's stereotypical, but it's my favorite stereotype :D

The better question is, please tell me what mythical place you live where you won't see cigarettes for sale or people smoking?

Literally every corner shop, major grocery store, convenience store, etc. sell cigarettes.

The chances of going out to any moderately populated area and not seeing any cigarettes for sale or even a single person smoking somewhere are pretty small.

So question, where do *you* live?

***** I live in London and, as a non-smoker myself, I haven't consciously noticed a cigarette in a long time. Maybe I saw someone smoking outside a pub last week while walking towards the train station? I think I vaguely remember something like that, though the beers stand out more to me.

In any case, all stores sell cigarettes behind the counter behind opaque panels and I don't remember the last time I saw an advertisement for smoking. According to [[https://www.ons.gov.uk/][ONS]], about 14.4% of people in England smoke, and since 2007 you cannot smoke indoors.

I do agree with you that a trigger warning for writing a smoking prompt is ... maybe a bit much, but I can see how reading about smoking in a story might "trigger" cravings in someone that is trying to quit.
