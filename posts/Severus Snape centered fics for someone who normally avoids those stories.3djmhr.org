I never understood the fascination of Snape-centered stories, mostly for two reasons:

1. Suddenly Snape is a likeable character, so he can raise and/or bang Harry
2. Childish James Potter and Dumbledore bashing, to shove all blame for his actions away from him
3. Or the story is only centered around Snape to make him look like the single most evil thing since Hitler

Could you recommend stories for someone who usually avoids stories with Snape as protagonist? Stories where he is a real character? Where he maybe still hates Harry, but still redeems himself? Where he doesn't run around boning every student he comes across, yet still does something different than simply sitting around all day being grumpy? Stories where he learns from his mistakes, or maybe already learned from his mistakes, and tries to change (but isn't simply replaced by snape 2.0 - now without any faults)?

I'd appreciate suggestions, as well as explanations on exactly why you suggest the story.


** If you can handle something abandoned, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6306296/1/The-Apprentice]]) is a great story. I also don't enjoy stories based around Snape but this was an exception.

Snape is killed in the final battle, but regains consciousness back in his school days. The story is written with the level of sarcasm and general attitude you'd expect from Snape which makes it quite humorous at times.

His personality is relatively true to the books. It's been a long while since I've read this story, but it has stuck with me. I highly recommend it.

  In 1998, Severus Snape was given a second chance. In 1976, he has to figure out how to take it.

** I don't read a lot of fanfiction, but I really enjoyed this Snape centered one: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family]]. It is written with Snape as a point-of-view character, starting with his birth and ending with his death. I though it was fascinating and well written. I also think that Snape, as he is presented in the story, aligns closely with Snape in the books. He's a more sympathetic, but only you see first hand his life and how he is influenced to make the decisions that he does. Well worth a read, imo!

**** I'll offer another opinion.

This fic is wordy as hell, a good edit would see it improve significantly. However it is worth the read none the less.

*** Best fan fic of all times, bar none. It's a surprisingly mature character study, even if I don't agree with the author's interpretation.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186953/1/Who-Has-Time-For-Tears][Who has time for tears?]] is a Silent Hill cross-over, of all things. Don't worry, you don't need to be into or know anything about Silent Hill to read it.

It doesn't sugar coat Snape's character, and it's not the best read of all time, but I enjoyed it for what it was - a journey about a broken man's experiences and past.

Probably the best Snape centric fic I've read

*** This is surprisingly good. I tend to hate crossover fiction because they're usually nothing more than egregious reference wank... but this isn't.
