Fics where the Dursley's psychological and verbal abuse affects Harry more than the physical. Making him have trouble with social situations or trouble processing emotion. The art of self fashioning is one that I have read with this premise but I was hoping for something that wasn't as dark

  Fourth year. Living with the Dursleys taught Harry three all important rules. These rules cause an emotionally repressed 11 year old to attend Hogwarts and discover his so called dead family aren't as dead as he believed.

**** No, it isn't. Just a very apathetic Harry who actually shows the effects of being little more than a social recluse for 11 years.

** Brutal Harry. Awesome fic and one of the plot points is for him to learn how to feel like a normal person.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
