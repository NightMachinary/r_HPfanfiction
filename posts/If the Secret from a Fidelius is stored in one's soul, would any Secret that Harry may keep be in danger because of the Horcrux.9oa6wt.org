Sure, its 2 different souls inside one body, but since they are so close together, wouldn't it "leak" from one another?


** What's the danger? Voldemort doesn't know about the final Horcrux and he can't communicate with it or something.

*** Well, Voldemort didn't know about the fact that it was the Horcrux that made the conection between them possible, but still manage to use it to lure Harry to the DoM and eventually try and posses him. He might've "gained" the Secret passively and not know, but it could still be a danger for Harry if the Secret passed on to Voldemort.

** In canon, nothing is specific enough to say that's true.

In fanfic, there's nothing saying that's NOT true, so go for it if you want it to be.

** Perhaps. Or it might be another of JK's plot holes

*** Arguably, Voldemort's soul staying with Harry is a plot hole either way since we see that he usually reacts with spontaneous combustion to Lily's protection.

**** I'm imagining it, I'm imagining it...young Harry goes to primary school (this is before he learns he's a wizard from Hagrid), everyone stares because his HEAD is on FIRE. And he's not even bothered by it.
