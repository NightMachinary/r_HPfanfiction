Harry is in Slytherin because he fell asleep on the train ride to Hogwarts alone in a compartment, and didn't know about their reputation. Adrian is a kind of tomboy older sister, and I forget how he became friends with Hermione. I think Adrian lives with her recluse aunt. I know they both make the quidditch team.

Pretty sure it's a multi book series, and that I saw it on AO3.

Thanks!
