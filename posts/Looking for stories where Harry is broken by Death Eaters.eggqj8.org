Rather his beliefs are broken his heart, his mind (driven insane, or childlike or something).

I do NOT want him to be on Voldemort's side, since that wouldn't make sense.

I do NOT want Weasley bashing, I'd rather not have Dumbledore bashing either, but I'd rather have Dumbledore bashing then Weasley bashing, since I absolutely love the Weasley's. Harry can be broken either the entire way in the story, or he's healed by those around him, somehow.

NO Super power/super intelligence type of Harry, he can be slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then canon, but nothing too unbelievable.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, though if Hermione is with one of them, or another character, NO Ron Weasley bashing, please.

It can be on any site, not just fanfiction.net, I'd rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6245561/12/The-Lies-that-Bind]]) I guess it's kind of a spoiler that he gets tortured and broken by Bellatrix, but since you asked for it.

  In the midst of his sixth year, Harry rescues Daphne Greengrass from an unpleasant fate. While innocent affection grows, a shadow has been cast into the Chosen One's life that might herald him down a darker path. A path his own actions may yet create.
