Basically, I'm looking for your favorite fics that have magic that isn't always the Canon style "incantation + wand movement = result".

Canon style magic like that isn't bad, and it can even be plentiful in the fics you recommend! But I'm looking for fics with magic that requires /more/ than that sometimes, be it complex spells the caster needs to wrestle into submission, rituals with swirling magic, or foreign magic that doesn't require wands or incantations at all!

A couple of examples to help get the idea but please branch out! This is far from complete list, just go with your gut.

- Bungle in the Jungle's take on the animagus transformation
- Sum of their Parts' (and many other fics too) take on fiendfire.
- By the Divining Light's take on old magic

Thanks!


** linkffn(8303194)

Has a lot of old and arcane magic. And it's also one of the few fics that features a truly powerful!grey!Harry and doesn't bash Dumbledore at all.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived.

In the context of the character and his position in the world his war against monotheistic religions made sense, however the author saying that this story is a power fantasy in which they enjoyed the character not being restrained by moral or societal norms.

There is a difference between writing a character who has to do something extreme that would go against REALITIES social norms because the consequences in your fiction would be catastrophic for the characters, but outright saying that you're using this character as personal wish fulfillment is just mean spirited and clearly NOT just used because the story/character's context demanded the action.

****** "There are so many other fics like it" is a problem in itself.

RobSt is another solid writer who has a large audience yet when people (especially here) talk about his work it's looked down upon because his work is largely derivative of...well his own works that he's already done before.

For the Love of Magic was a story that within the first few chapters you could see some actual ideas behind the work, but that's transformed into an over generic power fantasy/wish fulfillment story that's more about getting Harry super duper strong and get tons of ladies to fall in love with his dong.

The idea that you'd take a solid writer and a solid editor and start to create an almost original idea only for it to go fairly generic with it's intentions is a bit disappointing. Add on to that his troubling stance on WHY his character is doing what he's doing in the story it all becomes a bit troubling and even more of a disappointment.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Hermione Granger returns to England after years away. Things have changed back home, but so has she; though Hermione doesn't know just how much. No one ever said change was easy and in her case it is downright dangerous, but she wouldn't be alone. Not only do drastic changes affect Hermione's life and magic, but she will also end up bound for life to another. Hermione/Multiples

  Wheels Within Wheels is the story of Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, who were promised to one another by their parents in the dark days of the First Wizarding War. As they explore their new, sometimes overwhelming mutual feelings, they also discover heretofore unknown facts, and facets, about their parents, close associates, and themselves.

** A little late but this one talks about a time before Magic was "bound to wizards", "Wild Magic" is not something to be spoken of so lightly if at all, and there was a lot more to the death of Luna's mother and the creatures she can see, this is also a twins harry fic, its a worthy read
