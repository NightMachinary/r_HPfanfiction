Can be focused on the order/aurors centric or the trio (though preferably the former). I particularly liked Geminio (though its Moody doing the killing which is not really a surprise). A fic with battle in the DOM or Battle of Hogwarts where the Order lets the gloves come off would be particularly interesting.

  ...doesn't necessarily STAY there. When two groups travel to Sin City in an attempt to recover from recent events, no one could have predicted the consequences. Bloody Brandy's Vegas Vacation challenge, fem!Harry/Raven, femslash, NOT Tonks/Lupin

** The Order, including Dumbledore, usually aren't shying away from killing in my stories. In "Patron", Order members are killing in battle - Sirius, Harry, Ron, Tonks, Aberforth, and of course Moody. Among the POV characters are also two Aurors, who investigate the Death Eater cases - and aren't too shy about using lethal force either in a fight.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
