I've got a few ideas kicking around in my head about a time traveling ginny/tom fic, but the problem is it's kind of a patchwork mess.

â€‹

- Ginny & Tom's big arc is accepting the contradictions in their beliefs and resolving to change. Tom says muggles are cruel violent creatures, but he lives in an orphanage. Ginny says muggles are okay and don't deserves tom's hate, but she doesn't know anything about them and is parroting the stuff her parents say.
- ginny ends up in tom's sixth year\\
- tom at first wants to just buy into his nice guy routine, but after a while the two become intellectual rivals
- Ginny doesn't put up with tom's bs like others do i.e. she calls the death eaters the he-man woman haters & she tells him Voldemort is a dumb name
- ginny wasn't the one meant to go back in time. It was going to be minerva, but she died and ginny just went back because she was surrounded
- ginny can't kill to because she has no idea where his horcruxes are
- tom can't kill ginny because of the Myrtle indecent
- tom leaves school in his seventh year with the death eaters to steal the elder wand
- ginny goes with him cause harry died doing the same thing
- ginny tells tom about voldemort
