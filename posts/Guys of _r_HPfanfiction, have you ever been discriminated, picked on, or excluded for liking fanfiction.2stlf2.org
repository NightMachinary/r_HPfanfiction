** If you don't tell anyone, they can't discriminate against you. It does lead to some awkward conversations, though.

"Do you want to go out drinking tonight?"

"No, I've got stuff to do."

"What sort of 'stuff'?"

"Just stuff."

"OK, I get you, /stuff/"

Now my friends think I'm addicted to masturbation..

** Nope. Most of my friends know I write/read fanfic and most of them just think of it as a geeky hobby. A few of them were actually quite interested when I mentioned the numbers of readers and writers -- they had no idea it was so huge.

But in general I think people worry too much about how people perceive it. Actually, people just don't care lol. They're not going around their lives judging you; they're too busy dealing with their own shit to give your hobbies too much thought.

** Most of my friends know that I read this stuff. But we're CG artists and game developers. As such geeky and nerdy stuff surrounds us 24/7. Me liking fanfiction is about average on the geek-o-meter when it comes to my circle of friends. I mean, we have hardcore LARP players and all they have to "suffer through" for doing what they like is that we sometimes adress them with their fantasy names.

Sure, we make fun of each other for each others special little quirks, but its all in good fun.

Also, while writing this it hit me that you might mean people in general, not just people whos opinions about my hobbies are worth a fuck to give. To that: No, can't remember being disciminated, picked on or excluded for liking ff. But this is not a topic I usually speak about with a stranger.

** It doesn't come up much, but when it does, people mostly seem intrigued. For people who aren't in the loop, it usually blows their mind when I tell them there are 700,000 Harry Potter pieces on FF.net alone.

I've never been picked on or had a negative experience talking about it. I usually bring it up in the context of improving at writing: instant feedback, a community with a lot of knowledge and diverse opinions, stuff like that. Most people are at the very least intrigued; some want to read what I've written. Hell, /my mom/ e-mailed me a couple days ago to bug me about updating my fic. :P

**** I'm not shy about telling people I read/write fanfic, but I'm /very/ selective about giving people a link to my stuff. I knew my mom would be interested because she loves the HP books and she's read my original fiction novels and liked them.

My dad, on the other hand, cheerfully and honestly thinks fantasy of any kind is silly; doesn't get the point. He's not a dick about it, he just doesn't have the kind of brain that appreciates things that aren't real.

So, yeah, I'll only tell my real-life friends about my specific story when I have a strong hunch they'll be interested in it, and not just because I wrote it.

** I don't think any of my friends actually know about it to be honest. Think one of my flatmates may have seen some up on my kindle once but not sure if he'd really know the difference. I get some gentle ribbing because of my open love of anything Harry Potter related so I'd imagine it would just get lumped into that.

I'd say I'm a fan of Harry Potter, which extends to Harry Potter fanfiction, as opposed to a fan of fanfiction which includes Harry Potter. I'd imagine they'd see the second as weirder, seeing as how everyone's just sort of used to my interest in HP.

** (One) guy of [[/r/HPFanFiction]] here. I've never been discriminated against, picked on, or excluded for enjoying fanfiction. Then again, I don't exactly go around trumpeting my hobbies in public (whether fanfiction, Civ5, or something else). I'm fairly introverted, and don't enjoy talking about myself, which are bigger reasons why I don't bring these things up in public.

About the only person I've ever actually discussed fanfiction with in person is my sister, and that was maybe once when she told me she likes Snape-Hermione while I like Harry-Daphne or Harry-Tonks.

My manager at work found out I write fanfic because I don't really try to hide any link between my pen name and my real name, and he thought it was a good idea to bring it up publicly.\\
Got some "funny" comments about it for the past month but they mostly stopped by now because I made it clear I don't care.

It helps that I work in a geek profession I guess, I have colleagues who are absolutely obsessed with things like Farscape or Star Trek.

ex.

Harry Potter and the Nightmatres of Future Past -> Nightmatres of Future Past\\
Harry Potter and the methods of rationality -> Methods of Rationality

Then if they are interested and ask me what is about i give a short sumary

Ej:

NOFP: A Wizard goes back in time to his younger self after the future is destroyed by his nemesis, and tries to fix the time line while he deals with PTSD.

If they ask me for the file i give it to them, this generaly ends with them either getting into fanficion o simply ignoring it when they realize its fanfiction.

One of my best friends is deeply involved in an online Star Trek RP - and this is the one who's actually a productive member of society (having just graduated and got a job). We have twice weekly sessions of Dungeons and Dragons (Pathfinder, technically, but what's the difference), in which the one character who isn't drawing from the [[http://www.minmaxboards.com/index.php?board=101.0][Touhou Battle Grimoire]] is playing a slightly toned down version of Shiki Tohno. I got my first "real" job in part because the guy who would be my boss was ALSO a massive nerd, and our interview sidetracked into a conversation over Kirk v. Picard

So no.
