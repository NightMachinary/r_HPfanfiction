This is of course in no way canon, but I feel that it fits.

In essence, I posit that these spells might have been stolen. Specifically, from other magical species or even Muggles. Wizards saw another race use their magics to accomplish some form of teleportation, and they reverse-engineered a version that they could use.

The first one I thought of were Portkeys, and I believe the original creators of these were either Goblins or Dwarves, if those existed and could use magic.

My reasoning as to this is how they are described - spinning wildly, and then slamming into the floor. I believe the reason for this is because Goblins are shorter, and thus have both shorter legs and their entire being/magic is concentrated further down than a human's. Because of this, a portkey was created so it comfortably deposits them on their feet, allowing seamless travel without bracing to jump or landing. However, as Humans are taller, their feet touch the ground sooner than Goblins, which causes a hard impact and a stumble. People who have used portkeys many times can anticipate the landing and bend their legs, which causes them to land like a Goblin would. The spinning sensation was never compensated for as Goblins don't seem to get dizzy through rapid movement, as seen in their cart system.

The second one was Apparition, which I believe was reverse-engineered from House-Elves. Or perhaps their ancestors.

My reasoning is once again how it's described - like you're being squeezed down into a ball and sucked through a tube. Pressure from all sides, and extreme dizziness on the other end. I believe this is because Elves are much smaller in stature and much slighter in proportion to Humans. If an elf teleports, their apparition molds to their form seamlessly, perhaps for reasons of efficiency or so as not take with them more than their body and what they are holding. Meanwhile, when a wizard apparates, their body is similarily enveloped by the spell, but the spell still assumes they are as small as an elf, which causes unbearable pressure as the teleportation attempts to mold onto being much larger than an elf. Because elves often transport objects or items, the spell doesn't force their shape, but it still assumes that it is the default and attempts to align.

There must've been changes to the spell to make it usable by wizards, like a somantic trigger (the turning), which made it more detectable, as well as the added disturbance when a human-sized being teleports as opposed to an elf-sized one. This, adding to the fact that those who have an elf want them to be able to teleport, resulted in the standard anti-apparition hexes being geared towards human sized apparators and the altered spell, instead of the more natural elf apparition.

The third is the Knight Bus, and probably the most obvious. The bus is very much a muggle one, but enchanted up the ass to be invisible, to squeeze through traffic, to teleport and drive really, really fast. It's simply a muggle bus that's been altered.

The fourth, and this one is the biggest reach, is the Floo. I believe it was reverse-engineered from Phoenix Travel.

My reasoning here is much more flimsy, being based mainly on how it looks and how it's described. It's obviously a flame, and it feels like spinning through a dark network of fireplaces as you fly towards your destination. Phoenix travel is never truly described, but I believe it is similar in nature, feeling like flying as the phoenix teleports. This one is much more mysterious and powerful, as phoenixes are in HP canon, and can pierce anti-apparition and portkey enchantments alike, just like the Floo can. However, the Floo is stationary, most likely an enchantment that can be placed upon any fireplace remotely, and lifted just the same. Still, Sirius for example managed to pierce Hogwarts with the floo, speaking to Harry through the fire in the Gryffindor common room. It's unclear if all the fireplaces in the castle are connected to the network or only eachother, or if they are at all, but the fact remains that Sirius somehow managed to create a floo connection to another fire.

That's mostly it. If anyone has any other ideas, or better ideas for the Floo, please feel free to put them in the comments. Once again, this is pure fanon. I know it's a bit rambly, but I hope I managed to put what I meant to say into words.

Cheers.


** I think that the reason travel is supremely unpleasant is metaphorical. Magic allows you to cheat, but with a catch. Travel is unpleasant, and not even magic can remove that. You have to have the same amount of unpleasantness it would take to get to a place physically and compress it in the smaller amount of time you have when traveling magically.

So phenomenally unpleasant experience all at once.

*** But then why is Phoenix Travel not uncomfortable to the Phoenix? If magic always takes a price, then all spells would have some equal drawback. The Patronus for example is arguably a much, much larger "cheat" than apparition, but it doesn't seem to have any sort of drawback beyond the memory requirement. It doesn't have a price.

Additionally, people can adjust to the discomfort, and Harry describes the Apparition Instructor at Hogwarts as being wispy and light and almost see-through. If you can just overcome the price magic takes for cheating, then it's not really a price, is it?

**** Perhaps you are both correct in the sense that it was stolen from another species and it is uncomfortable because it was stolen and not natural. A wizard is supposed to be able to cast spells but shouldn't teleport so when he does it is uncomfortable. A house elf is supposed to teleport but not use a wand, that would mean that for an elf to use a wand would be awkward and unnatural.

** My theory is that apparition is uncomfortable because you're traveling from one place to another without disturbing the spaces between. I'm not very sciency, but from what I know, I would think that there would be pressure differences as you travel. I'm not sure where you are as you travel between spaces, but it's mentioned that you cannot breathe. That could be the pressure, or lack of oxygen. Or even moving so fast, your lungs can't expand.

Is it ever mentioned how long it takes? Perspective being in real time, or wherever they travel through?

*** I don't remember where I read it, but someone posited the theory that apparition forms a momentary microwormhole that sucks you through to the place you want to go, and that magic is used to condense you into a noodle thin enough to fit the compressed space. Wizards definitely have the ability to fuck around with space and a wormhole would be the most energy efficient method.

Knowing HP canon, actually breaching the fabric of reality would be a very bad thing.

However, I also like The Arithmancer's theory that you don't actually twist on one of the perceptible axes, but that you twist your body into a fourth spatial dimension, where distance doesn't matter and you essentially do a 360 degree turn through 4D space along the w axis and land back in 3D space where you visualized.

** I see it a lot like astronauts training their bodies to withstand G-forces for take-off and re-entry. You or I may be fine, but most likely not if we were to attempt what an astronaut does. So a young wizard/witch that has never taken a portkey or used the floo or side-along apparating doesn't know what to expect and it may not occur to grown wizards to explain it. I think mostly the unknown could be best explained by J.K. Rowling's writing style and a desire to move the story along more than anything else, they just throw Harry into side-along and portkeying because it's convenient travel. I feel like not every wizard or witch can apparate, or a person can but prefers not to acclimate to the feeling and chooses the floo. Just as I can attempt to train my body like an astronaut, there is no need since I work in an office and doing so would be more work for me than I would prefer in a hobby.

Apparition would almost certainly be required for magical law enforcement but not for a book seller or a ministry clerk. Perhaps there are skilled wizards that know how to use the spell comfortably and with almost no sound.

** Really clever ideas, I doubt I'll adopt them as a full headcanon as I also like a number of the other expkanations, but I'd love to see them in a fic. I think that your theory on portkeys and Goblins is especially fitting.

While the idea that there are costs and tradeoffs to magic and that comfort is the price paid for convenience works well in some fics, I think it only works in fics that apply that concept to the entirety of magic, and not every fic should do that. I feel like this would read really well for fics that address creature interactions. Is it possible for an elf working with a wizard to create a version of Apparation suited to the stature of the wizard? Perhaps it's only because the ability and knowledge is stolen that the downside exists and cooperation would see it removed.

** I headcanon the knight bus as an insult to people who can't get an apparition license (or had theirs taken away), can't afford the floo network, or get too drunk to apparate. They have to ride in a "muggle contraption" to get around, and according to pure bloods: muggles are filth.

Now on to the others: portkeys, apparition and floo travel.

Floo power is a proprietary item. Only one company sells it in Britain. At the same price for a hundred years. Why would they change anything? They have a good thing going.

Aparition? Again, it works, why should they change anything? In fact, it would probably confuse people if a new technique or change appeared.

The magical world from what we were shown is a very backwards place. Not a lot of new things happen. And then you throw in the pure bloods, where new things might step on their toes.

Portkeys? It really sounds like it requires all sorts of tracking. What happens if two portkey travellers collide while in transit? If two people arrive at the same time? It sounds like a lot of work, and simply not regulated to keep it out of everybody's hands. Fudge really got peeved when Dumbledore forced one on Harry in OoTP. Change here might be a chore because then EVERYONE has to accept it.
