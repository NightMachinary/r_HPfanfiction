Well no hate please.

I'm looking for any interesting dominant harry fic, well it should include adult scenes, I'm still not sure about how reddit works properly so maybe this is not the platform I should ask but whatever.

I am partial to slash , please no severus/harry pairing. Please.

Anything else is welcome, just Harry as Dominant/Top/protective/possessive/alpha/lord etc. You get my point.

Well if it's not a ficlet than that's better. Atleast 50-100k, complete fics would be appreciated but are not an requirement if the material is good.

Just Harry Potter as main character though. No OCs or anything.

  Draco has been having panic attacks for years, until his best friend, Pansy, welcomes him into a whole new world. And he thought being a wizard was neat. Being a dom was even better.

  Upon returning for Eighth Year, there are so many strange things going on with Malfoy, Harry doesn't know where to start. He won't talk to Harry, but he's talking to ghosts. He won't apologize for his past, but the Black Family tapestry has crossed him off its tree. And the worst of it all, he still has that infuriating, snotty mouth on him that gets Harry's dick hard as a rock drives Harry insane.

  Harry has had quite enough of sharing his mind with someone else, thankyouverymuch. A miscast Legilimecy spell says otherwise.(Fic from 2010 FF archive being uploaded here.)AND FOR THE LAST FUCKING TIME, STOP REPOSTING THIS ON WATTPAD. I DO NOT WANT IT ON WATTPAD. YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO POST THIS ON WATTPAD.
