Looking for any good HP and mythology crossovers, whether its greek, roman, egyptian, norse etc. Preferably over /50,000/ words.


** Here is my fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24841198/chapters/60090274]]

The crossover mythology starts from Christianity-adjacent sources, but slowly opens up to include other cosmologies. Year 1 almost complete! Updates weekly.

** Hmmm, not sure if it's what you want but I did a potions-based world traveler fic that has the running into different mythological creatures and stories where they go. I even have a notes section explaining the source material.
