Many fics play up The Veil as a gateway Read many where Harry travels through it to various fandoms/alternate universes. Nonjon springs to mind.

What about Sirius though? I'm kinda surprised he hasn't been used as a multi-dimension traveler or such.

Yeah there's likely hood whatever curse nailed him flat out killed him but what if it didn't?

Sirius Black lands in Narnia Sirius Black lands on top of Yoda on Kashyyyk Sirius Black's Groovy Adventure into the past and accidentally offs himself.

I guess it'd be considered too OC or SI-ish Still that's an untapped potential

Sirius Black falls through the veil and lands......

** I honestly have always wanted to read/write a fic about Sirius waking up in his old eleven year old body after he fell through the veil. This Sirius knows the future and he wants to change things for the better. However, everything soon gets very wrong when he ACTUALLY gets sorted into Slytherin (I mean, it's an ambitious plan to change the future after all). This Slytherin has to play the heir he never wanted to be, he has to 'befriend' future death eaters and he misses his friends. Nothing hurts more than knowing your best friends are alive and want nothing to do with you. Nothing hurts more than seeing James smile with Peter, not knowing that rat will betray him. Seeing Harry's smile in James and knowing he will probably never see his godson again.. This would be the story of a Sirius who has to sacrifice his whole life, to safe the ones who dispice him now

*** I've been hoping for Sirius POV Marauders for a while so if this gets written I'll take it. But Sirius' personality is still too Gryffindor to go anywhere else, it'd be hard to believe. The hat isn't just ‚Äúyou have a want therefore a snake‚Äù it's about what the kid values which would be friendship, loyalty, bravery, etc. Ron wants to be successful like his brothers, but just cause the want exists doesn't mean he's a Slytherin.

**** Well, yes but Sirius accidentally getting resort into Slytherin would be very important to the plot. I agree he's more Gryffindor, but he has always had some Slytherin traits too, especially when he got older. He was determined enough to save Harry from Peter (and get revenge) he literally broke out of Azkaban. Getting a second change to avoid the death of your friends would be a chance too good for him not to take. Sure, it's a noble thing to do, but it's also a really ambitious plan. He would have to be clever because of the butterfly effect and well, I think you get where I'm coming from

***** I can respect some plot contrivance, and the story of Sirius in Slytherin would be really fun.

I have two perspectives with Slytherin, but they both depend on what the characters value as most important. The more canon angle is that Slytherins value status and power over other things, hence you get purebloods, bigots, and bullies. The fanon interpretation is that Slytherins value the traits of cunning, ambition, determination as the skills they want to develop and be recognised for.

Percy Weasley would almost fall under the second catergory because he desires a good job and to be recognised for it. BUT it is not what he values the most which is ultimately to be brave and stand by his family.

This situation for Sirius does call him to use more of his Slytherin traits, he has to think ahead comparing to his timeline, he has to be subtle with how much he lets on etc. But when the hat is put on his head it will see that he ultimately values saving his friends over anything else that the time travel allows him.

Plus, I'm pretty sure he would pull a Harry and just ask to be put in Gryffindor.

That's all a discussion of the character, and a reason I wouldn't by the premise of your story. So instead we can make different changes to get the story you want.

A. Sirius tells Regulus what happens and they make a plan as brothers to make changes. Regulus is only 10 but he is also the closest he's ever been to his brother. What do they decide on, should Regulus still go to Slytherin if he can help it? Does Sirius lie to his parents about infiltrating the enemy camp?

B. Sirius and Regulus have both come back from the future. Maybe they were exploring the attic and found a weird device that pulled them back after their deaths. So Regulus knows of one horcrux and can be the cunning Slytherin who retreads the timeline to access it, but also we can get Sirius still with the Marauders.

C. Get rid of the time travel and just have Sirius and James make a friendship pact on the train that doesn't get upset by Sirius going to Slytherin. Now the Marauders are split but what changes now?
