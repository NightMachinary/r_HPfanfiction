This was originally meant to be a reply to a request thread by [[/u/CrimsonMyriad]] entitled "[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7h0g1m/request_snapecentric_fanfiction_that_focuses_on/][Snape-centric fanfiction that focuses on his intellectual genius and spywork]]", but it morphed into an only tangentially related discussion.

Excerpt from CrimsonMyriad:

#+begin_quote
  Love him or hate him, Severus Snape is without a doubt, HP' s most complex character. I just so happen to love him (as a character, nothing more, thanks), but what I love most about him is his sheer bravery and his towering and un-excavated intelligence. I feel his personhood is wasted when people try to shack him up with characters like Lupin, Harry or Hermione. Even with Lily, it doesn't work. Severus Snape is meant to be perpetually lonely in love. He is unattractive and foreboding and even if anyone did fall for him, he's still in love and guilt for Lily.
#+end_quote

I do take issue with the claim that Snape is "*without a doubt*, HP' s[sic] most complex character," but I do think one can make a very strong argument in support of the claim. He's almost certainly more complex than Harry, which brings me to the heart of my response.

My biggest problem with HP canon is that Rowling took what was a perfectly serviceable character arc for Harry through five books (arguably four books), and decided to make books 6 and 7 significantly about Snape.

As a teen, I hated Rowling for this, and I still hold her decision in ardent disdain. She makes me hate the man for my entire childhood and early teen years, and then shoves him down my throat for 2 whole books, when I wanted nothing to do with him. It ruined DH for me (I would never say it ruined the series, HP is probably my favorite thing).

I was expecting to read a series about the journey of Harry Potter from destitute, neglected orphan to a badass, self-sufficient hero. Instead, I get an extremely well constructed redemption arc for the character I hate the most, and a contrived MacGuffin (The Hallows) arc to save Harry's ass because Rowling neglected his character progression for the final two books.

I identified with Harry as a kid. I grew up imagining myself as Harry, going on adventures with him and Ron and Hermione. I get that it would have been rather predictable for Rowling to have a straightforward 7 book training montage where Harry gradually becomes more and more powerful until finally defeating Voldemort, but she didn't have to completely crap out on his magical training and potential after book 5.

What a lesson to teach the children whose lives you've been a major part of:

#+begin_quote
  Don't bother training, learning and improving because you'll just run out of steam when you get to something hard (Occlumency and silent magic). But fear not, the vindictive asshole who has tortured you for 6 years is actually not that bad of a guy and you owe him everything. You should name your kid after him, even though he indirectly killed your parents.

  Also, it didn't matter that you failed at your ultimate goals of making something of yourself, because these magical objects will show up and give you a loophole with which to defeat your nemesis with love.
#+end_quote

I know my relentless diatribe describes an extremely cynical take on Rowling's plot for books 6 and 7, but this is how I've felt for the last decade.

A great many HP fans loved Deathly Hallows and Snape, and the rational part of me can understand this POV. I wish I could muster the motivation to be a good steward of objectivity and present an intelligent rebuttal to my viewpoint, but I just don't have it in me.

In the end, this isn't a position that I am trying to defend. This is just my opinion. Feel free to tell me why you disagree.

I think it's worth pointing out that I haven't read the 7th book in over a decade. My memory on the plot is a bit hazy. There's a good chance I've embellished Snape's role as it's bitterness has stewed in my head over that time and intermingled with far more words of fanfiction than I ever read of canon.


** Imo, Snape's character arc was only really significant in the chapter of Snape's memories. Yes, Book 6 and 7 develop Snape more and make him a more important character, but he still remains very much in the background save for that one chapter in DH. To some extent, I understand your irritation with this, but I certainly don't think Snape was as significant a character in Book 6 and 7 as you seem to be making him out to be. In fact, I think the way JK Rowling wrapped up Snape's arc was a little rushed--I mean, a chapter of Pensieve memories to showcase his past? Anyway, to sum up, for me, Snape was a background character at best, whose character development happened mostly in the space of one chapter, and therefore, did not feel like he was 'shoved down my throat' for two books. He was just kind of there.

I don't have much to say about your problem with Snape, but as for your complaint about 'a contrived MacGuffin (The Hallows) arc to save Harry's ass', this is debatable at best. At least if your intent was to say that the Hallows were what enabled Harry's survival. If not, just disregard the rest of this post.

There's been a few theories floating around about how Harry actually survived, because JK Rowling's explanation of it in DH had a somewhat unreliable feel to it (was it a dream? Was it all just in Harry's head? Was Dumbledore actually there?) But I don't believe that the Hallows had anything to do with Harry's survival at all, nor do I believe that JK Rowling intended for this to be the case. The Hallows had no real power over death. They seemed to me more a symbol of understanding and accept death. They were not there for the purpose of allowing Harry to survive, but rather, they paved the way for Harry to accept his inevitable death.

Now, I'm coming up with this analysis as I go, so this is probably not going to make much sense. But first, look at who held the Hallows. Voldemort held the Elder Wand, even if he never owned it, but he did not understand death. He feared it and he disdained it. Dumbledore held the Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone, but he feared the Hallows' power. When he had the Elder Wand, he refused all seats of power, afraid that he would commit the same mistakes of the past that led to his sister's death. When he had the Resurrection Stone, he was so drawn to it, to the possibility of seeing his sister again and atoning, that he became blinded and nearly killed himself. They both held onto the Hallows, unable to give it up. Voldemort feared death, but Dumbledore couldn't let go of it. They both let their, for lack of a better word, relationship with death control their lives.

Harry, on the other hand, knowing both the mistakes of Voldemort and Dumbledore, understood that death was inescapable, and also that he couldn't cling onto the spirits of the dead. The Hallows were just symbolism for that understanding.

*** hmm. i love snape so i don't mind, but i can definitely understand how someone can be resentful of him if they don't. he's present in every book, one of which is named after him, and directly antagonises the protagonist in all of them. he's pretty much the most important adult that isn't dumbledore and voldemort, and i'd say he's more of a main character than the entire silver trio + draco. he's also one of two people, the other being the main villain, that protagonist personally identifies with. waaay more than a background character. i mean, even in CoS, where he arguably does the least, he's still the one who inadvertently teaches harry his signature spell, which harry acknowledges, more than once

**** I'd actually forgotten about that. I was thinking more along the lines of him refusing the Minister of Magic position several times.

Nevertheless, we don't actually know what the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW do. I always thought they were rather ceremonial positions, but there's no evidence from any source to indicate whether they were one way or the other. But as for the Headmaster position... well, it's not really supposed to be a powerful position, is it? You're just the leader of an institute of education. Granted, the position holds more weight given that there seems to be a very limited number of schools, but the Headmaster really shouldn't have much say in anything outside the sphere of education. I think we fans give more weight to the Headmaster position because of /who/ holds it in the Harry Potter series. I mean, when you think about Armando Dippet, do you think of him as a highly influential wizard? Because I don't.

***** Actually I would have to disagree and say that Dumbledore put himself into as many positions of power as possible that were worth while.

- Head of International Confederstion of Wizards. This gives direct global influence, regardless of it being a figurehead or not.
- Head of the Wizengamot of Britain. This gives him direct influence on laws AND the enforcement of said laws, once again regardless of it being a figurehead or not.
- Headmaster of the most prominent and influential school in all of Britain. Not only does being Headmaster give you influence to the students that he once instructed as transfiguration professor but also influences the future leaders of Britain which are the children (and their families). Commanding the respect of those in political positions simply by being seen as a guardian during their formative years could have a very real influence on a persons actions later in life, specifically in this individuals are part of the wizengamot. See where I'm going here? Playing the long game here in this position even if it is mostly just because he loves Hogwarts and teaching. I would also like to mention that a british youth representative who is under 17 yo sometimes is in the Wizengamot so maybe that could have some sort of influence being the headmaster of said youth.
- Held the Elder Wand. Weildable power to influence others into either being awestruck by his power or fearful of crossing him, an exclusion being Voldemort as seen during their battle in the Ministry.

I would say that Dumbledore wanted himself in as many adventageous positions as possible while giving himself some wiggle room by not being quoted in the papers constantly and being asked every single little meaningless decision. I would disagree that Dumbledore didn't trust himself with power. He knew how to use it and knew what positions were the best net-positive for him.

****** I think you've misunderstood what I meant by 'power'. Power, as I am referring to it, is the real, legitimate power that is given by a formal position of authority that an individual can wield, not their influence. It is undeniable that Dumbledore is influential. On top of these three positions, he is also known for his defeat of Grindelwald. Dumbledore is respected, if not revered, and he is magically powerful. But I disagree completely with the idea that this influence guarantees him any /legitimate/ power.

For your ICW point: If we assume that his position is ceremonial, then the only influence he has is through voice. His position, at best, gives him a platform for him to propose items on his own agenda, but he cannot (strictly within the confinements of the ICW, if he chooses to influence ICW members by talking them around to his point in private, etc., that doesn't count because anyone can do that--one does not need to be Supreme Mugwump of the ICW to persuade people to their point of view) enforce whatever decisions the ICW may make.

As Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot: Again, assuming that his position is completely ceremonial, which it very well might be. We have seen in OotP how the Wizengamot conducts trials, and they did not seem to require a Chief Warlock to proceed. If it did require a Chief Warlock, they would have gotten a replacement, as while the trial was ongoing, Dumbledore was on the outs with the Ministry. Either way, this position, again, lets his voice be heard, but if he has no power, then he cannot directly influence nor enforce those laws on the basis of his position.

Headmaster of Hogwarts: This entire argument relies on the idea that every child who goes through Hogwarts will respect their teacher/Headmaster. Here's a question. Do you respect the Headmaster/Headmistress of your school? I don't know about you, but Headmasters/Headmistresses of my schools tended to maintain a very distant relationship with the student body. Personally, I had no particular feeling towards them. They turned up at assemblies, and sometimes they made speeches. Sometimes they gave the student body a dressing down for doing something wrong. But at the end of the day, we rarely see the Headmaster/Headmistress. All I feel for them is a very distant kind of respect, and if I went into politics, I would not spare one thought about their opinions/views. This distant relationship between student body and Headmaster does seem to be what is happening in canon. The only student we really see Dumbledore interact with is Harry. Most students probably have other things to worry about than the opinions of a distant authority figure--like the opinions of their parents and peers. In canon, Dumbledore gives the impression that he is shaping many students' opinions because he is shaping Harry's. We only ever see the story from Harry's perspective, and thus, we're offered a biased perception of what is going on. In reality, the frequency of Dumbledore's meetings with Harry is what allows for this shaping of the mind to occur, whereas other students do not receive the same opportunity. The point is, Dumbledore's influence over the students is not as significant as you seem to think it is.

Elder Wand: Nobody knew he held the Elder Wand until the end of DH. His strength as a wizard is not being called into question here. Aside from the fact that I'd argue this is not a position at all, Dumbledore actually doesn't show off his magical power a lot. Everyone knows he is powerful, because he defeated Grindelwald, but throughout canon, we are only offered rare instances where his strength is displayed. He was always reluctant to use the full measure of his power and he rarely tried to intimidate people into doing what he wanted. Mostly, he preferred to remain genial and try to persuade others through discussion and logic--when he used strength, it was usually out of necessity. I think this is more in line with the idea that he was afraid of using his power.

******* When you look at the etymology, Supreme Mugwump basically means he's an impartial negotiator.

And don't forget how little respect Draco and his posse had for Dumbledore.

In OotP, Griselda Marchbanks mentions Dumbledore's magical prowess during the OWL Exams, stating: /"Examined [Dumbledore] personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s... Did things with a wand I'd never seen before."/

One more thing to consider about Dumbledore, relating to the last point: What happened when he allowed his own power to go to his head? He plotted world domination with Grindelwald which led to his sister dying.

******** Well, he's still very manipulative. He just isn't as influential/powerful as his positions would suggest. And none of his manipulations in Harry's life really had anything to do with the legitimate authority he could wield. His schemes were effective mainly because of his personal position in Harry's life--Harry saw him as a wise and powerful wizard who cared for him and wanted the best for him. That's why Dumbledore could influence Harry so much, not because he was Supreme Mugwump/Chief Warlock. Maybe a little because he was Headmaster.

I don't see how you can say that the Hallows had no impact on his survival. What was even the point of them then, just the symbolism?

I have trouble believing that Rowling added the Deathly Hallows just for that reason

Rowling just did a poor job incorporation the Hallows into the story, which unlike the horcuxes, appear to have been shoehorned into the plot late in the series. Maybe as late as book 6.

**** Yeah, I don't think the Hallows were very well done either. They were kind of out of the blue.

I don't know exactly how Harry survived, but the explanation offered by Rowling in DH revolves around this central fact--that Harry understood and accepted that he would die. Now, if the Hallows were in fact why Harry survived, I would think that the very fact that he owned them would be enough. He would not need to believe he would die.

I also don't think using the Hallows as a cheap way to get Harry to survive is Rowling's style. She's very much interested in the abstract throughout the Harry Potter series--she's interested in the power of love, the fear of death, regret and so on. When Harry triumphs over Voldemort or faces his trials, it's never really about how powerful he is or some OP magical item (save his wand). It's always about /emotions/: the loyalty of his friends, the love of his mother, the love Snape had for his mother, etc. Voldemort, on the other hand, relied on material items like Horcruxes and the Elder Wand. If Rowling had Harry survive because of material items like the Hallows, it would basically destroy the entire theme/story she has been building to throughout these seven books, because she has always, /always/ emphasised the defeat of evil through love and loyalty.

***** In the end Harry still survived because of his mother's love/sacrifice* and Voldemort's own mistakes (his huge ego). I agree that the hallows did not help Harry survive, but paved the way for his acceptance of the inevitability of death, and that death is not a terrible thing, or something that can be 'mastered'.**

*Harry's blood carried his mother's sacrifice which only purpose was to protect him from Death By Voldemort. Voldemort took on the blood protection and as long as he lived Harry would be tied to life. poetic justice that love and sacrifice worked just as well as Voldemort's gross and destructive horcruxes (which Harry was also Ha. HAah.)

**I just realised that 'master' of death is almost an oxymoron. And surely to master something you must face and experience it. So to be the master of death is to accept it, as Harry did. The interpretation is there to be taken at face value! But I guess we all must have epiphanies in our own time oops lmao.

** I hated Deathly Hallows too. The whole Hallows arc was such contrived bullshit totally out of left field. The last half of the book became a "quest" story in pursuit of two more chekovs guns in addition to the first seven. I thought the whole idea of Harry needing to obtain this OP artifact in order to totally defeat Voldemort was stupid as hell.

I was personally dissapointed with Snape. I was just expecting more from his character rather than just being a love-lorn puppy pining after Lily forever. But it appeased the fangirls so what the fuck ever. I'd be more okay with it if JKR hadn't tried to make that fact redeem him completely so much that Harry names his god damn child after him.

I truly think JKR was pushed for time in order to have it finished in line with filming. Or maybe there should have been eight books instead of 7. Who knows what could have made it better.

I love the HP books it was a huge part of my childhood. But I'm still bitter about book seven after all these years. It's also frustrating that there's such blind reverence for the series among fans that it's sometimes seen as sacrilegious to criticize anything about it.

** To be honest books six and seven are an utter mess. We had characters doing stupid things before (like flying a car to Hogwarts instead of waiting for the Weasleys to come back out) but the whole "He has horcruxes so let's not even try to kill him" and the "Harry has to take another killing curse for the team" plots are simply bullshit. The relationships are entirely out of the blue with little reason why they are attracted. What does Hermione see in Ron? This is until today one of the biggest mysteries I've ever read. The guy spent five and a half years destroying her sense of self worth but now she thinks he is hot because he actually got himself a girlfriend? And Harry/Ginny is not much better but sends a frankly disturbing message that you just have to be obsessed with somebody and they will fall in love with you. Things do not work that way in real life and if you reverse the gender it gets even more creepy.

The hunt was a retarded idea (just get a flat in Dublin, put it under the fidelius, dye your hair and Voldemort will not find you), Snape's regret does not wash the blood from his hands and Dumbledore' mixture of appeasement and redemption did cost many lives. If anyone with a dark mark gets executed then they could not kill again (and they did). So why are they suddenly the good guys?

It would have felt more rounded imo; Teddy is an orphan who lost both parents to Voldemort, but he has a parental figure in Harry to send him off to Hogwarts, that Harry himself didn't have. It wouldn't have shoehorned questionable marriages and children's names while still achieving the same emotional resolution.

Most (all?) good people in real life have done some bad things. Most notable people will be hated by some and loved by others, and tolerance is being able to say 'I think the good outweighed the bad (or vice versa) /but I understand that people think differently to me'/

These are, simply, misplaced expectations born from a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes Harry tick. He doesn't care about adventures, he doesn't care about making something of himself, and he certainly doesn't care that his victory was handed to him. The only time he ever applied himself throughout the course of the books was when a crisis was imminent.

All he ever cared about was being perfectly normal and living an average family life. He is the magical equivalent of the Dursleys.

Harry definitely wants to make something out of himself. Normal unambitious people aren't crazy good Quidditch players who enjoy winning and making a name for themselves. I'm pretty sure Harry thinks about wanting to make a name for himself through Quidditch, something that he's actually done himself (unlike his scar business). Nor do completely normal people want to become Dark wizard hunters.

**** He literally picked up a broom and fell into the seeker position. Him becoming a seeker had absolutely nothing to do with his own initiative, and everything to do with random circumstance and natural talent. Him wanting to be a quidditch star or an auror isn't some grand aspiration, it's him blurting out any old random thing at a career interview he didn't care about or prepare for.

Pretty much all of his great triumphs throughout the series are the exact same thing: he is carried by circumstance (mother's protection, random time travel/deathly hallow shenanigans), or by vastly more competent allies in Hermione and Dumbledore. The most proactive thing he does is learning/teaching defense in book 5, and /even that was mostly as a favor to Hermione/.

Harry has no ambition, really. He spends all of Hogwarts coasting by on the minimum amount of effort possible. This isn't a condemnation of his character, having humble aspirations is perfectly admirable, and it makes sense he would just enjoy basking in normal school life after his experience at the Dursleys. It just makes it really, really questionable that the hat ever seriously considered him for Slytherin.

And seeing as he took the classes to become an Auror, then actually became one, I'd say it isn't some random thing he blurted out.

Give me a hero's journey where Harry gets stronger (strong enough to take Voldemort on with help - I never thought Harry would fight him one on one!

The Voldemort/Dumbledore Duel. You can tell it was hard for her to write it which is why she stopped with dueling the way it was shown and dueling becomes rushed running battles where everyone is running around trying to get to Base so they can't be 'It'. Book 6 has no fights until Harry chases the DEs out and the Draco bathroom Duel was at most 4-5 spells? JK found that writing action was too hard said fuck it and found a way out through McGuffins

** I love Snape /(mostly thanks to Alan Rickman and fanfiction haha)/, but I agree with most of your points why Book 6 and Book 7 sucked. However, I don't think the books focused too much on Snape, since I absolutely lived for scenes including him. But I hated what JKR decided to do with his character in the end.\\
Before it was revealed, I vehemently DID NOT like the fan-theory that /"Snape loved Lily"/. I wanted Snape to have left the Deatheaters because he was intelligent and finally realized on his own that it was wrong, or self-destructive, or all of the other great reasons fanfic comes up with. AKA it wasn't /"truuu lurve"/ for Lily that saved Snape, but Snape coming to a realization on his own during his time as a Deatheater. AKA Snape actually chooses "good" for the sake of good itself and NOT because of sappy romance.\\
I also hated /how/ she killed Snape. I figured he would die in the end since he's a double-agent, but I wanted him to go out in a "blaze of glory" fighting a super-awesome duel with Voldemort himself. Not get bitten by a snake and die pathetically. ( because we KNOW Snape is a powerful wizard even if we never really get to see him duel a worthy opponent. )\\
I too hated how "lazy" Harry became after book 5. Hermione was the only one doing any studying or preparation for the final battles.\\
I read a lot of fanfics where Snape trains Harry to defeat Voldemort /(usually with a strong emphasis on Occlumency/Legilimency because that is my favorite branch of magic)/. Snape is a sarcastic bastard in those fics (because I hate it if he's too nice), but he does care enough and he's *practical* enough to train Harry to win.\\
I see Snape as a self-sufficient badass, and I wanted him to train Harry into a self-sufficient badass too. :) Even if they always will kinda love-hate each other with a ton of sarcastic banter. Being "nice" to each other is just too boring and unrealistic. But they can make a very badass, pragmatic team to defeat Voldy, because it is totally unrealistic to expect Harry to defeat Voldy alone unless its some kind of special Legilimency trick only he can do because of the horcrux in his brain.

I loved the horcruxes idea. I hated the Hallows, since it was definitely shoehorned into the story badly. I hated the camping quest crap. I wanted to go back to Hogwarts for a least part of the seventh year.

What about the people who wouldn't have died if Harry "I am a lazy shit" Potter had bothered with occlumency (yes, Snape was a shitty teacher and I hate the man, but that doesn't mean that Harry gets a pass...hell, why not ask Sirius, Tonks, Lupin etc. for occlumency advice or even a pureblood like Neville who might know something or at least who to ask?), more magic (he attacks Voldemort with a disarming charm! Damned, I'd rather blow my brains out than attempt that, at least this would lead to a relatively painless death while failing to kill the dark lord leads to torture and a painful death!) and silent-casting!)

Yeah, maybe the hero's journey has been done before, but it still works well (better than this contrived ending and the damned crapilogue!)

I also despise Snape and that he's suddenly important...I think Harry should have ended the man (He's the one who killed Lilly after all, even if she didn't die by his wand!
