*Additional observations:*

- Most respondents were from North America/Europe. [[http://i.imgur.com/IiIUyqX.jpg][Here's a map.]]
- The least favored pairing was Harry/Snape.
- Most favored was some variant of Harry/X.
- The thing everyone seemed to agree on was their dislike of bad writers/unfinished stories.
- [[http://i.imgur.com/i6ActHK.jpg][Word cloud of favorite characters]].
- None of this was really that surprising to me.

*Notes*: I didn't realize that SurveyMonkey was limited to 100 respondents (I ended up getting 123), but by the time I woke up, the quota had been filled. If someone wants to do a more comprehensive, better structured survey, by all means go for it. This was done on a whim.

*Edit*: For those of you interested in the results, please take note the only results I'll be posting will be age/gender. If I thought it through a little better (which I should have), I would've structured it a little differently and not so open-endedly... But I just wanted to see what people had to say, and so far the results aren't that surprising. Just a few anomalies here and there.

***** I think so, unfortunately. Some of the other countries that have just one pinpoint on the map, however, had 2-5 people. Like Canada, India, Australia, Norway.

** With a sample size of only 100, you're probably not going to get very representative results, and the margins of error are going to be quite big.
