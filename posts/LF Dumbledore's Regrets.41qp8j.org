Hey guys,

I am looking for stories where Dumbledore sees all the pain he caused Harry by either doing nothing, doing what he thought was right or by outright doing things "for the greater good" (and knowing he'd hurt people by doing so) and regrets doing so and wants to make amends! (I've seen a lot of dark Dumbledore stories, but I've seldom read stories where Dumbledore does admit that he's wrong and tries to make things right!)

I don't care if it's gen or het stories, but please:

No slash and no (well, ok if exceptionally good than I'd read them!) Harry/Ginny and/or Hermione/Ron -.- (I just don't like Ron and Ginny - I think he's a bad friend and she's just a fan-girl!)


** Oh, for crying out loud, Dumbledore gave up on the Greater Good when Arianna died. That's why he fought against Grindelwald. By the time Harry is born, his approach is better described as "Lesser Evil" --- try to minimize harm he and others do. For that matter, he regrets plenty of things in canon, and says so outright to Harry.

*** That isn't true. Canonically Dumbledore knew that Harry had to kill himself, that isn't debatable. They have an entire discussion about the fault in Dumbledores plan being that he cared for Harry and didn't want to to just be a weapon to be sacrificed.

****** If Voldemort wins, Harry dies either way. The Prophecy says it, Voldemort believes it, will not leave Harry alone, and eventually, Harry's luck will run out. Therefore, even if Dumbledore actually intended for Harry to die to make Voldemort mortal, it wouldn't increase "the bad" relative to not doing so.

However, he didn't even do that: he did his best to set things up so that Harry would get to live after all.

*** Well, call me an ass but: Not good enough! (and "the lesser evil" is just "the greater good" called by another name (he may have stopped believing in most of Grindelwald's ideology but not in that, otherwise he would not presume to know what's best for anyone or to have the right to meddle in other people's lives just because he thinks he's right!))

**** No, they aren't the same thing. It's the difference between the Minimax strategy (minimize the bad) and Act Utilitarianism (maximize the surplus of good over the bad). The latter allows doing more bad than the former, as long as it's counterbalanced by a sufficient gain in good.

Oh, and Dumbledore runs a /school/. It's a whole institution premised on the notion that trained adults know what's best for adolescents better than adolescent themselves do. The horror!

***** The thing is: HE DOES NOT KNOW BEST (Sirius in Azkaban anyone? That happened on his watch after all...or him distancing himself from Harry which killed Sirius more or less!) - grooming a sacrifice is DESPICABLE!

I know I'd probably do the same that Dumbledore did (as in sacrifice one person for the good of many others), but that does not mean I need to praise him for fucking up Harry's life (I mean come on, Harry should get tons of therapy in order to correct everything wrong with him -.-)

You might be right that in many cases they do, but putting yourself "in loco parentis" just because you can is not something that's ok (it's strange that Lilly and James didn't have any sort of last will (people in wars have those normally!) because if they did, then he surely violated it - I can't think that Lilly would want her child anywhere near her hateful miserable cow of a sister!)

He knew as well as anyone --- literally. Pretty much the only people who knew the truth were Sirius and Peter themselves, and neither of them distinguished themselves with good judgment.

#+begin_quote
  or him distancing himself from Harry which killed Sirius more or less!) -
#+end_quote

Given the unknown nature of the link with Voldemort, and given the political situation, what else could he have done?

#+begin_quote
  grooming a sacrifice is DESPICABLE!
#+end_quote

It wasn't until later that Dumbledore realized that Harry was a horcrux. Harry's Saving People Thing is all his own.

Um... The whole /in loco parentis/ thing comes with running a school. It's a package deal.

#+end_quote

Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. Lily didn't have the same reasons to resent Petunia as Petunia had to resent Lily, so maybe she was more optimistic about that arrangement. Alternatively, I would guess that the list would go as follows:

1. Sirius Black
2. Peter Pettigrew
3. Alice Longbottom
4. Frank Longbottom
5. Petunia Dursley

(Remus refused because he didn't want a child near himself.)

Now, the first one is a criminal, the second one is presumed dead, and the next two are in hiding and later incapacitated. That would leave Petunia, even though she's a distant fifth.

******* He could have actually shielded Harry from the media and from Umbridge (not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it's his DUTY he is Harry's headmaster after all - then again he didn't much care about Harry (and neither did the other professors!), after all he allowed bullying (chamber of secrets (heir of slytherin), GOF ("Potter stinks!"), Order of the Phoenix (deranged lunatic!)) and never did anything about it and it was not just Harry that was bullied ("Mudblood!" and "Snivellus!"))

Yeah, he didn't know but he should have made sure that everybody received a trial (even more so if he thought Sirius was actually guilty!)

Even if he didn't know...I'd say that makes it worse: Why did he never train Harry (no, history lessons, which could have been done in a weeks time instead of spread out for nearly a whole year, are not what I consider training to fight dark wizards -.-)?

Don't get me started on the coward wolf -.- (Sorry, but I despise Remus almost as much as Ron, Snape and Draco) who didn't have the decency to at least come by every once in a while (for someone supposedly close to James (and Lily!) he did almost everything to have nothing to do with Harry IMHO!)

No, it's not a package deal - the headmaster still has to call the parents if he needs to decide something for his students outside of his normal duties, not so with Harry!

You really think Lily would put someone even Snape (who hates Harry) probably thinks is disgusting and stupid etc. on that list? I don't agree (more so as Harry has magic so Petunia would be constantly reminded of Lily who she hates!)

#+end_quote

Skeeter got /one/ interview with Harry. After that, it was all spying; and the means it took to stop her involved Hermione, who is not as nice as Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  and from Umbridge (not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it's his DUTY he is Harry's headmaster after all - then again he didn't much care about Harry (and neither did the other professors!),
#+end_quote

At that point, it would have been a political fight he would have lost: short of going to war against the ministry, he would lose his position and not help Harry, either.

#+begin_quote
  after all he allowed bullying (chamber of secrets (heir of slytherin), GOF ("Potter stinks!"), Order of the Phoenix (deranged lunatic!))
#+end_quote

Did Harry ask for his help with any of these? For that matter, how much would it have helped? (CoS: would people stop being afraid of Harry just because Dumbledore told them to? GoF: an appearance of favoritism would have been less than helpful. OotP: Dumbledore wasn't in a great position to do anything.)

#+begin_quote
  never did anything about it and it was not just Harry that was bullied ("Mudblood!" and "Snivellus!"))
#+end_quote

I suspect that neither side actually complained. (Also, I suspect that Snape gave as good as he got; remember, we only get to see his impressions of the situation.)

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, he didn't know but he should have made sure that everybody received a trial (even more so if he thought Sirius was actually guilty!)
#+end_quote

Trial in the same system as the one that tried the Malfoys? Also, was he even a Chief Warlock then?

#+begin_quote
  Even if he didn't know...I'd say that makes it worse: Why did he never train Harry (no, history lessons, which could have been done in a weeks time instead of spread out for nearly a whole year, are not what I consider training to fight dark wizards -.-)?
#+end_quote

Harry got plenty of training. He trained for the Triwizard, he had to learn DADA material well enough to teach it, and all throughout, he was honing his reflexes and nerve and his situational awareness when playing Quiddich. During the HBP year, he had a competent DADA teacher in Snape. Over and above that, a ChildSoldier!Harry would have had more Power that Voldemort Knows Well but less Power that He Knows Not, and so would have been /weaker/ against Voldemort in particular.

Yeah, Remus didn't acquit himself well there, nor in DH.

Good point. It's only a package deal with Harry, not with others. How does that weaken my case rather than strengthen it?

#+end_quote

OK. Strike Petunia from the list. There are still four people on it --- which is probably more than most people have --- and after that, it's at the discretion of the executor of the estate (Dumbledore).
