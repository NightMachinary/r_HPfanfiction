Just as the title says:

-Preferably over 100,000 words with decent enough grammar and a decent plotline.

-I do not mind whatever pairing however I really dislike pregancies of any kind as a main plot point.

-Crossovers are fine, as well as OFC's.

-The mentor can have a laughably crude sense of humor as well.

-Two examples of this would be Make a Wish, a Black Comedy and I still haven't found what I am looking for by kathryn518.

This is kinda niche, which is why I am seeking HPfanfiction reddit's lovely assistance.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

*** I feel honestly jealous of this guy. He read "I still haven't found what I am looking" before the Havoc side of the Force. This fic is amazing and I wish I could forget having read it and do so again.

***** oh god. Prolonged life, greater physical endurance, super powerful magic... none of that compares to the ability to: at will, erase the memory of consuming an element of entertainment in order to enjoy it almost (maybe some of the subconsciousness stays) fresh again.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
