Veela, are probably based on the vila from Balkanic folklore which are the equivalent of sirens but they live in the woods instead of the sea. They are said to be spirits of maidens who died a violent death. They lure travelers at night and if someone stumbles upon them dancing are driven insane with lust. Also if they give a kiss to someone, that person will forever be their lust slave. They are immortal but they can die if their hair is cut or if they fall in love with a mortal that doesn't reciprocate their feelings.

Dementors are an original creation of JK. In an interview she said something along the lines that when she first wrote Book 1 she was going through depression and that's how she imagined depression would look like if it had a physical form. We're given a bit of a backstory for the ones at Azkaban, where a dark wizard (whose name I can never spell) was luring lost sailors to his island and would then torture and murder them. JK then doesn't go into detail but says that when the Ministry discovered the island, people were so shocked by what they found that they never spoke about it and they also discovered an infestation of Dementors.

So I was thinking what if the dark wizard was also experimenting with soul splitting and that's how future scholars, such as Owle Bullock, could write such a detailed description of Horcruxes? But the failed experiments were Dementors who were incomplete souls and constantly craved other souls. Thus they were spirits of men who died a violent death but not before their souls were damaged. That's why they are immortal as well. Of course this paragraph is my headcanon.

Thus we (edit - see) several parallels between Veela and Dementors. Both drive people insane with their presence, one through lust and the other through fear. Both have a dangerous kiss that offers a fate worse than death. Both are spirits of the opposite sex and their features are quite similar to the traditional features of these sexes. Women were traditionally associated with beauty and grace and would achieve power through seduction, while men are traditionally associated with brute strength and their control of people would be through intimidation and fear (even the height of Dementors is always emphasized). Also, unlike Veela, per JK, Dementors can't physical reproduce but they do breed like fungi in areas where they can feed on sadness and depression. To make sure I do not upset anyone, please note this is a correlation with genders viewed pre-2000s so it's not the purpose of discussion in this post.

So based on the above, I think Veela and Dementors are two halves of the same whole or maybe actually natural enemies.

Any thoughts? Or if you know of any fics exploring this aspect of magical lore, I would be grateful for recommendations.


** Great theory, it's as good as canon for me

** This is really clever, and interesting. I love to see the folklore origins and parallels of some of the features within the Potterverse.

** I feel that there is an implicit implication in the books that dementors aren't natural. Until Voldemort steals them, I think the implication is that they are only found in Azkaban, hence why the Ministry refused to believe they had attacked Harry in OoTP, as it would be their fault by default.

I can't remember exactly where, but I remember reading I think a sci-fi book where it said something along the lines of 'it is only naturally occuring if it exists to reproduce'. Dementors don't seem to reproduce and have just enough intelligence to follow very complex orders, like stand guard over Hogwarts for Sirius specifically, without being able to rebel on their own. That seems far too convenient not to have been designed.

Of course, there is a lot of flexibility in head canons when it comes to dementors, as nobody in canon knows anything about them.

*** The dementors also seem to be able to communicate as they talk to Fudge and other Ministry officials. How they do it it's unexplained but my thought was always that they could insert thoughts in people's minds like death from Discworld

** Ironically enough, I'm writing a Flowerpot fic right now where Fleur attends Hogwarts instead of Beauxbatons, and my justification for her being affected by the dementors during PoA is right along these lines.

Like Englishmen and Scots.

Jokes aside, it's an interesting idea and I like the effort and detail put into explaining it.
