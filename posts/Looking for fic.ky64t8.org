:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for the fanfiction where Harry looses the trial at the start of what would be his fifth year, which invalidates some charter and thus the ministry. Sirius ends up being interim minister while Harry goes to France(? I think so), and sends Voldemort poisoned wine to kill him.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.
