Today i accidentally deleted the entire fanfic fold I had. 50+ fics I was either waiting on updates for or was keeping to reread when I was feeling low. Chrome sucks


** You might be able to recover your tabs. In firefox, I've accidentally lost my tabs, with the normal 'restore previous session' button not working, and was able to recover them by going into the sessionstore folder and finding a file that had them. Don't know if there's an equivilent method for Chrome, but it's worth researching it on google to see if it's possible.

** I was on my phone and I've tried everything. I'm slowly trying to rebuild but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get everything back

*** OMG how do you people do everything on the small screen of a phone? The smallest size I go to is my 5x7 tablet, and I already hate how much I have to scroll on that versus my laptop.

**** I read a lot at work and dont actually own a tablet. I also read in bed and the phone is easier. Personally I find reading hunched over a laptop irritating and it kills my back

***** I keep the "lap" in "laptop." I don't hunch over my laptop because it's actually in my lap, so I'm just sitting in my comfy recliner. Reading in bed kills my back because pillows just don't give the same support. To each their own. :)

****** My lap gets to hot and cooling pads are uncomfortable. To each their own is a motto we should all practice though lol

******** I had one of those once. Ended up dropping my laptop on the floor lol. I shift constantly while reading. Kinda like a rotisserie chicken.

********* I wish I could say I've never dropped my laptop on the floor. Happened today in fact, but I blame my cat for that one.

** Sorry to hear that. I hope you get them back.

That's one of the reasons I connect to my laptop and make a copy of my files every so often. It's also why i use a downloader and retrieve the story renaming it to include the number of chapters and the date of the last updated chapter. If the story is completed then the filename is just the story title.
