Want to read some good early fics that were write before either Prisoner of Azkaban or Goblet of Fire.

Especially pre Goblet fics to see how people tackled Sirius being Harry's godfather


** Probably nothing was written pre-PoA. Harry Potter took off after it was released, plus the first three books came out very close to each other.

Pre-GoF is extremely rare. A popular one was /The Paradigm of Uncertainty/, but it takes place in Harry's late twenties anyway. If you want to find more, check ff.net for stories published before July 8, 2000.
