Does anyone have good recs of Snape/Lily fics?

- Can be short or long

- With or without smut.

- Preferably Marauders era.

- Happy plots, please!

All of the Snily I've stumbled upon have tragedy, violence and are generally sad. I would love one where they're just happy -- teenage sappy romance and all that, you know?

Can you help me? Thank you!

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
