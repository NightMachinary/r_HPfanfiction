I just started reading a fic where Harry was trans, and people noticed because the enchantment on the stairs to the girls' dorm knew her true gender, somehow, and let her through. And I thought to myself, "there's no way in hell the Founders built something that sophisticated for a hacked-together stairs enchantment that just needs to mostly seem to work." And then I realized that a stairs enchantment would be a great target for a budding hacker at Hogwarts to screw with. It seems like it must internally be pretty simple, it hasn't been given a firmware update in centuries, and it gives immediate feedback on whether you've tricked it or not. If I were a Hogwarts student, I'd spend hours fuzzing that thing.

I'm envisioning a Harry who:

- Happily obeys sensible rules, unless anyone tries to force him to.
- Takes any kind of barrier (with a few reasonable exceptions) as an invitation to try to get around it
- Avoids the third-floor corridor, until he finds out it's locked, at which point of course he has to go in. What, did they think a pathetic lock like this could stop him? [gets out lockpicks and/or alohomora]
- Starts encrypting letters when he finds out Umbridge is intercepting mail (assuming an earlier divergence hasn't prevented her teaching)
- Wants to go into cursebreaking, because screwing with enchantments is fun, and who wouldn't want to do that for a living?
- Tricks the stairs enchantment into letting him through

  - Using advanced conjuration and/or occlumency and/or ward construction that he only learned for the purpose, and that's not even taught to most seventh-years
  - And then he goes straight to McGonagall and reports the bug, without first doing anything evil or even annoying with it.
  - And he's in an especially joyful mood for the rest of the week because he outsmarted the Founders' enchantment.

- Uses the best memetic agents available (like annoying, catchy songs) to hit back at Voldemort over the scarcrux connection

The most obvious way to write this is as a crackfic. Hackers seem to really enjoy life and have great senses of humor, and I'd expect that to translate to a crackish tone. But I guess there's no reason you couldn't be more serious about it if you wanted.

** "So, this is how I would do it:" Harry announcement as he somehow conjured a whiteboard into existence.

"It's pretty clear from the whole setup that the cup has /very/ limited writespace available. Like, have you seen how many enchantments that thing has active at any one time? A lot of those barely skirt the Weasley Sapience Limit too, with the number of tasks they're expected to perform per operation-"

"Excuse me, Weasley Sapience Limit?" A member of the crowd asked.

"Yeah, a neat little enchantment feature that's useful for determining if you're dealing with a smart enchantment or an embedded Conjured Intelligence. Basically, the more energy-intense and conditional the enchantment is, the more likely it is to evolve a governing intelligence over time. Also, stack two or more heavy duty cognition-focused and decision-supporting enchantments on top of each other and you accelerate the process exponentially. Great for farming Conjured Intelligence systems to run circles around magical security systems. Now, back to why this isn't my fault." Harry finished as he wrote WSL on the whiteboard in red highlighter.

"Basically, the cup's running so many super-powerful enchantments at the same time that it's got a dedicated subroutine embedded in the very clay that keeps the cup at room temperature. If it didn't, then you'd be able to run a steam engine with this baby as a fuel source. The side effect of that is that there's simply no physical space left to accommodate more enchantments, as old school enchanting from this thing's day required for an area of the item to be seeped with the magic containing the enchantment's operating instructions and, well, the caster hit his limit at about 15 security iterations at a guess. That also means that storage space for data the enchantments use to make decisions is also limited, since long term data storage requires the enchanted object to imprint the data somewhere on its inner surface. At a guess, that's about ten lines- 3 contestants, 3 judges, 2 independent arbiters and 2 backups for both judge and arbiter should they die when carrying out their duties, if that book on the Triwizard wasn't lying." Harry took a sip of water, underlining ~10 lines of data left! Next to an equation that was the bastard child of algebra and numerology it presented itself as. Professor Vector had to be potioned by Poppy when she began foaming at the mouth at the sight of it.

"Now a not so very well known fact is that the goblet of Fire is, at its most basic level, meant as a conflict resolution tool first conjured up back when trial by fire was still a thing and most diplomatic tensions were resolved in a duel between champions of causes, factions, tribes etcetera. It was built with impartiality in mind. Basically, you put the names in and the cup magically sets up everything-the tasks, the rules, the times and the conditions. It made the Triwizard Tournament possible because nobody had the privilege of setting it up in their favor. Only a consensus achieved between all five judges & arbiters could tell the cup to modify certain variables, which was its true means of encouraging cooperation- if anyone dissented on, say, the lethality of the tasks, the cup forced the tasks to go ahead as initially designed, which is how you get total contestant kills cropping up on the regular throughout the tournament's history." Harry said as the crowd started murmuring. More importantly, the Hogwarts contingent started taking notes.

"Now then, to how I would have set it up. A simple query spell is designed to disgorge all the essential data and processed information onto a scroll like this:" He said, writing 'verificatio' along with providing standard wand positioning notation next to it. He then went up to the Goblet and mumbled 'verificatio' at it, causing the device to light up with purple flames and chuck a heavy-looking scroll at his head. "Ow. Blasted thing." He muttered as he unfurled the scroll and pointed out a section near the top. "Here we have the current setup. Type-Contest, Task-based, Name-Triwizard Tournament, all very normal. Contestants: 1-Fleur Delacour, 2-Victor Krum, 3-Cedric Diggory. Notice anything? Don't worry about that for now. Judges: 1-Albus Dumbledore, 2-Igor Karkaroff, 3-Olympe Maxime. And finally; Arbiters: 1-Barthemius Crouch, 2-Harry Potter, @test.Hogwarts@Status:Contestant." He finished as the muttering grew louder. "For those unfamiliar with enchantment output terminology, that makes me a dummy contestant testing the integrity of the system by means of completing the tasks at hand. Now compare that one to a reading I took during the night the cup was somewhat accessible..." He said, breaking out another scroll and opening it up for all to see. "Can anyone read what it says? Hermione, would you like a try? " He asked floating the scroll over.

"Umm..." The girl said, opening it up and going down to the Arbiters' section "Arbiter 2 is... Bertha Jorkins?" Hermione said with a frown. "Isn't she missing?"

"Precisely. More importantly, Bertha Jorkins has admin rights as an Arbiter, able to look after the whole tournament even if everyone else dies. So if you were to, say, get ahold of her pass-phrase, you could set out to replace Bertha Jorkins with whatever person you wanted. Why, you could even rig the selection process to have Harry Potter come out instead of Cedric Diggory and nobody would ever know! Hell, it would take less effort that way." Harry explained as he took another sip of water. "Sadly, I don't have that pass-phrase, so I have to do it the old fashioned way." He said, pulling something from out of his pocket.

"Umm, is that a taser?" Justin Finch-Fletchley asked. "Because that looks like a taser."

"Well spotted Justin. Now, all you need to brute force yourself to admin rights is to convince the Goblet it's been struck by lightning. You can't use a wand, but if you take this taser and shove it just so-" He finished, punching the device with the taser's business end, causing arcs of electricity to fly into the ceiling "That does a good job of simulating such a thing." Harry pulled the taser away and tapped his wand against the rim of the Goblet. A jolt of electricity arced into his wand, causing Harry to flinch. "R-r-right. Administrative rights, ye shall be granted to Missus Isobel Melody Stacked. Isobel commands thee, remove test subject Harry Potter and instate Independent Arbiter Jacques Chirac in his stead!"

The Goblet flared up in a rainbow-coloured fire before a quiet 'ding' was heard, causing the note containing Harry's name to burst into flames and a very bewildered French President to drop into Severus Snape's lap. Said President immediately started cursing so harshly the Beauxbatons contingent ducked under the table.

"Now, before I go back to my year and beating some sense into the idiots who think that I would sign myself up for this shit, I will leave you all with a simple message: if you want to get into a hacking contest with me, my club's open on weekends and Wednesday nights. You try and pull this shit again though? I will find you and hack your enchanted underpants to boil your gonads as you walk, be they on the outside or the inside. I'm literally magic Hacker man, don't try me! Potter out!" He said before vanishing in a puff of smoke.

"What the fuck was that?" Barthemius Crouch asked Dumbledore.

"He voudrais bien savoir, moi aussi." Chirac opined.

**** No. Harry Potter was not raised by RMS. HP is the magical equivalent of RMS!

Through the sharing of new magic's fundamental calculations and notes and using distributed spell casting, he and his friends will CRUSH the magical fascist Deatheater scum! Through the power of much tested friendship, a lot of hard and boring arithmancy and splintered fingers from wand and staffmaking trial and errors, together they must succeed!

Why did magic get so tangled up in itself? Spellmakers have been greedy, selfish and short sighted. Wizards and witches are paranoid and secretive on top of that. Families keep their home grown magic to themselves. Magical sects and cults keep their own council. Wand and staff makers only pass on their knowledge to carefully hand selected pupils who are magically sworn to secrecy with powerful bonds. On top of that, much of the original artithmantic formulas for many spell and much magic has been lost to time, negligence and burnings by both muggles and magical alike.

Is it any wonder that when Harry asked his arithmancy teacher for the spell source for the simple Lumos and she rebuked him and wagged her finger at him that he got upset, not only for himself but for his friend Hermione, whom he knew would also be very interested?

When Ron damaged his wand and Harry came with him to ask Ollivander to teach them how to fix it they got a stern talking to. While Ron seemed to be chastised, Harry was pissed off. He would get to the bottom of magic, and NO OLD FINGERWAGGERS WOULD STAND IN HIS WAY! And whatever he would learn and make, he would share!

Much carfuffle, finger wagging, raised eyebrows, stern talking to, dangerous proprietary guilds and Deatheaters who are furious on principle that this weak and pathetic new kind of magic is taking root in the muggleborn community!

** The people in Harry's dorm must've thought he was insane the night after the 'incident'. In-fact, most rightly could've called him off his rocker. When Harry had stormed into the clinic of the school, and professed that he'd heal an amnesiac patient with Alohamora, absolutely nobody believed that boy could do it.

Now, Madam Pomfrey was never one to take a student's life with such casual disregard, and yet, for some innately, borderline loss of sanity reason, Dumbledore had suggested that they see just what Harry was about to do. Now of course she didn't stand by in this, but when she saw what Dumbo was willing to try if she didn't follow the order... Well, let's just say she was leaning over Potter's side, even as all of Gryffindor house did much of the same.

Harry sat beside the poor Neville, who had taken a bludger to the head in the Common Room after one of Harry's less... Successful experiments. The boy was staring at him with wonder, confusion, and perhaps the slightest fear. Harry gave this no mind, as he lifted his wand, and placed it to the side of Neville's head.

"Alohamora," Harry whispered, giving an air of excitement as the last syllable left his mouth.

"H-harry?" Neville suddenly blurted out, "What is all of Gryffindor house doing in the clinic?"

**** There's a Ginny one with a similar concept to Magical Metamorphosis. She decides she's just one of the Weasley boys, not a girl (I think Molly refuses to entertain that "nonsense"), quite early on. At Hogwarts, she sleeps in one of her brothers' dorms until discovered by an authority figure and when sent up to the gjrls' dorm, the stairs collapse, which she takes as total vindication. I think it was Ron's dorm and the other boys were confused but mostly accepting?
