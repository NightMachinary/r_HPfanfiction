OOTP, where after scaring the Dementors, Harry does not wait for the letter from Dumbledore and decides to run away or fight with the Aurors.

Or else, a colder Harry arrives at Grimmauld place, he has no patience with Molly and does not forgive Ron and Hermione for ignoring him. I've read "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade cause]]", very good, by the way.
