I know it is for plot reasons that JK Rowling put peter pettigrew as the keeper of the Fidelius charm. But then, what made Sirius and James be suspicious of Remus? I'd love to read a fanfiction that explores the development of this suspicion. I'll read any ships (though I have a soft spot for Wolfstar)! Have y'all got any recs?


** The Colour of Everything by FloreatCastellum seemed to be going in that direction, but it's on hiatus

** You're reminding me to update this. They're only starting to get suspicious so far, but things will get worse because it's a canon-compliant story about Remus.

** I'd love to read more of this as well! I've got two recommendations that feature this, but the main plot goes into different things. Both are wolfstar and the second one is explicit so mind the tags.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/84554]]) Years of the Rat is a pretty good one. A longer one-shot at 23k words, takes Wormtail's perspective throughout Hogwarts years and beyond.
