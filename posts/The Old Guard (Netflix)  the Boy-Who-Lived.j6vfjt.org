[inspired by mistakenly reading a prompt yesterday]

Andromache woke with a start. Her dreams had been filled with red eyes and a jet of green light... and then the cries of a child.

For all her time in the world, being shot, speared or burned - she had never sensed death so close... And the visions that came to them of a new immortal had never ever showed them a child.

The visions cut off a day later - not to return for nearly 16 years... During that time the Old Guard continued their work across the world - as mercenaries, bounty hunters, rescue specialists... But once in a while they would get flashes - visions of enormous snakes and poison burning through veins, of immense despair and sudden happiness and finally - a sense of absolute victory.

The first time Harry stepped outside of Hogwarts wards without the horcrux in his head, he suddenly found that he could feel a tugging - a desire to meet someone.

A group, that just like him, would not die.

TL/DR : Harry is one of the immortals like Andy and the rest of the Old Guard. The wards around Privet Drive, Grimmauld Place and Hogwarts kept them disconnected, but once he finishes with Hogwarts, it is finally established and he joins the team of unkillable mercenaries, bringing a bit of magic along.


** Quick update : as I trawled the internet, I found this: [[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/who-plays-steven-merrick-in-the-old-guard-on-netflix-47610708]]

The villain in The Old Guard is played by the same actor as Dudley Dursley!

New headcanon for this mashup: Dudley, knowing that magic is real but sealed away from muggles, becomes an immoral pharmaceutical CEO bent on finding 'special' people and extracting what makes them tick.

*** Harry Melling, I somewhat suspect, is going to turn out to be the standout actor from the cohort that got their start as child actors in Harry Potter. He's got /skills/.

Be really cool if he ends up playing The Doctor like his granddad did.
