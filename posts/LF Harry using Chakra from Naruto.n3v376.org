Could be any one of these options. 1. Harry just discovers chakra for some reason and tries to copy techniques from Naruto. He could even see Naruto on TV and decide he wants to learn Ninjutsu or something like that. 2. Naruto gets a cache of Ninjutsu knowledge, either from his mother, father, or an abandoned house, because the fandom really loves those. 3. Harry gets the memories of one of the shinobi, can even be a character inserted as Harry, or one of the Wizards.

I'd prefer a focus in the Wizarding world, but if Harry moves to/is reborn in Naruto world, it's alright. But I don't want a mix of two worlds. No missions to protect Harry, and no Order going to the Naruto world to find Harry. Just one world.

Thank you.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.
