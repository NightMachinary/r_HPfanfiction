I recently watched Joker, and I was wondering if there any fics with an unhinged MC, or a descent into madness?

EDIT: Dark, serious fics, like the new Joker movie.

  A certain young wizard ends up at 4 Privy Drive instead of 4 Privet Drive. He is raised with loving care by a cuddly Merc with a Mouth. WARNING: now with 19.96% more Death Eaters and a Rodent of Death.

** The two links I have on hand:

linkao3(7322935) - Wrong BWL, Harry bites off more than he can chew and he's enjoying the ride until he's not. Basically. It's long and dark but it ends happy (sort of), which may not be what you want, but throwing it in anyway because it's good.

linkffn(4025300) - MC (Hermione) isn't dark, but /everyone else/ is.

Not /quite/ like the new Joker movie, but each well-written, coherent, and suitably dark, I'd like to think.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

** linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm) might be almost perfect for you.

It's also definitely not crack or a comedy despite the description of dark humor.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
