With Portkey's failure, I'm looking to archive other small fanfic sites, and I just wanted to hear if people have suggestions for sites I should get. I'm not discriminating against pairings or characters, so just throw all the sites at me that aren't FFN or AO3.

Sites already on my list:

- [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/index.php][Hex Files]]
- [[http://hpfandom.net/eff/][HPFandom]]
- [[http://harrypotterfanfiction.com/][HarryPotterFanfiction]]
- [[http://walkingtheplank.org/][Walking the Plank]]
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][Ashwinder]]
- [[http://patronuscharm.net/][PatronusCharm]]
- [[http://potionsandsnitches.org/][Potions and Snitches]]

Sites I can't currently archive:

- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/][Fictionalley]]
- [[http://sugarquill.net/][Sugar Quill]]


** In terms of archiving, you might like to also take a look at Ao3's Open Doors project and see if they've already started work on any!

*** Yeah, Ao3 has already announced they're working on HPFandom and the Hex Files: [[http://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/5386]]

I don't know how big those archives were, but they have almost 200 [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/hpfandom][HP Fandom]] and 3500 [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/thehexfiles][Hex Files]]

** You may like to speak with the folks over at the Granger Enchanted Survivors facebook page who have collected a great number of works that were thought lost when GE went dark. I am sure they would welcome the opportunity to find a new permanent home to house the collection

** If Ashwinder ever goes down, make sure to hit me up and any other SSHG fans (like on LiveJournal). I have quite a few downloaded onto my Dropbox. I know other lost SSHG fics are still floating somewhere because of downloading/uploading (like Tiger, Tiger which is now 'hosted' on a Gdrive folder).

Edit: It looks like on HP Fandom that they're already looking at merging with AO3, so you might not need to archive that site. Also Hex files. And the move is already in progress. [[http://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/5386][AO3 Announcement]].

*** Yeah, I've already got most of the big SSHG fics that have already gone. Haven't actually read them yet despite being a fan of the pairing, but they're on my to read list. (Although that's over 300 fics long currently...)

I'll still get HPF and Hex Files, just for safety's sake in case things are lost in transition, but I'll give priority to the others.

**** Hi there, I appreciate your very busy, so there's no rush if you haven't gotten around to reading my PM regarding PORTKEY. Thanks for all of the work you are doing in relation to archiving fics for people. It is incredibly generous and so very useful.

***** One other suggestion might be Fiction Alley, although it is still going strong, with the demise of Portkey, we can never take anything for granted I'm afraid.

*** At this point it basically just means downloading them all to my hard drive (previously using calibre and fanficfare, but now using httrack since calibre keeps crashing on me) and being able to share stories with people who are looking for missing fics from deleted sites. Given that I only aim to download the actual fics and not the whole website, I couldn't create a mirror site even if I knew how, but I'm not opposed to uploading the folders somewhere for people to download.

******* Currently I obtain a list of story links, put them in a txt file and use httrack to download them all. Worked fine for patronuscharm but seems to be downloading more than just the links I gave it when I started on walkingtheplank stories. Not sure why but as long as I get the stories then it's fine. (Although kind of annoying given that when I tried to use it to mirror an entire site all I got was the index page.) New to using it so still figuring it out, but seems to be serving my purposes so far. It and wget were what kept coming up when I googled how to download whole websites, and I can't figure out wget for the life of me so for now httrack seems best.

********* html. I really don't like txt files. But I'm getting the printer-friendly versions which strips out most of the extra crap and leaves only the story text, so file sizes aren't too huge.

********** I was searching for one of my favourite fics from Portkey, and stumbled on the site. Never came across it previously. Might be potentially worth archiving the stories. [[http://fanfic.potterheadsanonymous.com/viewstory.php?sid=118]] Another suggestion could also be fanfictionauthors. Both are still up and running, but this portkey business has shaken quite a few people.
