Just looking for a fic where Harry's grandparents (either side) play a large role- whether because they raise him after his parents' death or something else. (I do think it'd be a cool parallel to Teddy to have Harry raised by his grandmother though.) suggestions?


** My [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11859282/1][Linkffn(darkness ascendant)]] has Harry's paternal grandfather's ghost in the story, acting as a mentor.

Edit: oh, and my permanently on hiatus story had his maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather in it with a potential love interest between the two.

edit2: since the bot doesn't seem to be working for this one

***** Dude just look at the sidebar on the Reddit page, under fanfiction bot there are the variations and none are capitalized, plus my one worked and your's didn't. Maybe you just got lucky, it has almost always worked for me lowercase.

****** And I just showed you LITERAL proof that caps L at beginning WORKS. The original had three Fs in it that I then edited and used the refresh command. Then when that didn't work, I posted the link version.

Also, the word is yours, not your's.

******* Okay my mistake, yeah editing never works for the bot it has to be right the first time or in a reply. Also I can't believe I made such a stupid grammar mistake, thanks for correcting it :).

** I'll have to look it up, but there is a fic where he is raised in part by his grandparents portraits. Is that what you are looking for?

**** I remember a story kinda like this. I remember it was Lunar Harmony, and involved them living with some combination of Sirius, Luna's parents, and Hermione's parents. Does that ring a bell for you?
