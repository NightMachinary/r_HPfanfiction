... or any competent adult really. I think it'd be hilarious to see them handling tasks designed for 17-year-olds.


** It'd be lovely to see the whole 'forced to compete' thing. Here are some other nice ones:

- Snape
- Moody
- Peter Pettigrew
- Barty Crouch Jr.
- Dobby
- Ron
- Ginny
- Grindelwald
- Tom Riddle
- Dolores Umbridge
- Hagrid
- Sirius Black

Hedwig would crush those puny wizards. I think there is actually a similar story. Now to find it....

***** Hedwig is in fact a Champion of the Triwizard in my story. (There are 6 champions, Viktor being the only canon one. The other ones are Gabrielle, Viktor, a conceited Weasley, Hermione, and a evil Hufflepuff. Yes, Olympe Maxime is losing her goddamn mind; Karkaroff isn't for the simple reason that he's dead, and his replacement as Durmstrang Headmaster was killed by the evil Hufflepuff in the name of a reluctant Grindelwald. It's complicated. And preposterous.)

But yeah, I do also recall seeing talk of a Champion Hedwig elsewhere, I think as a one-shot.

Be prepared for rampant craziness. Though I didn't start it with this in mind at the time, this story is more or less about doing to the /HP/ universe what /Squirrel Girl/ does to the Marvel Universe.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  Hermione realizes that some nonsense will inevitably befall Harry on Halloween 1994 and decides to soften the blow by inviting two more unwilling Champions to the Tournament: Peter Pettigrew and Tom Riddle. [Parody. Crack. Oneshot. Ron, Dumbledore, and Fudge bashing.]

  In his dreams Harry discovered Voldemort was going to attempt to get him into the TriWizard Tournament. In retaliation he tricked the Goblet of Fire to emit the names of the people who wanted him in the tournament. Four names came out, including Albus Dumbledore. Now the new Supreme Champion is forced into the tournament. See how he fares. Dumbledore!Bashing.
