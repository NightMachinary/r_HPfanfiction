57 out of ~200 countries in world today allow polygamy: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_polygamy]]

Harem is part of reality for people or HP fans from those countries. In addition, polygamy in China was only abolished after the Communists took over in 1949. As an expat who had worked in China for many years, I had very close encounter with legacies of that tradition there. Despite being outlawed, many powerful or rich men there still take multiple lovers in long term relationships. Chinese literature never shies away from that topic either. The most popular author in China, Louis Cha ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong]]), probably sold as more books, including bootleg copies, as JKR. The (male) heroes in his books often, but not always, marry multiple wives.

I don't think harem stories are a thing only cooked up by teenage wank. Significant readership of the HP fandom comes from countries where harem is NOT seen as morally repugnant.

--------------

So the question becomes whether a harem setting is plausible in (magical) Britain. If the overarching goal of the society was to grow population, then I'd say it could be possible. Powerful wizards would gain the privilege of getting a harem, while less powerful ones would have to settle for monogamy or even Muggles. However, this implementation of harem would be highly disadvantageous for witches, and since witches were nearly as powerful as wizards, I doubt they would put up with this kind of things. It also put majority of wizards at a disadvantage, and they would have every incentive to reject such system.

Canon universe stated a female Minister of Magic as early as 1717, long before any female Muggle Prime Minister. It meant that witches were influential and powerful in Magical Britain. Canon Hermione and Ginny were highly jealous and violent persons. I shudder to think what would happen to their competition if these other girls made moves toward their guys. They would never ever share their love.

I think you're missing one crucial factor: the harems that appear in HP fanfiction have no material relation to actual polygamous forms of marriage in historical or current cultures.

** Despite the fact that there are SOOOOO many fics out there that operate on the thought that the Wizarding world was/is as oppressive to women as the Muggle one has been, historically speaking, there's not really much evidence for it. Thus, I don't think Harem societies would ever actually be a thing. Like you, I think witches would never put up with that kind of crap.

If, on the other hand, we were talking strictly poly-amorous relationships, that would be something else altogether. I don't think it's necessarily outside the realm of possibility for them to want to "share their love", just that it would be so gendered.

Edit: Also, I think that Harem is pretty much all teenage wank/adult rich man wank.

There are others. Millicent Bagnold (who was /minister/). Griselda Marchbanks. Gwenog Jones. Betty Brathwaithe. Madam Edgecombe. Rita Skeeter (who is employed as a journalist and therefore counts as one, regardless of what you consider to be journalism). Celestina Warbeck. Probably more whom I forget.

Celestina, Edgecombe and Rowena Ravenclaw have families. Not too many male characters have families, either.

Only known stay-at-home mums are Petunia and Molly. Just because Lily and Augusta's professions aren't mentioned, doesn't mean you can assume they're not working.

**** Well of course, because that's the world we live in and the world she's familiar with.

However, as far as the character and the tone of the books themselves, it's pretty apparent that it's meant to be equal between the sexes, since the platform for inequality in these books are based on blood status.

But honestly, I never thought of the only women as just staying home to raise kids instead of working, I just figured they were unnamed, just like there unnamed men working. Keep in mind too, that of course a lot of women are going to be teaching, because Rowling did try to make it more equal, and the only way to do that in a setting at a school is to make a lot of women teachers.

****** As far as Molly getting a job during the school year, we don't know either way really.Personally I doubt she's actually employed anywhere but its entirely plausible that she brings in some extra income in other ways. For example, they live out in the country and have a largish garden, perhaps she grows stuff (like potion ingredients or simply food) to sell at market. We know she knits sweaters every year for Christmas, perhaps she spends her time making hand-crafted goods to sell. Just because she's a stay-at-home-mum doesn't mean she doesn't contribute to the family's income in ways that, historically speaking, lots of women from low-income families often would.

As far as the teachers go, we don't actually know a lot about most of them outside of the classroom. Some of them may indeed have families that we don't know about. In some cases they may have had families at one point but lost them to the rather bloody war their society suffered from.

**** I think you're considering this is a rather Muggle way. In the Muggle world your job is considered a major indicator of your capability, intelligence, ambition, status, power, etc. This seems to hold significantly less so in the magical world. Molly Weasley being a housewife didn't stop her from killing one of the most powerful and dangerous witches in Britain. And the job which seems to indicate the greatest ability with magic is teaching, which is relatively low in terms of status/political power.

** Since polygamy has been outlawed in Britain for so long, I feel like trying to incorporate it into the HP series would remove the Britishness of the story, and Britishness is one of the core features of the thing.

Not that you couldn't write a good fanfic that incorporated the concept, but you'd need to do a lot of worldbuilding just to get the reader to accept the setting before you can even tell a story in it.

*** Sorry, but I think /Firebird's Son/ does a terrible job of it. The characters claimed that the reproductive role imbalance was a pressing issue but few of their actions matched that. And what I read of it didn't quite match "female-dominated" as much as I would expect.

Increased homosexuality, decreased emphasis on romance, and serial monogamy are alternate ways to address a gender imbalance on a social level. Interbreeding with Muggles, aromantic sexual intercourse, artificial insemination, adoption, and possibly magic offer ways to address the effects of a reproductive role imbalance on population size and access to pregnancy for those who want it, and some of those solutions grant a reasonable chance of having magical offspring.

If the imbalance is toward people who bear children, you don't need to worry about population size so much -- a population that's 70% female will have 40% more offspring than one that's 50% female, all else being equal. If it's the other way around, well, I don't think I've read a fic like that, but population size becomes an urgent concern.

*** I think I would have liked Firebird's Son a lot more without the harem aspects, actually. Or if that portion had been turned down a bit. Intentional or not, harem fanfiction does have a bad habit of devolving into something that sounds an awful lot like wish fulfillment.

It felt like "Let us take a break from the interesting parts of the story while Harry appeases this erupting volcano of female hormones with his super virile male body, for only he is manly enough to sooth the raging vaginas surrounding him."

** We must keep in mind that is is a generally considered theory that the magical world is a bit "behind the times" when compared to the muggle world. Because of magic, there has been less need to push certain types of progress forward and as such, changes come slower more often then not, and things like gender roles, and sexual/marital/partnership changes are included in that.

Its therefor perfectly reasonable to see harems or similar situations as a part of magical society, in Britain or otherwise. Although personally i find Poly relationships more likely in terms of being accepted and practiced in the wizarding world.

Throw in the fact that magical power can equate to "strength", "attractiveness", "success", or the ability to provide and support, and it becomes even more likely that such a person could pull in multiple members of the opposite sex quite easily should it be acceptable in the society (or even if its not).

There are other components as well that could play a factor.

One such example would be an imbalance of wizards vs. witches. There are multiple possibilities for this. More likely possibilities such as gender roles in such a society, meaning more men die then women (due to fighting, dangerous jobs, and more), leading to an imbalance in the sexes and less wizards then witches. Or less likely possibilities such as the mixing of veela blood into the wizarding world leading to more women born then men.

I could drone on but I think I have made the point that the combination of the Wizarding world advancing slower then the Muggle world in culture, gender balance, and other such aspects, combined with unique situations within the Magical world, could easily lead to the acceptance (even if its not common) of Harems or groupings of a similar type. More then likely the acceptance of Poly relationships if nothing else.

*** Not necessarily, although canon Wizarding Britain sucked in many ways, it didn't seem to have the Muggle racism or sexism. We have never seen any evidence of that in the Books.

Given how easily available contraceptives and magical healing were, Magicals should be more liberal with respect to sexual activities, too. In addition, with all kinds of physical altering/enhancing magic, I think they would be far more likely to use sex as a major form of entertainment.

**** We see no evidence of magical contraceptives except in fanon and considering the departure point was in the late seventeenth century--and seems to have stagnated there, we can reliably work from the assumption that while they might be a bit more liberal than at that era, the wizarding world is probably closer to the muggles of those times than our times.

** Even if it were plausible, to be honest, it just bores me. Too many fics out there, particularly crossover ones, seem to use it as a crutch to fill story time when they are done with a romance thread that leads to the protagonist sleeping with their current partner. Smutfics with otherwise interesting settings have Harry hook up with a character, them join the harem, and then there are no smut scenes with that character ever again, all you get is one with each new female that joins.

I like smut. Smut is great and fun. Smut without fluff and smut for the sake of smut get boring. When you could substitute the female for any other character in any fandom or even straight up remove them and not impact the story in any way, I just wonder what was the point.

If you design a setting in which a harem makes sense, it could be bearable, but I haven't really seen any. Even most threesome stories don't make much sense to me. A lot of writers seem to think having close friends of the opposite gender who aren't sexually or romantically involved is boring or unrealistic, and I just don't get it. I've abandoned a lot of stories that were labeled with one pairing and then had a 3rd character thrown in in the middle with no real reason. Good stories otherwise, but too many just make no sense.

** I always liked the idea that there is/was a tradition of Covens in magical Britain and the entirety of Europe (maybe even globally). In that context, a harem would be the Coven + one or more wizards, with the High Witch, the leader of the Coven, also as the leader of the harem.

But Rowling never went out worldbuilding for the question what it could mean that the "power difference" between men and women is basically non-existent in the magical world. Witches are equal to wizards in magic, but for familiarity sake (I suppose), Rowling kept the traditional gender roles. Its just one more evidence of the very thin worldbuilding done by Rowling.

So any sort of changed gender role, such as the position of a High Witch, or the role of a wizard in a Coven-harem, would have to be explored. In any case, AU's are inevitable.

*** One consequence people tend to overlook when they construct harems in HP is that if a few wizards get all the witches, so to speak, then the other wizards will marry muggles.

Obviously any harem story would have to do massive amounts of worldbuilding to withstand closer inspection. One way I did it once was to make the witch - wizard ratio roughly 10:1 - with 10 boys to a 105 girls in Harry's year (I think Firebird also did that).

Whatever solution authors think of, it always requires a shitton of additional worldbuilding.

If you make harems a status symbol - something only the richest, most powerful or most famous wizards have, with the vast majority of the people living monogamous - then you don't need to change that much. That witches are equal to wizards would make an actual harem just that more impressive.
