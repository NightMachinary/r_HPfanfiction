I have noticed in stories where Harry is training himself to take on voldemort he uses mirrors to reflect spells back at him so that he can work on his reflexes. Shouldn't a reducto just destroy a mirror or a sectumsempra just cut it into two instead of reflecting it back?


** The movies.

My stories divide it up differently than most, with some invisible, and some beams, balls, or flashes. Some spells are even designed to be seen, for dueling (so the audience can see) or targeting easier in rapid fire, and some completely undetectable for killing someone secretly.

You seem to have run into a rather silly and extreme example of this idea that spells are laser beams, or Star Trek phasers.

*** Speaking of the movies, I recently rewatched Prisoners of Azkaban and the little 'pop' sound effect when the disarming charm is cast had me laughing on the ground.

** Agreed. If spells /were/ light, there wouldn't be any dodging in duels; dueling would be more like gunfighting in that respect. If spells move so slowly they can be dodged after being cast, they must travel much slower than light (and in fact, sound, since hearing the incantation helps you dodge spells). Therefore spells merely /emit/ light as they travel through space, rather than actually /being/ light.

** I haven't seen any good fanfictions that do this. That sort of writing involves a frightening amount of misunderstanding of magic. It makes me cringe.
