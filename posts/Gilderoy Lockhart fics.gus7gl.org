For all that the character in canon is useless, I find that the fan community has a lot of fun with him. Of the fanfics I've read with Lockhart in it, these are the ones I find most interesting, in no particular order.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip][/Albus and Harry's World Trip/]] - This story starts at the end of Chamber of Secrets, but eventually it's revealed that this is an AU fic where Gilderoy was not obliviated by a backfiring wand, and while he's still a mediocre wizard, he's a genius at PR, even teaching Dumbledore a thing or two he'd never thought of. It also turns out the acheivements he stole were all already stolen from /Dumbledore/ by the people Gilderoy stole them from

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][/Oh God Not Again/]] - This one takes the Gilderoy from canon, barely changes him, yet somehow manages to make him more likeable, mostly by changing Harry's perspective on their introductory conversation. I think even Sarah1281 was surprised just how popular this version of Gilderoy ended up being. IIRC, it lead directly to the next one being written.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][/When in Doubt, Obliviate/]] - Gilderoy kidnaps Harry after the events of Halloween 1981, but just before the Dursleys take him in, and he raises him. Ironically enough, this leads to a better life for all involved.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly][/Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly/]] - Harry Potter is sent back in time after becoming Master of Death, under the impression he'd be going back as himself, but chance(or perhaps Death), intervenes, and he winds up sharing a body with Lockhart.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][/Magical Me/]] - I'm not quite sure if this one would count, but I'll include it all the same. A self-insert fic that is actually very similar to Lockhart's folly, but instead of Harry from the future sharing Lockhart's body, it has the self-insert of a Harry Potter fan basically taking over Lockhart's body, with nothing left of Lockhart beyond memories.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has him as a central character in 2nd year. He's secretly Regulus Black

there's also Tozette's SI one-shot but you need an Ao3 account to read it: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8906032]]

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  What if Lockhart after many years in St Mungo's is given a 2nd chance to forge his legend by being reverted back to an 11 year old through dark magic? Set many years after the original 7 books and the original characters will be in this fic, I will be ignoring the Cursed Child and will consider it non canon. However the children like Scorpius and Albus might make an appearance.
