A story premise that someone might pick up. If something like this exists already, link me!

The magical world looks fantastic and incredible at the first glance, but when you're fresh from the normal world and look closer, iiiiit's really not as grand.

The magical entrance to the Diagon Alley. Few bricks fastened to the Steve operated piece of plywood.

The wands, masterfully crafted are really more like barely debarked small branches with hair and feathers stuck to them with the big dollops of glue.

The Hogwarts hall? Those candles are hanging on the strings, with the pieces of cotton pretending to be clouds on the rather amateurishly painted ceiling.

Avada Cadvra... placebo. People die from the belief alone it's lethal. No wonder Harry survived. No toddler is aware it should be afraid of pretty green lights.

Oh, there is magic alright, but it's not what it was sold as, and for some strange reason, no wizard born can see this.


** AK killing through belief is kinda fresh idea.

*** Thanks.

The rest are not fresh? Were they used somewhere already?
