So many time travel stories with Harry travelling back in time and befriending Tom, saving him. However, I wonder what if:

Harry goes back in time and kills Tom Riddle when he is young, before he creates Horcruxes, before he grows powerful. Thinking that he saved the world, averted the war, saved countless innocent lives, Harry returns to his own time. Only to find out that something far worse has happened instead. Something so bad that all of Voldemorts evil deeds pale in comparison.

Not knowing how to fix things, he travels back in time again. This time to save young Tom Riddle ... from himself. And ends up fighting a war with his (slightly) younger self who does not believe one iota that Voldemort needs to live...

Their conflict escalates, quickly outgrowing just him, his younger murderous self and Tom. Whole thing turns into full scale war. Until Harry realises that horrid visage he saw in the future is literally the result of his war against himself, one trying to kill Tom and him trying to protect.

Harry realises that only way to prevent the war, to restore time line ... is to stop himself from going back in time in the first place. Even if it means killing himself ...

**** Wait... isn't the Cursed Child's plot sort of similar?

#SPOILER ALERT!!!

Where Scorpius Malfoy along with Albus Potter go back in time to save Cedric from dying by trying to get him out of the Tri-Wizard Tournament? Things go wrong as Cedric become spiteful, becomes a death eater and kills Neville, who was supposed to kill Nagini. As a result, Voldemort wins and kills Harry and the world is completely changed and Albus is blinked out of existence.

This is a good plot, however I find Cedric becoming a death eater just because he lost a tournament or embarrassed himself in front of many people quite stupid.

***** I hated the Cedric thing. The tragedy of his death lies in the fact that he was such a good person. He was innocent and had a bright future in front of him. To save him, only to make him a bad guy, means that his death was the "right choice". It takes away the tragedy. His death loses all meaning.

Bad writing right there. Especially since his death is what signalled the series leaving behind its childish wonder and delving deeper into loss and war.

****** Yes. I don't know what were JK Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne thinking when they wrote the Cursed Child. I'm almost certain they were drunk because the plot has no sense... I mean, having the Trolley witch turn into a savage lady who fought Albus and Scorpius in the top of the Hogwarts Express to avoid having them escape from the train?! Are they insane? The thing is that there were worst parts than this one. I don't know why have I read the book so many times if it is that crazy.

**** I think Stephen King wrote a book where someone goes back in time to change things and it doesn't work at all. It's pretty good and I def recommend it....it's called 11/22/63. There is a mini series on hulu based on it that is also pretty good.

***** I never quite got the big fuss about time travel in Harry Potter (well... JK probably didn't either since she created it as a solution for the conflict in Book 3 and then never brought it up again until CC, which was probably a result of her frustration with how fandom had interpreted it). It Book 3 it's quite clearly indicated that fate is rigid and your future self's actions have already influenced the past. I know it's quite a silly imagination exercise, but in my mind the fate cannot be changed. The Fates (from the Greek mythology) spin the fate of the world on a tapestry so even if you could travel back in time and try to tamper with the timeline, the Universe would still find a way to make your actions insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
