One of the issues raised in many Indy!Harry (also Dark!Harry and others) stories is that McGonagall was wrong in dismissing Harry, Ron and Hermione when they told her about the fact that Snape was about to steal the Stone.

It's often used as justification for bashing her.

...

Which I find completely ridiculous. Three 11-year olds come to a teacher and tell her about a grave danger and she's supposed to trust and believe them? Why? In which universe is that normal behaviour? The only logical thing she could do is what she did in canon. Tell them to forget about it and scold them. Think about it, they are eleven. When would any adult in the real world ever consider what an eleven year old says?

I just find that fandom cliche to be incredibly silly and not well thought out.

Are there any other not well known fandom cliches (plot points) you find outrageously stupid?

I don't disagree that McGonagall was written realistically for an older adult interacting with children, but that's also the problem. It's very much an issue that adults don't listen to children.

A troll had been in the school wandering around, something was in the forest killing unicorns, and someone had tried to kill Harry causing Dumbledore to feel he needed to attend the games. All cause for an explanation rather than an immediate dismissal.

If Ron, Hermione and Harry didn't go on their mad quest then Quirrel would be confronted by Dumbledore in front of the mirror and all would be well. She was right.

***** I agree, the trio clearly have discovered what is going on with the stone and are known to make Gryffindorish decisions like with the troll. Mcgonagall could have done a bit more than a simple "It's none of your business, put it out of your minds." She could have done a bit more ti help them understand the stone was in no danger and it was protected beyond Fluffy that they knew. Still not enough reason for the fandom to destroy her for not caring about her students. She didn't do anything wrong telling Harry to keep his head down in fifth year either, avoiding Umbridge was good advice. Harry wouldn't have been hit with the blood quill if he never got detention.

******* Dumbledore said it at the opening feast. And I think she assumed Hagrid would stay with all of them in the forest on detention.

But I've gone and looked at the relevant passage to check on what was actually said. None of them tell McGonagall they're planning on going after the Stone themselves, so they don't need the explanation you think they deserve. They're told very clearly that there's no risk to the Stone, which is a complete response to everything they tell her - and everything they /could possibly/ tell her at that time. If you expect her to explain how she's so certain that it's protected, then she'd need to detail the defences. Which, if she did that to anyone who expressed concern about the Stone, would rather defeat the point of having them.

#+begin_quote
  "He's gone ?" said Harry frantically. "Now?"

  "Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time--"

  "But this is important. "

  "Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?"

  "Look," said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's Stone--"

  Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.

  "How do you know -- ?" she spluttered.

  "Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn -- that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore. "

  She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.

  "Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, *no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected. "*

  "But Professor--"

  "Potter, I know what I'm talking about," she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine. "

  But they didn't.

  "It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot.

Because what she said would have worked on 99.9999999+% of children. It's a trope of children's literature that they go off to fix everything despite what the adults say, not a real life phenomenon. She explains that the Stone is safe, which it is, but they still choose to go behind her back and risk what they know to be extreme danger, in order to... what? They have no plan for dealing with Voldemort if he shows up, nor even Snape or Quirrell. Harry survives only because of a protection he knows nothing about.

What exactly should she have told Harry? The details of each defence? The way to beat the enchantment on the Mirror? Precisely how much information does this 11 year old need before he's able to agree that, yes, the Stone is in fact safe where it is?

One of the themes of the series is that Harry is unthinkingly brave. Or, in other words, reckless.

************ This is my last reply 'cause we're not getting anywhere.

The real life phenomena are "because I said so" and "I am an adult therefore I know what's best" not working on children of any age and adults not properly explaining things to said children. Simply asking "why, Potter, do you believe the stone is in danger could have cleared things up."

The common theme I'm seeing with those who agree with OP is "11 year old." Eleven year olds are people with thoughts, feelings and concerns and none of that should be dismissed simply because we are adults with, what we want to believe, are bigger thoughts, feelings and concerns. Just because he was 11 does not mean he didn't deserve to be assured the man who murdered his parents wasn't a threat.

Suppose that you were to tell another teacher that you'd just seen a teacher who isn't the chemistry teacher attempt to break into the room near the chemistry classroom where things like nitric and sulphuric acid, permanganates etc. are kept. Don't you think they'd at least look into it?

The problem, I think, is that she couldn't reveal that she was certain of Snape's loyalties, so the best thing to do was to feign irrationality and hope that the children would stay out it.

They actively avoided telling her anything that would cause her to act on the info, like the only thing they tell her is that someone is going to try to steal the stone, which she already knows, they didn't tell her that they thought it was happening now, neither did they tell her whom they suspect.

  *"It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was*

  *out of earshot.* "Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found

  out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He

  sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when

  Dumbledore turns up."

** What is this dumpster fire of a thread? Of course no teacher is supposed to take what students say at face value. But they are required BY LAW to listen to them and investigate if there seems to be something distressing the students. Also called common sense of protecting children.

Holy fuck, I can just see a fucktard like you just waving a child away when they come to tell you about the man that touched them. Because adults know best, eh?

Because she's one of the idiots who decided that keeping a Philosopher's Stone in a boarding school under deadly traps was a good idea. The Stone should've had nothing to do with Hogwarts at all.
