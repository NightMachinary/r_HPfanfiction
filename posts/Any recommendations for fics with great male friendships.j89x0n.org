Whether its Harry and his dorm mates or Harry and Ron. Even good marauders fics. Just want some nice jokes and banter


** *Through the Veil* linkffn(13206329)\\
Harry/Ron Bromance

Harry and Ron are drunkards, and hate their current life. They come up with a dumb plan to go back and fix things to avoid their crappy life. Seriously, when I say dumb, I mean DUMB.

Well, it works, and they end up back in year three. Except, Harry Potter wasn't born in that world, James Potter Jr was. Ronald Weasley wasn't born in that world. Ginny Weasley was. (For the people who haven't caught on, Ron was born female, so was named Ginny. No more Weasley children after that) ANYWHO, Ginny is a perfect female version of Ron back then.

There's other pairings, but they aren't totally central to the plot until the epilogue, where they go full-on crack.

HOUSE YEET REPRESENT!

  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.

*** I do have to wonder how many men are scared of two Male characters looking at each other in a friendly manner for more then 2 seconds in case someone comments “I ship it” and their fantasy of ‘two guys in a hot tub-5-feet-apart-because-they're-not-gay' is ruined

**** I mean sure but they could just say that they want to write about friendship. Shippers can be insufferable but hey shippers are just as bad. With the amount of no homo lines and outright homophobia I come across in fics I find it really weird that there isn't more wholesome male friendship.

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD. DISCONTINUED

  Harry Potter would never regret running away as a child, but two years living on the hard streets of London had taken its toll. Now almost thirteen, Harry is still struggling to survive when a split-second decision gives him a chance at happiness. But will he take that chance, or will his past haunt him forever? AU story.

** For some great friendship scenes with Harry and his dormmates check out Unthinkable Thoughts by Aidan Lynch on ff.

It is an old abandoned Drarry that is not that great, but it really shines when it comes to the camaraderie between the Gryffindor boys.

It totally helps that the author went to boarding school in the UK, he even explains some things about UK boarding schools in the reviews, which is one of the reasons why I still got this bookmarked.
