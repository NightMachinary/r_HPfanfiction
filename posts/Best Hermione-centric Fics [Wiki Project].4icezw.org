Hello everyone!

I request you all to recommend Hermione-centric fics. Please do not include fics that are specifically romances. Please see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index#wiki_hermione_.2F][Hermione ships]] for that.

Because the last Wiki thread (on Harry-centric fics) was a bit disorganized, here is a new system for recommending fics:

--------------

*Genre:* < list genre(s) that you think the fic fits into >

*Link:* linkffn(<the fic>) or a direct link

*Status:* <Complete, In Progress, Abandoned>

*Thoughts About It:* < NO SPOILERS >

--------------

Thanks for contributing.

ps: Possible genres include Time Travel, Rebirth, Sci-Fi, Dark, Horro, Western, Action, Adventure, Humor, Crack, Generic, AU, Video Game, etc.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron...and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta and Umbridge. AU, but canon-compliant.

** *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*

*Genre:* War, Politics, Action

*Link:* linkffn(10595005), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Link Here]]

*Status:* Complete

*Thoughts:* This fic is a little controversial, because it features a quite brutal/ruthless Hermione and Harry. However, it does a great job with respect to politics, strategies, and tactics. Writing quality is also very high. Ron, in my opinion, is the most sympathetic character in this fic, even though it pairs Hermione with Harry. Percy, Luna, and Victor Krum are well done too.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Genre: Pureblood!Hermione, Family, Drama

Link: linkffn(6723584)

Status: Complete, but there is a sequel that is Incomplete/Abandoned

Thoughts: Very interesting. One of the first fanfics I've read that did not involve Harry, and was also not just a romance/ship. Hermione is the Pureblood daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. It's so crazy, and unique. It feels like it's set in the early 1900s, and it really dives into the politics of Wizarding Britain reaching out and trying to gather allies with other Wizarding nations. If anyone has any questions about this, I love to discuss the one!

Link: linkffn(7775877)

Status: Complete

Thoughts: Starts out a bit clichéd, but overall I love this story. While it ends up being a HG/DM and HP/GW, there is more happening than just the romance. For a "Snape is Hermione's Biological Father" fic, I found it to be very funny and very cute.
