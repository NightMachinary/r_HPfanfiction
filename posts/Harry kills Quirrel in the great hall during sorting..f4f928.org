:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi everibody, I'm trying to find a fic I remember reading where a time-travelling Harry kills Quirrel as soon as he steps into Hogwarts as a first year because the time-travel made him ill and he is convinced he is about to die. He was arrested and sent to Azkaban, only to escape and to into hiding in a tropical island with Sirius. Does anybody know the name of this fic?


** Huh...from the title, I was going to suggest linkffn(9783629) The Trouble With Sorting Hats, that has a time-travelling Harry kill Voldemort during his sorting. But it's because he's exposed as a time traveller by the Sorting Hat, he explains what happened, and he ends up with the DADA position, so I'm pretty sure it's not the one you're after.

It can't be The Unforgiving Minute either, that goes back to the Third Task, not first year...

#+begin_quote
  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?
