** In Harry Potter and the Art of Self-Fashioning, Dumbledore thinks that Harry is evil, but a separate, lesser threat than Voldemort. This is a Neville-is-the-Boy-Who-Lived fic, but it's written beautifully (in my opinion) and the story is heart wrenching as well as interesting.

** linkffn(Full Circle by tetsurashian) is a hilarious fic about Harry and his soulmate Tom who keep being reborn and remembering their past lives when they find each other. The story focuses on them reliving the books and Harry intentionally tries to make Dumbledore suspicious. Great fic, still updates, very funny

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP

****** linkffn(11305455) has something /kinda/ similar. Harry is MoD and gets bored so he makes an alternate universe with Voldemort. It's pretty fun for most of it I think, but it's unfinished.

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!

******** the relationship in Full Circle doesn't take precedence over the story. Their relationship is like a cute old souls type relationship where they've been together for hundreds of years. As they've been together for so long, their relationship isn't angsted over or can't-keep-hands-off-each-other. It's almost like a cute elderly couple.

**** It doesn't matter that it's slash, it's a very well written and funny story. The slash element is a matter of them sometimes just being born into male bodies.
