I'm just bored and don't know what to read. I'll read anything, smut, fluff, angst, hurt/comfort, Marauders era, golden trio, next gen, anything as long as it's understandable. And that means I'm not entirely confused because of the style, language isn't a problem, my device automatically translates. It can be any ship, trope, whatever. Just give me the ships/tropes if there are any, please. Heck, at this point, I'd read the fucking Dobby/Sorting Hat fic(been meaning to experience that). I'll even read crossovers, just say what the crossover is. Please, help a desperate fanfic reader.


** linkffn(the arithmancer; rewriting destiny; one hundred sixty nine) l linkao3(the changeling; turn by saras_girl; hermione grangers hogwarts cranmer for delinquents on the run; Twenty-six; Twenty-nine; come once again and love me; antithesis; hogwarts to welcome you home)

A mesh of the best fics I can think of off the top of my head. They're all different genres so hopefully one sounds interesting to you!

I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]

The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

** Linkao3(remain in light) - One of the best fics I've ever read. I second anything by the Divine Comedian, just love their work. Linkao3(My heart is a fist of barbed wire) is brilliant too and the second one is just as good. Linkffn(ignite) Slide's work is amazing, both this trilogy and the work on the Slytherins during the war. Excellent world building.

#+begin_quote
  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.
