  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

** Linkao3(Red Sorrow) I think this fits? Harry has a half sister who was adopted by Snape when she was young (although she is also his actual daughter even though she doesn't know it in the beginning). Both have been marked by Voldemort but grew up separately. Has a lot of sweet sibling moments once they get to know each other.

This fic does focus quite a bit on father daughter relationship between Harry's sister and Snape. Also Snape is mostly in character so there is a lot tension and conflict going on.

  AU. Harry Potter was not the only one marked that fateful Halloween, and Severus Snape is given redemption in a form he least expected. When two children are Marked that night, three fates are intertwined to rewrite history. There are secrets long thought lost, however, secrets that might have the power the change everything. A Sibling!Addition AU beginning pre-PS and through DH.

** linkao3(the family evans) is a short version of "Petunia actually raises Harry". Not sure if it's what you're looking for, but the author has an unusual style that may be interesting to you.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
