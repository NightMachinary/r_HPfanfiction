:FlairText: Finished that fic! Time to celebrate! /*
:END:
Since I have no one in my direct surrounding that cares about fan fiction in general, I decided to celebrate the fact that I have just finished writing my long fic here. It is over 545k long and IT. IS. FINISHED!Roughly 5 years have passed since I started writing the story. In the meantime I've moved countries, went through divorce, went on a two year hiatus, moved from job to job, started college again and moved in with the love of my life.

The story has been with me through everything good and bad in my life. As of today, I have to let it go. No more daydreaming about scenes. No more notebooks filled with details on the story. My hands are shaking and I'm getting a bit teary-eyed. I guess this is what is feels like when your first-born leaves the nest. It's a bittersweet feeling.

So cheers to me! :) And cheers to everyone else who is currently struggling with a large piece of fiction.

Lots of love,

CypressWand

p.s. For anyone interested, it's a Harry Potter fic titled: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13222016/1/Severus-Snape-and-the-Art-of-War][Severus Snape and the Art of War]] (Also on AO3). It is a Snily! (Snape/Lily) so I am fully aware that the story won't be everyone's cup of tea. For now, I'm just here to celebrate. :)

p.s. thank you stranger for the anonymous gift! Reddit coins will probably be the closest thing to receiving royalties on this piece of fiction I will ever receive :')

** Congratulations too!

It seems that it's a time travel Sev/Lily. I have a few questions first before committing to read this long epic:

- How is Lily depicted? Is she more of a damsel in distress type or someone who contributes meaningfully alongside Severus?
- Is James bashed?
- Is Dumbledore bashed?
- Is there a standard Horcrux Hunt, or do you decide to introduce some new elements here?

Thx

*** The damsel in distress trope makes me want to vomit so I did everything I could to avoid that. She's a Gryffindor after all ;) The main line in the story also doesn't revolve around their relationship, but rather about Severus taking over Harry's position in the fight against Voldemort. Their relationship has a very natural and 'unforced' progression throughout the story (as I've been told by readers.) Their relationship is very meaningful, but they don't stick to each other like horny adolescent leeches.

There is no bashing on any characters involved whatsoever (I find character bashing to be very lame, and I don't hate James or the Marauders in general). The Marauders hold a prominent role in the story and eventually cooperate with Severus against the rise of the Dark Lord.

There is a Horcrux hunt but it's done very differently. Also, there's an entirely new prophecy. Severus is not a Horcrux himself, after all. So things had to be done differently.

Here's an overview on how I tagged the story on OA3:

#+begin_quote
  This story contains:\\
  - sexual content\\
  - Drug use\\
  - Violent scenes, including abuse\\
  - Swearing\\
  - A ton of 70s rock references that fit specifically within that time period\\
  - Historical facts mixed into the story\\
  - A slow and natural relationship progression\\
  - "Not-straight" relationships but they hold no prominent role in the story\\
  - A slow start. The story really starts rolling after the first 20 chapters\\
  - War related PTSD\\
  This story does NOT contain:\\
  - Character bashing\\
  - Rape scenes\\
  - Gore\\
  Extra:\\
  - English is not my native language and therefore it is almost inevitable that you'll sometimes encounter a word or a sentence structure written in a silly way. I try my best to avoid them and have other people read them before I put any chapters up. Keep in mind that even Rowling, who had a whole professional team of linguistic nerds behind her, still ended up with errors in her published work.

******** Yes, It is certainly partly Snape's fault that the friendship became so strained, but, that still doesn't excuse what Lily did, she turned on her best friend without having all of the details, in canon it does state that Tobias Snape (Snape's father) was a man that hated magic, that place would be Snape's home for a while, he was never really friends with anyone in his house, just acquaintances, Lily would always be his best friend, and he never left her even when his housemates surely expressed their displeasure (as i'm sure Lily's did as well).

Yes, Snape has absolutely no right to call Lily that, however, 5 years of verbal abuse at home (maybe physical) and 5 years of verbal abuse and sometimes physical abuse at Hogwarts, including the shrieking shack incident, he snapped. There's many psychological points that I could go into, how the verbal abuse at home affected Snape as a child, as Tobias Snape was Snape's first impression of Muggles growing up, and he was not a good impression, he grew up in a rundown neighborhood, no one there was a good role model, and then he met petunia (do I even need to say anything about this?).

Surely Lily could have made more of an effort to talk to Snape, she was still his best friend, if she talked to him, and kept going (but not to far) to get the truth out of him, then their friendship could have stayed around a little longer.

It is just as much Lily's fault as Snape's.

Lily does have a damn bad temper and that ensured that Snape saying that to her face would be like destroying any remnants of a friendship with a nuclear bomb to her.

I do agree that if she didn't have a nasty temper she should have and I think would have talked to Snape about it, why he called her that and what it'd mean and whether or not he actually meant it.

In the end I think Snape wouldn't have been able to cope with Lily, his best and only friend and his worst enemy getting married and would either have supported Lily as long as she was happy or gone to the dark lord.

Honestly I still stand by my decision. And I still can't possibly see how Lily could have been the most hated person for you, she literally sacrificed herself for her child to live, how is that bad behaviour.

I hope I didn't forget any points.

I love your characterization! Lily usually comes off as a flat character, but I really like your Lily. She's kind but not weak or useless. She's sassy and she has a backbone.

Dumbledore is also excellent. He's a very solid Dumbledore. The best version of Dumbledore, imo. He's not evil or manipulative, and I like that. He also doesn't always have all the answers, and I appreciate that too.

I really like the touch with Snape's mother being deaf, and Snape's mother in general.

****** Ok so I first need to make a compilation of all my ideas into one but basically

Harry is storm born aka has the power of an element (or more) (could become a magical animagus of that element) and that happens because Harry disappeared for a while and then they find him at a forest fire site (control of fire, phoenix or dragon animagus possible) or somewhere that just had a violent thunderstorm (lightning and water control, thunderbird animagus possible)

That is the basic premise

Also Trelawney is a secret Israeli sniper and in the battle of Hogwarts is dropping de's from her tower with her trusty rifle propped up on a tea pot (that's how I envisioned it) though it is not my idea but I have permission to run with the idea.

There were some other small things but basically a kind of OP!Harry but just a slight op and is a magical animagus

I'll answer to another comment on the other stuff if you're interested

******* The power of elements would be nice if it were related to the Houses. If Harry is still a Gryffindor in this story, I'd make his element fire. (Hufflepuff earth, Slytherin water and Ravenclaw air). What's Harry's reason for disappearing? An animagus is magical by default. What would be different about this type of magic? Or is it the creature itself that would be magical? Dumbledore's animagus is a Phoenix. I suppose we won't learn more about that until the new Fantastic Beasts movies come out. Would that make Harry related to the Dumbledores somehow? How is it relevant that Trelawney is Israeli? If it is relevant, how would that influence her stance on warfare in the wizarding world in relation to the war in Israel and Palastine?

I have one major piece of advice that I would give any writer (especially longfic writers) once they start they start writing their journey. Do you know how you want the story to end? Keeping the end in mind is of vital importance if you don't want to lose sight of the continuation of the story. There are way too many incredible writers out there who have never finished writing their longfic for the simple reason that they have lost track of where the story was initially going to take them. Long stories always end up writing themselves after a while. As a writer, all you can do is steer the course that it's taking in order to reach the ending you had in mind. I wrote the last two chapters of my longfic long before I finished writing the other chapters for exactly this reason. The second major piece of advice is, scrap everything redundant. There are plenty of elements in the story I just finished that may have distracted the course of the main plot a little too much. (You write, you learn.) Fanfiction has the annoying tendency to take a little too much pride in word count, and not enough in the quality of the stories. Don't fuss too much about word count. There are always bigger fish in the sea. Third by not least, write an outline. Some rare writers are complete pantsers that can glide their way through a story without as much as a character reference sheet, but they are unicorns among men. I used an actual calendar where I marked down when and what needed to happen. It also allowed me to look up historical references (as my stories is set in the 70s, it allowed me to do a lot of fun research).

Hope that helps! :)

******** Wait Dumbledore's animagus is a Phoenix??????????????? I always thought that magical animagus forms were like either impossible or like near impossible

It's not needed that Trelawney would be Israeli as it was more of an example and the main point would just be that she is a good sniper with a sniper in a window propped up on a tea mug and this is mainly just a sideplot that could be a bit humorous in the final battle. I know I cracked up when I first heard of the idea that Trelawney was a secret sniper

Harry would maybe be a Ravenclaw in my story so then the element of air, still a phoenix is possible as is a dragon and a thunderbird.. but now it opens to a few more.

I would go with Harry's element being fire too but lightning and water would fit Harry pretty well too (lightning bolt scar) but if I did link the houses to elements then it would become a bit stupid because like come on there's no way I'm giving someone the power of more elements than one because it would be too op. That would happen because if i totally linked the houses then that would happen as everyone is a bit of atleast two houses if not all of the houses.

But fire and lightning are good too so I'm still unsure about it. I don't want to take lightning and water because of linkffn(saviour of magic;harry potter and the lightning lord) fics, they both have Harry saved from the dursleys by a thunderbird and Harry becomes a magical golden eagle (i think) and btw they're great fics you should read if you haven't. BUT what animagus form would you give to Harry?

If I wrote a dragon then it would definitely be Smaug sized instead of those teeny tiny dragons that Rowling made

If a Phoenix then it would be just that, a Phoenix. Would probably give Harry a longer life span and can flash anywhere (only in phoenix form though) or should I have it so that he can flash anywhere in his human form too just so he could annoy Hermione endlessly about being able to appear into Hogwarts from outside of it's wards.

I don't really have an ending made up yet because I don't know what pairing I'm going with, at first I thought it would be Haphne but now I'm starting to wonder about Harmony and Harry/Luna and Harry/Fleur too

Idk how I'd make them other than the train ride of first year would work for a starting point for Haphne and Harmony pairings and maybe even Harry/Luna if I changed the timeline a bit with Luna being the same age as Harry...

Now I have more pro tips from writers

1. You can/should have a ”hook” somewhere at the start of a fic so that the reader starts questioning why something happened and thus are interested, I'd do this every time a new thing appears that could need that

------------------------------------------------------

1. You need to know what you're going towards at the end because it's easier to visualize the whole thing if you already know where you're going.

2. Write an outline so that it's easier to do what you had planned, no one has a perfect mind

3. Quality over quantity is a great way to start a fanfic

Did I get those right?

********* Dumbledore's patronus is a Phoenix. Meaning that if he were to be an Animagus, his Animagus form would most probably be a phoenix as well. Dumbledore wasn't a known Animagus though, but since he is the former Transfiguration teacher...who knows. :)

What exactly would make Harry a Ravenclaw? What is it about the Ravenclaw traits that would put him there? How would that affect his friendship with Ron and Hermione? Since you seem very keen on the elemental thing, to what extend are you familiar with Avatar? Do you think you could draw some inspiration from the original series?

Wizards already have a longer lifespan than the average human, and they can Apparate once they come of age. To what extend would a Phoenix help other than the ability to travel within the boundaries of Hogwarts?

Considering the fact that you don't know the ending yet because you haven't decided on a pairing, is it ultimately a romance story? To what extend does the romance support the story?

I personally prefer not to stray away too far from the original story. Hence why I would rather have Harry keep his stag patronus. Rowling is a christian after all, and many elements in her story are deeply biblical. The stag is no exception to that. Have you thought about the symbolism?

********** I don't think it has ever been confirmed that patronus form=animagus form but I really don't care that much. It would add some interest to Dumbledores character wouldn't it? I'm pretty sure Dumbledore probably did become an animagus as he was a transfiguration master after all, but I don't think that is confirmed

Idk much about Dumbledore because I haven't watched /any/ of the fantastic beasts series sadly.

I'm wondering about how to make Harry a Ravenclaw and thus far I have got one good idea on how I could do it and that I'd make Harry hide in the library from Dudley and his gang,

'and so Harry decided to do something worthwhile in the library.'

That would maybe spark a thirst for knowledge in Harry so then he would probably be in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin

Many people forget that Slytherin's are supposed to be very intelligent/smart/knowledgeable too and it is only how they use that knowledge that separates the two houses mostly.

I speculate the wizard/witch lifespan to be about 150 - 180 years with lucky guys making it to 200 so a phoenix animagus could maybe become 220 or something that is around that age, unless of course they die of another cause.

Also Harry's phoenix form could help him go through all anti apparition wards which could prove useful.

The romance is not the main point of the fic and it would only open up a few avenues for Harry in the fic, but the reason I can't make the ending clear yet is because I want to do a bit of a similar ending to your fic and linkffn(harry potter and the lightning scar) basically harry gets married and gets a few kids and then they get a lot of grand kids and then Harry dies a peaceful death and has changed the world a bit.

I prefer to change the original story a bit, sometimes a lot like for example I hate Hinny with a passion and would love to see it burn to be non-existant

I would change Harry's patronus depending on his personality so that it matches him well

No I haven't thought much about the symbolism but now that you point it out it does seem kind of obvious.

********* Be careful with the 1st year thing by the way. I've seen many potentially great stories left unfinished because the main character ended up in the 1st year (time travel or otherwise). Stories start to drag really fast if they have to make it through every single year. Writers often forget that it's much easier to start the first chapter right in the middle of a scene. Readers are much more easily drawn into it and any required explanations can always be secundary.
