:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fanfiction where harry and Voldemort soul bound destined to live life after life with each other in there life one way or another whether that was mother and child(eather could be a female in there next life) or significant other they always where together SOMEWAY. I think harry was master of death. In this book they remamber there past lives and they do love each other (at lest now by the time there in the like 87th life) they are finally in there original body's and harry and Tom are just having fun. (I think Tom went to durmstrang at lest in Harry's 4th year) there where flashbacks to past lifes together in parts of the book.

I am 99% shere it was on wattpad but it was so long ago I cant find it anymore.

#+begin_quote
  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

*** That sounds right I kinda hope it is I lost it like 2 years ago (at least) and I would love to read to complete. Even if it's not the one I'm thinking I'll give it a read because it sounds good.

**** It really is good. One of the few Harry-Toms I actually like. :)

Hopefully it is the fic you're looking for - your brief really sounds like what I remember of that one though.

***** It's all I can remember honestly like I said I lost it years ago. I had tons of HP fanfiction saved on my phone then it fell off a bridge while I was fishing ( curse you girl pants with barely pockets) and they're all gone I would love to find them again but I would hate to flood the "help me find my lost fanfics" people so I have limited myself to asking for help once every 3 days.

****** As the kids apparently say these days: 'ooof'. That sucks.

One of many reasons I treasure my beloved Vintage Greatcoats. No matter how many pockets your actual clothing has or lacks, Greatcoats have far more, and they're so delightfully deep. I can literally carry inch-thick hardbacks in a couple of them and they won't fall out even when I'm frantically running to catch trains. :D

On your fic note, it might be easier to go the request-post route and try bulk-find those of similar trope-niches to get a lot of them at once, then 'Whats that fic' the missing ones. :)
