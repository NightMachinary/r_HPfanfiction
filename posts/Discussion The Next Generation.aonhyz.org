We know that Rowling has made a bunch of stuff up after the final book, how close do you stay to her story after canon? For the characters in The Next generation; who is still there and not? What house do you have them sorted in? What personality do you have them as?

When I talk about next gen, I'm talking about:

Teddy Lupin

Victoire Weasley

Dominique Weasley

Louis Weasley

Rose Weasley

Hugo Weasley

Fred II Weasley

Roxanne Weasley

Lorcan Scamander

Lysander Scamander

Molly II Weasley

Lucy Weasley

Scorpius Malfoy

James Sirius Potter

Albus Severus Potter

Lily Luna Potter

How are they in relationships? What kind of a job do they get after Hogwarts? Who doesn't exist in your headcanon?

Anything else you'd like to share about with these characters?


** The Cursed Child does not exist.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin:
#+end_quote

The son of Remus and Nymphadora, Teddy was raised by Andromeda, with Harry having an active role as godfather. He joins the Aurors, but he is more interested in what it means to fight for a cause than the actual battles.

#+begin_quote
  Rose Weasley:
#+end_quote

Sorted into Hufflepuff

I like to think that Rose has a special bond with Neville and Herbology is her favorite subject. She is somewhat distant from her mother, who is very involved in the Ministry, while Rose despises government and bureaucracy in general. Rose has a habit of falling asleep in the library--though her favorite place to read is outside the Herbology greenhouses. She goes barefoot at every opportunity and carries schoolbooks and storybooks around constantly. Her favorite stories are the Dr. Doolittle books by Hugo Lofting.

#+begin_quote
  Hugo Weasley:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Hugo is fascinated by story and myth and the name Hugo. He carries around a copy of /Les Miserables./ Due to the size of the book, nobody notices that it isn't a textbook. He is meticulous and organized--his speciality being able to push Rose's buttons, for his own amusement. He knows exactly how to make her scream, how to make her laugh, and how to make her cry. Hugo was able to out-wrestle and out-rough-house her by the time he was six. Their dynamic is not completely antagonistic though--as much as he likes making Rose scream, Hugo is also the one who reads to her when she's sick in the Hospital Wing.

#+begin_quote
  Fred II Weasley
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Despite being fascinated by pranks, he spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them. As a result, all the professors think he's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot.

#+begin_quote
  Roxanne Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

The smallest of the Weasleys, Roxanne makes observations. She sits still and watches and makes records--she got the idea from Hugo, who records everything that makes Rose scream--but decided to do it for everybody. She grows up to be a historian.

#+begin_quote
  Molly II Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

Molly, Percy's oldest daughter, is every bit a mother hen as her grandmother. She also favors some Muggle tools, taking after her mother. She wears glasses like her father.

#+begin_quote
  Lucky Weasley:
#+end_quote

I'm going to assume you meant Lucy. Percy's second daughter, I must confess I hadn't given any thought to until I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley][/The Noticing of Lucy Weasley/]]. So yeah, a girl who idolizes her daddy and acknowledges the importance of pencil pushers.

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy:
#+end_quote

Scorpius Malfoy was sorted into Hufflepuff. He yearns to become a Healer. A quiet sort, he is utterly baffled by the antics of the Everyone Else. Being an only child and having no cousins close to his age, the way Albus and Rose and Lily can argue to the point of screaming one day and the next save one another favorite deserts is among the strangest thing he's ever seen.

#+begin_quote
  James Sirius Potter:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Given my inclination for Lucy, I find that James is not entirely unlike his grandfather, only with a far bigger ego. Delighted to be the son of heroes, James has a highly inflated sense of self. While popular among his classmates, he alienated himself from many of his cousins. To give him much needed discipline, Harry sends him to spend a summer with his Muggle cousins. Without his wand. The months away are deeply transformative, after James sees one of his cousins take on a gang of bullies despite being outnumbered four to one.

** I'm going to say right up front that I haven't read Cursed Child all the way through and have no intentions of doing so anytime soon. Also, I've pretty much forgotten the Epilogue...

So, here are my ideas:

- Fred II takes after Percy more than any other Weasley, and doesn't quite "get" pranks. Gryffindor, though probably better-suited for Slytherin or Ravenclaw
- Molly II and Lucy, in turn, are the pranksters of the generation and drive their father bonkers. Molly is in Gryffindor and Lucy a Slytherin, but they still get along incredibly well
- I always liked the idea of Albus, Rose and Scorpius being sorted into either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw together. Probably Hufflepuff.

  - Scorpius is the sunshine child who is much too innocent and happy for his own good. He plays peacekeeper between Rose and Albus. Scorpius sneaked out with Albus and Rose one year and discovered he really loves Muggle musicals...it's a long story that involves too many explosions and singing pandabears for anyone's health. He's determined to make the Fountain of Fair Fortune a successful musical, and accidentally guilt-trips everyone into helping him with this project
  - Rose is incredibly angsty and hostile. She loathes her name and the fact that her parents are always busy with work and her younger brother, who is slightly favoured thanks to his kinder disposition. Bit cyclical in nature, that. Rose enjoys blasting dramatic Muggle music and being /right/ (even if she knows she's not)
  - Albus inherited Harry's looks, but got both of his parents' pigheadedness, self-righteous fury and penchant for trouble. He and Rose bond on the matter of hating their names, but will often get into fights over who has it worse. Albus enjoys cinnamon and dislikes Herbology---says it's too boring. He declared war on the Whomping Willow second year and has deemed it the /root/ of all his problems and insists that it should /leaf/ him alone. Albus lowkey enjoys wordplay.

- Lorcan Scamander is a shy child who got sorted into Hufflepuff before the hat even touched his head. He's a bit of a conspiracy nut, but is the best Care student at Hogwarts. He invents a spell in his third year that would essentially turn his wand into a bubble wand. The bubbles taste like candyfloss
- Lysander Scamander is a hatstall---ends up going into Slytherin. Bit of a surprise for everyone, really, but he has a goal in mind: Lysander is going to prove, once and for all, that a Crumple-Horned Snorkack /does/ exist---no matter what it takes
- Dominique and Victoire fight like crups and kneazles, and it's only gotten worse over the years. If one so much as looks at the other the wrong way, screaming will be heard throughout the Slytherin dungeons---they're both in Gryffindor. Louis (successfully) pretends he doesn't know either of them; it helps that he's managed to get himself into Ravenclaw. Maybe it's his blond hair?

  - Victoire, when not arguing with her sister, loves playing both Quidditch and rugby, and enjoys traipsing through the Forbidden Forest. Somehow, she managed to get Lorcan to accompany her enough times to befriend the centaur herd, who begrudgingly agreed she could hunt with them every once in a while
  - Dominique is a bit of a fashionista, and is constantly petitioning for laxer uniforms at Hogwarts. She's surprisingly close to her aunt Hermione, as she also advocates for creature rights and the like; this relationship is something that makes Rose extremely jealous and short-tempered.
  - Louis always seems to be exasperated with everyone. He lives with two banshees and has some right devils for cousins, not to mention the war-heros for parents, aunts and uncles. He's just tired of all of the fuss, and nothing really phases him anymore. He hoards the Room of Requirement for himself and uses it as his own personal library

- Hugo is rather pleasant to be around. He was sick a fair amount as a child, thus leading to more doting from his parents and grandparents. He looks up to Scorpius as a role-model and big-brother sort, which makes both Rose /and/ Albus jealous (Rose is just a very explosive person, see). Hugo is still rather sickly, and will occasionally spend a week or two in the Hospital Wing; no one's quite sure what's wrong with him, but he's always so positive that people try not to worry about it
- Teddy alternates between being down and depressed and very mischievous. When he's in a good mood, he'll assist Lucy and Molly in their pranking endeavours. When he's down, his Metamorphmagus abilities falter a little, revealing just how similar to Sirius and Remus he looks like. He, like Bill, has some werewolf tendancies like preferring rare meat. Strangely enough, his mood mirrors the lunar cycle. He's also a dab hand at potions, and is secretely attempting to become an animagus. When he succeeds, he will be the first Metamorphmagus Animagus, as well as the first Colour-Changing Ball Python. Hufflepuff
- James is a very popular person. His humour is a bit like his uncle Ron's, and that leads to some hurt feelings, but he's usually decent enough about apologising. The exception to this would be to his siblings, to whom he is ruthless. At least, until Lily gets her wand. James has a pet dog his parents "don't know about" that he sneaks into Hogwarts every year. It's a really, /really/ tiny thing named Sneeze, and he lends him to Hugo whenever he's sick. Gryffindor
- Finally, Lily Luna. She's got a bit of a "Mad Scientist" flair, and was a hatstall between Slytherin and Ravenclaw, with the later winning out by a hair. She was inspired growing up by her namesake, who performed magic that held back death itself, and thus Lily Luna has become a bit obsessed with doing the same. Albeit, a bit more...permanently than what her grandmother did. It doesn't help that Lily is /brilliant/ and really more than a bit bored up in that tower.

  - Over time her tendencies towards the darker side of magic grow, and if anyone is going to discover the Chamber of Secrets again, it's going to be her. Let's just call it irony

** This may be an unpopular opinion.

I think that Rowling got caught up in the success of the original series, and it intimidated her into writing subpar novels. It's understandable, how could anyone top Harry Potter? But still, her books read like fan fiction, and they come off as both trying too hard and playing too safe, which, like I said, is understandable but still disappointing.

Furthermore, to name a next gen character after a character in the original generation indicates epilogue. How could you possibly make that character his/her own character when the reader already has a set of feelings and impressions associated with the original character whom they were named after? In books, we cannot see, but I hope she won't go truly fan fiction and include “piercing emerald eyes” and “white blonde hair like ice” in every other paragraph.

*** Seriously though! I can see using a middle name to honor a loved one, but I've always felt that more of (particularly Harry's kids) the 2nd gen kids should have had their own name. A name that didn't hold all this meaning they had to “live up to.” For instance, Albus. Who on earth wants to live up to a name like Albus when at first hearing it people would think Dumbledore...? I always thought that the addition of Severus was to give the name, the redemption it didn't fully get with Snape.

*** Yeah they all should get their own names. It seems to be an unspoken literary rule to not repeat names unless there is a completely good reason since it can get confusing.

A good way JKR did it was make Teddy named after his grandfather but be known by something other than “Ted.” That decision was good. The rest of the namesakes are a bit tedious.

** I play in the canon-verse a lot, but the more that has come out in recent years the more I have deeper I have crawled into my sandbox not really wanting to incorporate recent revelations into my own headcanon verse. I'm just very pick and choose off the revelation tree at this point. Through all that, my head canons for the Next Gen have remained fairly consistent.

​

*Teddy Lupin*- Hufflepuff. Super chill. Clumsy. Prone to crazy hair colors, a lover of puns and appreciator of small explosions for pranking purposes. Has a developed a (to a point) healthy fear of Bill Weasley after he started dating Victoire. Frequently described as ‘Not as dumb as he looks.'

Works for the Ministry in the Department of Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, joining Hermione in the fight for creature rights and equal treatment for them.

​

*Victoire Weasley*- Gryffindor- Intelligent. Fashionable. Can be socially oblivious to what's outside her own immediate social circle. While having less Veela power then her mother, she still turns heads in ways that make her deeply uncomfortable. Massive fan of the Irish Quidditch Team and paints her face green for the games.

Works for Gringotts for several years in various capacities before becoming an accountant for a major international wizard company.

​

*Dominique Weasley*- Gryffindor. Quidditch fanatic. Team Captain. Abrasive. Hacked her long strawberry blonde hair off in an act of spite. Desperate to crawl out of Victoire's and the family's shadow however she can. Less natural Veela magic then her sister, but much more control over what little she has.

Signed on to play professional Quidditch. Most famous for arguing with various idiot referees over her career and scoring the most goals for the Wimbledon Wasps since there inception.

​

*Louis Weasley*- Ravenclaw. All brain, no brawn. Portrait artist. No supernatural lust powers, he's relieved about it. Realized how hard it is to rebel with liberal parents. Speaks perfect French.

Becomes an artist. Marries a chef. Has four children named after either paint colors or cooking spices.

​

*Rose Weasley*- Ravenclaw. Laid back. Intelligent. Book collector. Possesses the kind of intelligence where she never actually studies and still pulls passing grades. Loves (and hates) her dad's many nicknames for her. Will come after you with facts, logic and a punch to the face.

Works in the Underage Magic Office, goes to explain the wizarding world to parents of muggle-borns who have some very raw magic that can be hard to hide. Gains a reputation for being fair in her work. Also serves on the courts of the Wizengamot.

​

*Hugo Weasley*- Gryffindor. Insomniac. Writer. Known for a love of debate and research skills. Has no problem fighting you or the big fellow in the corner if sufficiently annoyed. The hardest thing he ever did was take a leap of faith to do what he loved against the advice of everyone around him.

Becomes a published author writing both fiction and nonfictional works, including a complete history of the Second Voldemort War.

​

*Fred Weasley II*- Gryffindor. Calm. Relaxed. Searching for a purpose in life. Not sure what he really wants but knows what is expected and wanted of him. Organized the selling of Weasley products inside of Hogwarts with James' help. He's convinced the professors were drunk when they gave him a Prefect badge.

Takes over the family business and brings in various muggle magic tricks and prank items as he takes more adventures into muggle London. Becomes a bit of an expert on muggles.

​

*Roxanne Weasley*- Slytherin. Photographer. Potioneer. A street-smart girl who gives as good as she gets from her brother and his friends. Photos are forever and provide wonderful ammunition.

She works at Saint Mungo's as a medicinal potioneer while taking photos on the side for fun and profit.

​

*Molly Weasley II*- Ravenclaw. Composed. Loving. Empathetic. A kind soul with a fierce intellect, who seems to understand her sister best out of the rest of the family. She admires her grandmother, but it's hard deal with the expectation of being just like her.

Takes a job as a Healer at Saint Mungo's and specializes in women's care.

​

*Lucy Weasley*- Gryffindor. Fierce. Intelligent. Socially inept. Overwhelmingly protective of those she views as helpless, Lucy is a creature of many faces. Emotionally and personally, she is very much like her father. Her sense of adventure and raw magical talent she gets from her mother. Though, her love of dueling is all her own.

Upon graduation she joins the Aurors and chases down many dark forces over the course of her career.

​

*James Sirius Potter*- Gryffindor. Joker. Egotistical. Wearer of masks. He's been basically prophesied to be among the greatest troublemakers Hogwarts has ever seen. It leaves in conflict with Lucy and other who respect order. There was a prank war at one point and several trips to the Headmistress's office.

He started his career quill pushing for the Ministry of Magic in the Games and Sports department before he got an opportunity to become a radio host for a talk show.

​

*Albus Potter*- Hufflepuff. Quiet. Sensitive. Cold tempered. He's a very normal boy, just introverted. Rose has been his best friend since they were in nappies and they gladly welcomed Scorpius to make a trio. With two boisterous siblings and a herd of cousins, Albus gave up on standing out and focused on avoiding the photographers that followed his family around when they were in public.

After taking a trip around the world, he returned home and began his career in the International Diplomacy branch of the Ministry.

​

*Lily Luna Potter*- Flower enthusiast. Quick tempered. An organizer. A lover of simple things like flowers and botany doesn't make one weak or silly. Her quick temper and boisterous personality did not seem to be the type for simple pleasures.

She became a florist, with a focus on magical plants which by nature are incredibly dangerous. Eventually becoming the Hogwarts Herbology Professor years later.

** I'm not too set on anything to do with the next generation. I have some ideas, but I'm not committed enough to call them my headcanon.

Probably my favorite idea is that Harry and Ginny have only one child: Lily Luna Potter. Harry/Ginny are both busy people. They always have time for their daughter but just don't think they should add more kids to that. It's a hard decision because they both imagine a slightly larger family, but it works for them. Lily will often be found watching her mother's quidditch practices where the team loves their little mascot or writing letters to her godmother (Luna) in Harry's office where he's always happy to use her as a reason to procrastinate on his paperwork. Molly thinks they treat her too much like a little adult, but she's an overall happy kid. However, she does recognize from a young age that her dad has a dangerous job. She also knows he was an orphan and she lives with some fear for the life of her parents that becomes more low-key over time. She ends up a Slytherin because her parents, the Harpies, and the ministry workers have shown her determination and ambition as much as they have bravery. She faces some problems at school for it, but Harry told her that he was almost a Slytherin and Ginny told her that married an almost-Slytherin. It's still hard, but she get confidence from that (and hexes a lot of people.) She gets along with Scorpius, who dates Rose, but her best friend is Ivana Zabini. They're families had dinner together twice, both times resulted in the adults verbally savaging each other at the table while they watched in awe. Lily becomes an auror.

If I incorporated the epilogue, I still like the idea of Lily being the Slytherin. Albus becomes a Gryffindor but still is best friends with Slytherin Scorpius. He's better at research than practical magic but he's got some really strong hexes that Ginny taught him, and Harry made sure he could perform an impressive shield charm. He becomes an Unspeakable. James is very restless and exasperating. He's good enough at every subject, but leaves Hogwarts with no solid plans. He works in a shop in New York, assists researchers in Romania, and plays chaser on an amateur quidditch team in France and makes a few other stops. His longest job was as a fireman in the muggle world. He does return to Britain years later and takes the job of muggle studies professor (and then flying instructor...and then Care of Magical Creatures...).

I'm also fine with the canon stuff though. I seem to be one of the few people who is okay with Delphini and, if her story was ever continued, I'd like to see Harry visiting her in prison and being able to get through to her. My story for her is that she actually looks a lot like her parents. In prison, with drab clothes and the color gone from her hair, the resemblance is clear. She'll talk like she supports everything her father did, but she has no real investment in anti-muggle and anti-muggleborn ideas. She's desperate to prove herself more than she is power-hungry. Harry's a bit alarmed when, over time, that desire to prove herself and earn someone's favor becomes her trying to impress him.

** *Teddy Lupin (1998)*

A Hufflepuff with Slytherin tendencies. Gryffindor wasn't even considered as a House for him. He grew up with Andromeda but he spends the weekend at the Potters' house. He's extremely protective of James, who's often neglected in favor of his younger siblings. It's Teddy's idea to publish erroneous information to the newspaper regarding James' sorting.

*Victoire Weasley (2000)*

A Ravenclaw who is very practical. She's also very intuitive. Sometimes she relies on her instincts too much, although she's usually right in the end.

*Dominique Weasley (2003)*

Another Hufflepuff with Slytherin tendencies. She's uncommonly kind and patient, but also extremely stubborn, sometimes irrationally so.

*Louis Weasley (2006)*

Ravenclaw. He's blond like his sisters but that's the only Veela trait he inherited. His friendly personality naturally draws people to him. He also has a quick-witted sense of humor.

*Rose Weasley (2005)*

Gryffindor. She's honest, not brutally so but she'll speak without thinking, and sometimes that gets her into trouble. She's close to James, whom she regards as an older brother, and it's through him that she meets Scorpius.

*Hugo Weasley (2007)*

Ravenclaw and extremely creative. Unlike Rose, who's book-smart, Hugo is just very intuitive. He and Lily remain friends even though they're in different Houses.

*Fred II Weasley (2006)*

Hufflepuff. He has a lot of identity issues because he looks very little like his namesake. He absolutely hates Quidditch, has never pulled a prank in his life, and in regards to the joke shop, he's only interested in the business side of things.

*Roxanne Weasley (2008)*

Gryffindor. She's the one who inherits the joke shop when Fred decides he wants to be a writer instead. She doesn't have as many identity issues as Fred, but she does feel out of place with her darker coloring.

*Lorcan and Lysander Scamander (post 2007)*

Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, respectively. Lorcan's the more outgoing twin and he's protective of Lysander, who often has his head in the clouds.

*Molly II and Lucy Weasley (2002)*

Both of them are in Gryffindor. Molly's given name is actually Mary, but Arthur started calling her Little Molly because she reminds him of his wife. Mary and Lucy get in the most trouble out of all of the cousins.

*Scorpius Malfoy (2005)*

Slytherin. He's rather rude until he meets James, who takes him under his wing and protects him from bullies. He's not an outright bigot, but he does think Muggles are strange and definitely lesser than wizards. His relationship with Rose helps him to grow out of the ideology.

*James Sirius Potter (2004)*

Slytherin. Often neglected by his parents, he becomes extremely independent and forms his own family with his circle of friends. When he's younger all he wants is Harry and Ginny's approval, but finally he gets sick of the constant belittlement and moves in with Teddy and Victoire right before his sixth year. With his black hair and brown eyes, charismatic personality, and streak of independence, he often reminds Harry and Ginny of Tom Riddle. He's extremely protective of his younger siblings, although Albus doesn't appreciate it and instead further ridicules him.

*Albus Severus Potter (2005)*

Gryffindor. He's petrified of being in Slytherin after seeing the way his parents treat James. In the beginning he's close to Rose, but he rapidly gets jealous and rude when he realizes she's forming other friendships. His sense of entitlement also frustrates her and they stop being friends until he meets a Muggleborn girl who helps him change his attitude. He resembles Harry except for his light auburn hair. Harry specifically named him after Snape because he wanted Snape to have a part of Lily. When Albus finds out about this, he's disgusted; he's also talked to Neville, who doesn't sugar coat the truth about Snape. As soon as he's seventeen, Albus legally changes his middle name to Rubeus. He also insists on going by Al.

*Lily Luna Potter (2007)*

Gryffindor with Ravenclaw tendencies. When she was younger, she was a romantic, but as she grew older she realized her life wasn't as perfect as her parents pretended. She has a hard time dating because she doesn't trust herself to distinguish infatuation from love. She has trouble tolerating Albus, but she's extremely close to James. When James moves out, she often goes to visit him. She has dark red hair and hazel eyes. At first Snape's portrait absolutely hates her because she looks like a combination of Harry's parents, but then he starts to imprint Lily I onto her and becomes obsessed with her. As a result James ends up burning Snape's portrait.

**** Thanks! I drew upon the limited facts of the Epilogue and other information.

1) We know nothing about James' appearance, unlike his younger siblings. Even /post/ Epilogue, we know more about Rose (red hair) and Hugo (bushy hair) than James.

2) Lily is not mentioned /at all/ in the Quidditch 2014 thing.

3) Favoritism is, unfortunately, an extremely common occurrence. It happens for conscious and unconscious reasons. Ginny /is/ the favored child, so she thinks nothing of it, while favoritism is all that Harry knows in raising children because of the Dursleys.

4) Harry feels a severe need to defend naming his son Severus.

5) James is hopeful of his parents' attention, yet they ignore him, criticize him, and say nothing positive about him.

6) Ginny compares James to Ron, the brother to whom she was always rudest and sometimes even cruel.

7) Albus acts like a completely normal, if clingy, child, yet Harry and Ginny are so focused on him that they don't even care if James safely made it onto the platform. James could have been kidnapped and Harry and Ginny wouldn't have noticed until the train was leaving. They also insult James in front of Albus.

8) Lily doesn't interact with Albus, only James and Hugo. Favored children, like Albus, are usually alienated from their siblings. It seems he isn't close to Teddy, either, as he doesn't share his siblings' enthusiasm at the prospect of Teddy joining the family.

9) Harry likely favors Albus to subconsciously fill a void inside himself (in fact, JKR gives this as the reason for Albus Severus' abysmal name). He's still dealing with mental issues. Ginny does nothing to stop Harry's favoritism toward Albus because she prefers ignoring signs of an unstable relationship.

10) It's a cycle of abuse. (Refer to #3.)

** In case anyone was curious about mine:

Teddy Remus Lupin Hufflepuff Head Boy Chaser Loves his Metamorphis' ability, and enjoys turning into people like Harry or Ron to scare the living daylights out of his cousins, into making them think that they're in trouble. Is raised by his grandmother Andromeda, but Harry and the Weasley's have a large part in his life. Eventually Marries Victoire and becomes an Auror

Victoire Gabrielle Weasley Gryffindor Head Girl Prefect Fiery attitude, best to stay away when she's pissed! Her aunt Ginny taught her the Bat Boogey Hex, and she's not afraid to use it! While she may be Head Girl and eventually Prefect, isn't afraid to get back anyone who bullies her or her family. She is often getting into disagreements with her mother, and is a total daddy's girl (Though she would deny it!). And the only people who are allowed to call her Vicky, are her father and Teddy; thank you very much! She once even cuts her hair, in defiance to her mother's ideals. Gets many different jobs, before eventually deciding to go and join her uncle Charlie into training dragons.

Dominique Brielle Weasley Gryffindor Beater Is a Tomboy, loves to play Quidditch because it makes her feel free. Eventually becomes a Beater for the HolyHead Harpies. Secretly likes romance novels, (though she'll deny it if anyone asks). Is always willing to try a new dare or be a test subject to her uncle George's Joke Shop.

Louis William Weasley Ravenclaw Head Boy Prefect Gets very annoyed at all of the loud noises that come from his sister Victoire, and his mother. Is often seen locked up in his room or underneath a tree, reading or painting. He loves to paint; it's a past time that eventually turns into a job for him, later in life. But he knows that for most artist you don't get rich or famous until after you're dead, so he ends up working as a Curse Breaker like his father.

Rose Katherine Weasley Ravenclaw Head Girl Prefect: Is very competitive, hardly backs down, can sometimes be insensitive but doesn't mean it. Loves Chess and reading, but often rolls her eyes at Quidditch. (Though she will play occasionally). Often gets into fights and dares/competitions with James and Fred (Much to the annoyance of Hermione, Albus and Scorpius (And much to the amusement of Ron, and Hugo).

Hugo Xander Weasley Hufflepuff: A quiet and softly spoken boy. He's probably the most "well behaved" Weasley in the family. But is often dragged into whatever his much bolder cousin and friend; Lily Luna has on her mind. Without Lily by his side, he'd likely be a loner, often by himself, holed up in his bedroom or a library. But because of Lily, (as well as several other annoying cousins); he's often out causing mischief; even when he doesn't want too. Is most fond of Herbology, Potions and History, and is seen with Professor Longbottom in the Greenhouses, more often than not.

Frederick Robert Weasley II Gryffindor Social butterfly; loves to be the center of attention, and is always showing off. Can come off as arrogant or even rude; but is pretty caring and considerate deep down. Found a fondness for building things, and likes to build things in his spare time, even eventually going into the construction business in the Muggle world; and builds houses there. While helping his dad out with the joke shop.

Roxanne Olivia Weasley Slytherin: Was a surprise for everyone when she was sorted into Slytherin, Is more of a quiet sort, but has a thirst to prove herself and plenty of ambition. Will do what she can to go far in life. Is a quick thinker, thanks to being around her dad and her uncle Ron's joke shop, and often thinks outside of the box to get things done. Ends up becoming a Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor.

Molly Christine Weasley II Weasley Ravenclaw: She loves her family and would do anything for them; so when she found out that her father had left the family, because of his disagreement with him, she had been furious with him! She holds grudges easily, and is difficult to get to forgive you. Ends up being fascinated by Runes Magic

Lucy Ginevra Weasley Hufflepuff A shy and quiet girl, she's a great listener more than she is a talker; often getting tongue-tied and blushes easily. She also gives out great advice to people and is very empathetic towards people in general. She ends up being interested in magical and non magical creatures, and decides to go around the world looking for them.

James Sirius Potter Gryffindor Seeker Rebellious, Smart, Charming, Competitive, is often seen making bets or dares with everyone and anyone. Isn't afraid to say no (Though that has cost him more than once). Is very loud and adventurous; everyone thought he'd join Harry and Teddy and become an Auror, but were rather surprised when he decided to become a Professional Quidditch Player.

Albus Severus Potter Gryffindor Head Boy Prefect Is often annoyed by James (and to be quite frank; many of his other crazy family as well). Gets along quite well with Louis (despite the age difference), Teddy is his favorite family member (not that he'd admit that aloud!). Is often the voice of reason between his cousin Rose and best friend Scorpius (though they often don't listen to him, anyway). Becomes a Charms Master

Lily Luna Potter Slytherin Seeker Everyone was the most surprise (Except for Ginny, perhaps) when Lily Luna was sorted into Slytherin. James wouldn't talk to her for weeks, Albus would look over at the Slytherin table worriedly, as though she were some sort of next Dark lord? Or she supposed it'd be Dark Lady? But honestly with so many family members, and with her and Hugo being the youngest in the bunch; she had to have a thirst to prove herself, as well as the ambition. She's very bold and daring, isn't afraid of breaking the rules, but figures out when a "right" time for rule breaking is. Often gets Hugo, and Roxanne in plenty of trouble along with her. (Despite Roxanne being a year older than them). She surprises everyone even more later on, by becoming a Healer. (Always do the unexpected) is her moto.

Lorcan Harold Scamander Gryffindor Chaser Is very Adventurous and loves when his parents take him to a bunch of places. Would love to travel around the world forever, if he could. But his parents eventually settle down in Britain, right before he and Lysander are to go to Hogwarts. Ends up becoming a explorer.

Lysander Neville Scamander Ravenclaw Prefect He loves seeing new places and learning new things, he would much rather stay in one place. He is often seen trying to combine Muggle objects with magical, to see how they'd work. Ends up being an Unspeakable.

Scorpius Malfoy Ravenclaw Head Boy Prefect He's sarcastic he ends up developing a love for pranking people, thanks to Albus' relatives. (Much to Albus' horror). He's one of the smartest boys in his year, and is often very competitive against Rose and Albus when it comes to grades. He doesn't agree with how his family acted during the war, and later on in life he donates money to St. Mungo's regularly. Ends up becoming a Healer.
