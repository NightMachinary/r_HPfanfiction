Hello! I've had this fic idea on the backburner for a year now and now while I have the time I thought I'd look at it again.

This fic would feature a “Dark Lord” Harry and “Boy-Who-Lived” Tom following Tom through his years at Hogwarts (I'm not too sure if I want to start at Year One or skip into later years, leaning toward the latter though).

“On that faithful night, Tom Riddle mysteriously defeats the Dark Lord and is celebrated as a hero. Little do they know that Harry wasn't truly defeated that night as he managed to become Master of Death. When Harry was struck dead he was reborn in a different town as a baby to live another life. The deathly hallows are scattered and await their reunion.”

Basically, after Harry is vanquished by Tom, he is reborn under a different name and circumstances. He doesn't recall his past life and just has a faint urge to find and collect the Hallows. Upon the collection of the Hallows, he would regain his past-life's memories.

Tom would grow up under the “care” of his father until he goes to Hogwarts. There at Hogwarts he would be under Dumbledore's(?) tutelage where he is given the task to collect the Hallows (like how Harry had to find the horcruxes). The Hallows would be hidden in places of Harry's life respective to their “powers” like the resurrection stone would probably be in a place of life/death.

Since Harry needs some beliefs to go by I thought he could possibly stand for getting rid of the stature of secrecy and opening more relations with other magical creatures like werewolves and elves. I think these need a little bit more fleshing out, but it stands as a basis for now.

Also, due to an older Harry and a younger Tom, there would be a mixing of characters from different eras. House dynamics would also be slightly different with no Slytherins=evil and Gryffindors would be distrusted to an extent.

Thoughts?

*** While that's certainly true, I'm specifically looking to make a BWL Tom here and not some remake with a slightly modified Voldemort.

** Sounds interesting, but kinda out there if you're going for a serious story instead of a more comedic one. Though this is hardly advice, the most important thing to any story is to have characters with real motivations and a solid world built around them and then just let that write the story. And your description makes it sound like you have only the barest bones of the story you want to write.

I think you'd need to write a suitable reason for Harry being a Dark Lord and Master of Death while Voldemort is a child. Your mentioning of him getting back his memories when he unites the Hallows sounds like that could be interesting, reminds me a bit of Light Yagami in Death note. I'm no writer so I can't offer much in the way of substantial advice, but there have certainly been worse fanfiction pitches than this.

*** Well this is certainly still in the beginning stages of development, but I'll be sure to give more motivations to the characters and attempt to sound out the world a bit better to make it more understandable. I've never watched Death Note, but I'll probably give it a shot to see how certain elements play out. Thanks!

** This idea is actually pretty amazing, you would need to change the whole 1 enemy or trial a year system since Harry can't open the chamber of secrets since he has no horcruxes.

*** Oh yeah, kind of forgot about the whole Chamber of Secrets! Definitely going to fit that in somewhere. I'm probably going to end up changing Tom's challenges since AU Harry would probably act differently from Voldemort.
