Any fanfics out there where Harry is somewhat like Gilgamesh?

It'd be great if he went around calling people mongrels.


** I've been on the prowl for fics like this for quite a while. I even made my own post looking for these fics.

HP has none that I've found. They mainly reside in other fandoms.

** ...? As in the Gilgamesh from mythology, or the Gilgamesh from Final Fantasy?

** I know you are referring to Fate, but actually I would really like to see a Harry with a mindset from the Epic of Gilgamesh.

  "He is in he boys" the cat said, she lady's and gentlemen you read right the cat spoke. You see this was no normal cat he was Krosp I, The Emperor of All Cats. But most importantly he was the trusted adviser to the Heterodyne thrown. Him speaking really froze the woman in place, he and many others had been looking for the young heir whom had been kidnapped some years ago. Sadly this was not the heir but the heir's son, Lily Evens before she became Lily Potter had found out that she had no blood relation to Petunia Evens whom by that time had been a Dursley for sometime.

** Nothing like what you ask, but I do remember a story where Harry had a mentor/guardian female vampire that called him Gilgamesh. A lot of it was an abuse wank, but it was interesting otherwise.

** I kinda feel that canon Voldemort is a sort of Charles Dickens Gilgamesh, but without the epiphany at the end and more first night rights. Voldy's obsession with immortality, and his terrorizing of the wizarding community, certainly squares with Gilgamesh's (at least for the first half of the epic).

** Harry takes after his mom. Independent, righteous, and temperamental. However, he has what Gilgamesh had and no other descendants had: the mark of Fate, the destiny to be truly special. And because of that, he basically gets the full dose of Gilgamesh's divinity and his best known legacy: the Gate of Babylon.

Harry would eventually be able to use the Gate as Goldie could, but not at first and not for a while. He'd have to make do with the hilarious OP abilities Gil displays in Fate other than his Gate. Just having his [[http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sha_Nagba_Imuru][Sha Nagba Imuru]] ability would make him OP in the HPverse.

It would probably end up being just a crack fic, but I think it'd be a fun one to read.
