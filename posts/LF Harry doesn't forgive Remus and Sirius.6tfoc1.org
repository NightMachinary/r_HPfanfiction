Hey guys (and girls),

this time I am looking for fanfictions where Harry doesn't forgive Remus (for not visiting/checking up on him at least a few times a year!) and Sirius (for putting his revenge ahead of taking care of Harry)...at least not at first (they can earn his forgiveness in time, but none of that "So you are a friend of my dad - cool!" or "I want to live with you ASAP!" - I mean Harry is strangely trusting sometimes...in reality abused people (or people who were bullied, which also happens to Harry - Snape and Malfoy (!) have a fucking lot of trust issues, especially when it comes to adults!)

As always: No Slash and only really really really well done Harry/Ginny!

So, stage is yours and good hunting guys!

greetings LAX

The inverse also happens. Sometimes abused children are so desperate to leave their homes that they'll take the first chance they get even if it's not the most sensible path, which is what I suspect happens in Harry's case.

And how was Malfoy bullied?

I kinda agree with you in Remus's case for not making himself known earlier but Sirius had just stepped into Godric's Hollow and saw James and Lily dead with his own eyes. He was half-mad with grief. He did have Harry with him but gave him to Hagrid because he trusted Dumbledore and only then, chose to pursue Pettigrew.

In any case, Harry decides to not trust Remus and Sirius for your reasons in linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth)

As readers, we are given all of this information so we can make an informed judgement on his state of mind at the time. However, I feel its also quite logical for Harry to be resentful about being "neglected" in favour of revenge. From an angsty teen's point of view, I could easily see him being upset that Sirius didn't value him highly enough which eventually resulted in his sub-par childhood.

**** But Sirius didn't immediately go after Pettigrew. He made sure Harry was safe by giving him to Hagrid. Even in his unstable state of mind, Harry was his first priority.

He also ended up paying for being impulsive by spending the next 13 years in Azkaban. I can't really see Harry not being understanding and empathetic of that, especially since Sirius was after his parents's betrayer. I can see Harry being angry that Sirius didn't try to escape and find Harry earlier but not for trying to avenge his parents's deaths and then subsequently being imprisoned at Hell on Earth.

***** Yes! Besides, all people forget that Sirius fought with Hagrid over who will get Harry. After ensuring that he was safe with Hagrid he went after Pettigrew because he had nothing else to do.
