** I've always been partial to the McGonagall in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just A Random Tuesday]]. It's a crackfic, and it's probably ~10K words too long for the premise, but it's a bunch of fun.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] is a classic and features an excellent Minerva.

There is also a completed sequel by the same author.

*** I like this story but I thought McGonagall was a bit too OOC for my liking.

** A lot of stuff by the author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][My Dear Professor McGonagall]] lives up to the name. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][This one]] is a really great, pretty long fic about the DA at Hogwarts during Year 7. McGonagall narrates the second third of it, and is awesome through all of it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473197/1/Great-Deeds][Here]] is a rapidly updating set of quick moments in McGonagall's life that give a great portrayal of her through all different points in her life.

** I know a lot of people hate it, but HPMOR has a rather unique take on McGonagall.

This one made me think about her character in a different way then I had before... It is probably not what you're expecting.

** [[http://femgenficathon.livejournal.com/87549.html]] Majesty by Kelly Chambliss

(Excerpt) "Yes, ma'am, it's, er. . .a school. For learning, ah. . .magic."

The Prime Minister looked at the floor unhappily and actually ran a nervous finger under his collar. His suit was impeccably cut, and his hair looked as if each strand had been trimmed individually, yet he was as uncomfortable and wrong-footed as any child caught sneaking sweets.

"For learning magic. I see." Her Majesty the Queen (Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland) kept her tone neutral.

**** You're so welcome! I feel like every McGonagall thread should have this fic. You can read a hundred fics about Minerva as a teenager, or a million about her as a teacher, but fics that feature her as a woman or just an average perso are few and far between.
