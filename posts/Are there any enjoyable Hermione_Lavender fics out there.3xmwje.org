Don't deny it, that would make a stupidly entertaining read. Unfortunately, it barely exists from what I can find, which is a giant shame.


** I have not read any. Sorry I can't help, just didn't want you to feel like your post was ignored haha

I suspect this may in fact be a good candidate for either that plot bunny thread that came along a bit ago or the next one if they do the two weeks rotation thing the mentioned.
