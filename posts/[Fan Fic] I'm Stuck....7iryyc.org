** I'll be honest; if you only 'thought it up this morning and wrote most of it while in a towel', unless you are some sort of literary genius, it's extremely unlikely to be ready to post yet.

** Sorry, but you need some sort of description on that. I had no clue what I was reading, or even about who. Take your time, no need to rush. Fanfic readers have been here since the dawn of time, we're not going anywhere anytime soon .

** I've only got two chapters done. I thought this up in the shower this morning then wrote most of it while in a towel.

Since then, I've sat down and fleshed it out quite a bit more, however I knew if I didn't write it now, I'd never even get started.

P.S. Going over the first book to make sure I had timings right I realized just how incredibly fast it moves. Harry makes it to Hogwarts on page 113. Most of the books I read now wouldn't have the MC arriving at his destination till the second book.

*** Stop, take a deep breath. My recommendation is to not publish anything for at least one month after you first write it. Nothing is ready to publish for at least three revisions. If you don't have a beta that's fine, but read through your story multiple times for plot holes, flow, and general ways you can improve the story. Try to write as much of the story as you can before you publish, because it is key that it come together as a cohesive whole.

**** Thanks for the feedback. I really do appreciate it. Most of my writings I do exactly what you said, but I've had so many ideas for HP fanfics that I've never acted on, I knew I would never write it if I didn't get it out.

As bad as the first two chapters are, I now have an incentive to finish. I've actually sat down and started the work on it now, but I had to get it out, otherwise, I'd still be sitting here daydreaming.

I will admit, this is my first time using MCs from the source material. My other writings have been about side characters we don't know much about yet, which allowed me to pretty much make them OCs. So I'm a bit nervous about writing with characters so well fleshed out through canon and Fandom.

I ask that you be patient with me and I promise you a story that will be fun to read.
