If this is on Pottermore I don't know tbh. Vector I headcanon as either a man or a woman depending on the day I'm imagining them. Glasses, a bit shabby & scatterbrained looking. Sinistra is in my headcanon a classy, somewhat proud very fashionable black lady.

How about you guys? Feel free to add in other teachers too even if they're described in canon after you had a mental image of them.


** In my headcanon:

Spetima Vector is a young witch (25-30) that looks up to McGonagall and tries to be like her, thus has the same sternness and fairness to her.

Aurora Sinistra is a bit older witch (40) that is strict, but that's due to the fact that she gets tired spending the night teaching sleepy kids what stars are where and the meaning of each, while using the evenings to correct their assignments. Since she she has an inverted sleeping schedule, she is rarely seen at the head table unless during a feast.

Bathsheda Babbling is a very young witch (straigt outta runes mastery apprenticeship) which is fun, laid back and loves what she does. She appreciates students going above and beyond, and loves to help them achieve their goals.

Silvanus Kettleburn is a older wizard (nearing his 60's), and looks like a stockier Christopher Lee with more gray hairs and tons of scars. He is very knowledgeable, and loves magizoology, but doesn't quite have the same love for all animals as Hagrid.

Charity Burbage is a middle aged witch that knows jack shit about muggles and gives those that ask questions O's left and right just to keep quiet.

*** I'd add on for Kettleburn that he has one leg replaced by a wooden prosthesis and one arm missing, again replaced with a prosthesis that is charmed to move like a normal arm. If I wanna inject a bit of cool lore into the store, I'd have the wooden arm have a compartment for his wand that allows him to seemingly cast wandless magic.

** Totally forgot Ancient Runes. In my headcanon Bathsheda is old and a little chubby, with small circular glasses like John Lennon's, and an array of magnifying tools that levitate. She wears lots of layers of robes and ties her grey hair under a headscarf like a fisher woman.

Burbage is younger and a little chubby as well. I imagine she dresses like Mrs Bucket which is funny because she's so much younger. Really age inappropriate clothes, but sometimes accidentally fashionable. She's relentlessly upbeat and cheery like a preschool teacher.

Sinistra wears turtlenecks and long open robes and was a Slytherin. Vector wears a lot of tweed and always forgets to iron any of their clothes.

** Stop making me question these things, it's /ruining/ me.

I just don't think about them. If they aren't detailed in the fic I just put a generic teacher there and /don't think about it/. If I start thinking about a detail too hard then everything becomes Lovecraftian nightmares.

** Bathsheda Babbling has recently solidified herself into a tall, elegant, West-African woman who wears a lot of beautiful, colourful, silk head scarves.

Aurora Sinestra has always been Mediterranean or Latina - olive skin, long dark hair. A little curvier than more Northern Europeans.

Kettleburn I usually imagine as quite a gaunt-looking man. In my head he's usually from Northern England; probably York or somewhere like that. Oddly, I always think of him as quite short, but I think that's in comparison to Hagrid, who tends to be a lot taller in my head than he was in the films. While I think of him as a short man, I usually put Kettleburn only a little shorter than Minerva McGonagall who I think is quite tall, in addition to wearing well-heeled boots.

Charity Burbage is always a short, dumpy blond woman in cardigans; sort of like Umbridge, but much nicer and not all pink and always ready with a smile.

** Sinistra is a hot red teacher who is idealistic about teaching. She is "the" hot teacher who sometimes wears a lil revealing(still PG and acceptable) clothes. She is everybody's crush, the only reason mediocre male and female students work hard to get into her class. Because she actually fails people frequently otherwise as it is an elective," don't pick it if you don't mean business pick divination instead"

Bathsheda is karolina zebrowska in her late 30s with bottlecap glasses and ankle skirts. Talks loudly, she is clumsy with a wand sometimes

Vector is a tall lanky brunette woman. Might rest on her elbow on Snape accidentally when drunk on one Christmas eve. Also has long straight hair. Maybe part asian, like female Keanu Reeves vibes with Mulan hair. Married to either a really young wizard or a really old wizard. She acts very professional most of the time and then be weird enough to have enough gossip material for a year, otherwise blends in the background once you get used to her height especially when Hagrid is in the room

** Septima Vector: Tall, dark-haired pure-blood witch in her forties who is as strict and fair as McGonagall. Maybe even more for the latter since she isn't head of house. She was a Slytherin and was in the same year as Umbridge. They didn't talk much since they had diverging world views (the irony of their situation didn't fall on them what with a half-blood pro-purity and a pure-blood pro-equity). Septima got the role of prefect in her fifth-year and Umbridge was jealous and hated her for that.

Aurora Sinistra: Dark-skinned and dark-haired half-blood witch (mum's a witch, dad's a Muggle) in her late thirties, older than the Marauders. She's quite calm due to her inverted sleeping schedule, but nothing gets past her in the lessons. She also teaches her students about the advances the Muggles do in her subject, but she focuses on the the magical aspect of her class. That a man got on the moon is all fun and games, but that doesn't help her students understand the significance of the stars' alignment in potion-making.

Batsheda Babbling: She's younger than McGonagall but older than Vector. She's also on the strict side of things, but she can get quite passionate and joyful in her lessons. Particularly when the lessons delve in the practical side of the course. No one, not even Dumbledore, knows how it happened but both her and Trelawney are best friends. They weren't in the same year and their personality at first glance are very different, though they were both Ravenclaws. Guess opposites really attract each other.

Sylvanus Kettleburn: He's getting old, now, somewhere in his late eighties early nineties. He begun teaching his class the year the Chamber of Secrets opened, and from that moment his number of body parts only went down. First it was a finger, which rapidly became five. Fifteen years later, it was his leg. Then he lost a whole hand (the one with all his fingers) before he lost that arm seven years after. Between all that, he was able to get a scar on his face, but his eye was spared, unlike Moody. He really loved his job and taking care of interesting creatures, but sometimes he wished he had the strength and resistance of his friend Hagrid.

Charity Burbage: Dirty blonde, middle-aged pure-blood witch a bit like Arthur Weasley in that she loved everything Muggle but didn't really understand it. She's convinced that Muggles are more advanced concerning social issues compared to wizards despite it being the contrary and commends the Muggles for having lived well and their swift advances in the last century and a half without magic.

** I always picture Vector as a crocodile with glasses because I was playing sonic heroes at the same time I was reading HP when I was a kid. This is what furry shit does to your brain.

The only mental image I have of Sinistra is that of a black woman with a pointy hat but I think that's because of the movies (She kinda went over my head when I first read the books).

***** Ok, I'm not sure what your point is if I'm honest. You seem offended by the idea of people having their own conception of characters which seems an odd view to bring to a fanfiction subreddit. Is either of these professors' appearance mentioned in either of those examples? I didn't mean unseen as literally invisible...
