Never, in all it's life at Hogwarts, should Mrs Norris have been considered more than a minor inconvenience for troublemakers of any sort. It's a cat, you see it, you stun it. Same for Filch, he's a Squib. If you were caught by him and had to face any consequence then it's your fault to not have even prepared yourself a tiny bit. You learn the Forgetfulness Potion in first-year. You simply have to immobilise him then you force-drink him the potion, I can guarantee you he will have forgotten it was you and that's even if you let him have the chance to see your face (which you are stupid if you have, your cloak has a hood, use it). Hogwarts' students really seem like a bunch of wimps and sheep when you read the books, it's pathetic.


** I can't seem to find the fic but I remember reading one where Filch is actually an Unspeakable and Mrs Norris is his animagus wife. They are "stationed" at Hogwarts to keep track of things.

Well if you think about it actually why would you have a caretaker let alone a squib one in a castle that has elves? Because he isn't needed to actually clean anything as tge elves handle that.

*** probably because they don't want to talk to elfs and don't want to feel bad about forcingthe job on a wizard.
