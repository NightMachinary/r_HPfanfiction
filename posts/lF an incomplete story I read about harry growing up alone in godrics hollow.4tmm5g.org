I don't remember if the story was any good or not but it won't leave me alone unil I read it, I hope.

What I remember: Lily / Marauders live at hogwarts, Harry is tiny for his age due to inefficient diet, he was hurt by a caretaker before he made it safely to godrics hollow, he has 2 snakes and he's extrememly smart from reading all of his parents old textbooks as he grew up.

Any help is appreciated as not being able to find it is driving me insane!


** Is he sorted into Slytherin in this?

*** I can't recall off the top of my head, I know he spends a fair amount of time in the marauders quarters as well as the hospital wing as he's fairly delicate and sick from growing up on his own and isolated.

** Ah found it Name: Harry James Potter and the Power of a Prodigy Author: StarLight Massacre

It's no longer on fanfiction and google isn't showing me any promising links for it anywhere since the author deleted it from their account. I recalled it cause of the snakes and he conjures himself a goblet of pineapple juice.

I do have a html of the entire story before deletion tho?

*** Oh damn, that's a shame! You think you could PM me a copy?

I don't recall it being an amazing story, just not necessarily bad either. It's been stuck in my head rather annoyingly though.

Thanks either way for the help :)
