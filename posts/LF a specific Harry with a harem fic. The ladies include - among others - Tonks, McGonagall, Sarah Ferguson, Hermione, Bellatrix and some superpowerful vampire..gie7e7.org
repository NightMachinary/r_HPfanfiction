:END:
The story went that Harry wasn't taught to control some allure-ish thing that attracted hundreds of women across the country. He moves to a manor with his yuge harem and gets everyone trained by Moody, among others.

I'm pretty sure I read it last on FFN, and it was one hell of an exercise in the suspension of disbelief. Still, I'd love to read it again!


** The stories you are looking for are The Witches Secret Trilogy by RotaryFile. The Witches Secret, Harry Potter and the Dark Lady, Harry Potter and the Corvinus Strain. Now i read all three of them from hpfanficarchive but he goes by Selector on fanfiction.net. i don't think all three of them are there.

Here's the link to the first one.

He's also on Ficwad as Selector11.

*** All three of them are there, just as one dirty great big long story rather than as three separate ones. I bailed at the bit where he managed to SPOILER a SPOILER into submission.

I mean, I've long enjoyed RotaryFile/Selector's stories for their sheer silliness, but there are /limits/.
