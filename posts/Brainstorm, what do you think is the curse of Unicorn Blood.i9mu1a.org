** While it has no basis in anything, I like the idea that it keeps you alive... but doesn't heal you. You're still in pain, you're still debilitated, and you need it every day because you're still dying.

*** So it's basically the magical equivalent of life support? You live, but you can't do anything enjoyable.

  The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.

It seems to be up to interpretation; I like to think that you lead a life where you are alive but not really living- no joy, no fear, no feelings. A half-life. I can see Voldemort being able to do it despite the consequences- after all, he did literally rip apart his soul to gain immortality.

*** Someone once made the metaphor that drinking unicorn blood to stay alive was akin to drinking coffee to stay awake instead of getting a good night's sleep. You're irritable and shaky and don't feel good, but you're alive/awake lol

*** I like to think of it like the curse in Pirates of the Caribbean. You can't die, but you can still feel pain, and can't feel anything. You'll just be starving and dehydrated and unable to find any kind of pleasure or comfort in living.

** In my headcanon, it makes you weaker magically/mentally and physically - hence how Harry could beat Quirrell.

No self-respecting wizard loses to an 11 year old, even with sacrificial magic protections in place. There's plenty of four-syllable-or-fewer spells that could have easily been used to keep Harry out of touch range and just off him, but Quirrell didn't use any of them.

Not to mention that Quirrell hadn't the physical strength to fight Harry off once he closed the gap - another thing that doesn't typically happen in a fight between an 11-year-old and an adult.

** My HC is that after drinking it the person's body, though alive and with all organs intact, will start the process of decomposition, literally rotting as if the body was already a corpse while still being forced to function as it should normally. Eventually the arms and legs, tongue, eyes, ears, nose, tooth and all non-vital organs would fall or rot inside the person, from the second the blood is drank the natural healing and growth of the body would permanently stop, worms would start eating the flesh with the cursed being forced to feel every second of it, the very organs that keep the person alive would degenerate to the point where it should be impossible for them to keep the person alive while still moving normally -all of this generating extreme amounts of pain for the recipient and getting gradually worse and worse- and if left alone it would go on and on with no rest, natural death would forever be outside the drinkers reach (not for aging, not for disease...) the only ways of ending it would be either suicide or murder.

** Vampirism. It did not happen with Voldie because his soul is too damaged for curse to stick.
