****** Much more visceral. Darker, too, IMO. One of the best-written fic out there and arguably a Dark!Harry /classic/.

****** Also, much better writing, really pulls me in a way Too Young to Die (which required a lot of suspension of disbelief) never could.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, Harry fights to stay ahead of enemy machinations. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

***** I agree with you on this, but to be fair sometimes it is good to make these posts every once and a while so few people who know about obscure fics can share and new fics can be shared.
