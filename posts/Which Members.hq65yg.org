It's for a fanfic I'm writing right now, and I need some help with something. Which Order of the Phoenix members are supposed to guard Harry at Privet Drive? Specifically the summer after his fourth year?


** We don't know everyone who guarded him. We just know Mundungus and Mrs. Figg did so. It's not out of the realm of possibilities that Dedalus and Doge did so, too.

** At the very least I think Mundungus, Moody, Mrs. Figg, Tonks, and Shaklebolt. I agree with Ash_Lestrange, Dedalus and Dodge make sense. Just find a list of members and use whoever's there I think, they probably all took turns.

** From what I can remember, the advance guard that escorts him to Grimmauld is:

- Kingsley Shacklebolt

- Remus Lupin

- Alastor Moody

- Nymphadora Tonks

- Emmeline Vance

- Elphias Doge

- Dedalus Diggle

- Hestia Jones

- Sturgis Podmore

And the ones guarding him while he's still at home would be:

- Mrs Figg (although bear in mind that she does not live opposite the Dursleys, as shown in the film). She also tends to put at least one of her half-Kneazles (Mr Tibbles) on watch duty, I think.

- Mundungus Fletcher

There might be more, but we aren't told.
