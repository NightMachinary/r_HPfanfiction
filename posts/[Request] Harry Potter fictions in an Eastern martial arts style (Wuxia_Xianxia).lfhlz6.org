Ok this may seem like a really weird request, but I was wondering if anyone knows of any fanfics with a Wuxia or Xianxia plot style base.

Like Hogwarts is a sect, and magic is cultivation based with Harry going on adventure outside of Hogwarts.

Been a big fan of Chinese fictions for a while, and I think it would be cool to read one within the HP world.

Doesn't have to be exactly like I listed above, could be that magic in the east is taught like that, and Harry visits. Or something. Just with that general idea.


** Its not Wuxia style but there are martial arts and the integration of magic in the story. I had never heard of the series this had crossed over with but its a story I find compelling and fun. linkffn(4532363)

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

  Harry was a spirit deer. An animal that had cultivated human form. He was highly coveted for the benefits his corpse could bring to those who consumed it.Good thing he had a handsome, red-eyed man to help drive away any hunters.At first it seemed to be simply an enjoyable companionship, but it eventually became clear that something greater tied them together. Invisible strings that reached beyond heaven and earth. It was a blessing and a danger, and only if they embraced it could they overcome the shadows that lurked in their steps.
