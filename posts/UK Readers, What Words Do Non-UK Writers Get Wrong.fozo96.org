As I've been binge reading tons of HP fanfic lately while in isolation, I've started to notice that sometimes there are words or phrases that are decidedly unfamiliar to me, or in some cases are familiar but I question if they are outdated. I'm wondering if readers from the UK come across misused colloquialisms in fanfics very often, and if so, what are they?

Got any funny ones you want to share? Things that have made you cringe? Things that have made you shake your fist at the sky and ask why? I've been wondering about this for a few days now and had to ask!


** I'm not British but I'm Australian so I generally know the right terms

Grades = Marks

Grading = Marking

Candy = Sweets

Fall = Autumn

Mom = Mum

Oatmeal = Porridge

Those are the ones that stand out to me

And feeding British school kids chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast? Nah they eat cereal, eggs, bacon, porridge, perhaps even sausages and kippers

**** I think some people just don't overly associate Harry Potter with British culture, honestly. That's a big part of why it was popular worldwide - it's easily able to fit into most any culture, and the 'magical' feel of it takes precedence.

It's why, when Ilvermorny was set up, it has houses - not because it's an american thing, like the Hogwarts houses are a british boarding school thing, but because to most readers, it's a /magical/ thing. Same with prefects - many readers don't realize that that's an actual position in British boarding schools, and associate that with the magical community.

If someone doesn't really consider HP to be overly british, it'd make sense to me to just use the words they commonly use, or foods that they're used to.

For me, I think I consider HP to be a bit more 'european' than just 'british', which is a side-effect of first reading the books in French I think. So chocolate chip pancakes would be out - but eating bread with jam, croissants, or other french style breakfasts would not take me out of it /too/ much, as (in my head) there's enough crossover with the lightly english veneer I apply to the HP universe.

(That being said, if the situation were reversed - and HP was French - I could see finding it hilarious if english authors had him eating a full english breakfast ;) )

****** Well, I can only speak directly for the US and France, where neither one have that - and at least in my first-hand experience, my acquaintances saw prefects as more magical related than taking it from an actual school position.

So it's not so much 'US centric' as non-commonwealth, I think.

Edit - and that's more referring to the position itself, rather than the name. Obviously 'prefect' or its equivalent has very different connotations in much of Europe, where it's more often an administrative/government rank.

***** *Kipper*

A kipper is a whole herring, a small, oily fish, that has been split in a butterfly fashion from tail to head along the dorsal ridge, gutted, salted or pickled, and cold-smoked over smouldering woodchips (typically oak).

In Britain and Ireland as well as a few North American regions, they are often eaten for breakfast.

******* Usually it's more in cities - in the US there are a lot of city centers that are laid out in a grid (Manhattan is the easiest example, where all the streets are numbered and maps show that very well), so a block is fairly easy to think about. But it extends to other cities as well - even if the roads/divisions are uneven, I'd still think of the stretch from one road/street to the next in a city to be a 'block'.

Some European cities have areas that would be easy to visualize like that - the [[https://lh5.ggpht.com/-zHv1hczQcD4/UdgqTs1G3cI/AAAAAAAAqCI/leM5NgaGsx4/eixample-barcelona7%25255B6%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800][Eixample in Barcelona]] or [[https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/typical-parisian-city-block-paris-france-may-aerial-view-downtown-74973743.jpg][typical areas of Paris]] fit right into a 'block' mentality. But even irregular ones can still fit well.

The more spread out grids in suburban areas can also be considered a block, but in that context I tend to view/use it as synonymous with neighborhood. Eg, 'Right around the block' would be similar as 'right around the corner/in the same neighborhood/next neighborhood over', more or less.

********* This entire conversation has made me think about a (deeply) strange AU fic concept where instead of being a wizard Harry's just... English. And the Dursleys are, for some bizarre reason, anti-Pom and therefore have lied to him his entire life before Hagrid comes and "rescues" him from, say, Waiheke rather than a lonely shack in the North Sea (actually Waiheke is a terrible substitute for the shack).

Like, who would get what's going on? For the most part Harry won't find things overly confusing so an American reader might wonder why Harry doesn't find uniforms or even boarding school odd. But then there'll be random things like "everything is chips" and insisting soccer is called soccer. I guess he might ask Malfoy if he has a bach, but I don't know if bach would be confusing because its specific to here or if the whole idea of the well off having a beach (usually) house is odd to start with.

Unless you were to give Harry a really thick accent and write it phonetically... everything is chups, growen for grown etc. etc. But even then I reckon a lot of the readers would just think that's something like Hagrid or molespeak in Redwall. And if the author were to lean too heavily into this angle anyway NZ readers would see it as imitating specific groups of people not the country as a whole.

And the politics would get really weird. I guess Dumbledore would have to be some kind of bizarre CANZUK/Commonwealth obsessive... which would position Voldemort as a remainer... Otherwise there'd be no connection between "yer a wizard" and "yer English" whatsoever. But then you'd need some sort of professional occupation that exists in NZ but not the UK for Hermione's parents...

But then if you didn't do it muggle, there'd have to be some sort of prequel to establish some easily understood differences between Magical Britain and NZ. And would Lily be muggleborn? Perhaps a muggleborn NZer who just happened to be visiting relatives in the UK when they sent out the Hogwarts letters...

All in all, a very strange fic concept.

Also, the way I picture that meaning of 'to table' is that it's something you have in hand, that is being considered in the moment - and then you put it back on the table for later. Compared to 'to put something on the table', which is to take something that wasn't an option/under consideration and putting it up to be possibly discussed.

This is a peculiarly American (possibly also Canadian) thing. You won't see it in Australia or NZ either. I guess maybe Ireland but I doubt it.

For the most part, it's not American and British English but American and World English. Obviously it's a lot harder for Americans to notice this due to Americans having the vastly more dominant cultural output (for example, have you ever watched anything made in NZ for NZers? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxhIL4RqaDA][if not, try this]])... and this kind of cultural dominance/imperialism is also making the other countries more American.

(Just a note on that link... relievers are, to my knowledge, called supply teachers in the UK and substitutes in the US. Also, it's actually really weird for schoolboys to mostly wear trousers in NZ.)

Because he's a legend but definitely not from Yorkshire, here is Fred Dibnah, [[https://youtu.be/znMzDw3zosY?t=2662]] You can clearly hear him say 'You can give it me now.' at about 45:30

Casual swearing is everywhere here (Auckland). And by swearing I don't mean bloody, bugger etc. Those are just not swear words (any more).

It's probably the lack of hills. Less reason to swear.

***** It may be a difference of:

- what counts as swearing
- what's a normal/expected frequency
- who we were around to hear (I spent way less time near 18-24 year olds on holiday in London than I did when I was at home and therefore at uni for example)
- a combination

****** I'm from Lithuania, so not even British:) And I can't even figure out what gave me the impression that the British swear a lot. It might be that I read fanfic and there even adults use fucking. It seems this isn't much of a swearword there but to me it somehow sounds really awful. And that is definitely because in my country, all swaerwords are loaned from Russian and people who use them frequently are,well, not the ones you'd want to associate with. And they are often young and uneducated. 'Fucking' actually annoys me and I get such a negative reaction whenever I see it. And it's just a word! But I'm really curious how often they use it and how much they swear. I mean, if every other word is a swearword, that would be a lot.

**** It's because pancakes are the quintessential step up breakfast food - where it takes a bit of extra effort to make, and so it's a bit more of an occasion/treat/show that people care.

So obviously, a cute story about Harry making an effort for the two of them would be the step up version of breakfast, and not him making them a bowl of cereal while half asleep ;)

I'd love a pinned thread or a Britpicking sub-guide with common issues. Mom/mum is obvious, but it's the slight differences in grammar and syntax that are hardest to nail down.

** Something I see every now and again is using non-Brit terms for organisations. For example, reporting the Dursleys for child abuse would involve going to Social Services rather than Child Protective Services. Also, standard medical care is mostly provided by the Govt without charge, both going to a doctor and in hospital, and children can get free glasses (so stories where Harry's told these things would cost too much so he can't have them are noticeable).

*** To be fair, public primary in the US doesn't cost money to attend either (outside of the typical school supplies, of course), so I'm not sure where that idea comes from when people are writing it. Private schools are incredibly pricey, but public school, well, that's paid for by taxes so that everyone can attend.
