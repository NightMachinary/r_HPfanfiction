:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's 11 chapters (I think) and Tom asked Harry to pretend to be engaged to him for the Malfoy Yule Ball. Tom and Harry grew up together in the orphanage (I think), and they've always been close. Harry ends up getting feelings for Tom, and I remember Harry also had a crush on Ginny at first. Tom and Harry also made snow ice cream. They even have sex at the end.

Please help me find the fic.

  A bit of a holiday fic Sure friends helped each other out when they had problems. Harry just wished Tom's problems weren't so damned complicated. Why couldn't the other get some other poor soul to play the part of his fianc√©?
