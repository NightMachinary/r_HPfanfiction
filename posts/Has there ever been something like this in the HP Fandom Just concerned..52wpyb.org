** I got some nasty PMs on fanfic.net and anons on Tumblr during my last story. I did also think about deleting my story, but just reminded myself that I was getting loads of support too.

** there was a ton of wank when Cassandra Claire was revealed to have plagiarized passages in her Drarry fanfiction from a published novel. There are some folks who refuse to buy her published work now because they don't want to support plagiarism (even though she didn't financially profit from the plagiarism because... IT WAS FAN FICTION). Also because she was apparently(?) a huge jerk about it. Look it up on fandom wank on livejournal if you want details, it was before my time.

The LOTR convention fraudster who moved to the HP fandom (I think they wrote Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) also gets hate for defrauding people.

Edit: I reread the OP and realized this was about getting flames for writing, not genuinely controversial authors- sorry! And yes, OP, it's very common.

*** I thought the main issue people had with her published work was that there were significant parts of it pulled from her fanfic, so she essentially plagiarised her plagiarism?

But yeah. HP is notorious for fandom wank, especially back in the clique-y LJ days. I can't remember all the drama between SugarQuill, and FictionAlley(?), possibly including the MuggleNet archives? There was so much at one point it affected the whole fandom.

** Well, back in the early-to-mid-2000s, someone going by the name of "msscribe" engineered dozens of sockpuppet accounts, and all that to get within the "inner circle" of the fandom, the "BNFs" (Big Name Fans) who were all revolving around Cassandra Claire (an equally questionable person).

Read about msscribe and Cassandra Clare [[http://web.archive.org/web/20130203000224/http://www.journalfen.net/users/charlottelennox/784.html][here]] and [[http://www.webcitation.org/6jcCAA6Fo][here]]. They're long reads, but worth it.

** I had some of those once. It seemed like their main issue was with the sort of vampires in my story. Maybe they didn't sparkle enough or some shit...

I'm not sure what those cringey bastards wanted as English was certainly not their forte, but I deleted most of them and moved on. I've been on 4chan for too long to feel personally attacked by stuff like that.

** I know a couple of authors who had stories get popular and got a ton of hate. Particularly a dramione story that got popular had people coming out of the woodwork to be absolutely disgusting. And so that author prefers not to write dramione (even though they wrote it very well) because you just get too much attention and the negative can be overwhelming.

*** That's certainly a big part of it. The more popular a story gets the more it's scrutinised and people forget that a real human is behind the screen. I am guilty of this at times - HPMOR and DAYD for example.

**** And there are some ships that just get a lot of screaming hate. Like you'll see a bunch of reviews that say "Dramione is absolutely disgusting so why would you write this, you should die"

And it's like, why are you here? Stay in your lane. Like another author I follow keeps getting hateful messages for writing Harry/Pansy fic. It's cruel. Just stop, people- focus on what you like and ignore things you hate.

***** Lmao, I got loads of hate for writing a Harry/OC... except that it wasn't Harry/OC. It was pretty explicitly Harry/Ginny. I made a point in the writing several times to make it clear that neither Harry nor the OC were attracted to each other. But I guess some people just didn't like Harry being friendly to a girl that wasn't Ginny or Hermione, so felt happy to call me a bitch in PMs.
