  Sometimes, magic is just laughable. It was such a temperamental thing. One incorrect movement could create a disastrous result. If your intent was off just slightly, the power of a spell could cut in half. There were spells that movement and intent didn't affect it. There were spells that if preformed just a little incorrectly, an opposite result occurred.

  Harry had learned the lesson the hard way in his second year. /Brackium Emendo/ was a healing spell, one that nurses and healers have used for years to help mend broken bones. When the spell was spoken by Lockhart, combined with his use of jab his wand instead of swirling, it vanished bones instantly. Gifting a painful adventure for the victim.

  The idea came to him in his fifth year. He had a nightmare one night of him trying to crawl to the castle with legs made of rubber behind him. The first thought after he bolted upright in his bed was to decrease his intake of dairy. Hermione did mention eating cheese before bed gave nightmares, he wasn't sure if it was a myth or not but it was worth a try. The second thought was of the time he lost his entire arm because of an idiot.

  If anyone deserved to have rubber arms it was Umbridge, he tired mind thought as he tried to fall back asleep. After the thought of that, he blinked several times before grabbing the notebook he left on his table and scribbled down a note for him in the morning. He quickly fell back asleep, dreaming of his Defense Professor bouncing down the stairs on Hogwarts.

  He didn't tell anyone what he was doing. Hermione had given him a questioning eyebrow raised but never asked. He was sure that Ron didn't notice the difference between the Healer's book and his Transfiguration one. Luna had hummed when she saw him searching for the spell but never said anything. Neville figured he was going to teach the rest of the Defense group healing spells. Which he did, they may come in handy down the road.

  It took him two weeks to find the spell. He had snuck into Madam Pomphrey's office while she was tending to a moaning Hufflepuff who had walked into one of the twins' pranks. He had randomly grabbed a few loose books that were sitting on a chair. He tucked them under his cloak and darted out of the wing and to the Room of Requirement. The spell was in the second book of his stolen stash.

  He mastered the spell in a week. The room had provided him with dummies that needed healing. Once he mastered the spell correctly, he attempted working on it incorrectly. He found if you used the spell with a slashing motion, it shatters the bones into tiny pieces. If you jab it, it makes the bones vanish. When he combined some of the actions he got interesting results. If you started the spell with a swirl and ended it with a slash, the bone break in half and start growing the wrong way, causing the bones to grow tree-like limbs that broke through the muscle and skin. If you jabbed then swirled, the bones would vanish before starting to grow in different spots of the body. If the spell was spoken with a crisscrossing motion, all the bones would start to form together until all the bones in the body were a single one.

  The first time he used it on a living being was when he Faced Lucius Malfoy in the Department of Mysteries. He had vanished the man's leg when started chasing him for the orb. The man went to step on the limb only for it crumble into a pile beneath his weight. He had howled in pain. That, in turn, had Ginny looking to see what happened. She started to dry heavy when she saw his leg underneath his body. It was distorted and stretched in the wrong way.

  He had used it again when Bellatrix went to fire a spell towards Sirius and himself. Harry had thrown the spell with a crisscross. Her body instantly froze as her joints fused together. He could hear her attempting to scream as her jaw locked. Though he was sure, he guessed that she died when her ribs no longer moved, causing her to suffocate within her body. Sirius had given him a strange look when he saw what he had done, it turned to a horrified one when he explained it.

  It had its perks, Harry mused. It was entertaining to watch how Voldermort crumbled in on himself when he vanished his ribs and vertebrae. Yes, he had nightmares of a flopping Voldermort running towards him for the next few weeks, but the laughter he got from Tonks seemed worth it. Both Tonks and Harry had a strict talking to by Remus and Arthur. Tonks was told off for being childish. Harry was told off for the demented use of magic. Both seemed to ignore the scolding.

  Harry taught Ginny and Tonks the spell. They were the only ones who had an interest. Sirius had admitted its usefulness but had turned down the teachings. He mentioned already having too many nightmares, he really didn't want to add to them. Ron had attempted it, but Harry refused to let him learn the offensive version of the spell until he mastered the healing version. Hermione had straight out refused, as did Luna, Neville and the rest of the Defense group.

  When they had gone on the hunt for Horcruxes, Harry would simply vanish or toy with the bones of whoever came after them. Soon Voldermort's men refused to give chase after seeing their fellow men solidified and distorted. Voldermort's threats had lost some of their effects after many of his followers saw him in a makeshift brace that kept him upright.

  When the final battle at Hogwarts happened, there weren't as many dead members on Harry's side. There were plenty of Death Eaters with bones growing painfully out of their skulls. Many laid dead as the bones that grew off their splinter skulls went inward, penetrating the brain. Several had bones that grew inward piercing their lungs and other vital organs. Many had missing ribcages and pelvis. Those who were still alive after being hit with a misused spell were laying uselessly waiting for death.

  After the victory, the use of the spell was banned unless you had a license. Harry, being one of the holders, was the main teacher for the spell. Ginny and Tonks were also holders of the license. Tonk's rose to head Aurour as Harry split his time between the Aurour's office and his research. Ginny became a field medic, typically waiting behind the lines until she flew out to her patient. She used the spell both for healing and cursing.

  And to think, it was all because of an idiot.

** Harry spends three months studying under the tutelage of Lockhart. He reads all of Lockhart's books, takes copious notes on all of Lockhart's words, and practices every day. He learns a lot about Lockhart's theory on public relations.

Harry fails completely at learning because Lockhart can't replicate his mistake. Because Harry has spent so much time learning from Lockhart, completely incompetent, his actual learning suffers,

Lupin is disappointed the next year at how bad James' son is. Harry still goes to learn to patronus but is unable to manage more than a light mist.

Sirius is kissed. Buckbeak is executed.

Harry does fine in the first task in 4th year. Harry almost dies in the second task from Grindylows and is grateful when the organizers reveal the hostages were in no danger. Blatant manipulation is used to get Harry to the cup first. Voldemort returns; Cedric is killed. Voldemort kills Harry.

** Related, wish I remembered the name, but a year 7 fic had Harry get seriously injured fighting Nagini in the Chamber of Secrets. He didn't know healing spells for his crushed leg so he thought, "Maybe I can do Lockhart's bone thing and just drink some Skelegrow..." So he practiced on one of the Lestrange brothers he'd captured. I mostly worked.
