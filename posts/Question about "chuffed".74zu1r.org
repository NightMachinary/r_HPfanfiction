What, exactly, does "chuffed" mean? On [[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/chuffed][this]] page it has two definitions that directly contradict each other. First it has

#+begin_quote
  delighted; pleased; satisfied.
#+end_quote

Then it has

#+begin_quote
  annoyed; displeased; disgruntled.
#+end_quote

The disparity is really starting to bother me. I'm seeing it all the time in fics, but the meaning is never consistent.

Edit: it seems the prevailing definition is the first, so I'll just go with that from here on in. Cheers!


** I've never seen it used for "displeased" in contemporary writing.

** Without context of where you've read it I can't say for sure, but I would guess that it is generally a positive expression. The site you linkedsays that it was a negative meaning back in the 1800s.

Alternatively, they are using it as an alternative to "puff"? They siund kinda similar, and again, your link indicates that it was used tp descrive train movement. (Where Americans would say "puffed along the tracks", the British would say "chuffed along the tracks")

I think. Best I got.

** In modern English, it's nearly always pleased. Some people might say "I was chuffed off" to say they were annoyed, but it is very dated.

** Guess I'm just old school because I was certain that chuffed was negative.

** I'd say, almost always, it would be the first definition - although without context it's hard to say for sure.

Chuffed, to me at least, is a very proud emotion. Often you would be chuffed I about something you did/accomplished.

** I was well chuffed with myself for scoting the winning goal on Sunday.

Happy, proud or pleased.
