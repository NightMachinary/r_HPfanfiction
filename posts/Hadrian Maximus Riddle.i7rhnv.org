So, there was one of those Harry gets adopted by Voldemort fanfic. I think Harry's name was changed to Hadrian Maximus Riddle. So, he went to Durmstrang at first and then to Hogwarts for the T.W tournament. If any of you can remind me of its I'll be eternally grateful. (Ok, maybe not eternally but still) Thanks in advance :)
