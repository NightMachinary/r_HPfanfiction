** There is the Albus Potter series if you like next-gen stuff. It is a seven book series that kind of mirrors Harry's story. The author adds a ton of different types of magic. I really cannot recommend this series enough. Luckily for you, the author just finished the series last month so you don't have to wait for the end.

The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside).

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom, linkffn(3766574), has a complex and highly AU world with things like religion, though it might not be for everybody.

Also, seconding Wit of the Raven and Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome -- definitely two of my favourite fanfics, though it's a pity the former is abandoned.

linkffn(5755130), Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic, and linkffn(4563439), Ectomancer, are both rather massively AU, though also unfortunately abandoned. What You Leave Behind, linkffn(10758358), also fits in here.

** I really feel strange constantly recommending this series, but it really fits many requests.

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas.

The author really loves his detailed settings (not surprising considering he is a Nasu fan) and it really shows.

For example quite large part of the fic takes place in Mahoutokoro (fic was created before there was canon description of the school so it differs vastly) which here is not only name of the school, but also whole city under city, a magical community hidden under Kyoto. And we are shown how it differs from Hogwarts. The lack of Church's influence in Japan led to the more centralised and connected magical community and so practitioners of witchcraft (HP characters), members of Moonlit World (Nasuverse characters) and youkai mingle. And that leads to consequences like having techniques to deal with spiritual beings being still popular (as opposed to Britain were most of the fae were hunted down long ago), or methods of magical transports not being widely used (because everything is in one place).

Now we have Triwizard tournament in Durmstrang, which again differs quite a lot from Hogwarts, we had some sneak peeks at MACUSA and there is Potion Tournament soon with schools all over the world sending their candidates.

That's obviously only about things outside. We also learn a lot of things about magical Britain, be it on History of Magic lessons, or from other sources.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
