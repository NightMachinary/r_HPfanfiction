** In the absence of any actual recommendation here (seriously, I love the bot, but a link without comment doesn't qualify as a rec in my book), I'll give my thoughts (though, given the popularity of this story I doubt there are many who like this kind of story who have not already seen it)

If you've ever read anything else by kb0, you probably know what to expect. It's a fairly standard, low drama story with comfortable prose. It's from 2009, which is something that really needs to be borne in mind when looking at many of the features of the story. Lordships, incompetent Dumbledore, a Snape who is not really capable of saying anything more than 'arrogant brat just like your father' whilst sneering the lower half of his face off, and the Daphniest Ice Queen who ever did Daphne.

One of kb0's strengths is their ability to create contained stories of reasonable length, generally avoiding the sprawling epics often produced by writers who aren't really sure where they need to focus their efforts. However, kb0's weakness, in my view at least, is that everything is just too easy.

Malfoy, Dumbledore, Snape: they're all handled with an unreasonable ease, as Harry and Daphne outmanoeuvre them at every step. Even Voldemort is barely more than a footnote, and is quickly dealt with, with not even a hint of jeopardy for the heroes. The romance between Daphne and Harry is easy and without much in the way of conflict between the two. They both simply express everything that is important to them succinctly in words, and any momentary misunderstandings are quickly dealt with.

Ultimately, it's a wish-fulfilment fic which I enjoyed profusely when I first started reading fanfic. These days however, I find it rather bland and uninteresting due to the lack of conflict. I suspect that that lack of conflict is more of a feature than a bug, however. It's designed as wish-fulfilment, and if that's what you're looking for, that is what this story will provide.

  During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG
