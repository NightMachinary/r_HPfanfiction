Looking for a Harry fleur fanfic with heartbreak in it or something pretty sad, could also be like the alternate ending in Letters by TheEndless7


** It wasn't very heart breaking in The Alternative Ending of Letters just more realistic take that your not likely to find "The One" as a teenager and be with them forever.

The Life He Leads by GeneralStarfox also has a small fraction of Harry/Fleur Heartbreaker
