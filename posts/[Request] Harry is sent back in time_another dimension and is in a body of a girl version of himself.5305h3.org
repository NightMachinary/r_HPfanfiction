  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

*** Because people---including story characters---do a lot of assumptions based on someone's sex, and for some people switching characters' sex and seeing what could happen is entertaining.

Combine that with the thing about the character returning to the past or moving to a different dimension that quite some people like, and voil√†, you have this thread.
