Looking for fics which have either Harry having a normal life with his parents. This would probably mean no war with voldermort or the lack of a prophecy causing Harrys not to have a family and a normal life. Fics which are similar to Rowlings books in that they show harrys hogwarts years would be ideal. Thanks.

This is a repost as I basically just copied an earlier post I made but I just want to find some others than the ones suggested as I just devoured them. I've already read A rogue's bet, A Different beginning (which is superb) and its sequel
