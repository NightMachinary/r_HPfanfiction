I want the whole deal. The most terrible grammar, spelling, punctuation, give it all to me. Bonus points if the plot is non-existent. I need a good laugh.

Mouseover for translation: [[/s][Once upon a time Harry Potter decided that ponies were cool and he wanted a pony. So he went to Isis (the ancient egyptian goddess, not the terrorists) and said "I want a pony." Isis said "If you want a pony, you must please me." So, they went to the bedroom and played games all that week; at the end, Isis said, "Thanks for helping me complete my Pokedex, I will give you the power to create as many ponies as you desire." Harry was overjoyed and he went back to Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy came out and said "What's up, Scarhead?" But Harry was annoyed by that so he used his new power to turn Draco into his pony slave for eternity. The end, hope you liked, don't forget to review.]]

I wrote it, then put it into Google Translate, translated it into Zulu and back, then took out all the punctuation and capital letters except for H in Harry.

*** And getting on a bus (for 20p) with 'Sauruman/sarmuran from Lord of ring' who was also a 'tenager because it was past'.

And that's the first fucking chapter.

EDIT 1: Reporting in from chapter 4. For some fucking reason the houses are different but they're all like the original houses, like Ravenclaw and 'Hudlepuffle'. The spelling, if anything, gets worse. Also we have our middle-aged 'Bumbledorf' both driving the Express and being all Headmaster-y. His name is never spelled the same way twice, I just picked my favourite spelling.

EDIT 2: Chapter 5: 'Mcdongoldo'.

EDIT 3: 'Mcdongalo'.

EDIT 4: Chapter 6. The author has finally gotten the first letter of Dumbledore's name correct. The same cannot be said for the rest, though. Also the intrepid trio of Lupus, Saursman and McDongalol have decided to go and steal a silver dagger from 'Prof Snake' to stab a werewolf. Because reasons.

EDIT the last: The epic saga's final chapter. The fearsome wearwolf was defeated by 'hargrind' body-slamming it into a 'roke' which 'crakec his skul'. Also our home-boy (-girl?) 'mcGdonalg' got a good hit in with the silver dagger. She always was my favourite character in this story. Also lupius was bitten and was told, "You wil be OK but also CURSED!" which strikes me as the opposite of okay but all right. And then the story ends with the only sentence without a single spelling mistake: 'PART TWO COMING SOON!'

EDIT 2 electric boogaloo: In the sequel of 'Profesor Lupus' our heroes Saurman (or however the fuck his name is spelled now), Lupus and 'Mcodngla' go into the Hogwarts dungeons and decide to murder a ghost on their quest to kill 'Moudlermore' (Voldemort's father, because it was the past and he wasn't born yet. Duh.). Lipus uses a 'fliepdno' but misses, presumably because he choked on the pronunciation of 'flipendo'. Sarsman does absolutely nothing useful at all, because the ghost glared at him and he fell over and hurt his knees. Mcdongalos, tired of being shackled down by these imbeciles, decides to stop playing around and Avada Kedavra's the fuck out of the ghost (at least I think that's what 'avdranka debadrea' means). Unfortunately it doesn't work because the ghost is already dead but at least Mcodngla is actually doing something useful. Props to her. Then all three of them use the 'expextro petrolium' spell, and instead of the ghost catching fire, they summon ghost animals which murder the ghost. Problem solved. Except they still need to find and kill Moualdmore so that the school can come out of lockdown and 'Fumbleore' doesn't get killed. (The author seems to be working their way down the alphabet for the first letter of Dumbledore's name.)

And then the story ends because it's not been updated since 2013. The author has presumably either died of shame, or the epileptic seizure they were enduring as they wrote this thing. Or they grew up, who knows.

** linkffn(Blood Runes). While not as bad as My Immortal or some other ones on the thread, I wrote it as an angsty teen and I wasn't trying for comically bad.

** I've read some truly awful fics, many of which have no redeeming features at all. At least My Immortal is amusing at time, in the same way that watching fail videos on youtube is amusing. train crash analogy, etc. But there are plenty of stories out there that are just really bad, even without grammar and spelling problems. Like, Poison Pen is probably the worst fic I've ever read, but a lot of that is to do with the author(s) itself and the execution of the idea, and I feel like if the idea had been done by someone else, it would have been a serviceable story. But some stories are just beyond hope, such as - linkffn(7241534)
