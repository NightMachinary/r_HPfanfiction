Basically, I wanted to try my own version of the 40k crossover, 'Harry Potter and the God-Emperor of Mankind.' But with some major alterations:

Harry starts out during Dumbledores funeral, after the end of his life as the Emperor. He still fondly remembers his freinds, and still loves Ginny.

Voldemort is directly tied to the Chaos Gods. I shall not spoil how.

Imperial Remnants survive, that is all ships that were in the warp when the universe ended. They are led by High Admiral Spire and Lord Command Roboute Guilliman. The Eldar, Tau, and Chaos forces also survive, but they are less in number than even the Imperium.

Slaanesh also survives, and reawakens the other Chaos Gods.

Harry's goal in the story is multi-fold: Rally the remaining Imperial Forces, rebuild the imperium, find out what the hell is going on with Voldemort, destroy Chaos, and ensure that the grimdarkness of the far future never comes to pass.

What do you guys think? Would you read such a story?

Note: No, I am not attempting to get someone else to write this. You are welcome to, but I just need your thoughts on this one.
