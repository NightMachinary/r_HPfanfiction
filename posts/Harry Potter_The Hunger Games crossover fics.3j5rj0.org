** There's The Snow Queen from Darklooshkin, linkffn(8724634).

Female Harry, lost in time as a child and raised as the adoptive grand daughter of President Snow, summoned back to the Triwizard Tournament of an alternate Hogwarts. Great paranoid Hermione too, her reaction to the attempt to take her as a hostage is a sight to see - and compared to Rose Snow, she's the sane one.

** It seems to me like the only Harry Potter/Hunger Games crossovers with a decent length include the same thing. Snow selling out the victors. It's pretty annoying to me, and I see it as no different than the big 4 bashing from HP.

*** I actually found a decent one myself but it's the exact same plot but with Harry and Hermione in the place of Katniss and Peeta with Voldemort as Snow. The entire story plays out /exactly/ the same, it's infuriating.

Oh then there's the one that's Battle Royale but with Hogwarts people but unlike the above there's not even magic so it's literally identical.
