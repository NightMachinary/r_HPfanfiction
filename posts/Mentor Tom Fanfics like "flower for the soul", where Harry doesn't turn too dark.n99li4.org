#+begin_quote
  Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary on his first trip into Diagon Alley and finally sees someone he can look up to. Unfortunately, he's not quite right -- at least, not yet. Follow the unlikely duo across all seven continents as they embark upon a Grand Tour, finding knowledge, adventure, and maybe, just maybe, something like family. NOT a Tom x Harry story!

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
#+end_quote

After the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry ends up bumbling his way into becoming a bit of a protégé of Voldemort. It goes into /why/ Voldemort is Voldemort and into her rise to power.

** Edit: just wanna mention, most of these DO involve Het or Slash. Sorry if that's not really your cup of tea!

I personally categorise all these as either Light!Harry or Grey!Harry.

linkffn(The Darkening Of Your Soul by MaeglinYedi) - Involves second chances, a bit of bashing and Slash. I love the premise.

linkffn(Moratorium by Darkpetal16) - I absolutely ADORE this one. Fem!Harry with a very unique take on Guardian/Mentor!Tom(s)

linkffn(Riddled by Killing Curse Eyes) - Again, it's Fem!Harry. Diary!Tom is the Guardian/Mentor.

linkffn(Dance with the Devil by Ratkinzluver33) - Tom wants his sanity back, Horcrux!Hunt style. ...he's also in Harry's head.

linkffn(Destiny: The Beginning by Flowerscanbloomorwilt) - My definition of Tom, The Unwanted, Toxic, Manipulative, Sorta Mentor!

linkffn(Meddling of a Mischief Maker by Athey) - They're more like Equals in this fic, but Tom does help Harry a lot. Also Slash.

linkffn(An Idle Mind Is The Devil's Playground by night flame miko) - Letters are exchanged; Voldy grows fond. Kinda Crack.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.
