We all know the Death Eaters that usually have a starring role, such as the Lestranges, Crouch Junior, Rookwood, Karkaroff, Wormtail, and Antonin Dolohov. But I've read few fics that really dig into the backstories and talk about lesser known Death Eaters, such as the Carrows, Yaxley, the Averys, Evan Rosier, and Wilkes, or OC Death Eaters.


** Mulciber is a fairly major character in [[/u/ScottPress]]'s linkffn(Lesser Evils) and from what I saw in the last chapter (or penultimate chapter, if you call the epilogue a chapter) he is only going to become more so in the sequel.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive.

** Prince of Slytherin has some of the most intriguing Death Eaters I have read. They have actual ability and power instead of being unforgivable-casting-canon-fodder.

** The two Carrows got some exposures in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146). [[/spoiler][Since Wormtail got locked up early, they were the ones looking for Voldemort, freeing Barty Jr, and providing comic relief on the bad guys' side]].

**** I remember this one scene where Amycus got pissed off at La Pantera and she flung him down the staircase of the temple they were at.
