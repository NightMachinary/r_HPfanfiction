Looking for fics start just before the first war, can end when Harry is attacked or earlier.

Main character can be anybody, though I'd prefer focus point spread to people in that era more equally than focusing on one or two popular characters.

I want to read fics that describe the atmosphere change. people are enjoying their summer time, then attacks emerged, then at some point of time every thing turns into chaos, death and torture everywhere, people gone missing, etc. I also prefer to read that characters act more “realistic”. For example if marauders are main characters, they are still young and they will have fear, they will be stressed, they will suspect each other, you get that. The depressing and terrifying part of a war. A “you friends can be found dead any day” feeling.

No restrictions on pairings. Slash, non-slash, all welcome.

Thanks!

Edit: Forgot to add no time travel.
