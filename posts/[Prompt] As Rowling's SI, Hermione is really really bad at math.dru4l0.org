** “Is McGonagall as bad with numbers as you?”

“No. Why?”

“The schedule she gave you has three classes at 9 o'clock.”

** It's not being bad a maths. It's not being unable to remember how to integrate a sine function, which is fine, few people need to know that.

At this level, it not maths, it's simple common sense masquerading as maths. And it's not being bad at it, it's being indifferent to it.

**** I think a Hermione who knows all the advanced math like integrating a sine function but doesn't really apply any of it to basic relevant problems like how to arrange sensible work hours.

******* She didn't mention Rowling once though.

Honestly, Rowling herself pokes fun at it and geography, it's not like it's a character flaw.
