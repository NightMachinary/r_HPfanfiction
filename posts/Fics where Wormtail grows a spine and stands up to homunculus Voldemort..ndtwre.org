Wormtail might deserve all the bad things that happen to him in the series but I still can't help but feel bad for him during his time in GoF. It's basically an abusive relationship: Voldemort consistently toys with him only revealing to him parts of the plan, tortures and threatens him, constantly reminds him that no one other than him will ever take him, constantly shits on him by calling him stupid, coward, useless. As someone who has narrowly avoided what could have been an abusive relationship but - and actually for once thanks to reddit - I spotted it early one, I cannot help but feel pity for him. He seems in such a hopeless situation that most would prefer to take their lives than deal with that. However as Voldemort is still in a powerless homunculus form, Wormtail could fight back if pushed over limits. I was wondering if you knew of such fic. Thank you in advance.


** I think it would be great to read a fanfic where after being belittled for so long, Wormtail deliberately fucks up Voldemort's resurrection potion or general care for Voldemort's little baby homunculus form. After all, if you're relying on a “useless” “stupid” “coward” isn't it a given conclusion that such a person will make a fatal error in your care? :)

** That would certainly change things, with Wormtail dead Crouch Jr. would have to do all his work and wouldn't be free to impersonate Moody.

How much is up to the author though.\\
They could probably still get Harry in the tournament via Crouch Sr. Though ensuring he wins would be harder.\\
Or perhaps they'd go for a different tactic, either Voldemort would be forced to use someone else's blood, which means Harry is still protected, but also means nothing ties Harry to life so he might have to due for real to destroy that horcrux in his head, or they'd have to snatch Harry at another point, perhaps on platform 9 and 3/4 or while he's shopping in diagon alley the next year.

*** Well Wormtail shows some meek signs of rebellion during the first chapter when Barty Jr was still imprisoned by his dad so I would expect the turn to occur during that time rather than later on when he's completely broken. Still Voldemort had the information but in homunculus form he couldn't really move without help so he'd need to revert to his wraith form in order to get to BCJ and would still need to be careful not to be detected by Crouch Sr (who is an influential ministry official and hinted to be quite a powerful wizard) or Winky. Also Wormtail could pay his life debt by warning Harry about the TWT plot and then going into hiding since now he is wanted now by Voldemort, his former friends and the ministry.

** Yeah, but if he fought back Voldemort would kill him for sure eventually.

*** I mean, yeah, but that happened anyway. When wormtail was reminded of the life debt to Harry, he hesitated, and voldemort killed him with his silver hand

*** Hi. This is actually a request for a fic not a discussion prompt. We know what happened in canon but I would be interested to see if someone had explored the above scenario.
