I was recently reading the web novel [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/lord-of-the-mysteries/][Lord of Mysteries]] and thought that it would be interesting to have a crossover of the same with Harry Potter. For those who haven't read the novel in LoM, the people with powers are called Beyonders. They achieve this power through potions and rituals. They key idea of powers in LoM is that everyone follows a particular path of how their power grows i.e., their power growth has a [[https://lord-of-mysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Pathways][theme]]. At each stage you have to take a different potion perform a ritual etc.

I was thinking of something similar in Harry Potter with the base wizard being moderately powerful say 5th year level. But higher level magic being out of their capabilities unless they pick a particular pathway. I was wondering if people had any suggestions on what would the story go like. What would be a path taken by Dumbledore, Voldemort or our main characters.


** I wish to join Harry Potter with so many anime/manga it's crazy. I think Harry Potter is much closer to modern Japanese storytelling than a western one. If I see a full Harry Potter anime from start to finish then I'll live happily ever after....... Until the next thing catches my interest anyway.
