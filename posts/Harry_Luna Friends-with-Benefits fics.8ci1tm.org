As much as I ship Harry and Luna, and as much as I like to see fics where they are sweethearts / soulmates, I'd like to try something a little different. Does anyone out there know of any stories where Harry is a single adult who just can't seem to make his romantic relationships work, so then Luna offers an arrangement where they have casual sex together? Sex scenes can be either detailed or implied (although my personal preference would be detailed), and a fic that realistically depicts the emotional tensions involved in FwB arrangements would be a nice plus. *No underage please.*

*** Luna is very hard to write well without making her character very different.

I've tried to write some H/L in the past but I don't think I was particularly successful. The closest I've come in what I actually still like is the one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10734495/1/Luna-s-Animal][Luna's Animal]], but that isn't what OP is requesting.

**** Hard to write well, indeed, but also I had a very specific request which I suspect might be difficult to fill. There are a handful of stories out there where Harry and Luna have casual sex, but they tend to turn into boyfriend and girlfriend very quickly after that. Overall, fic writers seem to be more likely to make Harry and Hermione FwBs than Harry and Luna.

Still, I think someone out there could do it in a way that was in keeping with Luna's character. She's definitely unconventional enough to make this sort of offer to somebody, and she also certainly considers Harry a trustworthy friend (as he considers her).

  Post-DH No-Epilogue. Harry and Hermione are great friends, the best of friends... what happens when they decide to give their friendship some benefits? It's a good idea until it becomes a bad idea and it becomes bad really, really fast...hhr please r&r

*** Looks good enough (although I may regret saying that later). I'll admit, I wasn't really looking for something where things got all polyamorous - I more had in mind something where H/L were in a monogamous fuck-buddy relationship - but given how difficult it is to find /anything/ with this theme, I guess a story like this will have to do.

**** Uhh chapter twoish. It's not quite FWB but it's as close as you'll prolly find. Very much a smut with plot fic. It's not just him and Luna though
