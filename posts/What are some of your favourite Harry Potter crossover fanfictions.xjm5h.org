*** In addition to these:

The Denarian Trilogy by Shezza. HP/Dresden Files, complete.

Awaken Sleeper by Water Mage. HP/Dresden, in progress.

Harry Potter: An Ancient's Journey by Keiran Halcyon. HP/Stargate, in progress. A bit of a guilty pleasure, but epic in scale. First 4 chapters or so are no indication of the rest of the story.

*** I second [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat_Green_Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]]! Also, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3551453/1/][Harry and the Magic Factory]] by DisobedienceWriter isn't exactly a crossover, but it's a kind of bizarre, kind of cute Harry Potter spin on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
