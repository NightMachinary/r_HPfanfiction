Here is a list of spells that Hermione Granger has cast over the course of 7 Books and 8 Movies in Alphabetical Order. I have not included spells from the games, Cursed Child or anywhere outside of the Books and Movies. I have only included spells we have actually seen her cast and not ones that she should be able to use (spells taught to younger years like Vera Vorto) or ones she probably knew but never cast (Liberacorpus, Impedimenta,etc)

I have tried my hardest to include all the spells she cast but if there is something missing or if I added a spell that she did not cast; let me know and I will add or remove it.

If you want to know when she cast a particular spell just ask.

I will be posting a list of spells for Ron as well. Hope this helps.

*Edit-* I have removed Dissendium from Hermione's list. It was there because of a mess up I made.

Turns out the word Dissendium was used in two contexts in the series.

One was the password to the statue.

And the other was as a spell used by Harry in DH pt 1 in an attempt to destroy the Locket. It was the first one he cast that sent the locket flying and the log smoking.

Thank You to [[https://www.reddit.com/u/ChangeMe4574/][u/ChangeMe4574]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/u/S1lm4r1l/][u/S1lm4r1l]] for pointing this out.
