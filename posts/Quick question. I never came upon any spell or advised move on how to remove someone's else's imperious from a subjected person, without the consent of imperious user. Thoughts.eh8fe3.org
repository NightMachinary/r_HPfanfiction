#+TITLE: Quick question. I never came upon any spell or advised move on how to remove someone's else's imperious from a subjected person, without the consent of imperious user. Thoughts?

** I believe other than being disarmed during the time of the curse, there wouldnt be a way I haven't seen the cruciartus curse be stopped either (that I can remember)

So maybe since it's an unforgivable curse it acts differently

** Well, based on Philosopher's Stone I'd suggest killing the caster.

*** In DH, the Thief's Downfall did end the Imperius curse that Harry had cast on a Goblin, though it's not very clear if it's because it touched the Goblin of himself. When they left the bank, they met Yaxley that was trying to hide in a crack but I don't remember if it was part of his own order, or if he was free of the Imperius at that time.

**** The books state that Thief's Downfall removes all spells on the person. Both Yaxley and the goblin broke free from the imperius at this time, so Thief's Downfall does end the imperius. If I am not mistaken, it is also an accepted part of fanon? I'm pretty sure I've read fics where time travelling Harry says that he can't rob Gringotts using his old plan because he knows of Thief's Downfall now.

** The fake Moody only describes the killing curse as being unblockable and having no counter curse. I assume that both the Imperius and the Cruciatus have counter curses that stop the curse from affecting you further but won't heal the damage already done (if any); but that's an assumption on my part.

Canon isn't clear on the topic, just that the regular Shield Charm wouldn't stop it.

*** I don't think the imperius has a counter, it would be far less dangerous if it did, just regularly cast it on people, you'd never take over the ministry with a counterable imperius

** Cast the Imperius on yourself so you're under your own Imperius curse and other people's Imperius won't affect you
