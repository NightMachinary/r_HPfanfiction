Recently I've been trying to find some good Harry/OC and in most of the threads about that pairing someone recommends [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2920229/1/][Eclipse of the Sky]]

With the recommendation often comes a warning that the beginning is kind of boring, but it's worth going through because the story is great. It is a fic that has over 1 million words so I do understand that it would be really hard to make all of it interesting, but I'm actually at chapter 30 and I don't really know how to get through it. I would really love to read it but I'm just losing interest.

So my question for those who read it/are reading it: At what point does the story evolve into the story everyone's praising?

PS. No spoilers please


** Haven't read it. But 1 mil words? 30 chapters in? It should be good by now.

That's 2/3 the number of words in GRRM's ASOIAF for reference. That's longer than LOTR. By almost a factor of two.

If you write that many words it better be interesting, hell.

**** I think my google'd quick fact included the hobbit.

Still. 30 chapters? That's an entire novel by now! The reader should be drawn in, surely!

Even like...Tolstoy isn't that slow!

** I haven't read it, although I'm following firefawn's new Harry/Daphne story. But from what I understand, the author is rewriting chapters 5-25 of Eclipse of the Sky because they hate them, as it was their first story and written when they were younger. Whatever that's worth for the rest of the story.

*** Oooh, I didn't know Firefawn was writing a Harry/Daphne story. I'll need to check that out, thanks!

But yeah- there was a /huge/ hiatus between the first thirty or so chapters and the rest of it. I picked it up right around when she started writing it again. I ended up losing it around chapter 50-ish.

**** OironTheRed you missed out my friend. Zombies, sharks and the sexiness. You should PM the writer and tell them why you lost interest. I know they are trying to improve it so that might help them out. I'm going to reread the beginning for them once they finish writing and give them some feedback, but they are super open to it. You still missed out. Harry starts tearing Death Eaters limb from limb.

***** Nah, nah, I read the zombies- that was cool. Also got a bit of the sexiness.

I didn't tell her- I was pretty regularly communicating with the author for ten or so chapters- why I lost interest because it's not really a problem with her writing so much as it's my attention span that's the issue. I'm not ADD, but honestly you're gonna get me for 500k words or so at a time. But yeah, I know the author is open to feedback- iirc Firefawn was really nice.

Fun fact: one chapter had 'damn' in it /constantly/ when it was first posted. I guess the author just had 'damn' on the mind, because literally every other sentence was 'damned' this or 'damned' that. It was very amusing to read.

** If you are not enjoying yourself, you have no obligation to keep reading. It's a lesson I learned a while ago with proper books: it is not your fault for not enjoying it, and you owe no one.

If the author hasn't captured your interest after 30 chapters: too bad, but happens. Probably time to move on.

*** The only reason I wrote this post was because I'm trying to read the story for the third time (and the other times I've stopped reading earlier) because I really like the idea, and I think there's much potential there. Maybe it's just that my expectations are too high.

I know that I have no obligation of reading the full story, it's just that I really like the set up, and I wouldn't want to drop it if it becomes better soon. I think I'm just going to read another few chapters and if it doesn't get better I'm going to drop it.

**** I just wrote a bunch of pros and cons for you, but I'd read a few chapters past where you are at. You will see the writer's actual writing style then, and if you like it that's great, but if you don't then don't continue. This may be one of my favorite stories but it's not everyone's favorite style.

*** Hermione has been captured and the deatheaters extracted the information about the order's headquarters. They didn't get the precise location because of the Fidelius charm, but they know it's in London around Grimmuald Place.

Meanwhile Harry and Kally are inside the headquarters and are preparing to fight the deatheaters that are 'having fun' in London trying to lure the Order's members out of headquarters.

There's also this whole subplot of the Irish president and his daughter, but I'm gonna be honest, I don't understand what's going on there

** Around the chapter you're reading , if you don't like it after reading couple chapters after 30 , story might not be for you.

However , I'm kind of biased here. I loved the story from ch1 , Harry/OC dynamics is main part of that. If you don't like characters by now, don't see how you're going to enjoy the plot tbh.

You could try other firewan HP/DP story and see how you like it. It might be that the writing style doesn't suit you

*** I had the opposite issue. I didn't enjoy the story at first, but started getting into it at around chapter 30. That Daphne/Harry story is shaping up to be even better. I just hope the flames the writer is getting doesn't have her quit altogether.

**** Yeah , sadly the story has some abandon red flags. Which would be super dissapointing , because I don't re-read many stories multiple times , especially the ones 1m+ words.

​

ah well ,at least there's still Haphne story if worst comes. I enjoy it less , but that's only because no Kally. It's still amazing story. This time high quality since ch1

** At 30 chapters, if it's not interesting now, it likely never will. There's an author note dated to 11/9/19 that chapters 4-12 are undergoing heavy reworking, so you might have been put off by that. But unless the overarching structure is interesting and merely the execution of it poor, I don't see how just a reworking and not a full rewrite will change how interesting the story is. Also, did they revise the first three chapters? Still riddled with typos and orbs, /retch/. (Also, not entirely fair to judge this early, but it's a love at first sight story and I don't really like those, especially this story's execution of it.)

** Honestly, if you don't like it by now you probably won't.

I /did/ like the parts you're reading and I still ran out of steam around chapter 51 or so.

Sometimes you just can't deal with the way an author writes, and that doesn't necessarily reflect negatively on either of you. I don't like the way a lot of very popular authors write so I kinda live by that sentence.

** You are SO close to this getting just...amazing.

The point that got me hooked to this story was right after the fight at Number 12 Grimmauld. I believe that's when the writer came back to writing after a decade and a half or something nuts like that. So it picks up right when they get back to Hogwarts (Chapter 32 I believe). The action, the romance...it all picks up then. Also, this writer has some of the by far the “best” romance scenes later on in the story I've ever read.

I saw someone mention Chapter 30 is 1/3rd of the way through the story. It really isn't. The later chapters are significantly longer. The earlier chapters are far shorter.

Keep in mind I am biased. Once I got hooked to this story I was hooked. I really like the way they write (there is a distinct difference starting around chapter 33). When I say hooked I mean I couldn't put this down. I was late to work from losing track of time and walking around like a sleep deprived zombie for a week. Seriously, nothing beats Harry going nuts on Voldemort and a zombie apocalypse done right.

Things to keep in mind....I'm the sort of reader that likes Stephen King's super long novels. I love his writing style, and he can be a bit verbose. Firefawn is similar. If you liked Firefawn's new story (the Harry/Daphne one) that's a good example of how all the later chapters of Eclipse of the Sky are written (around 32 and onwards). Firefawn has a VERY particular writing style. You either love it or you hate it.

The other thing to keep in mind....there's a reason that most popular novels are shorter. Very few readers have the steam to power through long stories. This is a million plus word story. It is LONG. That automatically means most readers aren't going to make it all the way through it (or any story) that is this long.

That being said, the author is VERY transparent that there are some typos in the story and problems with the beginning. If you happen to be a bit “uppity” and expect all fanfiction (which I hope to remind everyone is a hobby that these people aren't being paid for) to be perfect, then you might get irritated with the occasional typo in this. This writer has churned out something like 700,000 words in a year and a half. Think about that. A year and a half! Of course they will have typos. They've said they don't have a beta. The fact that there aren't more is a testament to how good they actually are. I just can't rag on a story for stuff like that. I have a life outside of fanfiction and I expect fanfiction writers to as well. I don't get the whole ‘judgmental' vibe a lot of readers online have for typos, for what it is worth. So typos (as long as they aren't excessive and occurring every other paragraph) don't bother me much. This story doesn't have enough to bother me or even flag my radar.

I did actually start PMing the author after I got hooked to this, and that made me like the story even more. They are truly just one of the nicest human beings you could imagine on the internet. Seriously, I sent them a constructive criticism and they responded so nicely I was impressed. They thanked me a bunch and made a few edits. It's one of the reasons I recommend this so often. It's a good story with a non-arrogant author.

Ziela, overall when it comes to a story you have to like the writing style, the plot, and any quirks the writer has. I hope I've laid out the quirks they have (not having a beta) and a fair assessment of the overall likelihood of if you'll enjoy it. If you don't enjoy those three things and don't favor super long stories, you probably won't. If you do like those things, it may be the best thing you've ever read for free. Out of free stories and books I've paid for this is in my top 25.

I think she is actually just rewriting the beginning. She's keeping the plot the same overall but changing the initial approach. I do think she rewrote 1 to 3 just to get them posted up but she hasn't proofread anything (last time I asked her anyway as I've PMed her to ask when the rewrite is done so I can take a look).
