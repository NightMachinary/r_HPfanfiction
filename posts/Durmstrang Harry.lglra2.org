I'm looking for a decent collection of Harry at Durmstrang stories, plot doesn't matter, but I'd prefer completed fics 100k and up.

There is one in particular I'm looking for where he is a prodigy and Durmstrang is about only doing end of year projects, he ends up going to Hogwarts for the TriWizard. Wish I could remember more, but I do know it was abandoned, but still a good read.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

***** Make sure you read the extra chapters at DLP, it's still unfinished, but more of that story is a very good thing. I think there are 5 or so not posted on ffn.
