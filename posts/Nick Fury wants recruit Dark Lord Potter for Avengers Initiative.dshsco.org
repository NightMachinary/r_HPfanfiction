We saw so many fics where good Harry joins Avengers what about dark Harry joining the avengers?


** The only problem with this is that both Fury and Stark actively scuttle prospective members who don't have a reasonable morality to them. General Ross tried to pitch the Abomination as an Avenger, and Stark shut him down.

*** The abomination is a horrible comparison. Hulk is a decent avenger because he understands orders, even in his original form. The Abomination can't change back to a human, and he's extremely violent. Harry Potter, even as a dark lord, wouldn't be uncontrollably violent or insane.

** A lot of complaints on this sub forum seems to boil down to the complainer having a lack of imagination.

--------------

"Director Fury, Agent Trelain has returned through the portal with a message, sir."

Fury sighed. The Hydra portal. What a mess that turned out to be. When his superiors heard that Shield had obtained a portal to an alternate reality without any of this madness they wanted to exploit it.

None of our advanced technology, they planned to create a tech company on the other end and use the portal to jump ship to a world without any of the mess that ours is. A lifeboat for the rich and influential.

The wizards put a stop to that real quick. Rather, the wizard did. Harry Potter, or as our agents had learned from other sources, 'The Dark Lord'. A revolutionary from a hidden society of homo magi. He has strong opinions on what a government should and should not be doing.

"Send him in."

Soon enough the agent was in his office. "Agent Trelain reporting, sir."

"What was the message?"

The agent handed Nick an envelop with a wax seal. Nick cocked an eyebrow before taking it and opening the letter.

/I have enough problems keeping my own governments from turning into rancid cesspits of corruption. I don't need another world's added on top of that. Send a message if you're invaded by aliens or something equally stupid and I might consider it./

/Harry Potter/

It's about what Nick was expecting. Still, Potter seems to be a man of honor. He'll regret writing that hyperbole about aliens when they do come knocking at our door again.

Harry is labeled a Dark Lord by the Ministry because he used lethal force in the war and afterwards when he was attacked by dead-enders post-war. Too many rich, influential, Purebloods died so their families got Harry exiled or whatever.

Fury and Crew get down to "Dark Lord Potter" on their shitlist and are really confused when they actually meet him and he's just some dude who defended himself against would-be murderers.

  Harry Potter is fed up of all the attention that comes with being the saviour of the Wizarding world. Natasha Romanoff is the best field agent SHIELD have. How does an assassin deal with a Man who won't stay dead. Basically a fluff piece, could be expanded on at a later date.

In reality, he went to university post-Hogwarts and then on to med school. He's a doctor working with Medecins Sans Frontieres in refugee camps.
