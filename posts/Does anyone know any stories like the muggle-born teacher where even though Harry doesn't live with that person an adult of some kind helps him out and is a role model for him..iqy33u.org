** - “The Teacher by RMoors” linkffn(10008715) ... not exactly, but close enough?
- “Self-study by TheWizzard” linkao3(12915570)

There was one with his Muggle teacher in fact kidnapping him from Dursleys to save him from them, but I cannot find it.

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.

  It's 1986 and through a series of lies Remus has got himself a job as a teacher at his local primary school. Unbeknownst to him, this happens to be the school that a young and isolated Harry Potter attends with his thuggish cousin, Dudley. Can Remus and Harry save each other from loneliness or will the fragile world Remus has built for himself come tumbling down?

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

** Linkao3(it's green by Doodled93) fantastic, poignant story with unique point of view - it grows as Harry grows. Harry finds adult that is distantly supportive and slowly that leads to big changes in his life with Dursleys. I just love this fic, sadly it's unfinished and most likely abandoned. Still a worthwhile read.

  Harry grows up working on his Aunts' Garden and develops a love for it, meeting Samuel and eventually Max, who gives him a Mark of his own. This Mark is changing him, making him more different than he already was, and he loves it.NOTE:Under revisions. 1-17-17. Last arc will be posted once all revised.
