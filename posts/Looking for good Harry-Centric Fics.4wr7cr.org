Looking for good Harry-centric fics that are being updated semi-regularly (updated since the start of June). Anything WIP that hasn't been updated in a while is likely to be followed, then ignored until I get the email notification. If it's complete and/or often recommended, it's likely I've read it.

I'd prefer that any pairing with Harry be heterosexual, but have no preference on which girl(s). Any crossovers would generally have to be kept pretty much primarily in the HP world, or be written so that no knowledge of the other -verse is needed. Exceptions are Star Wars, the Dresden Files and Mass Effect, cause I know enough about them to struggle by.

Apart from that, anything goes. I don't mind if it's romance, action, drama, or mindless smut. The main criterion is that it's good. Thanks!


** HP: Raised by the Tonks' linkffn 11727180 I'll hopefully get to posting again this Friday. Just needs three more scenes done. One each day and it'll go to my beta for clean up.

Not sure if this will be your cuppa tea, as I'll be starting in first year and going up from there. Next update should be this Friday, depends on how much work I'll be doing with the Home renovations. But next month I should definitely be updating on a bi-weekly basis. I feel like I should mention that it gets betaed, later on, he, for whatever reason, ignores the pile of chapters before he started betaing my writing :| Feel like I should ask him to do one per week once I start posting again.

EDIT: Merged two posts together. Did not notice that it was the same thread... awkward.

  Follow Harry as he is rescued by Andromeda, and given a better, happier childhood. Pairings to be added as they are revealed. NOTE! Manipulative-Dumbledore. Scheming-Molly.

****** So far, almost nonexistent. And I honestly don't plan on taking it all the way to crazy town like most fics are. Most if not all of it should be over with by the end of Fourth year. At least that's the plan, and it won't be a truly big thing. I feel like most fics that have these things almost make that the main plot and Voldemort ends up being a subplot that sorta pops up every now and then.

******* Yeah if its mild then I'll still give the fic a shot. My main issue with it is when people turn Dumbledore and The Wealsys into some ridiculous evil one dimensional cartoon caricatures whose only purpose in the story is to shit on those characters.

Also quick heads up your first sentence has a random line break in the middle of it. You might want to fix that as it could turn people off from the story immediately even though it was probably a one off accident.

Also I'm not 100% sure of this, but the next 2 sentences seem to have tenses that don't match each other which reads awkwardly for me. I think either the third sentence should be changed to past tense with "was" instead of "is" or the second sentence should be changed to present tense, e.g. "How Dumbledore thinks it makes" and then an "is" at the end instead of the "was". It might be fine as is though I am not 100% sure of the rule there.

******** Yeah, I've been told that the first chapter is particularly bad :| but it gets better after. I was thinking too much on getting the 'jumbled thoughts' sort of feel to it that I ended up with particularly bad grammar, I hadn't even sent it trough Grammarly. Even now, my beta hasn't gotten the time to go over my older chapters. I think he started beta halfway trough the currently posted chapters.

As I said in another topic here, There's making a character villainous, and there's bashing. Most fics I've read that actually told you it was bashing threw in a line or two of Ron/Draco/Snape/Dumbledore/Molly/Ginny/RandomCharacter nr 20 trying and failing to do something once or twice a chapter. I won't do that. At the very least if I do, it'll serve a purpose beyond, a barely even there, comedic purpose.

** Linkffn(The Lesser Kindness) is a fic where the HP cast is reborn/reimagined in the Witcher setting. It doesn't have anything to do with the game. It is literally using the characters from HP and inserting their personalities, and tweaking their Job Descriptions to fit interesting plots in the Witcher universe.

From the author that brought you The Wizard of Harrenhall comes linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter). Don't let the title fool you. It doesn't have anything to so with the lords/nobility nonsense. It is a story wherein the MC never lost the wonder for magic.

YMMV with Linkffn(Warm Shadows by Storm0fCrows). It is a JL crossover that is laying the ground work for the whole fics' plot at the moment. It is so-so IMo.

Along with The Difference One Man Can Make, linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage1988) is another great ASOIAF crossover that stays true to the series' theme: backstabbing.

Linkffn(FateProphecy Break by Wrathkal) is a good read with proper character progression. It is primarily in the HP setting. A Fate/Stay Night crossover that isn't an overpoweredMC. Too bad it hasn't updated for a while now.

  At the age of twenty-seven Harry Potter had a good thing going for him with the DEO, decent pay, odd hours, a good chance for advancement; What else could a Slytherin ask for?... Maybe a few days that didn't force him into questioning his sanity.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an interesting life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. AU featuring HP characters if they were born into the Witcher world.

** I like Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235), though you may have already read it since it gets recommended a decent amount.

Its currently on break while the author plans year 3, but it was being updated most weeks previously. And the author said they will start posting year 3 in September.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL.
