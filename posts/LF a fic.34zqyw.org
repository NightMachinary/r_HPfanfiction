I'm looking for a fic that starts off with Harry being dared to go steel Susan Bones' underwear after Harry and some of the quittich team have too much to drink, but he ends up not doing it. I know that this request is a bit vague and for that I'm sorry.


** What do you mean, steel her underwear? Is this some kind of Hogwarts prank? What's funny about metalized underwear?

*** It was a dare from the twins. I remember he used his cloak and the map to get there. I remember that he ended waking Susan and telling her he "could not take away her feelings of safety"

**** it was a joke with steel and steal, with steel referring to the metal alloy between iron and tin(?) and steal meaning to take without permission

*** I read the whole thing. Not sure if I liked it. I'm kinda shell-shocked from it for some reason, sitting here confused as to wether it was good or horrible. Send doctors.

**** I honestly could not remember much about it except for the one scene. I knew the fic was... unique to say the least, but other than that I couldn't remember much else.
