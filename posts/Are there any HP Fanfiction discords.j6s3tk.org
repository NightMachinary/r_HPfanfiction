I just left one with really childish ownership, and it's the only one I've found. I'd like to go to a different discord on the same topic, if possible.


** "HP Fanfiction Club" is one. I enjoy it. I thought about making one with less emphasis on ships and more focus on writing, theorizing, and plotting, but I doubt anyone would be interested.

*** Any others? I would be interested in such a server as you have decribed, which means other people probably would be as well.

**** There's [[https://fanfictalk.com/][FanFicTalk]] but it's broadening its focus beyond HP FYI.

Maybe I'll make a server just for the hell of it. If I can figure it out.

** This sub has a discord. It's in one of the buttons on the sidebar, near the one that says 'IRC' (I have literally no idea what IRC means, but I assume it's similar to Discord).

** I like the HP tumblr creative collab discord - there are chats held every week or so on specific topics. There's more info and the schedule on [[https://hillyminne.tumblr.com/post/631252406770024449/harry-potter-online-events][tumblr]]!
