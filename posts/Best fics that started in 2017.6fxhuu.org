linkffn(Saviour of Magic by Colt01) - rewrite of author's first story Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord, it's started to be different from chapter 13. It's slightly darker and more mature than the first.

linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord) - time-travel

linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence) - time-travel

linkffn(Fear the Coming Darkness by I LIKE FEAR 1-2) - horror story, multi pairing but still intriguing.

linkffn(In Darkness, Bound to the Light by ElMarquis) - it's Lotr/HP crossover and oneshot but still worth to read.

linkffn(The Swallow and the Dragon by Flameraiser) - The Witcher/HP crossover

  Harry is doing everything he's supposed to be doing: working a job and taking care of his wife and three kids. The problem? He's utterly unfulfilled. One day, Ron shows him a Muggle romance book with some striking (and not-so-subtle) similarities to Harry's life. Will going in search of the woman who penned these stories turn his life upside down... or right-side up? Slash, SS/HP.
