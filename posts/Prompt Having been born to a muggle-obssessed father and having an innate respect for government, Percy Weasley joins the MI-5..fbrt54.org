Voldemort's return wreaked havoc on his personal life as he has to distance himself from his family to spy on the Ministry more efficiently.

**** I would love! this. Just imagine Mycroft and Percy drinking tea or some shit and complainig about their irresponsible siblings. But at the same time I want them both to be super neat and proper in all that they do and discuss stuff ala thickness of cauldrons whi√∂e they stand in an elevator to go to a super important meeting or so

***** That sounds awesome! :D

I'm also a sucker for identity porn and similar things, so I'd love Mycroft being suspicious of the weird things happening around Percy (be it him using magic or technology suddenly failing when he's around) and Percy acting absolutely clueless.

****** Yeah! We need to find someone who writes this. I also love the notion that Mycroft can't find anything because Percy is just so acurate about everything but it once got really close when Bill visited him at work or smth
