So during the holidays, I was catching up and reading some fanfics I found by browsing. Currently the WIPs I am reading are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13507192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Ashes-of-Chaos]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/221/New-Blood]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24721513]] (sarcasm and slytherin)

I would like to read something similar in the vein and am up to recommendations even if it is abandoned. Basically, anything worldbuilding, politics heavy, would be nice.

On the side, if it was either wrong BWL(WBWL) or non BWL, would be fine too!

Thank you ahead of time!


** linkao3(22220911) has what you're looking for.

linkffn(7613196) + sequels. Pureblood Pretense has incredible worldbuilding. It doesn't have much 'politics' in the sense these other fics do--Wizengamot stuff, political dealmaking and maneuvering, etc, but the fundamental conflicts of the story are mostly political.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18224369]]) You might like this series. The first book is a more rational TMR attending Hogwarts; the second is after he becomes Minister for Magic.

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)
