As the title asks, how big of a change to Harry Potter canon would there be if Severus had instead been Severa? (And yes, that is literally the female version of the name Severus. Latin is funky like that.)


** I'd say very much. I don't think Marauders would be very likely to bully her so much or even at all because power dynamics between boys and boys/girl is very different and James wouldn't see Snape as a competitor. On the other hand, she would be bullied by other girls because of her looks and poor clothes, and those girls would more likely than not be her fellow pureblood Slytherins.

So I think that fem!Snape is unlikely to become a Death Eater even if she still had a falling out Lily. And even if somebody else ratted the prophecy to Voldemort and the Potters were still killed, she definitely wouldn't become a teacher.

I think you're injecting Muggle gender politics into the Wizarding World. You can, of course, disagree as to the extent of it, but a perfectly valid interpretation of canon, and the most common one in the fandom, is that the Wizarding World is devoid of sexism and homophobia --- though it does have them, its prejudices are all its own (blood-purism, wizard supremacy). In a world where females /don't have/ an inborn statistical disadvantage in a fight compared to males, there is unlikely to be a "hitting girls is wrong" taboo in place which would prevent the Marauders from picking on a female Snape.

As for James seeing Severa as a competitor... that depends on whether you make Severa a lesbian, of course (I would say you should; Snape becomes nigh-unrecognizable if (s)he isn't in love with Lily). But if she /is/ romantically interested in Lily, and assuming by fiat either that Lily is bisexual, or James thinks she /might/ be, then the love rivalry can easily proceed forwards with no significant changes.

Similarly, it's not that Snape wouldn't get bullied by the other Slytherins at the start for being poor and Muggle-raised. But I don't think the bullying would be significantly worse for a girl than a boy.

**** Even if there's no sexism, girls and boys' hierarchies and bullying are still very different (vertical vs. cliques). Why would James/Sirius feel the need to pick on Severa (much)? Even if she were a lesbian, it wouldn't become an issue until years later, and James would likely consider Severa simply Lily's plain friend, a charity case.

I really do think a girl would be bullied much worse than a boy because of her looks and clothes, and we see enough catty behaviour in the books to prove that witches aren't above it any more than Muggles.

I also think Snape doesn't need to be a lesbian for there to be a deep connection between her and Lily. Friendship can be just as meaningful, just look at Sirius and James. There's not enough female friendships in HP anyway. She can even have unrequited love for James in this scenario

The problem is that if you take away "burning hatred of anything Potter", "way too into Dark Magic" and "madly in love with Lily Evans", there's not much /left/ of the core of the canonical Snape. Under those circumstances it would take a truly excellent writer not to make Severa into an OC who happens to be born in Snape's place, instead of an actual fem!Snape.

******** I don't think Snape necessarily needs to have burning hatred of anything Potter and be madly in love with Lily Evans to still be in character, just like you can write write Harry in a different house who has different friends than Ron and Hermione, and he still can be recognisably Harry. Fem!Snape would still be bad-tempered, insecure, talented, clever, spiteful, proud, obsessive (not necessarily over Lily), hold grudges forever (not necessarily on Marauders), be interested in Potions and Dark Arts, etc.

And I do think that out of all the HP characters, genderbender would affect Snape's life the most. I don't like reading fem!Harry fics precisely because I don't really believe canon would change in any significant way if Harry were a girl, but Snape is completely different story.

It isn't even about sexism. Hogwarts segregates by gender. You spend a lot more time with the same sex, from dorms to friend circles. Therefore FemSnape would be bullied by girls more than by boys simply because she is way more exposed to and interacting with other girls.

Ginny (assuming you're talking about her) is both the youngest Weasley and the only sibling of her gender, making the protective attitude less definitively rooted in gender roles. Also, the Weasleys are stated to reject many aspects of magical culture (this is presented as a positive, but isn't necessarily entirely so) and are fairly regressive in many ways.

I agree Rowling implies quite a bit of sexism with her writing, but I personally feel it usually comes across as her own feelings bleeding through rather than a trait inherent to the world. I don't think it's a stretch to write a magical world with greatly diminished gended roles.

Gender segregation definitely makes this all moot in regards to the OP's question, though.

*** *Ulpia Severina*

Ulpia Severina, also known as Severina (fl. 3rd century), was a Roman Empress, the wife of the emperor Aurelian. There is evidence that she reigned in her own right for some period after Aurelian's death in 275, which would make her the only woman to have ruled over the entire classical Roman Empire by her own power. Very little is known about her, as there are no literary sources mentioning her existence.

** Well... the cop-out answer is "not very if she's a lesbian", and that she would be a lesbian would be more or less inevitable, because not much of Snape's core remains if (s)he is not allowed to be madly in love with Lily Evans. And once you've granted that, you can just allow the whole canon plot to roll out with a few minimal pronoun switches. Sure, Snape's chemistry with certain secondary characters might be somewhat different (I imagine Bellatrix, in this scheme, would be even more antagonistic to Snape for being in good standing with the Dark Lord, because she would perceive this female Snape as even more of a romantic rival). But the basics could remain.

Naturally, if I had to write a story with this as a jumping-off point, I could perform all sorts of wizardry. For example, maybe female-Snape, what with maternal instincts and all that feels it is her duty to care for Lily's orphan, whatever Dumbledore says, and you end up with an unlikely take on Severitus. Or to go back further, maybe Petunia isn't quite so antagonistic to Severa as she was to Severus, and as a result Severa's accidental magic does /not/ nearly injure Petunia, and thus by induction you end up with a Petunia Dursley who doesn't hate magic with quite the same passion as her canonical counterpart. If it amuses you, and you wanted some shipping angst, maybe throw a wrench in the love triangle by having one of the Marauders develop a crush on Severa to mirror James's on Lily.

But none of that, I think, follows /necessarily/ from the premise, which, as I said, doesn't need to change very much at all.

Calling that evidence of any active sexism is stretching it, honestly. Besides, are we sure wizards never change their name to match their wife's? I'd say it depends on whether they're moving into the family or not, so to speak.

With her moving into the Burrow and all, Molly for all intents and purposes became a Weasley (she even had the red hair all along), so she took the name. Bellatrix presumably moved in with the Lestranges, since Grimmauld Place is derelict and long-abandoned.

And I can't think of any other examples. There /are/ a fair number of hyphenated names (Dagworth-Granger, Granger-Weasley, for example), too.

In fact, if we're bringing in /Pottermore/ stuff, McGonagall was married, yet she kept her name, so there's some evidence that it /is/ done.

"Wizarding" is the adjectival form of "wizardkind", and not really gendered per se, any more then "mankind" is. Sure, the fact that it was structured around the male rather than female form is evidence of the sexism of the society in which the English language developed, but I don't think that can be blamed on the modern Wizarding World with any fairness.

Also, I'll oppose that the most common name for practicing magic isn't "wizardry" but rather "witchcraft".

Why would she ever live there? It's Orion and Walburga's house, she is from a different branch of the Blacks.

Anyway, while I agree there's much less sexism in wizarding world, Muggleborns and Halfbloods would still bring some with them, and Muggle world as a whole still obviously influences the Wizarding world, whether purebloods want that or not.

Perhaps I got mixed up with fanon, but I was under the impression that it was the general-purpose Black family home, which belonged to Orion and Walburga in Sirius's youth because they were the heads of the family, but also housed (or could house if need be) all the other members of the family.

It would have been entirely plausible for Rodolphus to move in with the Blacks rather than the other way around, is my main point, and it doesn't appear that that's what was done.

I don't suggest they are. Perhaps on balance your interpretation is right. But mine, that the Black fortune was never split, but rather passed down from eldest child to eldest child, also fits the evidence without requiring there to be sexism in the WW. Either Walburga and Orion was the heir to the Black fortune in the previous generation; therefore the fortune then goes to /their/ first child (whether that's a son or not).

** I wrote up the set-up for a potential "Snape as a girl" AU some time ago... well, the prompt here was "Snape was a girl and James's childhood friend instead of Lily's," but I still kind of liked the resuit. I named the female Snape "Sevanna," by the way,,,,

Copy/pasting:

--------------

I thought about it. Let's take two things as read:

1: Severus Snape is a woman in this AU --- let's call her "Sevanna."

2: Sevanna Snape was a childhood friend of James, not Lily.

Okay. At once that means that Sevanna's childhood is very different. If she and James are friends before Hogwarts, she can't grow up in the Muggle world because James is pure-blood; she has to grow up in the wizarding world. And this probably means she grows up without an abusive father. Okay, fathers can be abusive in the wizarding world too, but canon Snape's father was a Muggle and abusive towards his wife and son. I don't believe a Muggle who lived in the wizarding would would ever be allowed to take it that far, so the easiest solution then is that Tobias Snape died and Eileen decided to move back to wizarding society, ending up living close to the Potter family.

So, Sevanna Snape would grow up different. Not the bitter, abused child with a temperamental father and a weak mother, an outsider in the Muggle world, but raised by a single mother in a wizarding world. Perhaps she would be neglected by the stressed Eileen... but in that case, I think Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, loving and indulgent parents as they were to James, would pretty much take her under their wing, and become like a spare set of parents for the girl.

In that case, it would be a much different, much happier, more loved and certainly less bitter Sevanna Snape who first started Hogwarts along with James. Given James's prejudices against Slytherin (which he would express when they first met Sirius Black), Sevanna would absolutely refuse to be placed in Slytherin. The Sorting Hat might try to put her there, but she would beg: "Not Slytherin! Not Slytherin! James would hate me!" And so I think she would end up --- not in Gryffindor with her beloved James, but in Ravenclaw.

Because if a Snape isn't a Slytherin, (s)he is a Ravenclaw.

Would a Ravenclaw Sevanna Snape still end up with a bad crowd and become a Death Eater? Hard to say, but I think the Potters would have influenced her enough that she didn't. She might get a little jealous when James started hanging out so much with his three new friends, Sirius, Remus and Peter... maybe she'd even get curious where they sneaked off to every month too... but the Snape/Marauders feud would not exist. Instead, there might end up to be a feud between Sevanna and Lily. I think James would, like in canon, be interested in Lily pretty early, and that would REALLY awaken Sevanna's jealousy. It wouldn't help that she and Lily had a lot of things in common: Both really talented witches, both favoured by Slughorn, both great with potions... and as time went on, both would be really interested in James. I could see a bitter rivalry growing between them, one that would get worse when James finally chose Lily.

What would Sevanna do then? Several possibilities. She might desperately try to throw herself at James. She might try to get Lily in trouble. She might just break all ties with them both and go off alone, heartbroken and embittered.

But. One thing strikes me. I still don't think she would join the Death Eaters. And so, there is nobody to overhear the prophecy told to Dumbledore, at least no-one that will tell it to Voldemort. Since the prophecy actually hinges on Voldemort knowing the first two lines... in this universe Trelawney does not make the prophecy. And so she isn't hired as Divination teacher, the subject is discontinued at Hogwarts, and Voldemort does not fall.

Voldemort never targets Lily and James, Sirius is never sent to Azkaban. Peter might still join the Death Eaters and act as a spy, but he doesn't get to frame Sirius for being the spy because he never gets such a perfect opportunity as the swapped Secret-Keepers. Instead he loses his nerve, fakes his death and high-tails it out of the country without anyone ever discovering his status as a double agent.

When Fleamont and Euphemia die shortly before Harry is born, Sevanna (who viewed them as a second pair of parents) makes up with James. She still does not get along with Lily, but has made her peace with the Potter family.

And so, Harry grows up with both his parents, but in a much darker wizarding world, knowing Sevanna Snape as "Dad's lady friend that Mum doesn't like." Voldemort still reigns, several people who lived in canon are killed in this universe. Hogwarts, still the only really safe place, becomes a bit of a refugee for Muggle-borns.

And the plot becomes another one entirely!

I haven't actually introduced her yet, or even really mentioned her, but Snape IS female in my current fanfic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12861492]["Holly Potter and the Witching World."]] Of course, in that AU, almost all the characters are female, with a few exceptions, and the plot is VERY different.
