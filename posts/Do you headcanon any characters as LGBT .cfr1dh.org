** I always had it in my head that Lavender and Parvati would've gotten together if the former hadn't died, but that's me channeling the fandom in a sense.

Aside from that, Harry reads as bisexual or just ambiguously into cute people, but I think that comes down to how Rowling writes the appearances of men, and isn't exactly Harry's perspective necessarily. Doesn't stop me from thinking that way, though.

Ginny feels bisexual too, if more female-leaning albeit ending up with Harry in the end.

Tonks could've been a fascinating look into how being able to be any gender could right fuck with someone's sense of self and gender if she wasn't, y'know, killed too. Maybe non-binary or at least non-conforming in any event.

Katie, Angelina and Alicia are absolutely 100% ot3 and none of you can tell me otherwise.

Oliver and Marcus hate-flirting is also great.

** Well, it's almost canonical already, but obviously, Grindelwald should be gay for his relationship with Dumbledore to work best, even if it's up to interpretation whether there were any actual /feelings/ on Grindelwald's side.

I don't feel strongly about it, but I like the idea that Ron is bi without realizing it in his teenage years, an idea suggested by others in relation to his apparent "celebrity crush" on Viktor Krum. While we're talking bi, I wrote Pansy Parkinson as such in /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/, purely for the look on Draco's face when she dumps him for a Hufflepuff girl --- so there's that.

In an effort to cull the creepy undertones some people try to read into him, I like to think of Lockhart as ace. All his getting-girls-to-swoon is pure ego-boosting, as hollow as anything he ever does. And maybe, if you want to get psychological, "overcompensating" for the feelings of inadequacy asexual people are known to have.

I'm of a similar mind, but I see Grindelwald as being egocentric and narcissistic, where he only stayed with Dumbledore for as long as he did because he saw Albus as being almost worthy of his radiant magnificence.

** The HP series is not the best when it comes to LGBT representation, but... the characters I do get LGBT vibes from are almost alway male. Peobably because JKR is a straight woman, and also because the HP series just has more central male figures.

Definitely getting bisexual vibes for Harry. As we've discussed elsewhere in this thread, he's more likely to notice how handsome the GUYS are than he is to notice how pretty the GIRLS are. He goes on about the handsomeness of Cedric and Bill, and he can't see the young Tom Riddle without noticing how very good-looking he is..So I definitely headcanon Harry as bisexual, just very much in denial about it.

I can sort of get some bi vibes from Ron too, but not as strongly. Ron is a lot more clearly into girls than Harry is, but there is that "celebrity crush" on Krum... Ron strikes me more as bicurious though.

Charlie is asexual. This is probably the one I'm most convinced about. Not only is he like the only Weasley never to get married or show any interest in romance at all, but he plain does not seem interested.

Same with Tom Riddle, really. Cursed Child aside, I plain can't see him bothering with sex or romance. (Bellatrix CLEARLY has the hots for him, but he mainly cares about her loyalty... it's obvious he doesn't care at all about her.)

Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy? Totally into each other. I mean, I'm not a shipper at all and even I was shocked that they didn't kiss even ONCE during the play. The only girl Scorpius pursues is the girl who blatatly HATES him... maybe it's just to get rid of the creepy nature of his pestering of Rose, but I kind of saw Scorpius as a deeply closeted homosexual who pursued Rose precisely because he knew he would never have a chance with her.

I don't really get all that many LGBTQ vibes from the female characters. I'm a queer woman myself, so I'd definitely appreciate some queer-coded ladies here, but... really, almost all the female characters read as either VERY heterosexual, or completely without any hints about their sexualities.

For example, Professor Sprout. If you told me it was canon that she was in a lesbian relationship with Madam Hooch, I'd have no problems believing that... but if you told me it was canon that she was married to a man and had three children, I'd believe that too.

So when I headcanon any girls as LGBTQ, it's not really based on anything I read in canon. It's more like "Yeah, it COULD be like this."

Like, I headcanon Luna as being pansexual; she's not bothered at all what sex or gender other people are and mostly just goes with the flow... but there's no canon hints here, it's just something I personally feel fits the character.

**** Yes! I've noticed that too! Harry is a LOT more likely to internally go on about how good-looking BOYS are. With GIRLS he's a lot more likely to find something odd or ugly about their appearances... the one girl he consistently thinks is pretty is Cho, otherwise his description of girls tends to be neutral or critical.

Even Ginny is usually described in neutral terms; it's pretty easy to infer from the text (and other characters' reactions to her) that she MUST be pretty nice-looking, Harry never really focuses much on her appearance at all. He's attracted to her, yes, but it seems to be more about her personality.

But if a BOY is handsome, Harry NOTICES. More than once he notices just how handsome Bill and Cedric are... but also with the young Tom Riddle he DEFINITELY notices how good-looking he is. Same with when he sees pictures of Sirius as a young boy; Harry is very quick to notice that Sirius is very easy on the eyes.

He is susceptible to Veela charms... but it's noticable that Harry is the only one who suspects that Fleur is part Veela since he identifies the same vibes from her. Almost like he's not that used to seeing girls that way.

It's probably a biproduct of being written by a heterosexual woman, but still... once you notice it, it's really hard to accept Harry as completely straight. I can definitely see him as being attracted to guys and just HUGELY in denial about it. He does like girls too... I mean, he pined over Cho enough and he got REALLY into Ginny, but he spends much more time thinking about the handsome guys. So yeah, my headcanon is that Harry's bisexual.

FYI, it was Ron who identified Fleur as half-Veela.

As for the rest - I've seen such arguments before, but they always seem to me to confuse the narrative voice of the series. Namely, it forgets that the narrative voice of the HP stories is not Harry.

The story centres around Harry, and (with a few exceptions) we are only let in on things that Harry knows, but the "voice" of the narrator is not Harry's internal monologue. We know this because the narrative always specifically distinguishes Harry's thoughts from the general narrative, either by use of the "Harry thought" tag, or through shifting into first-person italics.

The narrative is so heavily seasoned with Harry's feelings and thoughts that it can be easy to forget this, but it's most easily seen in descriptive passages, where the narrative voice is quite distinct from Harry's own, often using vocabulary that you would never hear Harry saying.

E.g.

PS:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Yeah, that's a goblin,' said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps towards him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.

  Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn't even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn't eating anything at all.

#+end_quote

GoF:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore's words; Harry had sent back his ‘yes' with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.
#+end_quote

DH:

#+begin_quote
  And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.
#+end_quote

Words like swarthy, fervent, gaunt, diatribe, tumultuous, austere, missive, unerring, splayed... these are not words which belong in Harry's mouth or head.

As a result, I don't really think that there's anything to be concluded about Harry from the descriptive passages of the HP books, except in those sections where the narrative distinguishes the description as something that Harry has specifically noted, like the PS quote above.

****** Hmm... I agree that the narrative voice definitely does not belong to Harry, but the fact remains that the narrative is written in Harry's perspective. When we are treated to descriptions about something or someone, it's because /Harry/ has noticed them and /Harry/ is looking at them. While the voice does not belong to Harry, the perspective does, so I think there is something to be said about the argument for Harry being bi. The words may not be his, but the very existence of the description does indicate that he is noticing their appearances. And apparently, more likely to linger on the appearances of men - though I admit I never noticed such a tendency when I read the books. Then again, when I read the books, I hadn't really been exposed to the idea of sexualities other than heterosexuality.

That all being said, I doubt JK Rowling ever intended for Harry to be anything other than heterosexual.

Also I see Ginny as being bisexual but preferring boys. Her fixation on the Holyhead Harpies and general sportiness is contrasted with her dating several boys over the span of the story, and part of me thinks Harry appreciated her ability to see both sides of the attraction game.

Well, it's generally common for people to give reasons for their opinions in a discussion. Otherwise it's not really a discussion, just a group of individuals each declaring their own views without any real interaction occurring. The discussion arises out of people talking about the relative merits of the reasons given for their differing viewpoints.

This is doubly so when it comes to "headcanon", which ostensibly refers to "the canon in your head" i.e. canon, plus your personal additions to it.

Assuming that we are all rational people who seek only to adopt logically consistent viewpoints, our headcanon will be consistent with the established canon and perhaps even supported by elements which are implicit within that established canon.

While there may well be people downvoting you out of sheer dislike for the topic of the thread, I don't think that's the case here. The second most upvoted comment in the thread is one stating Harry to be bi /and giving a reason for that opinion/ - the emphasis the GoF narrative places on Cedric Diggory's appearance.

I suspect the reason you are being downvoted is that you are stating your opinions as facts which cannot be disputed (and that to dispute them is somehow wrong), rather than a position adopted following some form of reasoning.

To be frank, a conversation where people just state their opinions is pretty much entirely pointless. Unreasoned opinions don't really have any value. Unless a person /justifies/ their opinion, there's no content there to engage with.

Considering Harry's description of Bill and Cedric could be paraphrased as "they are hot as fuck holy shit", I think he might be bi guys.

In my headcanon Sirius is bi and Dean/Seamus is a thing. I don't have any reason for it like I do with the other two, but the way I see their characters, it just makes sense to me.

** Dean is the only guy among the male characters close to Harry that I can see as being gay, and that's because he's basically a blank slate. Even Dumbledore doesn't fit as gay for me, regardless of JKRs tweets. I can accept Remus if you streach it, but certainly not with bloody Sirius! It's just very hard when you have known certain characters for decades to suddenly imagine them completely different.

Among the girls it's easy to see many bisexuals, but that's probably because I have never had any issues with picturing two girls together, it has always seem just normal to me, expected even.

I don't believe magicals can have transgender issues though, as too many fanfics have used all kinds of full gender switching magics to make me accept anything else. For that reason alone I find fics that include it completely unbelievable, even worst that the usual super angsty Lord Harry King of Europe Potter-Evans-Slytherin-Merlin.

** Harry, Lupin, Sirius, Tonks and Professor Sprout at the very least. Possibly Mrs Figg, possibly Charlie Weasley. Dumbledore I guess although I often headcanoned him as asexual, even before I knew the word.

Mostly bisexual, Sprout as a lesbian because I always got the vibe from how she was described - brisk and earthy are pretty long held indicators in classic lit when coding as gay women.

For that matter Lupin and Tonks are both pretty heavily queercoded in canon up to book 6 or so which is why it was pretty crappy of JKR to backtrack on it. She had to have known what she was doing after the first book she did it in.

Besides that I like to headcanon characters as bisexual when I get the vibe or there's no hard textual evidence otherwise, and that covers the rest of my headcanoned characters. Tbh there could be plenty more too like Lockhart, Millicent Bulstrode etc. There's arguably textual suggestive evidence of Rita Skeeter being a trans woman. But those were never ones I picked up on my initial readings. Having said that I don't discount them when I see them in fic and could happily read fics where any number of characters were LGBT in a magic world where such things might not even be noteworthy.

E: downvotes for my own headcanon, really? Why ask the question if you don't want answers? Seriously I feel like this is disrespectful. Aren't we better at engaging than this?

And the short haired punky girl who seems to be the only woman in an all boys club, with an androgynous name who hates being feminized by her mother, and who is clumsy and unladylike?

Throughout fiction over the last at least 50 years when you couldn't openly write about gay characters often writers would use traits like the above, either lowkey associated with gay stereotypes or very suggestive of the opposite gender stereotypes. JK was a university educated, literary woman, and she by the time she got to these books had a strong team of editors around her. Those archetypes were suggestive and not uncommon. She herself admits she used an interest in knitting to indicate Dumbledore's sexuality. There's plenty textual evidence that those may at least have been indications before she ultimately decided to take the characters in a different direction.

***** Remus doesn't trust himself in a relationship because he's a werewolf, Rowling described Sirius and Remus's reunion as "embracing like brothers".

He's paternal towards and cares about the son of his best friend like a normal person who doesnt dislike children tends to do.

They buy a joint birthday gift because Remus doesnt have a lot of money, and Sirius can't be seen in public.

Tonks hates her first name for a very good reason, anybody under the age of 40 will see her first name, and immediately single out "Nympho". If she went by that, she'd have spent her 7 years at Hogwarts being constantly laughed at or with her head in a toilet. I'd hate that name too if I were her.

Just because some people did it, doesnt mean Rowling did. Besides, do you really think she'd have kept her mouth shut if Remus was gay?

*** Figg? Seriously? lol

I disagree on Sirius vehemently, he is straight as an arrow, but just fucking broken. Lupin is a peaceful individual that dislikes conflict because of a self imposed moral code, but I don't see him as anything but straight, though I can accept it because of the entire Wolf play. Harry is straight, he would in fact never accept a touch from a man as I see it. Tonks as bi is normal, in the books she was basically a punk girl that liked adventure, and taking everything about her into account then it's obvious she would have plenty of female friends, but only guys for romance.

Lockhart is... probably bi curious, but it's far easier to imagine him raping and memory charming girls than boys, unless they are worth collecting. And yes, I see him as a pedophile and a rapist, that's for sure. Fucking fanon has filled my head with this for me to imagine anything else.

I don't get where you came up with Bullstrode as I remember literally nothing of her beyond just being.. big boned, and Rita seems..

**** Rita is described as having 'mannish' hands and other body characteristics on more than one occasion, so arguably the read is there. Witch Please podcast discusses this at length and there's also a discussion of it [[http://www.cosforums.com/cosarchive/archive/index.php/t-23138.html][from 2004 here]] - based solely on the text and JKR's descriptions, which are well-known to lay hints.

On that point, I'm slightly intrigued with the way this thread has turned. In my mimd we have been discussing how certain things /could/ be, supported by our own personal reading of the text. Is it the case that others on the thread are perceiving us to be discussing how things /are/ or /must/ be? I'm struggling to understand otherwise why so many of the politely and textually sourced comments on here are attracting downvotes.

***** Actually like I quoted she's described as heavy and thick, that's a polite way of calling someone fat if there ever was one. Nonetheless when taking Harry's point of view into account we must seriously considering the fact that we do have an unreliable narrator, that's on top of a writer that doesn't know how to write a male perspective. (Much less a teenager!)

I agree that /some/ people use downvote to disagree, but in general is when you say something utterly stupid or insulting. I have seen one comment of yours that basically says being over 30 and having HIV means you're gay. How did you expect no one to downvote that?

Also don't put words or actions on JKRs hands that have no proof or basis. We can rant at her all we want, but it does have consequences. People will defend even her more stupid tweets, I know it because I've learned that lesson long ago in CC debates.

****** It didn't say that, it explained that those were indicators used at the time to indicate homosexuality when it couldn't be outright stated - which JK may potentially have neen bound by too, as the UK had a law against promoting homosexuality to children that wasn't repealed until 2003.

My understanding was that I was not making accusations, I was stating the possibility. Possibly the phrasing led to people taking an interpretation I didn't intend. For the record of course I don't think we have any way of seeing into JK's head! we can only guess and make theories. My own there were largely just based on the history of coded and veiled representation when it couldn't be said outright.
