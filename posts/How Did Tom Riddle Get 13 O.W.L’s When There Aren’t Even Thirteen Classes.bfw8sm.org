Ok, so I admit that there is a very small chance I am completely wrong on this, since I just moved and my version of The Half Blood Prince is in a box somewhere so I can't really fact check this.

Despite that, my memory has been evaluated and said to be somewhere in the top 10% of the population, so I would like to think I have this right.

In half blood prince while Harry and Dumbledore are reviewing the life of Tom Riddle, Dumbledore tells Harry how Tom got a job at Borgin and Burke's, (apologies if that's spelled wrong) I believe that it is during this portion of the text (if not it's when he is speaking about Riddle before showing him the altered Slughorn memory) that Dumbledore gives a somewhat summary of Riddle's academics. He says something along the lines of Riddle achieving 13 Outstanding O.W.L.'s (could've been N.E.W.T's but I am quite sure it was O.W.L's)

My question is how? Here are the Hogwarts courses I am aware of

1 Ancient Runes 2 Arithmancy 3 Astronomy 4 Care of Magical Creatures 5 Charms 6 DADA 7 Divination 8 Herbology 9 History of Magic 10 Muggle Studies 11 Potions 12 Transfiguration

So, you see the issue, there aren't even thirteen classes... but wait, the plot thickens. We know that at this time there was no Divination class, because we know Dumbledore was against “adding” the subject to the curriculum, which would have meant it was not present before this, and this more than 30 years after Riddle graduated. So, right there, the classes are down to eleven. But wait... the plot thickens even more.

Hogwarts students are only allowed three electives (either runes, Arithmancy, comc, divination or muggle studies) on top of the original seven classes. Granted, this could be worked around if we work under the assumption that Riddle was given a time turner like Hermione. If he was, I have no doubt that unlike Hermione he would have been able to keep it up (she's brilliant, but nowhere near Riddle's league)

So, even if we work on that assumption, we know there were only 11 possible classes to take, yet I remember Dumbledore saying THIRTEEN O.W.L's.

I would love for someone to find what I am missing and fill in the blanks, or even theorize. Also, the block of text where Dumbledore says this would be greatly appreciated if it's not too much work. It could be that I am remembering this wrong, and that it never happened (or it's a Pottermore thing) but I swear I remember Dumbledore saying this in HBP.

So, what do you guys think?

PS: sorry if there are typos, I'm typing this on my phone and really don't want to read through this all on a small screen, sorry.


** I think you've misremembered this. I searched through my eBook copy of HBP (and the other books, just to be safe) and couldn't find any mention of how many O.W.L.s Voldemort got - at least, barring Ron's joke in CoS that Riddle was given an award for special services to Hogwarts for getting 30 O.W.L.s. I believe this is the passage you're thinking of, but as you can see it only talks about Voldemort's academic record in general terms:

#+begin_quote
  “He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.” - Dumbledore, HBP, Chapter 20

** Twelve seems to be the standard maximum, being the number that Percy Weasley and Barty Crouch Jr. both got. But we know that other classes are offered at Hogwarts sometimes (was it a Rowling interview or Pottermore that mentioned Dumbledore's infrequent Alchemy class?), so it's certainly possible that maybe Riddle had more, but there's no mention of it in the books.

** We don't know how many classes were offered in Riddle's time. It's possible that the wizarding population was higher before the war, so they had more professors, and there was enough interest in even obscure topics to fill classes in them. The population we see in Harry's time may be unusually low, well below Hogwarts capacity, which is why there's always a conveniently empty classroom to duck into when you need one.

*** it might have also been gridalwalds war and then voldemorts war that drastically reduced the population

add in a virus or something

and it would explain the low classess

** The classes at Hogwarts change over time. In particular, we know that alchemy is taught when there is sufficient demand for it, and we also know that Dumbledore was minded to remove Divination from the curriculum.

** Not to apply American things to British culture, but maybe it's kind of like AP exams? There's like 30 different AP tests, but my school for example only offered like 6 AP classes, but I was able to sign up for tests for subjects not offered, and I just self studied throughout the year, so maybe that's how he pulled it off?

**** Oh yeah for sure I have nothing to back it up at all, but I always thought it was a pretty great opportunity since I basically got college credit for 60 bucks and no homework so it would be cool to see it applied somewhere else. Plus, I think I've seen a few fics with somewhat similar concepts for all the people who missed 7th year to take their NEWTs at the ministry without retaking the year

** I may be misremembering it, but for some reason I have a vivid memory of thirteen O.W.L's. Maybe it was in reference to Dumbledore? But I really thought it was Riddle?

It could have been a Pottermore thing, or maybe I'm just an idiot.

** I don't know what all the class would be, but I always considered that while the class at Hogwarts "prepared" the student to the OWL and NEWT, you didn't have to take them to try exams.\\
The most obvious example is Muggle Studies, the OWL and NEWT is necessary for some jobs (mainly at the Ministry) and with the exception of overeager student like Hermione, I don't see why Muggleborns students should take 3 years of an elective the could already get an O the day they arrived at Hogwarts.

So, in my headcanon, 12 OWL students take 3 electives and work the 2 other by themselves with their 3 times (Muggle studies is obviously simple enough for free time but I don't really which class between Ancient Runes and Divinations can be worked the best without a teacher).

** You also have to account for Dumbledore being the Transfiguration Professor not the Headmaster, so he would not have been in charge of the choice of what classes were available yet.

That was up to Dippet at the time, so it is alot harder to find the information on this area. So, who knows Divination may have been available, along with more classes that Dumbledore removed when he became Headmaster, due to there being,"Dark"

*** I believe in regards to divination that it is said that the topic had not been taught at Hogwarts for “many years” and it seems like Dumbledore is doing something rather out there by adding it to the curriculum, so I think we can rule that one out.

Though I can sort of see Dumbledore removing “dark” classes, I also have a hard time believing it.

Dumbledore was quite keen on the pursuit of knowledge, and something tells me he would not have had removed classes unless they were “really dark” I'm talking like, horcrux kind of dark, and I highly doubt it.

I don't really think there is any other option though, so I guess you may be right. I was kind of hoping that I was just missing something and someone would know the answer, but you may well be right, even if the solution is far from perfect.
