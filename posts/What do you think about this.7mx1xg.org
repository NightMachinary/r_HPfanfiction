** Frankly, I think something like this would deserve better than simple plywood. It kinda ruins the whole product when you see those stripes of the plywood's layers.

I would use solid wood for the next one. Maybe some nice beech, or oak.

*** You are right, solid wood will be good for this box, but I think price will be growing up too

**** Thats not a bad thing, though.

Better make it expensive and worth it, than cheap and forgettable.

***** For $14.99 minus coupon for $3 dollars "$3FORCE" I bought it. But if the price was $50+ I would not buy.

****** If I liked it, I'd rather buy it for 70â‚¬ and have a really nice, decorative piece.

15$ for something I don't particularly like looking at is in some way more expensive than the 70.

******* I agree with you. You either buy for a fun, or to decorate a room. Then no matter how much it costs.
