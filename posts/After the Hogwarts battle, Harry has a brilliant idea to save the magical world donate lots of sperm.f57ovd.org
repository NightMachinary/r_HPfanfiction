After the Hogwarts battle, Harry has a brilliant idea to save the magical world: donate lots of sperm, together with most of his classmates (including Draco). They also make a spell to ensure that many women pick their donation instead of the ones of other muggles.

Fast forward 11 years and the Hogwarts letters must be sent to over 500 kids. Chaos follows.


** yeah who needs purebloods any more when you can start a subculture of /pottbloods/. I can imagine a century onward some snot nosed kid boasting how he is genuine 5th generation pottblood and how all nonpotts should be rounded up and fed to hippogriffs.

** I had a note for a story postscript like that:

- Minerva alerts Harry that Hogwarts is being suffused by a spate of vision-impaired Muggleborns with messy black hair. A bit of investigation and it turns out that fertility clinics across the UK accepted donations from an anonymous contributor. Profile read: "Black hair, green eyes, 5' 11", Twelve stone; might have gone pro rugby but instead joined law-enforcement; IQ 125 and a certain something special." Once this donor's sperm had been used, it became obvious to the clinicians that it was exceptionally fertile stock- every client got pregnant at first try, often with twins. It became the defacto choice for those with IVR difficulties.

*** I don't see Harry as 5'11”, and I don't think that's just because Daniel Radcliffe's 5'5”. I pictured Harry as small in the books too, at least partly because he wasn't fed enough in his childhood.

Sperm banks generally accept donations only from tall men. A dishonest wizard could use magic to bypass that screening, but that doesn't seem like Harry's style.

The flashback sequence during the Bathilda's Secret chapter in DH, right before Bagshot turns out to be Nagini.

He's also described as tall in the Mirror of Erised, but your guess is as good as mine if that was supposed to be a realistic portrayal or not.

** Sperm banks are very picky about donors. They generally have to be tall, university-educated, have family trees free of genetic diseases, etc. Most muggle men don't qualify, so most wizards wouldn't either. They could get around that with magic, but that's in “for the greater good” territory.

*** Why? Women that use donated sperm want a kid. And I can bet most of them want their kid to be as special as possible, so having a magical child would not be so awful.

However, my ideea was not so much about that part, but most about all the chaos 500 halfbloods raised only muggles would create at Hogwarts: from the delivery of letters (it's HARD to attend so many kids!), to issues with the train (they would need a few more cars!), boats, to how to deal with the sorting (500 sortings would take a lot),etc... to parts where the kids should find out who their brothers are to prevent future incest (That is why it should not be Harry only the donor, but most of his male friends/colleagues). Lots of funny/difficult situations.

Also, If the trend continues the following years... it would completely disrupt the magical world!

***** Actually, from what I have read (never been to a sperm donating center), the guy gives a (anonymous) description of himself and I guess many try to make it look good...

Also, I don't see as a compulsion spell (that would be rapey), more like a "Hey, check this guy, isn't he a good choice?" kind :)

Also, I said "many" would chose them , not all, so it would be just a statistical tweak, not a force the girl to use your sperm.

I /think/ the description is just a set of details. What I've been told of the sperm-dad of a friend of mine was: red-head, doctor, tall. What I remember is needed is: hair colour, eye colour, IQ, profession & height (maybe more, but it could also be different in different countries).
