Apologies in advance if this is against the rules, I didn't see anything against this. And I wasn't to sure where else to put this.

This happened a couple days ago but I was browsing google like I usually do for some good 'ol harry/daphne and harry/tonks fics. And I found this user who didn't have any stories but had over 1000 (think the exact number was 1203 or 1023) favorites most were harry potter but some other like naruto stories. But what surprised me was that almost all stories (hp) were either; harry/daphne, harry/tonks, and harry/fleur. Almost all of them stories I hadn't even seen posted here before at all.

I've tried googling what I thought I googled when I found it the first time but there seems to only be already read stories rather than users which i'm looking for (and i tend to find a lot of users).

Like I said apologies if this isn't the right place to post it or goes against rules. Also downvote this to hell if you want its a throwaway so idc xd

Edit: Done as much searching as possible as my own and the closest I could find was harry-lestrange but theres enough here to keep me company for a bit
