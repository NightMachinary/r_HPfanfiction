Looking for some good fics where Harry's Patronus is capable of killing dementors.


** I remember coming across one story where Ron managed (with Hermione's help) to come up with a variant of the Patronus which used anger.\\
The red-colored Patroni then proceeded to rip apart several Dementors.

Sadly, I've lost track of which story it was since I read it ages ago.

** that is in The second string, it's really only a very small part of the story and it's not only Harry's, but a whole group learns. linkao3(15465966) expect to cry a river while reading this though.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

***** - [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=3555][Reign O'er Me by cts]] (unfinished, but very good)
- “The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs” (not linking here, breaks rule 8, Google for it, if you want it)
- Hermione in linkao3(14281440) developed a ritual on killing them (not Patronus)
- There are more, but I am too lazy to find them.

** There was the Albus Potter series from NoahPhantom where the Patronus was deriving from some godly ritual which could kill Dementors. There was also an anti-Patronus which could summon Dementors.

** There are a few I've read, unfortunately I don't remember them all but one I remember is Linkffn(The Return of the Marauders)

This on features not just Harry being able to kill dementors. Rather his faction is able to.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
