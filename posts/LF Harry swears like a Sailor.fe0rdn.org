None of this Slimy Snake or everyone talking like they're from the 1750s. None of this "Dumbledork" nonsense or "Moldy Shorts" that's not even Playground level of weak.

"Malfoy, fuck off" wouldn't be inappropriate. The one instance of swearing was from Molly Weasley of all people "NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH" when if it wasn't a Children's book, someone would have called Malfoy a Bellend at the very least, if not flat out calling him a Cunt.


** There are quite a few fics I've read where actual swearing happens. Unfortunately, they are all too highly correlated with super edgy independent harry fics where 80% of the dialogue are rants.

** In my latest fic, Fem!Harry curses like a sailor, but Harry is pretty clean.

** Harry in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) swears quite a bit, but a lot of it is with Shadowrun swears, so he uses "drek" in place of "shit" and "frag" and "slot" in place of "fuck", though he will use normal profanity to punctuate a point.
