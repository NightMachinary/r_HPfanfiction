I guess this is a two pronged post as I'm wondering 1) what do you think would have happened in the series if Mr. Weasley died in the ministry and Sirius had lived? 2) Anyone have any recs where this happened? Thanks.


** 1) It would obviously have had a profound effect on Ron, which would probably force him to mature a lot faster than in the series (hence I believe the Lavender crap would not have happened).

2) A few years ago, I'd have recommended Aspirations by MegaMatt09, but my taste has greatly improved since then.

**** I actually agree (I hate Ron, just to get that out in the open!), because IMHO the bimbo (that's how Lavender is often described after all) is a much better girlfriend, for him (!), than Hermione (who he constantly fights with over the smallest things!) and he really might have matured (over time!) without all those petty arguments (and without copying homework from Hermione and Harry he might actually have learned something!)

***** You seem to be forgetting that Ron and Harry are both the same in canon on the scale of laziness when it comes to work. Both of them constantly copied homework from Hermione. Both of them hated putting in effort for the majority of their subjects (much like the average teenage boy). The only reason Ron doing it more seems to stand out is because it was constantly shoved in our faces and used as a pretext for the start of Ron/Hermione attraction. It was never the case that Ron was lazier than Harry or riding his coat tails through life. He had his own talents and skills which made themselves known over time, much later in the series when JKR actually decided to flesh him out beyond the loyal friend and follower.

It's neither here nor there to discuss who might be better or worse for Ron, but the way I've always seen it, as a male, is that Ron is the stereotypical average teenage boy who gets his moment of fame in HBP and random attraction from one of the popular, attractive girls (someone who he'd never had a chance with previously) and he jumps on it. There's very few people I know who /wouldn't/ do that. It doesn't mean that their relationship would last forever or that they're a perfect match. Personally I always felt like Lavender was using Ron, dating him because he was popular and all the negative things that come with that. But again, that's neither here nor there. Point is; Ron's a teenage boy acting his age in that book. Then he shows more maturity and becomes a man at the end of the series.

Question to all the haters of Ron: why do you have to hate him? Seriously, he's got the same flaws as Harry and the majority of the male characters in the book... What makes him stand out as the big bad?

****** Ron has NONE of the qualities that Harry has to redeem himself. Harry can forgive even his relatives for over a decade of abuse. Ron can't even get over his jealousy without a life or death situation. Harry has an extremely strong sense of right and wrong. Ron just seems like a follower. Even in the books. Personally, I feel that JK wrote Ron to be a foil to Harry on the positive side, much like she wrote Malfoy to be. Ron is everything that Harry is, except amplified. If Harry is Lazy, Ron is lazier. If Harry over reacts, Ron explodes. Along with that, in honestly after fourth year, Ron is simply there for comedic relief. Ron does not give any new information after that, at least nothing that Hermione could not give, and he only serves a point of contention and "character drive" for Hermione.

The hatred from Ron stems from this, and from "Sakura Syndrome". In the movies, he is completely useless. His lines were given to Hermione, 90% of his actions were given to her, and he isnt "as cute" as Harry, draco, neville.

Plus, lets be honest here. Ron is extremely easy to bash because we have all had that friend that was jealous of something we had, and it ended our friendship. (if you have not, then you will have one eventually). Its a form of projection.

I dont hate Ron, nor do I like his character. I personally feel about him as I do about Sakura from Naruto. He served his purpose in the first half of the story. He should have been killed off/written off in the second half, allowing the main character to grow from the pain.

******* Thanks for taking the time to respond and for being so concise and polite.

Surely loyalty in itself is a redeeming feature? I know a lot of people argue that he's not that loyal because of his behaviour in Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows, but aren't they all overlooking that in the end he does come around? That the hardest thing for a jealous person to do is swallow their pride and seek forgiveness? Ron does both of these things and the second time he does this, he doesn't stray again. I mean, personally (and that's all this is really, my viewpoint on the Ron hate), I've always viewed him as the most human character in the story. He's neither super powerful, super intelligent nor stupid or even evil. He's got nothing that makes him stand out. He is average. But that's what makes him human. He's /that/ guy that we all know. The one who we go to school with, the average joe from work, hell, sometimes we even are that guy. In addition to this, I surmised part of the hate as stemming from this... That Ron from canon reminds people of themselves and as most of us know, the only person who's hated more than any other is one's self in their school days. It's a form of projection. But that's all my own analysis and theorising.

I don't like movie Ron for that first reason so I'll give you that one. But for the latter, people were already fans of Draco long before Tom Felton's face became his. I'll still argue that comparatively Ron > Draco. But yet in the bashing fics, Draco is usually (not always, but usually), held to a higher standard and seen as generally better than Ron.

Again, I know what you're trying to say and I have had a friend like that. However my interpretation of Ron is that he's that best mate who thinks that staying up drinking before an exam is a great idea or the guy who has a crush on your ex/current crush and doesn't say anything about it. it's a point of contention, sure. But how a person deals with that is really up to them. Nine times out of ten you wouldn't really end a friendship based on those things alone. There's a fair bit of good to be considered along with the bad. No one is perfect.

You see, that's something I can understand because I honestly felt that there was a vibe of that happening in Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix. When Neville was being introduced as more of a friend to Harry and developing him as a character. I actually thought that this was the moment when Ron would step back and though he'd be a friend of Harry's still he wouldn't be his best friend, necessarily. But that was when I first read it years ago. I suppose JKR just didn't want to expand or change the circle that fans had grown accustomed to.

** In a way I agree with the majority about Ron maturing and becoming the man he is at the end of Deathly Hallows, but I'm also unsure about the latter part of that statement. What we saw with Fred's death in DH was that it changed all the Weasley's at a base level. That was a sibling who'd been with them for most of their lives. It was his death that really caused a change in Percy's behaviour, let's not forget that it was in the immediate aftermath of it that he charged in to duel Rookwood without a second's though... A move that could very well have gotten him killed.

But in my mind, killing off their father would've had a much more devastating effect on all of them. A man who'd been there through thick and thin, not judging any of his children, loving them unconditionally. Also the one seen as the lenient and the voice of reason parent, his care and relaxed presence would be one that would be missed straight away. It's entirely likely that his children would become imbued with a greater fervour to join the fight against Voldemort... Whereas his wife would fall apart and find herself increasingly estranged from her children as they tried to go against her in joining the order. There's plenty of what if scenarios that would play out because of this.

1.  Percy could be redeemed to his family much earlier in this case. The flipside is that he's too ashamed to return and would feel an amount of guilt, seeing his lack of belief in his family's claim of Voldemort's return as a contributing factor to his father's death. The third option is that he attempted to return but would be spurned by the other members of the family for not being there for their father when he was most needed... or viewed as a spy following the entire ministry debacle. There's endless possibilities for the Percy's relationship with his family here.
2.  I always feel that with the death of someone so close in any form of fiction that there's the possibility for one of the family members to go dark. By that I don't mean they drink the Death Eater kool aid and switch sides, but they change from the person they used to be into a whole different kind of person. I believe some Harry Potter fanfic writers refer to this as "unleashing their inner Slytherin" and using any means to secure personal victory.
3.  Mentioned it in passing, but I'll say it again. Mrs Weasley would almost certainly become more protective of her children and try to keep them out of the order. Her fear of losing anyone else would win out. But this, in itself, could potentially be seen as a betrayal of her children (in their eyes) and inadvertently push them further away.
4.  The state of the Weasley family's financial situation would be hit extremely hard. The loss of the primary source of income could cause them to lose their home.
5.  Charlie could be forced to return to England for the funeral and then seek a job nearer to support his family.
6.  The effect of their father's death on the Weasley twins could take the wind out of the sales of their joke shop idea and they could decide to drop it entirely.
7.  Bill and Fleur's relationship and eventual marriage could be stepped up or dropped due to the additional strain on Bill as the oldest male Weasley.
8.  Ginny and Harry's friendship to relationship could also either be accelerated or forgotten in this scenario. Harry comforting her could lead to their closer friendship and potentially a romance much sooner than was seen in HBP, but there's also the scope for Harry's guilt taking hold of him and deciding to not get close to anyone else in an attempt to not cause them anymore pain.
9.  Harry's reaction would almost certainly be one of grief and guilt at not doing more. I'm also fairly certain he'd try to distance himself from the Weasley's and Hermione as a whole. Determined not to be the cause of anymore death of anyone that he cares about.
10. Ron/Hermione could start a lot sooner in this case, but only if Ron matured and changed into the man he became at the end of DH. Both factors of that personality would be required for a lasting romance between them.

Edit: Oh and the big thing I forgot to mention is that I feel that JKR would've still have killed off Sirius eventually... Just probably in either a more dramatic or cheapened way. Like him saving Harry from an Avada Kedavra thrown by Voldemort or dying along with Lupin and Tonks off-screen.

*** Well said. I know Rowling canceled Arthur's death because she felt like he was losing too many father figures throughout the series, but I really feel like she should have kept this one (I agree Sirius' death seemed inevitable but she could have traded out Arthur for Lupin). For one thing, I find it entirely unbelievable that a family of 9--as in the thick of it as they were--only lost one person. But for another, it absolutely would have been the appropriate catalyst for so many things I felt were poorly handled in canon;

1. The cheap, last minute redemption of Percy's story arc.
2. It would give a more realistic build up of the Harry/Ginny storyline.
3. I'd def hope for a matured Ron. It would make the Ron/Hermione angle palatable.

And the thing about Charlie is a good point. It would have been great to see him reeled into the story instead of being this vague Weasley galavanting about Romania.

** I think without a father figure Ron actually does the opposite of what people think here and grows more immature and bitter. His immaturity is highlighted in the last 2 or 3 books and while he remains loyal it doesn't stop him from having a short fuse and this is without the loss of a close relative until the 7th book. I couldn't imagine his mental state without having his father around.

In the sixth book when the whole finding out about Hermione kissing Krum situation happens I think Ron takes a huge hit to his pride and gives Hermione the cold shoulder(even worse than canon). Combine this with what happens in the 7th book during the whole Horcrux scene and I think Ron comes out to be a super bitter unlikeable character.

*** Ron is fiercely loyal, but he also seems to create and hold grudges easily and readily. If he feels he has been wronged, he gives people the cold shoulder for long periods of time before realizing he's being a git. There is a part of me that wonders if he would blame Harry for a period since he /was/ the snake. But, at the same time I could see him not blaming Harry because he does have moments of maturity and hnderstanding. Guess I am not convinced in either direction.

** Lots of ifs but some things seem likely/obvious...

- Harry would feel guilty because he couldn't stop it in Nagini
- Weasleys would be devastated emotionally and financially
- Ron would probably mature earlier and be more committed to ending Voldemort instead of being a prat for the last 2 books
- Voldemort might have been more successful possessing Harry if Sirius were alive

Rest is up in the air. Personally, I think Sirius would have died sooner or later.

***** Well Harry originally didn't even want Ron and Hermione to come, and they only came because they pretty much forced their way along. I imagine Sirius would want to go with Harry, but he has never been a part of Harry's adventures the way that Ron and Hermione have. He doesn't know all the details about the visions/link with Voldemort, the horcruxes, or have the same history with Harry that Ron and Hermione do. The only ones who can help him are them; I think this is obvious in the calculated objects that Dumbledore leaves for them. Sirius is an important part of Harry's life, but doesn't fill the same role as his friends do.

Sirius is also much older, an escaped prisoner, suffering from depression and likely anxiety and PTSD from Azkaban. He is also risky, and he encourages Harry into riskier positions by conflating Harry with James. He's just not physically, mentally, and emotionally stable enough to not be a burden and liability for the group.

There's also the fact that even though Sirius is a big kid, he's also an adult and authority figure. The trio distanced themselves from authority figures, because they need autonomy in order to properly deal with the situation. They need to be able to make the decisions themselves about what and where the next move is. Overall, Harry is in charge, and I don't think Sirius would fit into this power dynamic smoothly. This is also part of the reason that they didn't let Remus come along (as well as the Tonks and Teddy complications).

** Some quick thoughts in bullet points

- I agree with the majority and as indirectly stated by JKR, Ron would lose his immaturity and insensitivity.

- Mrs.Weasley she would probably more overprotective, after losing her twin brothers and now husband.

- Charlie would most likely permanently return to UK to help out his family.

- I think Percy's reaction is the more interesting one. Would he return out of grief, would he feel vindicated and angry at his father for supporting Dumbledore, would his shame prevent him to return to his family?

- Harry would feel guilty because he's Harry.

- Hermione would read a book about grief or something.

- I have no idea how Bill, the twins and Ginny would react though.

Though ending aside, I can see the Weasleys wanting revenge. They are a tight-knit, proud family (even Percy might come back sooner), the older members have already been fighting Voldemort as part of the Order, the younger members when they had to, and many of them have a temper. After the diary, this could be what pushes them into choosing a much more drastic course of action against the Death Eaters.
