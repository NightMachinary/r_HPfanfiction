Are there any fics that you consider to be better than Canon and would recommend over the original books?

Maybe they improve in a few areas. Update the writing or fix plotholes. Or maybe just fics that offer something really fresh.


** Not overall better than canon, but I can think of a few that deal with elements of canon better.

Linkao3(Common Sense by Grohiik) has better worldbuilding than most fics I've read, and definitely better than canon considering JKR's worldbuilding is so hit and miss.

Marauder Era characterisation in [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] can be considered at least canon adjacent, especially considering the sort of offal deemed canon these days.

Linkao3(In The Black by izzythehutt) gives an excellently nuanced look into high society politics and how privilege breeds prejudice, whereas JKR would have us believe that only a hat telling you to wear green when you're eleven makes you racist.

Linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) takes a better look at how a war machine is supposed to work than just "Dumbledore said so", and gives Harry a hero's journey that he has to work for.

Tl:dr, there are a lot of excellent writers in fandom who've dedicated a lot of time and effort into exploring elements of the Harry Potter world where JKR has repeatedly dropped the ball.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

** I'm not saying it's better than canon in every aspect, but I've never read a fic that dives into the historical potential for the wizarding world like this one. It's a fascinating take on what European history would have been if magic existed. The main story has some trope-y bits, its not everyones cup of tea, but the history alone is significant.

** The fic that gets closest for me is Meaning of One by Sovran.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

It's a Hinny Soul Bond fic, and I know they get a bad reputation, but this is legitimately amazing. The characterisations are perfect, I'd seriously just read it for McGonagall. The original ideas in world building like the Toy Shop in Diagon Alley, the Seeker's Duel, the Throw-Dough spell, all have the same depth and whimsy as canon. The relationship between Harry and Ginny is just the most wholesome and heartwarming thing, and the Bond between them has set rules abilities that are set in stone, but the Bond doesn't get explained due to some Flamel Ex Machina, it's treated the same way Love is treated in canon. And then there's the emotion, god, it made trapdoor in the third floor corridor exciting and tense again. The Ravenclaw Quidditch match had me waving my arms like a kid. The humour from the twins was just gut-busting. Then there's the heartbreak and drama, I don't want to spoil any of it.

I'm rambling aren't I...

**** Well... it's similar to AO3's M rating more than an R rating. At least in the context of the fic.

For details, it went from I think it was “PG” to “R” after it described someone's nose getting blown off.

The most you have to worry about is violence similar to Deathly Hallows, and a mature and non-fetishising, yet realistic take on puberty.

** I really depends on what you like in canon. Some people like the whimsical style, some people like the world building, some people like the plot, some people like the characters, or some of them.

There are many stories that do some or all of those things differently compared to canon, and which would be considered 'better' if you didn't like those parts of canon.

*** Really, fanfiction is a different beast than the novels. Authors already have a universe and release on a different schedule. It actually compares a bit to how Dickens used to release Novels, a piece at a time.

As for better, well that's opinion here. Rowling is a great author. She has flaws, but her work being so universally popular people can nitpick it is amazing.

** I find that the best fic are the ones where a authors build their own world, whether they only use the bare bones of Rowling's world is also a factor as well. For insistence, I find a story such as linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs) is great because it is /so/ different from many other fics I've read, and it's because the author took the time to branch away from the norm, but saying it better then the cannon? No, but it's none convectional from many 100s of other Fic's I've seen out there.

Joking aside, I personally regard the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal][Perfectly Normal]] series by BrilliantLady to be the best example of this that I've found. It explores the world and setting in a way Rowling never even considered, and it fleshes out every single character into a real /person,/ instead of a flat, one dimensional caricature.

** I'll say the Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity, mostly because it's what I'm reading now. It reads a lot like the early books, except you have things like people noticing that House Elves are basically slaves as well as hints as to /why/ they're okay with that, an actual examination of what happens when wizards visit a loving Muggle household and don't make any bones of the fact that they're ultimately pretty irrelevant, and MUCH better worldbuilding of non-Hogwarts schools.

In fact, Voldemort is the only canon character who gets namedropped, to the best of my knowledge, and a witch who might be Luna shows up in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo during third year, but it doesn't use ANY canon characters apart from that.
