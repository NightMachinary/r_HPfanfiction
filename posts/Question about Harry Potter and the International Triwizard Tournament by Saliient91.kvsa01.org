Is it still not clear what the main pairing will be in the end?

I remember reading this story about half a year ago and I actually quite liked it. My problem however was that I really loved the OC and I couldn't stand to possibly seeing her hurt in the future. I can't stand love triangles and the author never came clean about their plans. I remember many fans predicted a harem?


** From memory I believe Harry was the head of two houses and was taking one wife for each.

** Fair warning, this is rather spoiler-y:\\
Harry knows that he cannot trust her, so he performs a ritual after which her allegiances switch to him and him alone - because of that, we learn that her family forced her to make multiple different vows that forced her to act in the interest of her family and that her family planned to betray and blackmail Harry later on to serve their agenda. After the ritual, the girl and Harry are both happy because of that
