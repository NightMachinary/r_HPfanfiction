Harry goes to Azkaban falsely, gets out after X amount of years, then goes on a hidden vengeance rampage? preferably no ship, but if there is then no slash please.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]], this is very obviously modeled off of the Count of Monte Cristo, sadly it never got completed nor did it get that far after Harry got out. Also it doesn't use Azkaban.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Well, there's linkffn(do not meddle in the affairs of wizards by corwalch), which even references the book. Not exactly a rampage, but he certainly isn't forgiving anyone and is trying to piss them off as much as possible. Revenge on pretty much everybody.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.
