Like a Lichtenberg figure, basically, going over half his face.

Idk when I first noticed it, probably somewhere on tumblr a couple of years ago, but I've noticed it's become somewhat of a thing. I couldn't say if it's becoming more popular or if it's just a thing in specific niches (I seem to notice it a lot in recent fem!Harry stories?) but I was just wondering what y'all think.

Basically: /I have so many questions/. I mean this isn't like the Indian!Harry or black!Hermione ideas, which 1. add interesting undertones to character backstories (Harry's treatment by the Dursleys) 2. give interesting spins to canon developments (Hermione's fixation on house elf enslavement) and 3. add more diversity to a pretty whitebread canon. I understand why people like these and continue writing them.

But the scar?? I don't understand what that adds? I mean it's not really a topic that's discussed in the stories that I've noticed, it just gets mentioned on occasion (when somebody unfamiliar to Harry sees him for the first time, or with fem!Harry in particular there's sometimes an introspective paragraph or something about her coming to terms with how different the scar makes her with regards to conventional beauty ideals).

And I don't really understand the attraction in general. I mean why would you like that idea? I'm not saying you shouldn't, in fact in theory I'm completely ambivalent about it and don't really care. (In reality it's kind of annoying me, but that's primarily because I just don't understand and that's frustrating. Which is why I'd really appreciate some comments with people's thoughts, I don't /want/ to be annoyed by something so trivial.) I just don't understand.

Does anybody have any input? Theories? Another viewpoint? Did I miss something?


** Personally I also prefer the traditional lightning bolt (both for nostalgia reasons and because I like the symbolism of its runic form), but I can definitely see the appeal of a branching style scar. Firstly it adds weight to other characters' reactions to his scar (horrible scar...scar head...etc) which, with a smaller and less noticeable scar are far less cutting. It also adds another dimension to Harry's difficulty covering it up, whereas in canon the scar could be hidden with a hat or fringe. Another reason authors might choose a literal lightning scar is for the aesthetic - I've seen a lot of fanart of this sort and it does look pretty cool. Writers could also use the scar as an excuse for a personality change, for example Harry could be a lot more self conscious of his scar and perhaps more timid. I think it would also be interesting that when Harry's scar bleeds it would be much more extreme and horrifying than in canon. Honestly I've not seen much of it in fic, mostly just headcanons and fanart, so I think it just depends on what you're reading.

*** Ooh, that's an interesting aspect I hadn't considered before - that it gives more weight to people's reactions to Harry's scar, which the much smaller and less noticeable canon version doesn't necessarily warrant.

Thinking about it, I think the reason why that never occurred to me is because there are two ways of looking at the scar: the visual (it's noticeable, or not so much), or the metaphorical. I never questioned characters' reactions because I didn't really take the visual much into account (other than that it's in an obvious place and thus easy to spot) and ascribed it to the metaphorical; the scar is the (rumoured) remnant of the Killing Curse, which everyone is justifiably terrified of, and is also the symbol of Harry's fame. Which is why Draco attacks it and derides it, simultaneously also deriding the people who flock to Harry. So to me there was never a disparity. But that is a very interesting nuance, thank you for providing your thoughts!

With regards to how it looks - the first time I saw it I thought it was an interesting interpretation, but I gave it the same amount of attention that I'd give fanart where they wear interesting outfits. So I think when I saw it more and more from various sources it started to frustrate me, because I just didn't get it. But "it just looks cool" is a perfectly valid reason, just not one I took into account.

Yeah, I spend most of my HP fanfic time in niches, so if there are only 10 writers and 5 of them start to add a new trend to their stories, it can seem a lot more popular than it actually is.

** I can see, for a fem!Harry, an actually disfiguring scar would be more interesting because women are judged on their appearance more than men are.

I'm working on a thing where, when Harry does evil things, or at least things that Tom would especially approve of, the scar gets a little bigger and angrier looking, but it stops short of taking over his eye. Well, it's a possibility, it'll get cut if I can't find anything interesting to do with it.

*** Yeah I see where you're coming from, I just kind of feel like there are already more than enough interesting things going on in Harry's life, particularly the reinterpretation of canon for fem!Harry (did she still have to wear Dudley's clothes? What impact did that, plus her relatives' vastly different body types, have on Harry's own body image?). Plus, any scar at all in the face would already be experienced very differently by fem!Harry.

Now see, that I think is very interesting and I wouldn't have any issue whatsoever with that, because the changing of the scar from canon serves a very clear purpose.

I think I'm starting to narrow down that my issue is that there isn't really a point to changing Harry's scar (for the stories I'm talking about I mean, not for yours or for other stories in which there is a purpose). I find that frustrating. (I mean, even changing Harry into goth!Harry serves a purpose; whether I personally am into that is a different matter.)

Thank you for your input!

** I've seen people use the branching scar/large scar as a way to explain Harry being blind in An AU I've read :)

** There's a collection of one-shots which includes a story where Harry's scar gets made far worse due to a childhood "prank" gone wrong. Since the prank include hydrochloric acid... Harry ends up wearing a mask to cover his half-ruined face.

Sadly, The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/33/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][Phantom Of Hogwarts]] stops just as Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin, but the author notes that it is up for adoption by anyone who wants it (as are the other one-shots)
