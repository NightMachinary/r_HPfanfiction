I hope it's alright to post this here. None of my friends online or offline are into Harry Potter or fanfiction, so...yeah.

What I have:

- Five non-consecutive, partially completed chapters (maybe 7k words total).

- A plot outline. Involves stations of Marauder's canon at the beginning. Harry's gen isn't in it much.

- A specific idea for an ending scene... some details are vague.

- Too many notes about scenes and subplots for one fic probably.

- A pretty good handle on grammar, usually.

- Chronic, severe thesauritis/verbosity.

What I'm looking for in a beta reader:

- A good sense for what works/what doesn't in terms of phrasing and word usage. Identify awkward phrasing, unnecessary SAT words, repetitiveness, wordiness, etc, and help me fix it.

- Canon-picking. I only read the books like 10 times, when I was a teenager, and have subsisted on fanfiction since then, so feel free to show off if you're a nerd and I get stuff wrong.

- Discussions on how to structure scenes and arrange them in the story... Discussions about my story/outline as a whole, too. Put your fingers in my plot holes ;)

- Ruthless axing of junk (boring descriptions, pointless scenes, useless dialog, etc).

- Patience. I'm super busy and sometimes have no time or energy for writing for fun at all, but it would be cool if you were that pushy influence encouraging me to write more often.

- Brit-picking? honestly I don't worry too much about it.

Writing sample (a scene from the third chapter):

Sirius wonders how Peter thinks he could hide from a best friend he's had half his life. He knows everything about Peter: The first thing he wanted to be when he grew up (a lion). His favorite dream (swimming deep in the ocean). His greatest fear (having his heart broken). Where and when he had his first kiss (under the mistletoe just outside the Hufflepuff common room in their fifth year). He even knows where and when Peter will have his last Kiss (at the Ministry later this afternoon, or tomorrow if the queue of traitors is too long).

Most importantly, he knows where Peter is hiding now: His own flat. As a rat animagus, he can hide more-or-less in plain sight, and where better than a building he already knows like the back of his hand? Remus is the only other living soul who might know where Peter is, but Sirius has no idea where /he/ is, and he can't let Peter get away, so he's alone when he turns Peter's cheap, pathetic excuse for a front door into splinters with a sharp, “/diffindo/!”

He isn't sure what he was expecting as he steps over the threshold, but it sure wasn't Peter---the man---sitting on that horrible floral sofa, facing the front door and wringing his hands. Peter doesn't move, just stares right at him with a look of---

Before Peter can react---before Sirius himself even realizes how angry seeing Peter's feigned courage has made him---he's transformed into the dog, bounded across the room, and toppled both Peter and the couch over. He's still growling when he's a man again, and it's through clenched teeth that he grinds out,

“Voldemort is dead, traitor.”

“I know, Sirius, please, I can explain!”

“Exp-explain? Explain?!” Sirius sputters almost hysterically. Peter cringes. Sirius is literally shaking with rage, his heart pounding in his ears. He's never been so angry in his life. He feels like he might go mad at any moment and tear Peter's throat out with his teeth. He roars, “YOU KILLED THEM, PETER!”

“I know.” The words are so quiet, nearly whispered, that Sirius has to read Peter's lips to understand.

But then, from behind him: “Peter, dear! I thought I heard---OH!”

Sirius reflexively /Stupefied/ the old woman in the doorway. Once she's lying on the floor motionless, he recognizes her as Peter's next-door neighbor, the one with the little gray terrier that Peter walks for her sometimes when her knees are especially bad. He doesn't have time to check on her because Peter took the opportunity to transform when he was looking away, and now the rat is scampering out from under him as fast as its stubby legs will carry it. Sirius transforms back into the dog just to end up gnashing at the empty air in front of a hole beneath a cupboard. He can't let Peter get away. He leaps over the unconscious old woman lying at the front door and gallops out to the street.

Nose to the ground, Sirius wanders in random directions for a few moments before picking up the trail. The mildewy stench of shame and fear and treachery leads him down the narrow alley beside Peter's apartment block to the crowded muggle shopping district on the other side. Peter is standing at the mouth of the alley, wand pointed at Sirius, with the crowd of muggles streaming past in both directions behind him. Few spare Peter and his wand even a passing glance, let alone a second. Sirius transforms into a man but doesn't reach for his own wand immediately.

“Going to kill me too, are you Petey?”

Peter is staring hard at Sirius, looking more resolved than he's ever seen him. “No.”

Peter doesn't say the words “I have something else planned for you” out loud but Sirius reads them in the way his fingers are flexing around his wand and his other hand keeps drifting toward the frayed pocket of his robe.

Sirius takes a step forward. Peter takes a step back, out onto the sidewalk. Sirius steps forward again. He feels hot all over, sweaty, although it's a rather cool morning. He's going to kill Peter. He's going to kill the boy with the round, jovial face who made him laugh after Bellatrix wouldn't let him sit with her and her friends the first time he rode the Hogwarts Express. He's going to kill the calm, thoughtful boy he shared a dormitory with for 7 years. He's going to kill the man who stood with him and Remus in the best friends' place of honor when James and Lily married. He's going to kill the traitor who handed James, Lily, and Harry to Voldemort. Some of the panicky fluttering in his chest subsides.

Peter must see something relax in Sirius's expression because just then he finally speaks again, “Padfoot---“

Sirius scowls.

“S-Sirius, please listen. I had to do it.”

“You killed them,” Sirius mutters, unable to keep the incredulity out of his voice.

“I had to, for him to---“

Sirius takes another step forward. His posture has relaxed, and his expression is stoic, or peaceful, even. In a way, Peter knows Sirius even better than Sirius knows Peter: He knows that the Black Madness is often subtle in its presentation, but not in Sirius Black. The calm affect is an illusion. Beneath it lies something like a monster in chains.

“It was the only way! Lily figured it out, but there wasn't time to find you or Remus. I don't think she even told James the plan,” Peter is babbling, trying to come up with the right thing to say that will make Sirius understand why he had to betray James and Lily. “It worked, though, Sirius, it worked!” He finishes, breathless, close to sobs. Some of the muggles have to step around him as they pass, and both wizards are drawing stares.

“How long have you been Voldemort's spy?”

Peter hesitates, surprised by the question.

“You don't know what it's like to be vulnerable,” he says finally, voice trembling. “You don't know what it's like for your family, people you /love/, to be vulnerable.”

“You were my family, Peter.” Sirius's voice cracks, but his face is stone. In the blink of an eye, Sirius has his arm outstretched toward Peter, wand in hand. Peter turns on his heel and runs out into the road with Sirius in pursuit. Then he stops again and turns around wearing an expression of wild panic. Muggles are beginning to stop and gawk openly at the two of them.

“SIRIUS, WHY?!” He wails. “HOW COULD YOU BETRAY JAMES AND LILY?!”

Sirius doesn't hesitate. Wand raised, enraged, he shouts, “/Petrificus/---"

“They- WE trusted you!” Peter screams over him, fumbling with something in his hands.

The street between the two men erupts before Sirius finishes the spell.

Sirius slowly sits up on the pavement with ringing ears and dust choking his eyes, nose, and mouth. He's unsure what just happened. In front of him is a gaping hole where the street used to be; he can nearly see the other end of it through the smoke and settling dust. His hearing returns to him slowly, bringing screams and moans seemingly from all directions. There are muggles running all over the place, dragging the wounded away from the site of the blast, searching for loved ones, or simply trying to get away. There are corpses, too. The left half of a young woman is lying a few meters away from himself. He can see the end of a sooty little arm clutched in her outstretched hand. As the dust and smoke begin to clear from the air he can see more bodies and body parts scattered to either side of the crater. Presently, he begins to check himself for injuries. The face is dirty, but unblemished. Two arms with ten fingers. No holes in the torso. Two legs with two feet. Beside his right foot is a lone finger.

He isn't sure how he knows without transforming into the dog and smelling it, but he knows. The finger belongs to Peter. Clever Peter. Cunning, traitorous, spying, murdering Peter. Finally, his stoic façade breaks, and Sirius laughs.


** Hey I'm interested and I think I fit your criteria! I like what you've written so far and have a few remarks already, should you be willing :)

** I probably don't qualify, but this looks great and I'm already looking forward to reading it when you're done. :)

Also it's hilarious that in this fandom you can say you've 'only' read the books 10 times. What a shameful unfamiliarity with Canon. ;b
