I've read a couple of Dramione fics and I pretty much easily visualized it which may have been because of some pre-conceived notion that Draco would have been a normal bloke (even shown in original Epilogue) and the fact that a 26F "wants" to feel Draco to be positive and romantic (all thanks to Felton).

However when I see Ron going nasty or Voldemort in any positive instance (even him bearing a child with Bellatrix in cursed child) I find it difficult to visualize, hence affecting the pace of my story reading.

Does it happen with you as well?


** To me, OOC is the worst and most often committed crime in fanfiction. It is my biggest pet peeve. There's a way to write a story with keeping the characters as close to their canon selves as possible, if you don't you're basically just slapping the same name onto an OC. Now there are those fics where people change who they are etc. This can be done well according to the character, how well thought out it was, why they turned, how long it took (It shouldn't be anything like a few weeks, it should be months--again according to who the character is, what happened in their lives etc).

Some characters you can't change, I feel, without ruining them, like Voldemort or Bellatrix, I just got done torturing myself with a fic where Bellatrix/Harry are in the Chamber of Secrets when Harry rapes her to avenge Sirius, she likes it and in 2 minutes they fall in love, he helps her escape and keeps her hidden, all in the first chapter. It's just not plausible, if you wanted to attempt to make it so you'd have to really work hard at it, not chapter 1, not after them talking to each other in what would be 2 minutes in real life.

Things like this are not okay. I could go on forever about this

**** Yes I was like this is so dumb, harry would never do that and even if you could write it so he could rape bella, you'd have to go into his thoughts and how his mind changed over months to get to the point where harry would be like that and then to fall in love? like what is this.

It was titled "Don't Look Back", more like "Read the summary, and don't look further inside."

*** Is it? Can you write a Harry the Genius fanfiction with canon Harry as the "driver"? No way mate! Canon Harry isn't a genius, he has no drive, he is a lazy fuck and should IMHO have died in the end (heroic sacrifice! To show that you need to actually prepare yourself to survive situations like that and that manipulative headmasters aren't good people to put your trust in!)

** I just wanted to speak to one part of this post in order to say that I find it incredibly easy to visualize Voldemort having a child with Bellatrix. Don't imagine he was in love with her, or that he had any desire for children or an heir, or even a sex drive. Nope. None of that.

What I think about is, "Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you shall renew your son!" Body parts of family members are clearly powerful ingredients in dark rituals. And the child of Voldemort and Bellatrix would be a /firstborn/ child on both sides. Think how many jokes there are about people trading or signing away their firstborn. Clearly they're valued property for some reason.

Yep, if you ask me, Voldie's daughter is pretty damn lucky dad popped off when he did because if he'd won she would have been chopped up for potions ingredients long ago and never lived to adulthood like in the play.

** I never understood how anyone found Draco good looking. I think that is mostly due to a German YouTube parody in which Dobby describes Draco along the following lines:

#+begin_quote
  You ought to know the boy. His entire body is thoroughly coated with lube. Even his hair is dripping with it. Do you know the expression "crawling into somebody's ass"? [sucking up to somebody] He takes that literally.
#+end_quote

Having seen that ten years ago I could never unsee that mental image and the fact that Draco has two boys following him everywhere did not help. And to me as a guy, a good-looking man is Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, not some 16/17-year-old wannabe member of the magical Hitler-Youth.

Nasty Ron, however, is something I have no problems imagining because I had more than one "friend" fuck me over. Perhaps I am just cynical but I can totally see Ron being a dick and turning on Harry or Hermione happening. I can get behind a Machiavellian Dumbledore who uses Harry as a pawn but an evil Dumbledore or Death Eater Ron is just too OOC to be convincing. Same with Ginny or Molly slipping Harry a love potion. That seems somewhat plausible. But Molly running an empire with her potions or a happy Weasley family potion scheme is too far fetched.

*** I grew up with the Harry Potter movies and Draco has always been Tom Felton to me. Even when he was younger I have always thought he was kind of cute/not bad looking, now as an adult I think he is quite attractive so it's I think easier for me to visualize him as not a bad guy. I am not a fan of the gelled hair look, but without it he looks fine. I don't know if I can say I care for Draco that much, but his arc in HBP was wonderfully angsty and did a good job of portraying him more sympatherically as someone who has been forced to do things that he doesn't want to do at the threat of his family and his own life. He seems nice in real life too so it's easier to ignore his bad and whiny behavior in the movies.

Plus I saw him in Arrow recently and he has gotten better looking I think (Or maybe I am just over the phase of where I used to be into emo looking guys, haha).

But as a girl, I have to say that it may be that I just don't find Arnold or any super strong muscle guys very attractive. Someone like present day Tom Felton is just way sexier to me than bodybuilder Arnold in his prime with bulging muscles or his terminator look.

These are not two words I'd use together. But I guess it comes down to preference.

Personally, I never saw how Draco was forced to do anything. He had choices (sneaking his mother to Heathrow under an invisibility cloak and running to Auckland, going to Dumbledore for help) but he chose to commit treason, use Unforgivables and he broke the Geneva convention in the process, making him a war criminal. A suitcase filled with Galleons would have set them for life but he made several assassination attempts instead of running if he was not into the cause.

I mean, yeah, he was in a tough spot but he really just got what he asked for (the return of the Dark Lord) and others had a way worse hand to deal with. Andromeda, Edward, Teddy and Nymphadora "I have to die for the trope" Tonks, Harry "I am fate's bitch" Potter, Fleur "Molly, Ginny and Ron are my in-laws" Weasley, Hermione "JKR thinks that fighting and belittling makes a successful relationships" Weasley or even Luna "My mother died and my father is no fit caretaker" Lovegood to name just a few.

Yes, I can see that. Angst (in moderation at least) is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I can understand why someone wouldn't like it. I have moods where I enjoy it as long as it's not too much which is why I enjoyed his arc. I don't think that he was a good person or that he did not have other choices or that other characters did not have it worse. I just find the actor attractive in real life which helps me feel better about him and enjoy the arc of "snobby rich kid given almost impossible task he doesn't want to do by organization he thought was awesome and him freaking out about it". I am sure he could have left the country, but that would be a lot more boring to read about instead of watching him struggle with actually killing someone after all his talk about how great the death eater ideals are.

I do like redemption arcs though and the thought that people can change for the better even if they start out as a total asshole, no matter how unlikely that is. Not someone I would ever want to meet in real life, but entertaining and interesting to read about or watch in movies/TV. Seems to be fairly common and popular trope for a lot of fandoms so I can't be the only one either since those characters are often very popular.

** I can deal with OOCness if there's a justification for it, if the entire premise of the fic is that it's an AU where a single life changing event has occurred to a particular character then I can accept that, I just really dislike fics where characters are different for no reason.

I can deal with certain characters acting differently if that's the point of the fic, you can't exactly have Harry become a Dark Lord or have Draco Malfoy renounce his family due to his love for Hermione Granger without some change in the character's personalities. Otherwise it's a total turn off for me I mean I'm sorry, but despite any questionable actions Dumbledore isn't actually vying for the death and misery of your favourite characters and unless there's some serious time-travel fix-it going on, Tom Riddle isn't gonna be all sunshine and rainbows either.

** How you women can think this pale guy is hot is beyond me (yes, I am male but I can admit that somebody like Pierce Brosnan is attractive!)...

Still, it depends on the character! Harry being OC and maybe cruel? Yeah, that I can do!

Draco however? If there's a turning point event? Maybe, but not enough to make Hermione/Draco or Ginny/Draco possible! Draco IMHO just doesn't deserve a GF, he deserves a prison cell till he dies of old age IMHO and that's why I just can't read fanfictions that include Hermione/Draco...give him some pureblood-flozy and that works (still makes me cringe and wish that he is dead, but I can live with it!)
