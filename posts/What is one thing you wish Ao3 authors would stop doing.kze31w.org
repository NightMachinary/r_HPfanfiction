For me its using hyperspecific tags for things that have a more general option and don't put any more general tags on.

Like let's say you have a oc in your fic. But instead of putting oc or any variant of oc in your tags you just tag it something like like Josephine x Harry.

No one who wants to see a oc or Harry x Oc is going to be able to find this fic. And no one who wants to filter out oc or oc shipping fics is going to be able to filter this out. I mean go ahead tag your oc name x Harry or whoever. But also put oc tags on it ? Why would you not do that ? Why would you only put the specific tag and not a general one on it?

******* True. I've never read the books, though, so I don't know if some characters deserve the MC tag exclusively.

But for the vast, vast majority of FF this ain't the case. People just confuse "main character" and something like "POV time" or "story focuses on", and want put in the latter, even though the box is for the former.

I'd suggest Ao3 split their character categories in two (one for MC, one for everone else), but you'd run into exactly the same problem. I suppose strictly limiting the MC category to one or two could work, though. Just mark one or two of your 100 characters the MC ... sounds like a decent compromise. I might just suggest that in the feedback form, in fact.

********* ... I know of no definition of the trope that includes "five main characters". Without context, the main character is the leader, though any story can certainly make any of the members the main character -- it depends on whose story is told. It will be exceptionally rare that five (equal, in the former sense) stories are told at once. GRRM probably goes there (but as I said, I haven't read the books), and he is noted for his singular approach w.r.t. characters. Strictly speaking, it might even be more accurate to say that his story has /no/ main character, but I'll defer to readers.

Anyway, it appears we simply have different ideas of what a "main character" is, but then again, that was just what I was trying to get across here.

*********** Leaving aside that "protagonist" literally renders to "leading" (or "first") character?

We can, of course, split hairs over "main character" and "protagonist". The classic definition of the former is the audience's eyes into the story, while the latter would pursue, drive forward, in that sense: create the story. Most often (and certainly for FF), they are one, so that's what I went with. If the problem only was debating whether the MC or the protagonist was tagged for a story, we would have luxury problems ...

At any rate, for either definition, there will be virtually no stories with multiple MC/protagonists. Already from a technical POV: You can't write a story through two eyes simultaneously, only consecutively. And you usually write one story at a time, not many. In instances where this is different, you don't /have/ a main character, see e.g. Tolstoy's War and Peace, because it gives equal weight to many characters. On the other hand, in the case of The Magnificient Seven (the 1960 version), the protagonist (and arguably main character as well) is Chris Adams. What you call the other six I don't particularly mind, but he is clearly driving the story.

.

Putting aside this technical debate, though: If you have four boxes, and are bent on filling them up, you put in your characters in order of relevance to the story. I maintain that doing so will adequately describe your story at all times, where "adequately" renders to "it will be found by the people whose interest you are trying to attract". And since there literally is no other purpose for those tags, in the end, it's sufficient, and no one cares about labels and definitions.

YES! This is one of my pet peeves - it's like the author is cutting themselves off at the ankles because they refuse to use any tags that are more specific than character or ship tags. I have often thought that a ‚Äúsuggest a tag‚Äù button/form would be helpful, especially for authors newer to AO3 (might be more of an issue for auths coming from ffn?). I can imagine that'd turn into a shitshow on more popular fics immediately, though.

For some reason people got it in their heads that Quirkless people are systematically mistreated(Despite that never really being the case); this creates alot of dead plot lines; and sloppy writing.

Practically none of em know how to write a compelling main character. Izuku archetypes boil down to "Stutters and useless" "Stutters but badass" "The Joker", and "Author Wish Fulfillment the character"

******* I find 99% of BNHA fics just awful. There's so many problems with them that in spending an hour searching I might find only one fic that I might want to read. It's not just differences between Eastern and Western school systems but the whole lack of understanding of the culture. Shounen anime and manga gets away with being a lot less concerned with traditions and hierarchy, but elements of it are still there. You can't just abandon it wholesale. Characters talking without honourifics isn't the end of the world, but if these are gone hierarchy and respect have to be expressed through actions. It's just so much Americanisms.

Speaking of Americanisms, I hate how little research is done so there's so much that immediately sticks out to me and breaks SoD. Beyond the lack of understanding of the culture, characters just go around spouting uniquely American pop culture. Every fic where Izuku sings involves purely English songs. Plus, the setting is 200 years in the future, that stretches belief, but then it's contemporary pop songs that maybe one in twenty will be remembered by later generations. I understand it's almost necessary to the premise of the fic so that readers can follow along, but anachronistic English songs is the straw that breaks the camel's back with everything else going on. Another thing is fics using US dollars instead of yen. I even checked chapter 100 of the manga specifically to see what currency they were using, and even though it's anachronistic to see the same yen designs, it was definitely yen. There was even one fic that took the time to have a Japanese-style bullying scene involving a funeral flower arrangement but then later involved Izuku buying an umbrella with dollars.

I hate how characters are written too. Not just Bakugou but it seems most authors don't have any real grasp over any character's personality, just aspects which are distorted so heavily. Izuku's characterisation makes me want to vomit most of the time. There's either harem master, trauma-porn, or Tumblr meme. He doesn't feel like a real character. Not a lot of fics capture both his kindness and justice as a person and understand how his history with bullying affects him. It's even worse when they have characters text. Maybe a few people will text completely different from how they talk, but every character in every fic is too much. Making Tumblr-esque jokes in texts is awful too.

Somehow, the mostly modern, shounen fantasy setting causes writers to feel a lot more free to change and fill in gaps with Western stuff. It's interesting when comparing it with other shounen anime/manga fandoms. Naruto you can't just interject Americanisms willy-nilly. Authors still don't always get the culture, but I've noticed a higher percentage of fics do. Hikaru no Go is mostly not fantasy and deals with a traditional sport with lots more formal traditions, so writers don't really deviate heavily. Fate from my brief forays into it seems to stick to more Eastern culture parts too. I wonder what a comparable setting would be, because I'd like to compare the closest thing to it and see the differences in fics.

If that wasn't enough, the divorce had severely damaged his father's ability to trust women, so Mineta grew up having had a mother who threw him away and a father who disliked the thought of having another romantic relationship due to how he had been burned with his first one.

If your list of tags takes up the full screen, /I will skip your story/.

Usually if I'm excluding one, I want to exclude both others (especially on account of most authors using the tags interchangeably). With that in mind, I actually don't mind if an author tags all three - excluding any of the tags is enough to not see that story, which means that functionality works.

And actually no, the piped version (Tom Riddle|Voldemort/Harry Potter) doesn't catch all of them - it's just Yet Another Competing Tag for Harry/Voldemort, the way it's used. There's 1200-something stories tagged with Harry Potter/Tom Riddle|Voldemort that aren't tagged with either Harry Potter/Tom Riddle or Harry Potter/Voldemort, and from what I remember the reverse is also true (stories tagged with either Harry/Riddle or Harry/Voldemort that aren't tagged with the combined tag).

I get that there's a difference there, but honestly if it's aliased it just changes from "authors treat them interchangeable so you have to include all 3" to "just include one, and for the few authors that do it right you can still exclude the other versions separately" if you actually want to read that sort of thing, and if you don't want any you don't have to jump through hoops.

I did a double-check just now. I looked at "Harry Potter/Tom Riddle" and get 4788 works. Adding "Harry Potter/Tom Riddle | Voldemort" to the tag filtering makes no difference, still 4788 fics. The same thing happens with "Harry Potter/Voldemort vs "Harry Potter/Voldemort + Harry Potter/Tom Riddle | Voldemort", both show 2564 fics.

Tomione tags work the same way (the other Voldemort ship among the top 30 most popular ships).

However, there are actually some ships with odd tag behaviour. While it might have been fixed since, the last time I checked, "Jily" actually has more fics than "James Potter/Lily Evans Potter". The former catches all of the latter, plus a few fics that only has the Jily tag.

**** That's the exact problem, though. It is, in fact, /very/ common for authors to tag evil/manipulative/GreaterGood!Dumbledore but then not tag "character bashing" or "Dumbledore Bashing". Or to just not tag any of those at all, and then paint him as the good guy for all of 2 chapters before Suddenly‚Ñ¢ he conspires with Molly Weasley to put love potions in Harry's pumpkin juice and set the Weasleys up with his inheritance once he croaks it.

Ditto with the Weasleys - there's quite a few tags there, that /really/ should just be aliased to "Character Bashing" so that tag would get all of them, but they aren't aliased there.

And that's not even getting into the amount of times "Independent Harry Potter" or similar just means "Dumbledore And Weasley Bashing But I Didn't Want To Tag That".

** My biggest problem with Ao3, not sure if this is on the author(s) or the site itself, is how it is completely impossible to search on fics with a major character. This is the one thing FFN does better IMO.

I read a lot of Snape fics. On FFN, searching for those is trivial: filter on fics with "Severus S.", and there you go. On Ao3, I have several tabs open whenever I want to look for Snape-centric fics: one for each major ship that I have at least marginal interest in. I don't actually mind gen, but I have no idea how to search for Snape-centric fics that don't involve him romantically (or platonically) with someone. So I have a (platonic) SS&HP list, a SSHG list, a SSOC list and a SSLE one. Of those, the only ship I actually like is SSLE (and I guess SS&HP but I wouldn't really count that as a ship). As for the others, I really only read a fraction of whatever options it has (on top of the already existing "normal" fraction of fics I bother to read). And on SSHG I also have to exclude teacher/student.

**** Ao3 search is horrible for finding gen fics focused on secondary characters. A character like Luna for example is very common to see in fics but is rarely the focus. Searching for her will give you tons of fics but in the majority she is just a minor character who barely appears.

I just did a search for her and no fics on the first page of 18k results even had her listed in the top characters for the fic. How would you even begin to find fics about her in that situation? I can start excluding ships like Harry/Draco but that still doesn't do much. The search in this case is almost completely useless.

On FFN on the other hand you search for Luna and the only fics you get are those where she is a major character.

Like I don't even get what they're trying to accomplish. Sneaking stuff in like that isn't a good way to get fans.

Also, wishful thinking but I really wish they'd cut down on the outright pedophilia. Late teens Harry/Voldemort is one thing but there are /way/ too many fics with a 65-something Voldemort obsessing over an 11y/o Harry with a heavy focus on him being a kid.

The second time I returned was when I saw a similar thread to this and gave it another try; lets just say it did not work out well for me and so I only use the site when reading some story's recommend from here. I lost trust in the search results.

Issues I faced where that the authors used incorrect tags or did not use tags and the unhelpful summaries with incorrectly tagged stories.

The other one is the really bad search results. When I put in my search criteria I expect a search result to somewhat match not be completely disregarded.

I spent hours searching and when I found something more than once I found myself half way through a story only to find it contained some wired fetish or made me uncomfortable to continue.

It is why I only read gen stuff or works that don't dissolve into porn and the relationship stuff can be skipped by for stuff I commit myself into finishing. This includes the few fics I have read that are not gen or het as the plot was what won me over.

Instead of using ‚Äúso and so/so and so‚Äù for romantic and ‚Äúso and so & so and so‚Äù for platonic relationships they'll tag the ship name, or tag the relationship in the romantic variant of it but then put in brackets that it's ‚Äúsibling‚Äù or something?

Tag walls. Why? Just...why? No one wants to read all of that. Tag what's necessary (main characters only, relationships, genre (ie, fluff/angst) and canon compliance or divergence. maybe some core themes. I don't need to hear the characters life story. That's what the fic is for.)

And jumping onto what I just touched on, just plain bad tagging. Use the archive warnings right, use the categories and ratings right, tag your warnings foe those it might trigger. Yikes, it's not a lot to ask.

There are a metric ton's worth of fics on AO3 that overtag or tag things redundantly. It's almost gotten to the point that the way an author tags is indicative to the style, and sometimes quality, of their writing. It's not an omnipresent trend, but I've noticed that the more an author overtags, the more underwhelming their writing style or fic quality is. There are a hundred possible arguments as to why that is, but my writing group generally agrees that when authors think it's okay to redundantly tag for the sake of "comedy" or "cuteness", they also consider it okay to write redundantly or with the same grammar that they tag with.

Basically, it boils down to tagging things redundantly, and then has a tendency to lead into poor writing quality. Sure, you can argue that it's okay to do because it's commonplace, but something being commonplace doesn't make it noteworthy, or even good.

The tag has lost any meaning it ever had because it is not used consistently.

** When authors change the gender of a character and do not reflect that in the author tags. Find a story with a pairing you like only for one of the characters to be gender-flipped is the most depressing thing I have ever found out. Not even a reason in the story on why their gender changed. Female Harry is one of my biggest gripes, even more so if the name is ‚ÄòHarriet' or ‚ÄòHari', or anything similar to Harry. If Harry wants to be a female in the story, cool, just changing his gender makes him an OC based on Harry.

This thread is too similar to a pet peeve thread. I was close to going off the rails.

** I'm inclined to be sceptical of the existence/relevance of "overtagging". Personally, when I read fanfic I'm looking for a specific sort of idea and a lot of the time that's what would ordinarily be a spoiler.

However, this does mean... please don't tag a relationship unless it's the focus of the plot.

I guess, maybe, I wouldn't want to read Snarry or Tomarry even as a precursor to Hinny because of the basic problems with Snarry or Tomarry but I genuinely don't know. (I mean, when I was reading Harmony I didn't mind background Hinny but that's quite different.) But you can do "past Tomarry" to capture that idea (and I don't think people would be annoyed if you said, "I've tagged this past [ship] but they don't actually break up until chapter 20 of 100").

I must say, though, most fics I read come from mentions in this sub so I don't really know much about how they interact with the search function.

In an ideal world, this would be a valid reason to have 3 separate tags. In practice, the tags are used pretty much interchangeably by most authors to the point where there's no reason for all three to exist without aliasing.

***** Quite a lot of Harry/Tom fics involve the diary horcrux manipulating him or the scar horcrux, which are always equivalent to paedophilia or extremely manipulative and dangerous relationships.

*** I think having the tag system would be better than not having it, and AO3 is much more pleasant to look at for me, from a website-design standpoint - but a tagging system isn't worth much if it's misused to the point of tags becoming meaningless.

With FFN, if I look for Harry and Ginny as characters and turn "pairing" on, I know I'm going to get a story where Harry/Ginny is endgame. With AO3's tagging, when I search for Harry/Ginny as a relationship, I'll still have to filter out a ton of stuff where the relationship happens for all of one sentence before the love-potion wears off and Ginny ends up in Azkaban for line-theft, or it's one-sided on Ginny's part, or they're both in the background in favor of a bad reader-insert getting with Severus Snape, et cetera.

The warnings are nice, but they'd be nicer if they were actually /used correctly/. No sense of security is better than a false one, and there's been a bunch of times where I'd specifically excluded something only to still find it prominently in the story I clicked.

*** I mean I use FFN and have my own problems with the site; but can you honestly say that you would be alright with reading 40000 + words only to get to a stage that the main character changed sexual orientation involving none human without a hint? because I have and I disliked it. That's the kind of things that need tags and I won't mention the one that had genital mutilation and consumption I found. That one I was happy was early on allowing me to stop reading.

It's all about a readers comfort levels, if we want to search for a type of fic the author should tag correctly for his future reader base. But the rest that are searching for fics that exclude such content should be provided information that allows us to decide if we want to continue or not and not have it hidden intentionally or unintentionally. The site should require all new stories to be tagged and limit tags to 10 at most and FFN should too.

I agree though, there are a lot more complaints about tags ITT than I thought there'd be! Tags can get annoying for sure, but having them is just so much better than not. You can't search or filter for shit on FFN, and if you have a hard limit on a subject or theme (i.e. sexual assault), FFN is basically impossible to use. It's a bummer.

I was happy when I first saw the search function and filter options, they just don't work without all authors contributing to the system of tagging correctly. They probably need to add a hint popup for new authors and update to allow a mod to correctly tag a reported story when people report with a highlighted paragraph or something but I can see that being abused ü§î.
