:FlairText: Fic Recommendations
:END:
Because I was looking for a good fic with three dimensional/complex characters.\\
No Hinny whatsoever.\\
Preferably Drarry, Harmione(Harry x Hermione), Dramione.\\
In that exact order of preference.\\
I suppose it goes without saying that the writing itself should be good, an example of writing could be It Was All A Game(or whatever the book it called) on Wattpad though it's not the prime example, it's the best I've encountered in my entire time reading fan fiction.

I'm sorry if I'm being too picky, I've just encountered a lot of shit fics and am sick of it.


** I notice nobody has replied to this - would you like to read my fic? It isn't one of your preferred pairings, but I like to think it meets your standards of well-written and concerning 'three dimensional/complex characters'. Might keep you entertained until someone more helpful comes along at least - I just posted Chapter 10!

This way if you'd like to check it out:

***** Maybe I'll read it one day. Right now though, no. I don't mean to insult, it's just I'm not a fan of Snape and the mature warning makes me think there's sex which I don't like reading about(I'm ace).

** For Harmony one of my faves is linkffn(That Old House by vanillaparchment)\\
For Dramione I think some great examples are linkffn(Isolation Bex-chan) and The Fallout which sadly is not online anymore.\\
If you want a less serious and more NSFW fic, I really liked linkffn(Eros and Psyche by RZZMG)

​

P.S. If anyone dislikes the pairings mentioned just scroll down, instead of downvoting

  “It's not for long,” Hermione said. “By the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.”“Listen to you!” Ron said. “He's got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at Malfoy Manor. With Draco Malfoy.”“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, because he hadn't just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they'd ever been before.

  Draco snorted. “I'm not reduced to penury. I want something considerably beyond money, and I rather think you're the only one can give it to me.” “You want the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry said, flatly. He'd half expected as much; it was the only thing he had that Draco could want---“Don't be stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “I want my reputation back.”

  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love.
