So I've come across quite a few stories where certain characters are bashed. Why is that? I remember it being popular in like 2011/2012 but I thought it had died down, but I still see it being pretty popular to bash someone.

I never understood the appeal for it myself and if a summary says Weasley or Dumbledore bashing I tend to skip the story. Even if the story is really good I just don't want to read a story where characters are bashed.

So thoughts? Why is it a thing and why is it still a popular thing to do? Do you do it when you write? Do you like stories that bash characters?


** I think a big part of the problem is that most fanfiction authors read fanfiction, so fanon and canon eventually start blurring together. If you read the Harry Potter series back in...let's say, High School, and for the past few years you've only been reading fanfiction, you're probably going to associate fanon character traits with how the characters actually act.

Sirus suddenly becomes a swag master who hits on anything with a vagina. Dumbledore's eye twinkles are secretly legilimency and every single action he takes, including small actions like eating some spaghetti and taking a shit, are merely steps in his plan to sacrificing Harry for the Greater Good.

Ron is a lazy glutton who would gladly sell out Harry for a knut, and won't let Harry get any form of happiness without being insanely jealous about it. Hermione is a sex goddess with rockin tits and no physical flaws whatsoever, and she also has an IQ of over 1000. She is always right. Always.

Severus is either a pedophile who fucks Draco on the daily and would love to crucio first years, or he's just a whiny bitch going on about 'muh Lily' and swears total loyalty to Indy!Harry despite years of mutual hatred.

I was once talking to a friend of mine who hates Ron; when I asked why, he mentioned the usual 'oh he betrayed Harry at the tournament and the Horcux hunt' and then he said that Ron called Hermione a mudblood. I was speechless for a moment, asked if he was 100% sure on that, and he said yes.

Another problem is that, well, I personally think that JKR didn't have every single plot idea planned out when she started writing the series. Some stuff might have been thought of (stuff like Severus loving Lily, for one) but overall I doubt it. So when we look at the actions of characters in later books, it makes their actions in previous books look dastardly when it wasn't intended to be.

The romantic obstacle is always bashed, because laziness and stupidity. See: Ginny in Harry/other fics, Ron in Hermione/other fics, James in Snape/Lily fics, Lily in Snape/other fics, Harry in Draco/Ginny fics.

Because people writing wank fantasies want their protagonists to be all self righteously lecturing, which can't be done unless they strawman the other characters and take away their ability to argue reasonably. See: The whole indy!Harry genre.

Because it is edgy and oh-so-cool.

Because fanfiction by its very nature is an echo chamber of unoriginal opinions. If someone writes a particular kind of fic, then everyone starts writing the same kind, to the point that we have purely fanon templates of several kinds of fics. Fandom breeds stupidity.

** For me, the word bashing means the story isn't well written. Good characterization is one of the pillars of a good work. You can dislike a character and still write them well. Declaring "bashing" in your story summary is basically admitting you just created a strawman to beat on and not a fully fleshed out realized character. Fully fleshed out characters don't have to be likable.

** Part of it with Ron is because if you don't write him well, he's kind of a waste of a character. He can be written well, but people focus on the easily inflated ego, the temper, the inadequacy complex.. Which admittedly is a part of Ron's character but he's more useful than that.

He is the Wizard Friend, the one who understands the culture of wizzardly affairs. Hermione knows magic, but Ron understands Wizards.

It gets weird when you have a more knowledgeable Harry (lets say if he was raised by magic users) but Ron's role still makes sense as one who is intrinsically tied by his relations to the Ministry .

** First of all, many fanfiction authors are ... not good. They write shallow, 2-dimensional characters based on just a few character traits, so the characters end up as caricatures of themselves.

Then there's the tendency to look at the world in black-and-white, which is so typical of the US where most authors live. Disney is a perfect example of that. The heroes are all good with no bad characteristics, the villains have no redeeming features. JKR managed to create ambiguous characters with both good and bad sides. [[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/][Miyazaki]] is a master of that.

The plot also raises questions about the characters' personalities and motives. Ron is a brave and loyal friend, but his irrational jealousy often trumps that loyalty, which creates problems. He's a lazy glutton, and starts out being borderline abusive towards Hermione.

Dumbledore is a particularly difficult character. He makes so many mistakes, and contradicts himself so much, that the only conclusion is that he's either evil or massively incompetent. He always knew that Harry would have a bad childhood, and then he hides vital information from him to ... spare him? He always knew that Harry would have to face Voldemort, and does nothing to prepare him for that. He has several powerful positions, but doesn't make sure that justice has properly been done in the case of Sirius Black. Sirius Black was supposedly Voldemort's right hand man (or something like that), and wasn't even questioned before being thrown into Azkaban.

Not to mention that Hagrid in effect /kidnapped/ Harry from his own godfather. Harry was /immediately/ sent to the Dursleys, even before Sirius became a suspect. And then he was /left on the doorstep in November/ with just a letter telling the Dursleys that they now had another mouth to feed, and /btw your sister is dead/. Many fics use that to remove Harry from the Dursleys and give him a happy childhood somewhere else.

How did everyone know what Harry looked like? Why was Remus the only werewolf to go to Hogwarts? Why did he keep his distance from Harry, even after 3rd year?

The plot raises so many questions that it's easy to answer them by attributing central characters with incompetence or outright malice.

JKR was just as guilty creating black-and-white world, since Voldemort and his Death Eaters almost had none redeeming values. (Malfoys' love for each other hardly qualified, as many Nazi monsters were also 'loving family persons')

He and Harry were both slackers. At least Ron as a Pureblood could afford to slack off, whereas Harry couldn't. Hermione was once a jerk as well. For example, if you had been on the receiving end of Hermione's Wingadium Leviosa showoff, what would you have thought? Ron didn't even insult her directly, but merely complained to his other friends. As for calling someone abusive, what about Hermione? She physically assaulted Ron for kissing another girl, even though she wasn't in a relationship with him.

Dumbledore is the worst written character in the entire Series. He is nothing but a dumbed down plot device so kids could play heroes. On the other hand, if you give JKR a pass, then Dumbledore's in-story behaviors were one of utter incompetence and criminal negligence. He completely failed as a political and military leader. Someone like him should be bashed worse than Neville Chamberlain or Herbert Hoover in history.

Dumbledore couldn't force the government to imprison people. He wasn't the dictator. He wasn't even Minister. He was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot; a position you can be easily removed from as we saw in Order of the Phoenix. His only real job was being the head of Hogwarts.

** I think many writers are sick of certain characters being portrayed too 'light sided', so to speak. While I find it well rounded that Rowling had genuine, well thought out and consistent flaws for the main characters, I feel that some of the surrounding elements did not appropriately act.

Everyone thinks Ron magically matured post-BoH, despite abandoning his friends in their most dangerous adventure yet (and it wasn't even the first time he did this! Tournament, yeah?)

Everyone thinks that Dumbledore is still an infallible man, even though his desire to keep secrets and manipulations caused pain, suffering, and death to many people.

Or Molly Weasley, and her flaky attitude towards Hermione in 4th year was somehow easily forgotten.

A lot of writers, myself included, like having fictions where these flaws don't magically disappear, that some people don't see these characters as inherently good. Now, I draw a line at the absurdity of some of the excessive and OOC fictions out there, but a lot of people view bashing as a portrayal that these characters, canon wise, are incapable of being anything but good. Ron was an ass. I expect him to eventually grow out of it or get worse. Molly is a bit judgemental. Dumbledore left a magical child on the doorstep of magic-hating people.

** I think these are the primary reasons for so many bash fics:

- JKR described the magical world as a horrible dystopia, once readers got past the 'fantastic' facade of the magic.
- Children's literature generally dumbed down adults. In HP's case it was mostly Dumbledore who got handed the idiot ball, so he got the most bashing as a result.
- Then shippers piled in and bashed those who blocked their favorite ships. This effort was led by Movie screenwriter Steve Kloves, who was an Emma fan and tried his best to push for a Harmony solution. I see the plethora of Ron/Ginny bash fics heavily influenced by Kloves' very biased writing.
- Finally, the stake of the war against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy far worse than Nazis and ISIS), and yet JKR wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle. For example, the Trio already knocked out Greyback after he mutilated Lavender. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again. Many readers, including me, don't like that attitude AT ALL.

*** To follow up on the last point. The epilogue shits on the memory of the fallen by allowing people like Malfoy to live a normal life instead of rotting away in a prison cell for murder, terrorism and treason.

Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore were no good people. The later might have had good intentions but he fucked up, badly. And yet Harry spits on all the dead by naming his son Albus Severus. Add in the casual disregard for Ron assaulting a muggle and that is the reason these characters get bashed, just for the last chapter of the books.

And the books are far too forgiving towards people like Lupin, who was a coward, an asshole who broke his wedding vows within a year and did almost nothing to help Harry (the Patronus lessons were part of his job and even those were not that good since he saw that Harry was not getting the spell to work and yet set the dementor/boggart free) and you have more reasons, why certain characters are portrayed negatively.

** Fact 1: Most fanfiction is shit writing.

Fact 2: Bashing is shit character design and writing.

Any story that has bashing in it is by default bad. Bashing takes away a character's third dimension. A bashfic-Ron or bashfic-Dumbledore will never be well done villains, because everything that makes a good villain is taken from them. They will not learn, they will not grow with the challenges, they won't adapt or overcome. Bashed characters are a caricature of the actual character where their worst flaws are exaggerated and their better sides forgotten or ridiculed. Why are they written? They're easy to beat. To some they may even be satisfying to beat. Authors dislike, or even hate the actual character and find satisfaction in taking away everything that would make the character interesting, followed by ridiculing and beating the empty husk that is left over.

Why is it popular? I think for the same reason the "Transformers" movies are popular. Its mindless. They're easy, black and white. And to be honest... consuming it isn't bad. I cannot blame someone trying to find something that lets your brain go into standby and just consume.

But I'm with you. I don't find the appeal in them either.

**** Your three main characters are:

- Harry, whose main virtue is attendance and doesn't seem terribly curious or interested to be in a school of FUCKING MAGIC, or about his parents, or anything that happens to him
- Ron, who occasionally fails even at that
- Hermione, who beats Ron for attendance and /also/ seems to give a shit about being in a school of FUCKING MAGIC, even if her interest is mainly that it's a school and not, you know, MAGIC, and also she has some skill that she seems to gain through her own efforts, and also she's got occasional bits of common sense (ie let the professors handle things when you can, since they're better at magic, better studied, and it's their actual job)

It's not surprising that she's put on a pedestal sometimes. You just have to blur away her flaws a bit to make her a worthwhile protagonist, instead of giving her a personality transplant as with Harry and Ron.

**** Yup. That's why you'll also see fics of people getting revenge on Umbridge much more well-received than others.

But most people have a few characters they dislike beyond Umbridge. For me, it's Ron and Snape. For some others, it's Ginny and Molly. For some it's Harry himself. And I think people with these preferences are more likely to enjoy fics that bash their "least-favourites".

** Because both Ron (less so) and Dumbledore (more so) are kind of dicks and it's enjoyable to treat them how they deserve to be treated when canon wants us to love them for being dicks.
