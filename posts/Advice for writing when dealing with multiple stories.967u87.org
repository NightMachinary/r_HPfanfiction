I started writing about a month ago and I was working on a single story. As I got into the writing process, I kept coming up with ideas for other stories and I'd start a new google doc and hash out some of the main plot points and details for the new story. Then I'd try to go back to my original story. It's been kind of a challenge to make meaningful progress on my original story because I keep getting distracted by other story ideas. Instead of having one long story going, I have dozens of pretty stories that have only been slightly written. How do you manage a situation like this? I feel like it would be hard to be pecking away at a handful of stories at once, but maybe some of you have had success with this?


** I'll give you some rather unpopular advice: Don't feel obligated to write a specific story, just write whatever you feel like. Your work will suffer if you force yourself to sit down and focus on something you aren't 100% invested in.

I was in a similar situation, my primary story that I had been working on for a month I just couldn't focus on. I had other ideas I wanted to flesh out and my heart wasn't in it. I noticed whatever I wrote wasn't my best, so I gave in and moved to my other ideas. *My motivation and quality of work improved greatly.* My primary story isn't being worked on(sorry readers), but you know what that's ok. I was enjoying what I was doing, and I was making good progress on my other works.

I honestly think having a lot of 20k/30k works isn't a bad thing. This is after all not a job nor an obligation. As long as you are having fun and improving as a writer *why would you need to change*? Just do what you have been, focus on whatever you want. It's ok not to make progress on your primary story.

That's unpopular advice? Really? I think that's excellent advice.

**** Judging by the attitude towards abandoned fics and the hate authors receive when they stop writing a story and switch to another I'd say that it is rather unpopular, at least from a reader's standpoint.

*** That is very good advice Moomoo! :) Yes lots of people here DO forget this is just a HOBBY. It is for FUN and yes therefore nobody should have to follow actual writing techniques and habits if they do not want to!

** When I was writing my super-long story, I would get ideas for sort of offshoot stories. Some of them were so captivating that I just had to write them immediately, so I did. I think in the year it took to finish the long one, I wrote 3 or 4 one shots and I think 1 multi chapter. I feel like doing this helped the main long one I was working on--I integrated some of the things I'd come up with in the one shots into the larger story.

Right now I'm working on a multi chapter and I'm pretty much sticking with that one. I've jotted down a couple of scenes for some new ones, but nothing has grabbed me by the throat and demanded I write it. Do whatever you feel like. You're not under any kind of publishing deadline or obligation. You haven't spent any advance money and no publisher is breathing down your neck. :D

** This sounds like me. I pretty much keep trying story ideas until one sticks. I just follow the ideas. If it doesn't go anywhere, then sometimes I end back on one of the previous ones. It is what it is.

** I generally write new ideas as semi-coherent notes. I have a computer folder full of notes with ideas, that when printed is a few inches thick.

I just keep at the original, without doing more than summarizing the idea, and incorporate bits at each moment that look, good

** I have been dealing with this since I began writing THREE YEARS ago! I have been working on the same story for two years, but have done some drabbles and short stories here and there.

There is another story (really a trilogy) I've been wanting to write for about two years as well. I keep putting it off until I finish my current big one. However, it is very frustrating and I feel like it will never get written if I don't just start.

I have a few other, shorter stories that I would like to write as well, but have done how you have and hashed out the major plot points.

Advice: This is extremely frustrating. My advice is to let your imagination run wild! Make notes and partially write a hundred stories if you want. You may forget some important things and regret not taking detailed notes, so do NOT put it off. Work on whatever stories you want, but have the main story that gets most of your attention then you can move onto another. Or work on three major ones at a time. The more time you spend writing, the quicker you can get to another, but make sure to enjoy writing it. Just DO YOU. You feel like you need to work more on one? Work more on one. You want to write several? Write several.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!

** I feel I write best with 3-5 stories in progress at once. One is too confining and I get frustrated and stop entirely. 6+ gets hard to keep track of.

Ideally, once I've got several stories ongoing any other ideas I may have get a scene/description so I can come back later, but sometimes something grabs my attention and I end up writing way more. In general I try to keep the number of active fics low. I'm getting close to finishing my first major fic after two years, struggling to update my second after one year, and making reasonable progress on three other smaller ones in between.

Ultimately, as long as I'm writing something each day I consider it a win; whether that's on my main project or a side-scene that doesn't go anywhere.

** I have an ideas folder! :) I put every idea I get into it, and I write as much as I can into them and then I stop and save them and then they are in my ideas folder so I can go back to my other story! :)

** I'm writing about three or four stories right now, but it changes, it depends on my mood. Generally, I sort all my stories into their own folders: each story is separated into three docs. The first one is the actual story, the second one the story line, and the third one is a methodically written out explanation of every chapter, all the way to the end of the story. Then I keep to my plan. Usually works pretty well. Good luck!
