** It really sucks getting a bad review especially if it's not constructive. There'll be some people along shortly to tell you that you're over sensitive but you have my sympathy.

Just remember that the fact that you've made it 20 chapters in without something like this is really testament to your writing! There's also no accounting for taste - some people are looking for a particular type of story or character and you can't please them all.

** I think if you're going to leave a negative review that's not constructive in any way, then you're just an asshole. If it's constructive, that's different. I got a few constructive ones that I appreciate and have found helpful. I haven't gotten one like you described yet, and I'm sure if I did that would ruin my entire day, as you said... so I'm so sorry you have to deal with that! I would just try to ignore it, if you can. You put work into your story, and if it's something you can be proud of, does it matter what one asshole thinks?

** It'll happen. I've been in the HP fan fiction game off and on since 2005 and have over 30 stories under my belt. Last week I got a (guest) review telling me that all of my characterizations were OOC and unlikeable. That's one person's opinion, so don't let it bother you. As long as you are true and consistent to your vision of your characters, that's all you need.

When this happens again, and it will, channel you inner Dude and just shrug and say, ‚ÄúYeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.‚Äù

Not to be an asshole, but there are always gonna be people like that. There is nothing anyone can do about it.

You can only learn to ignore or brush off this kind of stuff and focus on the constructive ones.

******* Thank you. I really did leave a LOT of open ends in the first chapter (don't worry I have plans to explain everything and the choice of the title. Spoiler Grindelwald). I'll give your story a read once I finish my current one I'm reading. Glad you liked the end. I just checked again and I got one saying if I have to fill in plot holes in the au of the first chapter than it would suck. I'm pretty sure if the story is a comedy, then it isn't really meant to make sense with the timeline. For fucks sake I read a fic where Harry goes to an alter net universe and it's 50 years in the past and TMR is the boy who lived and dumbledore likes Slytherin and the golden trio have already graduated.

******** I've never really read any comedic FF and I found that to be very funny. Focus on good laughs (which I think would be incredibly hard to write so it's actually funny and not stupid) and I think you'll be fine if you balance humor and characters (70%) and plot (30%) I don't think it's the type of story that has to have full proof logic like some readers DEMAND.

** Once you post your story online, ou gotta prepare yourself for haters to come...it is the nature of internet, people do like to use the anonimity to "let it out", to expell their own negative energy.

‚Äã

I have written lots of stories, mostly obviously crack; the ones where I really put my ideas and feelings in it and tried to write to improve my skills, where the ones that had the biggest responses and yes, haters.

‚Äã

I have one experience where a hater had multiple accounts and would be always the first to comment on my chapters and keep on echoing his own vicious op over and over...readers alerted me this hater was quite weel known- he had written a failed fanfiction once- and for me not to bother.

‚Äã

But the thing that gets me really is the time and effort some people like this hater I mentioned put into it. I read many stories and I do click like button everytime just to reward the effort, but when something really gets my attention and i write a review, it is either to thank the author for the good times freely provided, or really to help improve some points. I have seen at least a couple of authors who were clearly teenagers trying to exercise their imagination quit writung altigether because of trolling...and it pisses me off.

‚Äã

This being said, there is a difference between a hater or a bad reviewer. Reading legitimate criticism is also hard, but you should always take something out of it because the person is taking time to write to you.

Haters? ignore. That is it: ignore. There is nothing you can do about it. If it really bothers you, like for instance what happened to me, just answer that if the story is that bad, please stop reading; you already let the world know you dont like it; you have been heard, now leave me alone and, if you continue to spread hate, I will delete your comment.
