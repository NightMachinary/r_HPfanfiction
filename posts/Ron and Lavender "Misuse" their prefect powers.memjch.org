:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic in which for some reason Hermione turns down being a prefect for some reason so Lavender Brown is prefect in her place. Ron and Lavender end up not doing what they are supposed to as prefects so Harry and Hermione end up taking over taking care of the firsties. Ron and lavender get caught "doing things" when they were supposed to be patrolling and so they get their badges revoked. I can't for the life of me remember the name of this fic.
