Admins, I'm not sure where else to post this, but even as I type, the white on black looks so blurry to me; it's hard to read. Are there plans perhaps to implement a theme selector as seen on sites like SIYE and others? I don't mean to suggest that the overall look isn't nice, because it is, but the text scheme, the bright white on black just hurts the eyes! Thanks.

*** Even without RES there's also a checkbox in your Reddit account preferences. This is side-wide. Personally I never missed custom subreddit designs, but I guess RES is better if you only want to get rid of it for certain subs.

**** Not seeing the themes on the other subs is worth it not to see this one.

** The other way is to get a user-css browser extension like /Stylish/ or /UserCSS/ and use the following stylesheet. It keeeps most of the layout, but reverses the colors. It's a quick hack, but servicable.

** I myself have experienced issues on mobile. The selector next to the snoo at the top(to switch between, hot/new/etc) breaks on mobile for me. I have to manually type in /new
