So pretty much, I love Neville! I wish there were more fics either about him or where he features heavily, so rec me your favourites!! Preferably completed fics, I don't mind if there are pairings or not, and any pairing het or slash is fine by me ðŸ˜Š


** So it's been a while since I've read this (stumbled across it in my favourites) but from what I can recall it was a great read, with us following Neville becoming more himself

  COMPLETE Neville's Gran breaks her hip just after his fifth year at Hogwarts, and he must spend the summer with Harry and Remus. They discover a hidden message in the candy wrappers his mother has been giving him, and begin to uncover the mystery.
