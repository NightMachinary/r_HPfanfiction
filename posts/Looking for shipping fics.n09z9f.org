  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

*** That was this one I think! linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26056906/chapters/63370063]]) great fic but beware! It's got porn in it. However it's a fucking great crime office drama with really excellent OCs and plotline

It's dramione, so really it's a shipping squared fic

  Hermione Granger has a career she loves, friends she can depend on, and a nice set of hand towels for her new flat.She's single and tired of tiresome men, but that doesn't stop her from wearing beautiful lingerie underneath her serious Ministry skirts.Or having pictures taken in naughty knickers.Just once.For herself.Draco Malfoy doesn't get upset at the sight of blood, which is good, because he sees a lot of it.What he doesn't see a lot of is Hermione Granger in her unmentionables.Usually.A series of meetings and mix-ups in which one cannot possibly mean done.
