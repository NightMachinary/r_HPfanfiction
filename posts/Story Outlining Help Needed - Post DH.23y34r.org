Playing with an idea for a post-DH (immediate, not next gen) story. Looking for input on what issues face the main trio or the wizarding world in general in the immediate aftermath of the battle. Things like:

- How do we handle the refugee crisis created by the Snatchers?
- What to do about Azkeban?
- How to liberate/reform the Ministry?
- What's the international political scene like? What about the Muggle government, is the Statute of Secrecy irreparably damaged?
- How do we handle the new werewolves turned by Greyback?
- What to do with the Malfoys?

Got any more ideas for me to play with?


** A lot of this is heavily dependent on who manages to grab the reins after the fall of Voldemort. The Ministry at this point is heavily infiltrated by Death Eaters and their sympathizers. If you want to seriously handle the problems facing magical society they need to be ousted.

Sure, with Voldemort gone it will be like the end of the first war all over again, they'll all renounce him and claim to have been under the Imperius or for lower level Ministry employees to have been just doing their jobs, but the Ministry will still be rotten to the core and resist reform. The only real solution I can see is revolution: clean house completely. Act while you have the upper hand and seize the Ministry before it can start claiming to be a legitimate authority. Require all current and potential Ministry employees to submit to veritaserum questioning to ensure they are not corrupt. Call an emergency election for a new Minister, candidates also subject to veritaserum questioning.

Ideally you'd also replace or supplement the Wizengamot with an elected body as well, though that may face resistance even from those who weren't Voldemort sympathizers. The important thing is to act quickly, because the longer you wait the harder it will be to make significant changes as people regain a sense of normality and order. Even the Order and other trustworthy people are probably going to want things to just go back to normal. It's going to require a strong personality and a lot of pushing from someone or someones to initiate this kind of thing.

I don't think I've ever read a fic dealing with the immediate aftermath of DH like this. It would be an interesting read.

*** Thanks for the good points about the MoM.

Incidentally if you are interested in a fic that looks at some of the post war political aftermath like this I have found a couple that come close, though often the plot ends up getting all involved in romantic relationships rather than the sociology/politics, hence my interest in thinking it out myself. The (now-inactive) short fic tumblr livesandliesofwizards has a few snippets of this which are [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1158978/chapters/2354224][collected here]]. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1158978/chapters/2354252][This one]] is a favorite of mine. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/Vera-Rozalsky][Vera Rozalsky]] is wonderful and thoughtfully engages with the idea of how difficult the postwar will be, for survivors of both sides (she also borrows liberally from AJ Hall in her version of Augusta Longbottom). The annoyingly unfinished [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127805][Shut and Be a Bud Again]] declines somewhat towards the end but has some interesting takes on other countries' wizarding communities as well as relations between the UK's Muggle govt and the MoM in the immediate postwar aftermath.

** - refugees can be either very minor: people just come back home, problem solved. It could be the extreme: post holocaust jews would come back, find that their home is held by another family, and if they try and claim it, the local government does nothing to help them, leaving them homeless and without support... while the ministry itself is in too much chaos to actually do anything. There is also the middle ground, where all the houses have been looted, damaged (some beyond repair), or destroyed.

- Azkaban is a problem: the Dementors are now not trustworthy and cannot guard it. How to make sure the more dangerous criminals, those who can do wandless legilimency and the such, don't escape? Especially now with Death Eaters all over the place, this is a real conundrum. Perhaps an enchantment to make all magic not work there, and hire muggle security forces (if someone talks about magic, they just drug the crap out of him, if not beat him a bit first... crazy criminals).

- The ministry is a huge problem. Death Eaters and loyalists are in every position. Kingsley will need to be swift and brutal with cutting out the worst of them, but you can't get rid of everyone or you'll lose too much talent to actually run things. Ideally, it would be the perfect time for a /major/ reform, because a post-war economy has a huge place for massive growth. As for the secrecy, it is just a matter of time before it cannot be held. 1998? Civilian satellite photography is coming in a /big/ way, the internet is growing big, and soon enough it will be out.

- Werewolves turned by Greyback and company will be a massive problem. I assume some of them will be slaughtered before there is anything to be done, but the main problem is that a lot of those will be children turned in the final battle. The fact that the werewolves other than Lupin sided with Voldemort will make their negative image even worse.

- Lucius isn't getting out of jail this time - he's ruined from a political point of view, and there are just too many of his allies on the losing side while his enemies won. Narcissa will probably not be imprisoned, but she'd be left with a tarnished name, with all her major backers gone. For the first time, she'd not have Lucius to be the man of the house or Snape to depend on. Draco will all of a sudden be on his own, supporting his parents who finally seem human... only to find them broken, and everyone else showing him the spite he showered on others back a hundredfold. The house of Malfoy will have to work /very/ hard to survive, and Draco, being a true Slytherin, will find a way to come out on top... by whatever means necessary.

More things:

- The Weasleys shock over Fred's death... and George specifically.

- Harry won... so now what? His entire life had a laser-focus on winning the final battle. Does he ask Dumbledore's portrait to be completely honest now, or does he just walk away? What about Ginny? How do they hide? Does he work on clearing Snape's name, or does someone else do that, if at all?

- Hogwarts is falling apart. What's the damage? Who will fix it?

- War orphans. For the side of the light, that's a sad problem, but what will happen to the Death Eater's children?

- Hogwarts staffing is now problematic, with an ancient potions master that can't wait to retire (and the only Slytherin on staff), no DADA professor, no muggle studies professor, no one for transfiguration, and next year will deal with returning 7th years, who didn't graduate as well. Don't even get me started on the problems of having a massive scale of PTSD in children all enclosed in a crumbling building. Oh, and the ghosts all around Hogwarts. A cackling Bellatrix doesn't seem like such a welcome idea around eleven year olds.

- Survivor's guilt. Harry had issues with it earlier, but this time it is on a massive scale. It would also fit Hermione's character. Ron, while coping with the loss of Fred, will have to learn to be the emotional rock to hold the trio together... even as he can barely cope with his own loss.

This can go on for ages, really.

**** Started reading it now... Considering I think Snape is one of the more interesting characters in fan fiction, I'll give it a chance (though Hermione/Snape is cringeworthy nine times out of ten).

****** Well, from what I read so far, it seems to be really well done... though it has a bit of "cheap" shock value at the start, but it seems to try and give a realistic take on some heavy issues of child abuse / PTSD without resorting to cliches. And the Hermione/Snape romance is one of the rare ones where it's starting to develop nicely (she is /not/ a student, cheating on Ron, nor is Ron an asshole, Snape particularly agreeable, etc)... It seems you weren't temporarily insane, this is actually rather good, and most romance fan fiction makes me cringe as you can practically hear the (metaphorical) 16 year old author squealing with joy writing about a love so great no one else can possibly get it.

Now, as to Hermione / Snape, that pairing theoretically has a lot going for it /if it is written well/, which it usually isn't. Then again, my aunt and uncle are what you would call an odd couple with a 17 year age gap between them (and they work sickeningly well together).

****** OK, after finishing the story, it is definitely a good one. Not the best HGSS story (even though the vast majority of those are worse), but definitely up there and makes up for it with a lot of provocative situations.
