Trying to recover a specific fic that I was reading (probably a recent rec on this sub)

Harry and Ginny have two kids but their marriage is on the rocks. After they are separated, Harry realises he has feelings for Snape and makes a pass at him, with the encouragement of Hermione. It's a longish one-shot.

Help a girl out, I /never/ read slash but was liking this one.
