I've read a lot of harry potter fanfictions that result in him snapping and becoming a badass or independent. But i want to know if there are any with him being a badass in the goblet of fire(i think thats the name..). Like for example, harry fights the dragon and he knocks the dragon out but some of the crowd is still booing and that angers him(dumbledore agrees with the crowd because of greater good bullshit) so he enervates the dragon and brutally beats it again out of spite. And picture this. He gives of a powerful blast of magic and blows the dragon into the air breaking the chains and it lands with a thud... The ring and silent but harry is still angry... He whips around and glares at dumbledork and the crowd and screams, "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!"...

The scenario would be awesome to say the least. So if you can point me in the right direction it'd be greatüòÅüòÅüòÅ
