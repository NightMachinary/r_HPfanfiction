I've been watching a lot of Day in the Life videos and documentaries and I was thinking about how interesting it would be if the people making the videos were wizards. Forget defeating Voldemort, I want to know what cursebreakers do in their jobs, how wandmakers make wands, what Charlie Weasley does in the dragon sanctuary, how broommakers make brooms, how Healers deal with the various quirky injuries that wizards get themselves into, how alchemists are the backbone of the wizarding chemical industry, how aurors hunt Dark Wizards, what unspeakables do, etc etc. Basically I want fics that focus on the worldbuilding aspects of the Wizarding World and deals with the mundane aspects of day to day wizarding life.

Honestly, if there aren't any fics like this, I'm thinking of creating a fic that's a series of one shots exploring the lives of various different wizards/witches working various jobs.


** That's exactly what I like on “Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray by Katinka31” linkffn(714431) ... normal life of a seamstress at Hogsmeade.
