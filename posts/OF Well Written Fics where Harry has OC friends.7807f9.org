Looking for fics where Harry has some OC friends along with the rest of the gang (Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Luna etc). I would specifically be interested in fics where his OC friends are not in on everything going on during the year (mostly due to my bias since they aren't Canon). Sorry for the weird wording.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
