I read this well over a year ago, can't seem to find it anymore. If I'm not mixing my fics up, it included the following:

Neglected Luna. Xeno went mad after his wife died and sort of forgot he has a daughter, he just doesn't care for her. Harry finds out and rescues her (I think this happens near the start of the story).

Later on, there's this family (I think magical, could be muggle + magical, they at least have a magical child) who are getting threatened by some bad guys. Harry does Strong!Harry things and saves them from said bad guys. I can't remember many specifics here, but this family proceeds to adopt Luna.

Some part of the plot revolves around some sources of power (crystals maybe?) which are scattered around the world. There's this group of people who are tasked with making sure one of these doesn't blow Britain up. I think.

That's pretty much all I have, hope it's enough for someone to recognize it.
