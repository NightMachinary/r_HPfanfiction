So, I want a fic where Harry is mad about about dragons, like Hagrid level mad, and decides to open a dragon preserve as a business. After all, all these dragon hide boots and gloves and jackets need to come from somewhere. So, Harry accquires some dragon eggs, could be by buying them or "liberating" them from smuggler rings. Please no Slash fics.
