I've been out of the hpff game for a while and just listened to some music I used to listen to back when I read fanfiction and it hit me with some nostalgia.

I've read nearly all of the L/J fics that were popular a few years ago: Life and Times, the one where they work in a theatre, the angsty one (lol), etc.

Any good ones that I may have missed or that came out recently?

Thanks!


** I liked linkffn(The Age of Inertia by sevenperseids)

Unfortunately it's not new, so you may have seen it. Also incomplete, no updates for a year.

**** One of the better characterizations of Lily out there, for sure! Do you know of any others that portray her this well?

*** Here is the theatre one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3263560/1/The-Curtain-Call]]

It's one of my faves.

The angsty thing was me just joking around, since a large amount of ff is angst.

** I adore [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amaranthine]]. It's one of the few L/J stories I like, set during their time of hiding. (the site's veeeery slow at the moment, so you may have to wait a bit before it loads, or save it for another day.)
