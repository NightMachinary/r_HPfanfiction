So the other day I was looking for fics with Lavender Brown when I came across "Nothing scares me anymore". It is definitely not the /Best Story Ever/^{^{TM,}} but it is something I enjoyed reading nonetheless. Compared to the Death Eater ships and glorification, Happy Weasley Family canon rehashes, bashing fics and stories where the love interest is just arm candy, "Nothing scares me anymore" is a refreshing breath of fresh air. It has a child character without turning her into a small adult or annoying brat who does nothing but pranks. It also doesn't suffer from wasting 100k words before we even get to the First Year.

Strengths:

- Unique, interesting AU (although not really Harry Potter anymore, just utilising some characters)

- Fluffy and Sweet

- Young Lavender is cute

- In media res without a wall of text for the exposition

Weaknesses:

- A lot of AN clutter surrounding the fic

- Relatively short (1735 words without the ANs)

- Written in present tense

- Too many line breaks

Overall a short, sweet fic that is something new in between the 648864 repetitions of pairing Harry or Hermione with Snape, Malfoy or Voldemort.

  Tonks is the monster under Lavender's bed. Except this monster is just here to help.

** What do you mean Tonks is a monster? As in, she's a nonhuman? Maybe a Boggart?

*** /SPOILERS/

It is never explained what kind of monster she is, but certainly recognisable as non-human and she is fighting with a dark spirit.
