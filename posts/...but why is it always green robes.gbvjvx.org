So... any time Harry gets new robes for any reason, it's always green or dark green or almost black with a green sheen or emerald, etc.

Just... why. XD I know, Harry has green eyes and they are exceptionally green. That's fantastic, Harry! You've got something good going for you, Harry!

Green in good shade will make eyes pop out, yes, but there are other colours out there, but it's always green.

I don't blame even one author because to be completely honest - if I were to write anything, I'd probably give Harry robes /with some amount of green/ in them too.

But, I don't know about you, unless I stand quite close to someone the only thing I'm able to say about someone's eyes is that /they're there/. Maybe if they're light or dark.

So let's go all out, let's give Harry robes in black, deep wine-red, navy blue! His eyes will still be there and still be green! :D
