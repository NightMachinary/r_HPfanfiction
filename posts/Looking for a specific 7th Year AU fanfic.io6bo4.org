:END:
It was a 7th year AU with snape alive and mcgonagall as headmistress. I vividly remember a scene where snape is teaching DADA and starts pairing people together. He picks hermione to pair with draco and ron gets really mad about it then harry volunteers in his place. Harry and draco duel but its pretty normal and I think theres a mention of harry seeming ovviously stronger or something.

Then theres another scene where snape talks with harry and hermione comes up then harry admits shes still having nightmares. Snape tries to recommend help and says he will have to inform minerva but harry shuts down and says he regrets telling him anything.

The last scene I remember is snape talking to mcgonagall and I think it comes up in their conversation and they talk about harry staying with hermione and ron all the time. They go into everyone being worried about them and mcgonagall wasnt even sure if they would come back to finish.

If anyone recognozes some of this or knows a similar fic ill be eternally grateful
