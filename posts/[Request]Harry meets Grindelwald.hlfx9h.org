  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this..

  Gilderoy Lockhart landed himself in St Mungo's after his 'Cornish Pixies' class. Where can a headmaster now find another Defence teacher, one who's knowledgeable beyond doubt, willing to face the curse on the position, and available to start in a few days? In Nurmengard, that's where.

#+begin_quote
  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

I arranged with the warden to let me take a kid for a holiday visit to my ex-boyfriend, who also happens to be magical Hittler."

******** Not because they are both magical and both "evil" means they have the same mindset.

Grindelwald was all about the ideals. Prove the superiority of wizardkind over muggles, no mention, at least in paper, to muggleborns. Charismatic, recruited people convincing them that he had the solution for them based on their past experiences. A "teacher" of sorts.

Voldemort supported the pureblood superiority (muggleborns taken as muggles) mostly in name. He was colder and more logical than Grindelwald. His true purpose was power and immortality and how he could use others to achieve it. He recruited other people by making them realize that he was more powerful and that they could suffer if they disobeyed him.

****** The thing is... You would have to go some way into OOC with Harry. The dude has serious vias against anything that's slytherin or he perceives as not morally righteous. Hence him always doubting Durmstrang/Slytherin/Snape/Malfoy/Mundungus' shadiness/Kreacher/Anything inside the Black house/... and he doesn't get over this until after book 7, once he has a change of heart on Kreacher, hears of Regulus and learns of Dumbledore's gey side.

He wouldn't want to talk to Grindelwald unless something really important depended on it .... something tangible and in short term... and even if he talked, frrom that to believe him or take his advice...

You would have to go intense AU in plot, timeline, characters or some of them combined.

******* When people call Harry too morally righteous to do something I have to remind myself fan fiction has made him nicer and more upstanding than he was in the books.

It's Ron who makes disparaging remarks about Durmstrang. I can't remember Harry having an opinion and he's pretty cordial with if not outright fond of Krum.

His issue with Mundungus is his stealing from Grimmauld Place and his issue with Grimmauld Place is that Sirius hated it there. In fact, it was he who suggested they hide there in DH. I think you're forgetting Kreacher helped set him and Sirius up to die he has every reason to distrust Snape and Malfoy.

But also you're talking about a person who took advice from two separate DEs and lied throughout the series to get in or out of something.

******** Dumbledore could just want to destroy the Scarcrux without killing Harry. He has researched everything he could, but hasn't found anything. In desperation, he goes to the only person who is as much if not more knowledgeable than he, and who has undoubtedly dabbled in more dark arts than he. Grindelwald could easily say he wants to see the boy and the scar first before he tells Dumbledore anything if he knows how to remove it or not.

You could also write a story where Grindelwald is trying to reform.
