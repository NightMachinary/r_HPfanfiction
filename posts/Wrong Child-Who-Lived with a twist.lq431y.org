*Summary:*

On that terrible Halloween in 1981 the Potters lived but they lost a child. Little Rose was declared the Girl-Who-Lived while Harry... became something else. Now eleven-years-old Rosie has to attend Hogwarts and face her "adoring fans" and "epic adventures". Not to mention the ghost of her brother who's far too mischievous and just /a little/ overprotective. Just a bit.

‚Äã

*Details:*

Basically, a neglect fic without the neglect. The Potters, Dumbledore, /everyone/ legitimately believes that Harry is dead. Initially, the only person who can interact with him is his sibling, but that just gets written off as an imaginary friend or the expression of childhood trauma. With time, Harry grows stronger until he can be an active participant in events. E.g. he can only cause minor mischief at most in '91 but can become fully corporeal by the end of the Triwizard Tournament (don't necessarily stick to this timeline).

The idea is for him to parallel Voldemort from '81 until the end of the war. You know how Voldemort says /"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive"/? Well... so was Harry. Voldemort hitches a ride into Hogwarts? So does Harry. And so on.

This takes "He shall mark him as his equal" to a pretty extreme level and fulfills the requirements of the prophecy. With everyone in the know /assuming/ it applies to the living sibling while Harry is the one destined to take him down.

The character arc of the sibling is trying to grow into their own person in spite of everyone's expectations while trying to deal with all the shit being a "chosen one" entails (kind of if canon Harry had more agency, now that I think about it).

The arc of "Harry" is to recover his humanity while helping his sibling through any means available and having some fun along the way. And killing Voldemort, I guess. "Neither can live while the other survives" and all that.

The relationship between the Potter siblings is that of best friends and some kind of familiar bond (with Harry being some kind of phantasmal being, I guess). Both of the siblings are the Main Character (pretty sure there's a term for this but it escapes me at the moment).

‚Äã

*WTF is this:*

It's late o'clock over here but I had a brainwave and decided to share it before I came to my senses. I like a good dark horse story and neglect fics are basically that with a whole lot of bashing added to the mix. So, I took out the parts that make it questionable so that we can still have drama and an explanation for Harry's initial obscurity, without the people involved being dangerously idiotic, if not just plain terrible.

*** Exposing my otaku side, this prompt reminded me of several anime, ranging from silly to serious (üòÖ).

1. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure - silly idea of Harry becoming Rose's "stand" (fighting partner)

2. Shaman King - it's a bit like Jojo but in the former, stands can't talk whereas here, the shamans can talk to their ghost partners

3. AnoHana - this isn't like the earlier ones. This is about a boy who starts seeing the ghost of his childhood friend because she had some unfinished business. It's quite the tearjerker.

This prompt also reminded me of the movie Casper, the Friendly Ghost starring Christina Ricci because of the "getting a corporeal body back" part.

**** Stand!Harry sounds hilarious but I don't think he's manly enough to pull it off, lol. Shaman King sounds like a good framework though! Casper less so. My idea wasn't that he'd get a human body but that he'd be able to generate a corporeal (humanoid/human) form. Think of it as a creature fic.

** One of the more hilarious ideas on this is as ghost harry becomes closer and closer to being human he also begins to experience things like hormones and puberty. The first time he entered the girls showers was out of curiosity but after that harry seemed to mysteriously disappear every morning and his support for the gryffindor quidditch team seem to soar. Or when Hermione finally finds out after his careless statement to her during the triwizard ball that the birthmark on her chest is cute and that she should not cover it up with makeup, Hermione chases him around threatening to make him wish he were still dead. The canon harry was too meek imo to be a perv but a ghost harry who grew up with a girl twin, with girl friends, and finally discovering hormones leaves a lot of comic potential. Hermione becoming the greatest expert on ghost/necromantic magic in her attempt to stop harry would be bonus

*** Yo! So, here I am with the follow up.

Harry being a ghostly being offers some pretty unique opportunities but also constraints on the character and "resolving" that plot thread so early would mean you won't get to explore them. Not unless you feel like cramming 4-5 years of personal development into 9 months or so.

Harry's sibling starts to get a larger social circle and spend time with friends? Harry gets jealous because he starts feeling lonely and left out. Teens start noticing the opposite (same?) sex? Not an option for Harry. Malfoy/Lockhart experiences a long streak of inexplicable unfortunate events? Good luck proving a ghost did it.

In the prompt scenario Harry's been ghostly since he was one, so that's all he's known. Keeping him incorporeal and unnoticed for a significant period of time gives an opportunity to show the character what he's missing and develop him. That's what I think, anyway.

Anyway! Philosopher's Stone shenanigans definitely sounds like a possible avenue of corporealizing Harry.

**** This could fall into the realm of he takes the Stone and hides it. He KNOWS it can be used to return to living, but he trusts no one (except his sis) enough to ask for help because they might simply TAKE the stone. So, even though he has it, he can't use it. Plus, maybe he could make a deal with Flamel -- he gives them the Stone, and they promise to come up with a solution for him. It will, of course, take time, so he has to be patient. They will have only one shot at this. In the meantime, they pretend the Stone is destroyed so they can switch to new identities and live out in the open for some decades.

***** That could absolutely work!

He wouldn't even need to keep it a secret from his sister! At the time this happens they'd be what, eleven years old? Twelve at the most? And the stone, even if powerful, is still a rare and (seemingly) obscure artifact, so we can assume using it takes some specific knowledge, if not a certain level of skill. And it's not like the thing comes with an instruction manual.

So the way I imagine it is: they have their adventure and stash the stone somewhere safe because *a)* they've lost a lot of trust in the Hogwarts faculty after their blunder with the stone and *b)* kids are much more likely to seek forgiveness than permission from their parents (so they don't tell the Potters either)

In the end they sit on the stone until they figure out how to use it and Harry decides he wants a corporeal form.

P.S. I approve of the "deal with Flamel" angle but he'd need to hold off on that at least until he can interact with other people freely.
