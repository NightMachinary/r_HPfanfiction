It seems so odd that this person (I'm not even sure if they're male or female) wrote such an massively long story so quickly and consistently and then once they finished just seems to have disappeared.

  Sometime in 2010, she completely disappeared from the Internet. It was mentioned early in 2013 on her Facebook Fan page, that she is doing well. It was reported that while she does appreciate her fans and their support over the years, she has put her online literary life behind her.

That is a common story for many of the early-mid 2000s "greats". Most have slowly but surely disappeared. Which is understandable. Many were in their 20s, so life was just starting and over time family, work, whatever steered them away from writing fanfiction.

As a sidenote: I did read some of her original works back then and remember to have liked them. So if you enjoy her style, give them a try. You can find them on the linked site too. But disclaimer: it has been 14 years and I liked a lot of stuff back then that I don't enjoy today.
