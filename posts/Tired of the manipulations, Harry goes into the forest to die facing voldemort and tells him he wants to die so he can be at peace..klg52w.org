** It was too much. Even if Dumbledore really had cared for him (and that was a big if). Even if they couldn't win the war without him (after all they couldn't win with him either seeing as he kept Voldemort immortal). Even if the sight of his body would kill his best friends inside (and he knew it would). It was just too much. He couldn't handle it anymore. The stress of being on the run. The constant carrot on the pole ahead of him with the answers seeming only just out our reach. Knowing he was putting everyone else in danger by letting the war run longer. Never knowing who was safe and who would die or get injured next. Fred's death and Percy's grief just moments after they finally reconciled, not to mention Ron and George's. Ginny and the fear that she would be the next victim of loyalty to him. Hermione... well Hermione was honestly mostly there for him seeing as Ron at least had his family for support. If she saw it was a lost cause she could go back to her parents and restore their memories and have a happy and fulfilling life with them- far more than he could ever offer her in this hellscape. All those who died for him that never got to really know. His father. His mother. Sirius. Even Dumbledore's death had hurt even if his motivations had to be viewed with suspicion in retrospect. All came crashing down on him, unrelenting, unyielding, never waning or ceasing. And Harry. Just. Could. Not. Take it. Anymore.

What Harry wanted, more than anything, was peace. He had never experienced peace before. Not really anyway. Growing up at the Dursley's there had always been the either hunger or fear for the future when he was unable to assauge his growling stomach because of some strange happening beyond his control. In later years he had learned that whatever else came, he could be assured that he would be thrust into /some/ absurd, impossible situation that would tax even an adult both emotionally and magically/physically. Of course he had his friends but even they had had their fair share of fights and harry just didn't have it in him anymore. He wanted peace. He wanted to relax. In short, he wanted, out.

So now Harry set out to face Voldemort. Not for any noble reason. Not because of his saving-people-thing. Because he was done. He couldn't end it but at long last, he /could/ not be in the middle of it. Not even be a part of it. He could see Sirius and his parents again. That was why Cedric had been the school champion. As Dumbledore had pointed out, Cedric had chosen what was right over what was easy. The truth was though, to do that again and again took a certain level of dedication that Harry just no longer had in him. Too often had he chosen what was right. And it was exhausting. For once, he would choose what was easy because he simply did not have the emotional fortitude to choose what was right /again/.

Lost in these thoughts he wandered down the path of the forbidden forest. He didn't want to be heard until he was ready. He didn't want to have to deal with torture and questioning should he be captured. At the end of the hour he would reveal himself and die and that would be that. So he followed the death eaters standing guard. He trod relatively noiselessly behind them as they went back to Voldemort. And when the hour was up, just as Voldemort began ordering the next attack, he revealed himself. And he died
