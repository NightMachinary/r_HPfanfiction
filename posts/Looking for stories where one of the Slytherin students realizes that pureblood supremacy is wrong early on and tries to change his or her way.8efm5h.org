I was wondering if there was any story where one of the Death Eater children realizes that the pureblood ideology is bullshit (Hermione is beating all purebloods in academics, Lily Potter blew the Dark Lord out of his body, stuff like that). I'm not asking for an overnight 180 about everything, but for example Draco or Pansy realizing by year two that their parents are wrong and slowly try to change their way of thinking.

Please no m/m, good Snape or Ron/Hermione


** I was going through my favorites and was surprised that I don't really have a story that applies. This seems to be sorely missing in the fandom?! Seems like such an obvious plot point.

Maybe Wind Shear applies:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]])

Bellatrix barely matters in that fic and is for the most part just getting wet over Harry being super powerful, but she realizes that blood-purity is dogshit and has a small amount of character development later on. Really minor part of the fic though.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** You would definitely enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12311860/1/Old-Scars-and-Future-Hearts][Old Scars and Future Hearts]] by AnotherGirlWithAStory since it fit all of your criteria's. This is a what-if story where Draco finds Sirius' diary and he starts to question pureblood life. Everything is cannon until the beginning of the summer before their 3rd Year.

I absolutely love the story. No slashes or romances, just pure chance of Draco and Harry becoming friends. (I have nothing against slashes or romances, I just wanted something that shows character growth.)

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.

**** linkao3(The Only Way to Wake Up by Jemina)

The fic I'm writing now has something to do that with. It was pure smut that had to do with an alternate Harry Potter AU where Pansy had Hermione as her personal maid. I've expanded the story beyond that, though, as Pansy's deepening affection for Hermione caused her to realize that mudbloods were no different than anyone else, to the point where she wants to help Hermione undermine the pureblood hierarchy that Voldemort created when he wasn't defeated by baby Harry.

  In a world where The Dark Lord was never defeated by Harry as a baby, he ushered in a society where purebloods are on top and mudbloods are at the very bottom. Pansy could have any mudblood servant she wants, but as far as she's concerned, Hermione is just perfect. Smut!

** linkffn(9704180) I don't quite remember if Draco realizes pureblood supremacy is bullshit or if he just doesn't support Voldemort for self preservation reasons. It's just a minor part of the story though, since I would classify this as more of travel to alternate universe story, so I don't know if it qualifies for what you are looking for. It's a good fic regardless, would recommend if you haven't read it already.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Unfortunately, I don't have the time to write a short snippet here, but I've been sitting on the notion for a whole that purebloods are like dukes and kings; born into a position of prestige, they have a responsibility for all of the others in their domain.

So, that means not being discriminatory towards muggleborns and magical creatures, it means being their leader. Acting as a good role model, teaching them about the magical world and its culture, acting to try and solve their problems and reduce disputes. Maybe one day if the job's done well enough, one of these muggleborns or their children will rise to become leaders of the magical world in their own right.
