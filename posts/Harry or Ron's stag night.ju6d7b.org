Any fics where its Harry or Ron's stag night and they get up to a bunch of stupid stuff. Something lighthearted preferably


** Not the most important part of the story, but “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124) has one very traumatic stag night for Harry (who wanted to be with somebody else).

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** I don't think I have ever come across a fic concerning Harry or Ron's stag night. However, Jeconais did write a fic about the stag night for Bill and had Harry as the Best man called Best Man.
