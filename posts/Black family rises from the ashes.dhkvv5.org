This is, of course, just one possible scenario;

After Sirius dies at the Department of Mysteries fight Harry is summoned to Gringotts where he learns that he is the new Lord Black. Typical trope of him being Sirius' heir which is made even more possible since his paternal grandmother was a Black so it's in his blood with no real need for a blood adoption.

But once he comes into his inheritance he starts looking into the Potter and Black families and he finds that while is definitely the last Potter he isn't technically the last Black. Of course there's Narcissa, Bellatrix, and Draco but he finds out there's a lot of disowned uncles, aunts, and cousins that can be brought back into the family including, but not limited to, Andromeda Tonks nee Black and her family as well as Cedrella Weasley nee Black and her family.

Having learned of the prophecy and feeling kind of disillusioned with the 'great and powerful' Dumbledore he decides to rebuild and clean up the Black family inviting living descendants from all over to take the oath and be brought back into the fold as it were dissolving marriages with Death Eaters, casting out Death Eaters who refuse to renounce Voldemort, etc.

His efforts bring the Black Family back and they become an army unto themselves with Harry as the Head of the Family.

A similar situation happens in "Season of Change" linkffn(9928419) except Harry wakes up, after falling asleep in the Dursley's house, as a girl named Ayla Black, the daughter of Sirius Black and Lily Evans. She becomes the head of the Black Family and starts fixing things bringing all kinds of cousins back into the family. Apparently she can't be the head of House Potter because the Potters are patriarchal or something like that.

â€‹

Basically a fic where Harry, or preferably someone who isn't on Voldemort's side, becomes head of the Black family and does some house cleaning and restructuring instead of just going "I'm Lord Black! I have the monies and the votes... and there's a betrothal contract with some girl i've never talked to i'm sure we'll fall in love!"


** I just hope that Marius Black, disowned for being a Squib, had a long and happy life away from all that wizard nonsense.

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes
