******* Bored. Reading the top posts on the sub.

Also that fic does the same thing your Not From Others did for DADH --- becomes a definitive version of the genre, while averting and subverting stupid tropes. For example, Lily and James have an actually compelling reason to send Harry to Dursleys, they are not evil, even if Harry sees them like this at first. Dursleys are also not evil just because, they treat Harry like shit for a reason and it becomes a plot point later on. Etc., etc., etc...

Overall, everyone is at the very least competent, everything has a good reason, and thus story plays off on a completely different level. Writer is really good at plotting and foreshadowing too... though at least one chapter name is spoilerific as fuck. It's like MoR, only without weird philosophy and with writer that actually knows his shit. I especially love how the background characters like Marcus Flint get fleshed out.

Finally, while PoS is rather vanilla, TSE (second book) has really great villains. Pettigrew is slick and terrifying, Narcissa is beautiful and unhinged, and Voldemort is... well, that backstory you'll have to read for yourself. I'll just say that transformation Tom>Voldemort is beautifully set up, and "the power he knows not" plays a very important part at that.

On the downside --- "kids don't talk and think like that". Handwaved and in Harry's case turned into a plot point, but still, can be a bit jarring. But otherwise, Harry and Co. wouldn't stand a chance in this world, because pretty much every adversary took a level in badass and it shows - in the first book, Jim Potter tries to stop Quirrel the canon way and gets his ass handed to him.

Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

Then do the same thing with paragraphs. So I luckily never notice the poor spelling or grammar.

I learnt how to speed-read in a very similar way when I was in elementary school. Sort of like read a few words and generate the idea/feel for what the author is trying to say based off of that, right?

It really helps when I don't need to read for a high level of recall.

Unfortunately, I'm trying to wean myself off of this, especially for fanfiction. Not only do I end up running through fics /too/ quickly (meaning I have less time to enjoy them), I lose out on the enjoyment and visceral realism that comes from the minute details.

It's still difficult to /not/ speed-read when I'm reading an action scene, though.

The downside for me is exactly the fact that it's /too fast/. I often wish I could Obliviate myself of most of the fic and read it again.

I'm trying to stop and smell the roses, I guess.

Edit: But with action scenes, I still let my imagination fill in the details. I'll even put a fic down for a bit to imagine the action going on. It's almost always better than what is written, anyways!

***** Huh. I don't read like this, and I've never wanted to read like this. Speed-reading has always seemed to me mostly a tool for absorbing information, something I can imagine would be useful for tedious kinds of nonfiction, textbooks, or test prep guides, although obviously it runs the risk of missing crucial details.

But reading for pleasure? I want /all/ the words. The words /are/ the pleasure: the writer's voice and style, the rhythm or music of a sentence, their talent for coining the perfect phrase at the right moment. I don't read only (or even mostly) for plot. Plot is structural: beams and girders. I can admire the engineering, but I'm not going to wander around inside it. Okay, I'm exaggeratiing. Sometimes, sure, I get pulled into a fic whose sole recommendation is plot. But I'm much more interested in the finished house: the number of rooms, the interior decorating, the color scheme, the relative (dis)comfort, the view out the windows and the degree (or lack) of light. All the words the writer puts on the page/screen build that house. Otherwise we might as well let computers generate the stories we read.

Unless I'm completely misunderstanding what you mean by skilled readers and word for word?

I guess the point of pleasure reading for me is indulgence. It's not a contest to see how fast I can whip through a story using the shortest attention span and smallest quantity of information. Because part of the reason I love reading fiction is the immersion aspect of it - and the fact that it's not my own voice.

On a different note, America. No offense to American posters, but I have NEVER read a fanfic where inserting our friends across the ocean works out well. I don't care if it's Harry transferring to a school there, or the characters going on holiday there, or the dreaded foreign exchange student/visiting person of influence. Part of the charm of HP is its quirky Britishness! This gets lost if you send the main character to live in Los Angeles. (It's too sunny for a start, bah hambug).

Similarly, any time Harry is referred to as Lord Black... please go away, Lord Black (and take your many other and increasingly ridiculous titles with you. I don't care that you are the direct descendent of every famous wizard ever, and the heir to all their fortunes). Just go away. Far far away.

Was that them writing about characters not having a conscious, or did they give readers “unconscience characters”?

That being said, I know of one story where Harry has a few titles that actually is enjoyable. It's a story mocking this, though (the titles do nothing, but the goblin says he heard they help in getting female company), so that's that.

** Punctuation errors. Grammatical errors. Spelling errors. Syntax errors. Those are the early warning signs. Also, poor pacing and inability to keep track of tenses.

OOC behavior without in-fic events that would plausibly result in that behavioral change. I really, really /really/ doubt that Snape would become a kind, cheerful person, Harry turn into a drunkard playboy or Hermione a hateful shrew without a *lot* of external forces. If those external forces are plausibly presented and written, then I can get behind it. Problem is, 90% of the time they aren't plausible.

Sudden power boosts without a good lore-friendly explanation. Again, for me it's how well you can present it and how well it's written. If Harry had to train for months on end to gain this power boost and it's presented in a way that makes it plausible, then I can buy it. Suddenly being able to cast spells like Dumbledore after reading one book or "learning his true heritage"? No. Just no.

Characters becoming attracted to each other for no apparent reason. Do you really think after six years of hatred and harrasment that Hermoine is going to suddenly find Draco attractive, or the other way around? No. Now, if say they were forced into a dangerous situation together for an extended period of time, made to depend on one another for survival and in the course of that situation learned more about each other personally? Yeah, I'd say they might start feeling a little hot under the collar after a while.

It's all in how well you can write it and present it. If the situations and external events driving the internal narratives and changes are plausible, then I'm willing to go along with just about anything, even Snarry, mpreg, Lord Potter, whatever. You name it. Just do it in a way that makes sense.

This is a large problem with one of the main pairings I read, which involves Tom Riddle and Hermione, and to a lesser extent, whenever Hermione is written romantically with either Severus Snape or Draco Malfoy, or any Death Eater-related characters in general. In the aforementioned scenarios with Hermione and Tom Riddle, there are quite a few fanfictions where the author seems to glorify, or romanticize, abuse, manipulation, control, and a host of other issues...namely, Riddle abusing Hermione in their relationship, usually not once but /several/ times, and she always forgives him for it. In at least one fanfiction, Riddle actually /tortures/ Hermione, and in some cases like this, Hermione not only forgives Riddle, but encourages such behavior.

*** Why is it bad if they tell whose PoV it's from? I'd rather that then have to question myself who's view I am even reading from.

**** Because any competent author would make that perfectly clear through context. The only exception is if you're doing a story with a billion different charaters like A Song of Ice and Fire and even then, you should just state it in the chapter name.

Switching PoV in the middle of the story ruins immersion.

** Off the top of my head: * Magical Trunks * Magical Cores * Custom made wands * Bashing * Severitus * Unexplained OOC * Anime-isms (sweat droops and the like) * Misspellings or obvious grammar issues in the summary * "Don't like don't read" * "I'm not good at summaries" * "More in depth summary inside" * ANs in the middle of a chapter * Having a different fucking font for foreign languages, including but not limited to French, Goblin, Parseltongue and Telepathy (Legillimency) * Slash, esp. Mpreg * OC centric esp. Foreign exchange student moves to Hogwarts * Independent/Dark/Light/Grey * Inheritance tests\\
* Long ass ANs replying to reviews or thanking each and every reviewer by name. This ain't an Oscars' speech. Chill. * Royalty/Lordship * Chapter/Word Ratio where there is less than 2000 words per chapter (One shots are an exception) * Harry/Multi. * Rationality.

** Bashing, crossovers, and any form of overtly ignoring, denying, changing, or manipulating the canon world to suit the authors wishes.

I guess I only really like single points of departure. There's nothing wrong with canon, why ruin it?

** Here's one I don't see yet: Anytime there are sorting hat shenanigans where the hat doesn't sort Harry into *one* of the houses. Whether the hat can't sort Harry at all or it chooses some stupid combination of multiple houses, it always ends up being a horrible story.

** Slash,

bash,

a Harry who's overly brash.

"Woe is me, my life is ash..."

Gnash,

gash.

No Harry with too much cash,

or a cache

with a stash

of hash.

And please, dear God, no "yet another canon rehash."

** Title uses some variant of "darkness within" or uses the words "shades" or "power"

Summary that uses pairing names (Harmony, Hellatrix, etc), indicates bashing, indicates harems, uses tags like "dark-but-not-evil!Harry, grey!Harry, indicates dumb animagus forms or bad politics, and various forms of bonds. Oh, and the always amusing "Story is better than the summary."

Excessive author notes at the beginning and end of the every chapter. Disclaimers where the author tries to be funny.

Use of "Ice Queen" or "Hadrian".
