I'm always interested in characters bonding over something they had in common, and I've always found it a little odd that there seems to be so little fan fiction involving Luna Lovegood and Hagrid interacting over their love of animals.

Granted, in canon, one of the only times Luna speaks about Hagrid directly is when she's rather disdainful of his teaching capabilities.

That said, Hagrid and Luna bonding over their connection to animals, perhaps Thestrals, is still an idea I like quite a bit.

Has anyone ever come across a story like this? Even as a subplot? I'd rather not read shipping.


** "A Different Sort" by lightofhislife and "Hope" by FancifulRivers are both really sweet. In canon, Luna didn't have a very high opinion of Hagrid as a teacher, but I like the idea that she sympathized with the fact that he cared for animals - and I want to believe that she came back to Hogwarts eventually after her kids were grown and became the new CoMC teacher.

To be fair, neither did Harry nor Hermione nor anyone with half a brain really.

Hagrid has a lot of qualities, but his teaching abilities are far from top notch.

To come back to the subject, an amusing idea I had would be a crossover with the Witcher where Luna and Hagrid are sent to the Witcherverse and shock the hell out of Geralt with behaviour around all kinds of monsters.\\
I think it could be an amazing one-shot.\\
I lack the skill to right something like that sadly...

**** Just because you're a zoologist doesn't mean you're suited for teaching zoology. To be fair, Luna might not be the best CoMC teacher, either: I imagine her being the type of professor who can't remember all her students' names (although she's named every animal she's ever brought to class) and frequently interrupts her own lectures to go off on tangents about her travels or about the latest creature sightings in /The Quibbler/.

Although dammit, I'd still want to take her class.

***** I don't think she would forget her students' names, but that's maybe a different interpretetion of the character, I don't think she's nearly as distracted as she lets on (her performance in the DoM isn't that of someone who's forgetfull or has attention problems. I agree with you assessment though, I'd want to take this class too. Just the digressions would make it worth it.

While that's true, Harry seems to be a bit more forgiving of Hagrid's abilities than Hermione.

The narration, while somewhat omniscient is still largely sympathetic to Harry's point of view, indicates this as such when it describes the lessons immediately following the Hippogriff incident. Hagrid is described as losing his nerve.

The lessons with Grubbly-Plank are also worth noting. Harry, preoccupied with where Hagrid is, is throughly annoyed by how good the lesson is. Hermione, by contrast, says she liked "having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once."

As for Luna, she outright says that "We think of him as a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw," which just sounds...off, coming from her. While I can certainly accept that Luna wouldn't be the least bit shy in criticizing a professor, at the same time, I find it peculiar that she didn't at least say she respected his love for all things furry or scaly.

Then again, Luna's first lessons with Hagrid were the Blast-Ended Skrewts. That might have had something to do with it.

***** maybe it sounds off cause you read too much fanfic where luna's a one dimensional dreamy lunatic? :P she actually has serious thoughts and opinions and negative emotions and flaws and stuff in canon that people forget about.

****** On the contrary, I go out of my way to read fanfics where Luna is well-written and has character development. I /hate/ Seer!Luna as a trope.

And I resent you putting words in my mouth.

*** Thanks for the recommendations, those were very sweet. I think of the two stories, I prefer "Hope," though "A Different Sort" seems to be a bit closer to canon.
