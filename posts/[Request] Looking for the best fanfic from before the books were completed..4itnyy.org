I only got into fanfiction last year, so I wonder how fans imagined the books to continue before the series was completed. What are the best fanfictions from that time?


** linkao3(Cartographer's Craft)

Written in 2005! Acts as an alternate DH, and in my opinion is really fantastic.

Also has a great use of Chekhov's gun fairly early on.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.
