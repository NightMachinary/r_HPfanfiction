#+TITLE: Self-insert in which the OC hasn’t read the books or seen the movies? Like a Gen Z maybe? Either 1991 or Marauders era would be cool.

** I read part of a fic in which the SI had a vague recollection of the books, but kept getting them confused with Star Wars, LOTR, D&D, etc. I thought the idea had potential but the execution wasn't great.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** They way I'd implement this I think is by having the SI in Marauder-era who has only read up to GoF, but with the universe having the continuity of DH. Because at GoF, we still knew basically nothing about that time. OotP gave us Snape's Worst Memory, DH gave us The Prince's Tale. Before then, all we had was vague anecdotes.

But no, I haven't seen a fic with a SI with incomplete knowledge of the universe. Sorry.
