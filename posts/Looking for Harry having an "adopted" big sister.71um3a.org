I realized that there are nearly no stories where Harry gets to know an older girl/woman and develop a relationship like one would have with a sibling or a favorite aunt (there are plenty of bad "new mother" stories out there though). Preferably some fluff moments without that turning into a romantic relationship at some point.

I was thinking along the lines of a young Harry meeting Tonks during her final year at Hogwarts and her filling a mentor role or Fleur doing something similar during the Triwizard Tournament after seeing Harry becoming an outcast. Of course, I am open to any recommendations that have an "adopted sister" plot. Please, no slash, canon pairings or sugarcoat mother Molly.


** Harry Potter And the Girl With a Hundred Faces by Sarista Wow linkffn(8535739)

Has Tonks meeting Harry in the summer before his first year and taking care of him. Sadly it's abandoned, but what's there is decent and the author added an outline of where they wanted the story to go which was good of them.

  On his first trip to Diagon Alley, Harry Potter is discovered by a certain would-be Auror Metamorphmagus, and life will never be the same again. This is a AU, but the divergence actually takes place before the books themselves begin. Tonks will be her canon age. Rated M for possible language and fight scenes later in the story. Not a Harry/Tonks romance fic. On Hiatus.

** There is Triumphant, the Dreamer linkffn(12369247).

It's more like the sister has Harry as an "adopted" brother, though. It's a SI fic.

Still really decent, but it hasn't updated in a couple months.

  Heather's not exactly sure how she got here, but at least the role of 'older sister' is a familiar one.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5324704/1/Tyrant][Tyrant]], linkffn(5324704): very AU, very interesting, but unfortunately abandoned. The author of "Emperor" credited this fic for the original inspiration. Tonks is the adopted big sister of Harry.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry
