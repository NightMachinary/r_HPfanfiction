I've read so many Ron and the Weasley family bashing.

What about a fic where Hermione is bashed. I don't want Ron Bashing included though.


** Can someone do this ... I enjoy reading her stories but she's always so perfect it's super annoying like no matter what ship, she's always perfect and If she has a flaw it's ... she needs to be reminded to eat .

Snape said it best : "That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me, are you incapable of restraining yourself, or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? "

To be honest if she was a real person I wouldn't stand her, the way she memorizes things by heart and recites them ... a girl in my physics class read ahead a tried to pull that shit , she got a very similar response . She must be a pain in the ass for teachers, who usually are leading to a certain topic or conclusion by getting general knowledge answers from the students ( like moody teaching about the unforgivables ).

**** This just reminds me of GoF movie where they show the girls walking after Krum when he's working out, while "not like other girls" Hermione reads a book.

The Wesley's views are far from traditional in the wizarding world so I really can't see where the narrative comes from .

**** Well obviously, but he could've easily written the unforgivables on the board and asked about them ... he wanted it come from the students to see how much they knew and what reactions they had . I think the real Moody would've used a similar method but to know the students ability rather than what I assume to be the sadistic intent of asking about them In a room full of children who suffered the outcome (e.g Neville and Harry)

"You also spent five hours and used nearly an entire bottle of Sleakeasy's Hair Relaxant calming your hair when a five-second incantation known to both of your roommates as well as almost ever non-muggleborn female in Hogwarts at the time would have been both easier and less expensive."

** I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]), along with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]). And these communities on FFN have some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Hermione-Bashing/123454/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/]]) has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to her about her long essays. Hermione ignores her.

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. Its more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10434054/1/Not-the-Smartest-Witch]]) Hermione is not as smart as she portrays herself to be.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]) where Ron choses not to date Hermione. It's Hermione-critical.
