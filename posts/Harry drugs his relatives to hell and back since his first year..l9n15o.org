So, I remember a story I read some time ago that had the order almost overdosing the Dursley's with congeniality potion (not sure if this potion is cannon) resulting in making the Dursley's turn from abusive and jump over friendly straight to obsessively creepy, to give you guys and gals an idea Petunia offered to haves ex with Harry (to calm a bit the horror and indignation he was 15/16 and promptly jumped out of the bed and flees the house without anything sexual happening). So remembering the story got me thinking, what if Harry had tried to do something similar?

There are different takes on how muggles react to potions (we know they are receptive to them because of Tom Riddle) but the two most accepted takes seem to be that either the potion react as it would for a magical or it has a much stronger effect, even potentially being permanent, for this post I will go with the second one.

The turning point would be that Harry got the information about the underage magic laws around the beginning of the year when the memories of his treatment by the Dursley's was still fresh in his mind and he was still hopping to be able to use magic to make his summers easier. Now many readers would agree with me that, for all talk about having Harry be more independent, cannon Harry was reasonably proactive until this tendency diminished around GoF and then dropped a bit further in HBP, so 11 YO Harry's first reaction to learning about this particular law is to look for loopholes, some brainstorming and a bit of researching later brings him the realization that potions are not monitored by the trace.

Harry's talent for potions seems to be average or even a little above average, however as a first year who just got to start learning the basics of potions we can safely assume that would commit some mistakes and either not be able to identify them or even just not know enough about the subject to care overmuch for anything less serious than an exploded caldron or an obviously toxic mix, this plus the fact that pre-teens are really not the best on judging what amounts to an appropriate response to offenses and the fact that Hogwarts does not seem to have no issues with behavior altering magic below the imperius such as love-potions or cheering charms (assumedly because they have enough knowledge to safely identify and deal with abuses of such magic) plus Harry having the money to buy the Ingredients means the Dursley's are about to have a /real/ bad time.

The way I see it Harry would be at an age where he wouldn't yet have the good sense of starting small and would try as his first some very powerful and dangerous potion (probably not amortenia, but Snape /did/ give the recipe for the fraught of living dead right from the first class) then a few more specialized to change the mood and make the person more affable/gullibly like some calming droughts and congeniality potions and then some for memory and attention span like the forgetfulness elixir and some others.

Then comes summer and since Harry is the one who cooks the meals but rarely gets to eat he has no problem dosing his relatives with the potentially faulty potions according his and theirs moods. Problem begins because he never thought to research how muggles react to the potions and believes that they lose power with time like what happens to magicals, they don't and the effects start slowly but surely staking with each new dose. What begins as Vernon forgetting some mishap he blamed Harry for progressively turns to forgetfulness/absentmindedness and eventually to becoming incapable of retaining short-term memories. Dudley goes from becoming slightly more gullible to always doing whatever someone tells him regardless of his wishes or the potential of harm while Petunia goes from friendlier to self-sacrificing.

Harry notices it sometime either in that summer or the next and panics, this wasn't what he wanted, but he can't ask for help since he would be admitting several crimes, so instead he decides to try solving it on his own with only his burgeoning potionering skills... it goes as well as you would expect.


** Truthfully if Harry had been a bit more focused on making his life better potions would have been the perfect route rather than scaring the Dursley's with magic his first year just dose their food with some sort of potion I suggest checking out linkffn(whispers in the night) it's a good fic with a similar scenario. Harry after his first starts drugging the Dursley's with draughts of peace i think The abuse is fairly graphic a bit over the top but otherwise I think it might have my favourite abused Harry

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
