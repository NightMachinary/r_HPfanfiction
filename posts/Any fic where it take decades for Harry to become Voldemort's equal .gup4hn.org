I am not looking for teenage drama and definitely not Hogwarts life. I read an amazing fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain]] which was definitely what I was looking for. You can give it a read it too, it has amazing world building and no lord-potter-gryffin-slytherin-peverell bs . Just honest hardworking and realistic Harry.

Any fics with mature harry fighting the good fight ?


** Why he need decades? He can learn everything in his sleep from horcrux or a powerful ring which consists the knowledge of Merlin, founders and his ancestors.

Or He can learn everything in time chamber where he lives in complete isolation without doing anything but studying and practicing (But, little poor me couldn't last 3 three days in corona lockdown without going insane). Plus he doesn't even age.

Or all he needed was going to Gringotts and getting the print out of all his powers and subjects he was good at. They perform a ritual for free because he remembered Griphooks name.

When he had all these options why he needs to spent decades to match his enemy whom he dedtroyed while still in diapers?

*** You forgot Grindelwald was teaching him in his dreams and then he somehow dies and not dies at the same time by an exploding mimbulus mimbletonia near his scar, goes to Kings Cross to pick a point in timeline and kill baby riddle mean while getting laid with all the Fleurs that come in between.

*** Why does he need a decade to become Voldemort's equal? He could just marry 6 witches with whom he has a bond with and then Harry can combine all of their magical power to defeat Voldemort when he is sitting with his wives in the Great Hall.

**** 6!....come on. Those are rookie numbers. He was born married to 6 witches.

The appropriate number of whiches married to him are given by an formula:

(his age)![factorial]+6=number of current soul bonded babes waiting for emerald swimmers.

***** 6 is for Harry. Hadrian on the other hand was contracted to marry 6 witches and gets their mothers, sisters and friends and their mothers and sisters because of some obscure reasons. Then gets all the death eater's wife and daughters after killing Voldemort as right of conquest. If that number was not sufficient he would travel to DC, Marvel and GoT universes to get remaining girls.

#+begin_quote
  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. No prominent pairings. 5* from DLP.
