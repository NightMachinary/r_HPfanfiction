So I've been on an HP/OC binge, and I really enjoyed Grow Young With Me, by Taliesin19. linkffn(11111990)

I think the best part of it all was just how laidback it was. It's purely about the characters, and their interactions. There's not a big bad guy torturing muggles every other chapter, or some looming battle, nobody is dying. I care about what's going on, the characters are interesting, but they aren't constantly fighting for their lives either.

I've come to the conclusion that I /really/ like that. I'm interested in what's happening, but it stays fairly light hearted /most/ of the time. And in the few parts it does get depressing, the pace of the writing means it's resolved fairly fast- I don't need to read 60k words for two characters to make up finally.

The next thing I started(and am still reading, so no spoilers please) is Eclipse Of The Sky, by firefawn. linkffn(2920229)

It's a complete 180. This fic has been fire and brimstone, conflict around every corner. /It just doesn't stop./ I can absolutely see why someone would love this, and the fic is well written(though somewhat verbose), but fuck I wish it'd stop for a bit and let everyone talk about their feelings. I'm enjoying the read. It's just.. stressful, and that's not really something I want from a fic.

So TL;DR: I want fics based around characters and relationships, not a dark lord or something like that. Romance strongly preferred, and if it's with an OC that's even better. I also really like Dad!Harry for some reason, or maybe that's just Taliesin being a fantastic author, I'm not sure.

I'm probably not going to read anything Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione, but go ahead and post if you have anything that fits with those pairings. I might not read it, but someone else who stumbles on this thread might be happy you commented.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

**** These look good- I was looking for stuff with HP as the main character, but these look interesting enough to read anyways.

I'll definitely check out Madley In Love first, though.

Thanks!

** Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time is pretty laidback, it's entirely centred around character relationships. It does feature Ginny/Harry but it's not about them. Also the sequels aren't so laid back.
