** No. Portraits only have the memories and knowledge they're told, they aren't copies of the people they're patterned after, they aren't real people. Like the Dumbledore portrait only knew the Resurrection Stone was within the Snitch because the real Dumbledore told it while he was still alive.

**** yes Rowling wrote a Pottermore article about portraits.

It talks about how their ability to interact with the world depends of the power of the depicted wizard. How they only behave the way the painter perceived the person he paints and how the headmasters of Hogwarts take time to teach a portrait to act like them and give it memories.

***** might make for a good plot to steal knowledge. invent a portrait making method that somehow has all their memories while the victim thinks its just a normal portrait. then swap the finished one out for a regular one and use various methods to get info from the secret portrait.

***** A through-the-years fic of Dumbledore updating his portrait could be very interesting. It's maybe the only thing he can truly unburden himself to (how could he trust anyone besides himself with his secrets?) Seeing Dumbledore change through the eyes of the portrait from the First Wizarding War to the period of peace and through Voldemort's 2nd rise, with Dumbledore knowing almost exactly when he'll die, could be fascinating and make him a more empathetic character.

In the same vein, Snape's relationship with his portrait would be interesting. I've always assumed he went into 7th year fully expecting to be dead before the year ended; how would that affect his interaction with it?

** Yes and no. Portraits are artificial beings who possess an imperfect copy of the original's personality, but know they are not the original, and they purposefully try to act as close to the original as possible. Sometimes wizards transfer them some of their most precious memories via Pensieve, other times they just tell the portrait about their life the normal way.

The point is, it's imaginable, although it would be very complex magic, that a Portrait could be given a physical body; but that would in no way amount to resurrecting the original person, it would just give the Portrait-Person a body.

** Since I'm confused it wasn't yet mentioned: I don't think so, simply because in the HP universe souls are a definite thing. Remember, when a dementor takes somebody's soul, they take the personality and memories with them, even while the body stays functional, meaning they are completely anchored to the soul.

So I'd imagine your suggestion would be only marginally better than a empty shell. Maybe you can sorta 'program' the body to behave in a very basic and limited way, but nothing like the actual person.

*** That's not quite right. The portraits aren't the original, but they /are/ sentient, by all appearances; they're simply different people, magical "mind-clones" whose personality is only broadly based on the originals. Thus, if you could transfer a portrait's consciousness to a body, you /would/ get a functional, feeling, thinking person --- it's just that that person would /not/ be the original brought back to life.

** If I were following canon attitudes, I'd say that portraits are mere simulacra of people, shades without the essence. They have no souls, and that somehow means they're not people, and in turn it means you can't bring them back to life.

I've got a much more functional view of personhood. Portraits seem to be as capable as people. It should be straightforward to make a sort of magitech mecha for one. However, that person is not necessarily the same as the basis of the portrait. They might have the personality that the painter thought they had. They might only know what the painter knew the original person knew. They might be something of a caricature of the original self. Their memories might degrade with time. Their personality may be immutable.

If you want to write a story in which portraits are people and don't have massive downsides, you can make them super common, or you can invent a reason why they're not popular. Maybe they're incredibly expensive to produce, or they require letting the painter know all your secrets, or there are only a few people with the required skills. Maybe the tech is new. Maybe it requires super expensive reagents. Maybe people tend to go a bit funny in the head after a few years of being two-dimensional.

Or let's say it's not that expensive, and plenty of portraiturists are available. Then everyone's going to commission a portrait, and the dead will quickly outnumber the living. Perhaps Hephaestus Gore is enjoying his fifty-seventh term as Minister for Magic.

Another way to go: the portrait contains enough of the person's essence that you can use it to track back to the original person, through time and space. Combining the portrait, divination, and soul magic would let you return them to life by snatching their soul at the moment of their death and bringing that into a body you create today.
