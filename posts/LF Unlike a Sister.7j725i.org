Im looking for something similar to unlike a sister, this story is great and I hate that it is unfinished. So I'm looking for the next best thing, similar plot, smut, etc.

Any out there?

  Harry and Hermione have always had a deep bond, a strong connection that has been a constant in Harry's life since he was 11 years old. When this bond shifts one particular Halloween, shifts into something not easily explained, the two struggle to define what it means and what will come of it.
