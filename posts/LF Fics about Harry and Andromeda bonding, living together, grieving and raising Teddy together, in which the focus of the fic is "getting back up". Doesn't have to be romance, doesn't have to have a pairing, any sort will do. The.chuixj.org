#+TITLE: LF Fics about Harry and Andromeda bonding, living together, grieving and raising Teddy together, in which the focus of the fic is "getting back up". Doesn't have to be romance, doesn't have to have a pairing, any sort will do. The only thing I ask is for no unnecessary bashing.

I've read What we Lost by Jacob Apples, and a bunch of other fics with a similar premise. Just wanted to see if I've missed it. Also read Sum of their Parts, so no need for that either.

*** What We Lost is the post epilogue fanfic. Disorder of the Phoenix and Found in the Ashes are the time travel ones by Fawkes with Found in the Ashes being a direct continuation of What We Lost.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

  What happens when Harry Potter at age 29 is transported back in time with his family by a meddling phoenix? Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them. Begins in Prisoner of Azkaban, the start of book 3.
