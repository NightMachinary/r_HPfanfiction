I don't mind the stories where Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but too many of them still have Harry being forced to live with the Dursleys, or Snape finds out and ends up raising Harry somehow, or Sirius and Remus decide to raise Harry.

I just do NOT see James and Lily being okay with sending Harry to the Dursley's, even if he wasn't the Boy-Who-Lived, I also don't see them treating Harry awful, even if they found out he could speak to snakes, or was sorted into Slytherin.

No super smart or superpowerful Harry, Harry smarter or more powerful then he was in canon is fine, but make it believable

No Weasley bashing. Would rather have no Dumbledore bashing, but that might be more difficult to come across, in stories like this; so just keep the bashing small, if possible

No Harem Harry

No Seer Luna

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** Harry potter and the boy who lived by the santi (please someone fanficbot this for me because I am NOT the gifted of the bot) would be right up your alley. I loved it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
