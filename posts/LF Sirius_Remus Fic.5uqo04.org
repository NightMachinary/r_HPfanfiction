Wolfstar is one of my favorite pairings and I would like to get my hands on some recs as I have read surprisingly little for them. I'm partial to angst in my fic but any genre is fine.

** Fingerholds is good, and decently angsty I guess? [[http://remusxsirius.livejournal.com/2872554.html]]

** Not sure if you're in to alternate universes (I wasn't until recently), but two amazing fics I've read lately are:

Long Live Living (If Living Can Be This) [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/315289/chapters/580274]]

And

Text Talk [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239]]

** I highly recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2454211/1/A-Feast-in-Azkaban][A Feast In Azkaban]] .

It's super angsty, very well-written, and completed. Hope you enjoy!
