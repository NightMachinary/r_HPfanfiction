Just reading "Basilisk-born by Ebenbild" it underlines just how incompetent the ministry of magic is as an institution.

Curious if there's a dark lord potter who's actually got his own moral code, as moral as you can be when your forcing death eaters to bow to you, but Harry won't let them have any fun, no murder, no rape, just a quiet overthrow of the ministry and replacing it with something more practical and functional.


** linkao3(The Sum of Their Parts) is pretty much this.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Sadly there's surprisingly few stories that do this right. "Sum of their Parts" has already been mentioned, but probably comes closest.

Almost all other attempts at this I've tried to read quickly devolve into (male) power fantasies with a super independent Harry who always does the right thing (even if his actions are only justifiable in hindsight, because the author willed them so: "Whoops, turns out I was totally justified in torturing this guy, because I gained vital information that will save thousands of lives" ... instead of "Whops, turns out I tortured this guy for no reason at all, because I can't separate fact from fiction in his desperate attempts to make the pain stop".).

I'd love to read more stories about a "rogue" Harry who turns his back on the ministry and is willing to make morally ambiguous decisions without immediately devolving into evil!Harry. I'm sometimes shocked when people seem to completely fall for the author manipulations and are willing to agree with all kinds of shit just because it is perpetrated by the POV protagonist.

*** I'm only a third the way through this one, and it seems good, but it has the Hermione-turns-into-an-unreasonable-bitch-for-no-reason trope to facilitate Harry making other friends. Always makes fics much harder to read.

***** It's a trope I run into almost 100% of the time when the author either wants to pair Harry with someone who isn't Ginny or Hermione, or wants him to make friends outside of Hermione and Ron.

Also, I never really understood why authors use Hermione's supposed rule following as the reason for their friendship ending? Especially in regards to nitpicking Harry, considering Harry (and Ron) were usually her impetus or accomplices for her rule breaking. She drugged and impersonated fellow students and went with Harry to break into a secure government facility. She cares about rules until Harry or Ron needs something, then rules are unimportant.
