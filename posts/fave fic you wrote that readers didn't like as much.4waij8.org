Do the fanfic writers here have a fic they wrote that they really like but which the readers don't like as much?

Does this usually happen when the story is too personal and the characters become OOC?

Would love to hear theories and see examples :)


** I wrote a fic that had this premise:

The DoM battle in 5th year gave Ron the ability to throw himself forward in time for an initial span of twenty seconds. He could see and hear everything, but he couldn't interact with the future time. He used that ability to better himself in school, Quidditch, and with his romances, but the spans of time start stretching longer and longer until he starts watching the return of Voldemort and the death of his friends. He doesn't know whether or not his actions will lead or even matter in regards to the future he sees and starts to go mad.

I wrote the first few chapters and it received only a few reviews. It was fun writing a non-Harry centric fic. I've since taken it down, but that was a story that none of my readers really got into.

I think A Soul To Fight For was just not really good. I leave it up for giggles, but meh...

The Light of Lumos suffers from its completely OC nature. I'm looking forward to see if there is more pull for it after a few updates. But as I am writing this very fragmented, it will take a while.

***** Yeah maybe. I mean there were several factors that probably don't draw people in. Namely:

-We know so little about these characters that they're basically OCs. People don't really like OCs. -It's femmeslash, but only mild sexual situations. People only seem to like gay stuff i it's porny. -It's an unusual pairing which takes a character (Astoria) from more popular pairings (Harry, Draco) -It's a doomed ship fic, so the reader knows it's not a ship that will sail. -The challenge stipulated that it had to be inspired by/in the theme of this Florence + The Machine song, which makes people think it's a song fic. It's not, fyi. -The summary doesn't say a lot and is not intriguing, but because I knew it wasn't going to be popular I didn't bother putting effort into it. I'm ok with it being just for me, but I'm still proud enough of it that I wanted it up somewhere. -It's just a one-shot and I was a fairly new writer when I posted it.

** Definitely my newest fic, linkffn(11804414)

Obviously, it's a crossover, so it's never going to get as much attention as just a regular HP fic, but the review, fave, and follow counts are all pretty low, even for that archive. The lack of readership for it bothered me for a really long time, because (and I'm not /trying/ to sound like a dick here, but I will) I felt that my fic was a better read than anything else in that archive. Now, however, I think I was just trying too hard to be clever and original, and it backfired spectacularly.

Essentially, the story isn't really a Harry Potter-Witcher crossover, so much as it's HP re-imagined in the Witcher world some 200 years before the original Witcher books/games. That means there's no jumping through the DoM veil and landing on the other planet; Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Dumbledore, you name 'em, they were all born in the Witcher world, grew up there, and have no concept of England, Hogwarts, or any of the stuff from HP canon. For those of you who have read the Witcher books, I modeled the fic after the first two books in the Witcher series as a collection of short stories from Harry's life, as sort of a spiritual prequel to Geralt's adventures in the canon series. But, due to the fact that it's set so far back in the timeline, there isn't much interaction between Harry and the main cast of characters in the original Witcher series, because only a few of them are even alive at that point. And the characters Harry does interact with are mostly characters mentioned in the Witcher books, all of whom would be unfamiliar to people who have only played the Witcher games. And I think those are the vast majority of people outside of Poland who are familiar with The Witcher.

I've since realised this is all pretty much a non-starter with crossover readers, who aren't really looking for that kind of story. Even though the fic is definitely more Witcher-inspired than HP-inspired, people just look at it, see that the main characters from the Witcher series aren't in it, and decide that it's not really a crossover. It sucks, because I feel like it's the best fic I've written, and the reviews I have gotten are really positive, but the interest just isn't there, I suppose. I'm still working on it, because it's genuinely fun to write, but I've learned not to expect a lot of reviews or favourites for it.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an interesting life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. AU featuring HP characters if they were born into the Witcher world.

** None of mine have ever been remotely what you'd call popular, but this one has a far lower read-through rate from first to last chapters than the others do. It's my most recent multichapter, and I thought - and still think - it's better written and plotted, more complex, and deals with more interesting issues altogether. But people don't seem very enthusiastic about it. Though I don't think I'd change it because it still pleases me, I honestly wish I knew why. linkffn(11662486)
