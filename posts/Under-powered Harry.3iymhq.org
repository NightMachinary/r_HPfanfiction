I've noticed something. Practically every fanfiction that I read has Harry being given some advantage over canon Harry. Sometimes it's something small like a piece of info he didn't have in canon, and then sometimes Harry is an super-genius, god-like, Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Peverell who can defeat Dumbledore wandlessly. But overall, Harry almost always comes out smarter or more powerful than in canon. It got me thinking, it might be interesting to see what weak!Harry or even squib!harry does with the prophesy hanging over his head. Does anyone know of any stories where Harry is significantly /less/ powerful than canon?

** Have you read either linkffn(A Squib Worth by Naia) or linkffn(Running Away by Bil)?

linkffn(A Different Fate by lordhellebore) has squibbed-disabled Harry, with Neville taking over the BWL role.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  The blood wards around Privet Drive have a disastrous effect on Harry Potter's magical development, leaving him unable to use a wand. But there are other kinds of magic, and other paths to power. Harry/many witches. No horcruxes.
