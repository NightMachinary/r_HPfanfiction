Like it says your favorites fics for any pairing you want to share and why. I personally will start with one to help the ball

Harry/Tonks. This was the one made me fall in love with the pairing, its well written, does not bash anyone and shows some ways people care without words. ( has some smut. For a warning.)

Anyone you want.

** Red Knight is a rare (and very good) Ron/Daphne. It has made me want more of this pairing, but haven't found any others of good enough quality.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** "Call Me" has a very interesting partner for Harry in the shape of Lisa Turpin. She's basically an OC, but certainly not a Mary Sue. The fic is pretty unique as it is basically one big subversion of all those "post-OotP brooding -> Indy/OP Harry" stories. My only criticism is that sometimes, the adults are too reasonable.

** I don't like all of these pairings, but they're the fics I like the most from what I've read, or stand out the most, with the pairing

BBHP: linkffn(Delenda Est) First half is really good. Second half isn't bad, but ruins how good the first half was. This fic gave me a brief interest in the BBHP ship and I found some others I liked (Wind Shear comes to mind), but nothing I liked as much as the first half of this.

DGHP: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Importance of Intent) I've read several Haphne fics, this one stands out to me as the best one. It's also unique -- most Haphne has a focus on politics and Lordships, which this one doesn't really have.

GWHP: linkffn(Backwards with Purpose) The only Hinny that stands out to me -- the 2nd fanfic I read ever, and my introduction to the Peggy Sue trope.

HGDM: linkffn(Promise me Love by JodieLove) I don't really care much for this ship, but was curious about it recently. I liked the execution of this one and how lighthearted it is -- as long as you're willing to stomach postwar good!Draco.

HGSS: linkffn(Pride of Time) Ideally I'd link a fic called Semantics here, but that fic seems to have vanished. So instead I'll refer to the fic that does the whole HG-to-Marauder-era best IMO. There's countless of fics like this, and while there's nothing unique about it, it doesn't really do anything wrong.

HGTR: linkffn(Have You Ever) I like this ship even less than Dramione, but got curious over it a few weeks ago. This fic has one of the more interesting ideas. I find the last chapter (or last 2, I don't remember) to have dropped the ball completely, though, and making me stop take the fic seriously at that point.

LESS: linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) One of the first SS-centric fics I read, and the first with this particular ship. In hindsight, with my major interest in the ship, there's several fics with a similar premise; SS Marauder-era Peggy Sue. This one is unique in that, instead of basically making him a Gryffindor in disguise, bashing Marauders, and more or less disowning his own house, avoiding the fallout of SWM and trivially get a happily ever after with a bit of first-war thrown in, this one actually lands him /after/ the event, and focuses on him trying to show Slytherins an alternative path besides serving as Death Eaters. I've not seen any other fics do something similar, which is a bit sad given how common the initial premise is.

NTHP: linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) The only NTHP I've read and liked. I like the pairing but haven't seen any other fic doing it well.

** My favorite Dramione is "Destiny" by Annie Lockwood. I read almost exclusively Dramione when I started reading fanfiction and now I cant stand the pairing. I've read all the big hits, and the small hits, and this one is still a good read. I mean it's fluff central but that might be why I like it.

The best Ginny/Blaise, Ron/Pansy, Theo/Daphne, etc. is most definitely "Eros & psyche" by RZZMG. It's a work in progress though and it is full of smut so it's not for everyone. I read a really good Neville/Hermione once but I can't remember the name of it. That is a rare pairing I wish there was more of!
