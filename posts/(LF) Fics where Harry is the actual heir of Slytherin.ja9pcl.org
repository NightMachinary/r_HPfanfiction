Not like the one who opens the chamber and sets out to kill the muggleborns but that would be interesting to see


** linkffn (A Cadmean Victory)

It is quite controversial on here - some like it, some don't, but it does fit your request.

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a remastered version is coming to my Patreon - initially free.

**** IIRC it depends on how you see it, Salazar, who knows about Soul Magic and Horcruxes, along with the Blood and Ritual Magic he used to gift his descendants with parseltongue, says there's no way Harry could be a parselmouth without being a descendant from him, even with the Horcrux he carries.

So Harry is a descendent of Salazar, most likely through Lily.

As for being the /Heir,/ well that's more complicated because it involves firstborns and such, but Salazar practically disinherits Riddle and calls Harry his actual Heir.

** Ooh, ooh, I can help here.

Okay, so first, it's linkao3(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw), where he obtains the heirship of Slytherin and many shenanigans happen (I say shenanigans, but it's pretty serious, except for being like a huge heist movie)

Then linkao3(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament by Salient_Causality), which is also fun and good.

And, well, whenever I get the chance, I like plugging linkao3(From Ruin by GraeFoxx), despite the fact that it has virtually nothing to do with what you asked for. In the words of the inimitable Marge Simpson, "I just think [it's] neat."

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Fic is crossposted from FFN, it is still being written and future updates will be added here too. A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more; it is a story of growth and and maturation. Harry is het and it may or may not be a multi fic.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

(Time travel due to a time-turner accident during the battle of the Department of Mysteries)

Harry, Ron, and Hermione get sent to the founders era... Glacial updates and rough writing in the first few chapters, but it's a story I really enjoy.

It's very interesting. Very. It's about Harry travelling to the Founders' era and living there.

If you're worried about it being the third part of the series, don't be. I started reading it from here and then read the rest.
