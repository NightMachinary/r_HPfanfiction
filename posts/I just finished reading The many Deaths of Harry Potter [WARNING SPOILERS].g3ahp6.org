I don't want this post to become /too/ long, but I want to rant about this lol

Anyway. So the basic premise is that Harry has the ability to die and then come back to an earlier period of time. But the summary could have told you that.

Admittedly, I wouldn't have read it if I knew what Harry would become - slightly ruthless. Call me idealistic but I don't enjoy that in a character. However it was necessary. It portrayed the mental effects of being killed around ten times.

I'm not very articulate, so forgive me. But the story did a great job of being creative, of character development (though I would have liked to see more of the main characters of the story who weren't Harry characterised to more of an effect. ie Hermione, Neville and Voldemort) and showed Harry to be not OP but not lucky either. A Slytherin to the boot- he used many methods that countered wizarding logic in the way so many of us would have done. For example, accio-ing the golden egg.

The story sucked me in for the ten hours it took em to read it, and I recommend it to anyone looking for something interesting and time consuming to read.


** I absolutely agree. It's certainly not the most heartwarming story out there, but it's a great read, and portrays Voldemort as more cunning and ruthless as well, which I really appreciated.

*** I recommend reading it. It's very well written and shows how memories of your own death would really mess you up as a person.
