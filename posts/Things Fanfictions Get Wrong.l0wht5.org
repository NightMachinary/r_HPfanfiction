I invite you all to rant freely about things you have read in fanfiction that are just... /wrong/.

Those little language and culture mixups that irritate you no end even though you /know/ it's not the author's fault they didn't grow up in Britain. /(Cream does not fucking go in tea.)/

The times when movie scenes that are downright contradicted in the canon books somehow manage to worm their way into the story. /(Voldemort. Did. Not. Hug. Draco. Malfoy.)/

Passages from the books that the author has /clearly/ written from memory. /("Bone of the father, unknowingly 'taken', you will 'ressurect' your son.")/

Words that are spelled incorrectly. /("Hogsmead")/

Spells and potions that somehow have a different effect, or a different incantation, than they do in canon. /(Pepper-Up, the cure for colds, acting like an Invigoration Draught. Veritaserum forcing answers out of an unwilling mouth (Edit: rather than drugging the mouth to be willing)./ "Enervate", /for whatever fucking reason, replacing/ "Rennervate" /(Edit: I have apparently grown up with the wrong books and the correct spell is/ Ennervate/)./

Times when the author forgot how much the characters know at different points in the timeline and how that affects how they refer to things. /(Calling Harry the "Chosen One" before the fight in the Department of Mysteries happens, making it common knowledge that Sirius Black was the Potters' Secret Keeper.)/

Please give me your rants. I can't be the only one!

Good thing you pointed this out. I immediately changed this small detail in my story.

However, students don't seem to interact with the Headmaster frequently. Besides, Dippet seemed to be unsure about Riddle living in an orphanage in 1943, after five years of education. Surely Riddle had asked to stay at Hogwarts for the summer earlier than that? And since Dumbledore was the one who introduced Riddle to the wizarding world, it feels plausible that Riddle would have asked him things like staying at Hogwarts. Slughorn is another possible person, but maybe Riddle did not want him to know he had no background in the wizarding world.

**** Riddle acknowledges that it seemed like Dumbledore didn't like him before he even opened the CoS and Slughorn knew about his origins, so I don't think it's plausible he'd go to him.

If you wanted to retcon it, though, you could just say Deputy-Headmaster Dumbledore convinced Dippet to say no, which is what he did when TMR asked for the DADA post.

Also ppl seeming to think that Veritaserum compels you to take a shot if it's "Never Have I Ever". /What/. And lastly, Veritaserum being used on Draco Malfoy during or after his sixth year /wouldn't work/. He learns Occlumency. Occlumency can be used to counteract Veritaserum.

This is a retcon. Nowhere in the books is it stated that occlumency can counteract veritaserum. Do you think Crouch Jr wouldn't know occlumency when he was posing as Moody? Especially when he needed to fool Dumbledore? He was still susceptible to veritaserum.

  . Do you think Crouch Jr wouldn't know occlumency when he was posing as Moody?
#+end_quote

I think you are substantially over-estimating the prevalence of occlumency. I wouldn't be surprised if Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, Slughorn, Bellatrix and (kinda) Draco were the only ones capable of it in Britain. There is in fact also a very good reason to think Crouch Jr did /not/ know occlumency: the fact that his father was able to hold him under the Imperius Curse.

Also, a retcon is where you /change/ something from earlier canon. Saying occlumency can block veritaserum is not a retcon because it does not contradict any previous canon. Indeed, it fits entirely with Snape's description of occlumency in OotP, which was that occlumency protects the mind generally:

#+begin_quote
  “Occlumency, Potter. The magical Defense of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.”
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  Snape continued to survey him through narrowed eyes for a moment, then said, “Now, Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather's kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence.”
#+end_quote

The fact that a defence to veritaserum exists also is consistent with the established canon fact that veritaserum is not used in trials to be sure of innocence/guilt, which becomes difficult to explain if veritaserum is infallible.

  “But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as pos­sible, “you don't need me --- you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum. ...”

  “Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be ex­pecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be aston­ished if he has not *carried an antidote to Veritaserum* with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
#+end_quote

I stand by the statement that it is a retcon. Dumbledore had the option here to mention occlumency being able to counteract veritaserum but didn't. He mentioned it as a defense against legilimency, and /specifically mentioned an antidote to veritaserum./

Rowling realised later that the presence of veritaserum creates plot holes given the Death Eaters being free after the First War, so changed stuff in pottermore.

#+end_quote

This logic doesn't really hold at all. Dumbledore is not an encyclopedia, he's a person having a conversation. The idea that he was under a duty in that conversation to exhaustively list all the defences against veritaserum and that his failure to do so means that no such defences exist is to completely mischaracterise how conversation works, both in real life and in fiction (professional authors avoid info-dump).

JKR's Pottermore article where she talks about the various defences to veritaserum includes antidotes as well - there's a range of possible defences, one of which Dumbledore refers to in that quote.

#+begin_quote
  There's no reason why this wouldn't be part of auror training, for example,
#+end_quote

There's three very good reasons:

1. Occlumency is said to be extremely difficult. The typical Auror may be incapable of it, making it pointless to even attempt to teach.

2. Legilimency is said to be obscure - perhaps so rare that most wizards have never even heard of it. It would be like teaching Special Forces how to disarm a nuclear bomb as part of their standard training - a skill they are never going to have to use.

3. It's not even that important a skill to an Auror's duties. McGonagall duelled Snape just fine in DH without knowing occlumency.

I've searched for it, but ennervate doesn't seem to be a word at all, and I can't find any reference to it meaning to give energy to something.

I think its just JKR couldn't have a spell be a normal English word, so she changed it just a bit. Then later on she realized that it didn't make sense considering the meaning of enervate (which is definitely a real word and means to drain of energy) so she added the prefix 're-', giving us 'Rennervate'.

** No one knew that inner circle Death Eaters had the dark mark on their arm. I've seen so many fics randomly check people's arms for the dark mark or bash Dumbledore for not doing so when it wasn't common knowledge. Sirius Black, who fought extensively in the first war, had no clue about it.

Along the same lines, no one really knew Snape had been a Death Eater in the first war. Sirius only says that he hung around future Death Eaters, not that he was one himself. During Kakaroff's trial, he mentions Snape's name last, after he has given up every other Death Eater. This shows that Snape was smart enough not to reveal his identity during raids (if he went on them; it is as likely he was a more behind the scenes type person, just brewing potions and spying for information). So, scenes like Snape and the Marauders screaming and threatening each other during fights with the Order in the first war didn't happen.

Also, Remus and Lily weren't close friends. That's a movie only thing. In the books, he only talks about James.

And afaik, James Potter's patronus was never confirmed to be a stag. We know his animagus form but it doesn't mention whether or not he could cast a patronus. But this one is alright imo; it's natural to assume that he could.

Snape was Dumbledore's spy near the end of the First War. He had the Dark mark. He must've told Dumbledore. Dumbledore should've informed the Ministry and the Order. /If he didn't,/ that's his fault. Karkaroff gave up his fellow Death Eaters; it's possible that he also told the Ministry.

The Ministry would've made this public knowledge to identify Death Eaters, especially by the end of the First War when a lot of the Death Eaters are captured.

It is somewhat plausible that Sirius didn't know since he was in prison and missed a dozen years' worth of news and gossip.

But Dumbledore should've known through Snape and should've informed the Ministry and the Order. This information does not sacrifice the identity of his spy.

With good reason. From Sirius' comments, the imprisoned Death Eaters knew who actually betrayed the Potters. One wonders why the "spy" didn't know. Or maybe didn't care that an innocent man was in prison.

The inner circle Death Eaters were aware of other. In the fifth book in the DoM, Malfoy addresses all of them by name when he sends them after Harry and co. In the fourth book in the graveyard, when the Death Eaters take their places in a circle around Voldemort, they leave empty spaces for the missing or the dead, but Pettigrew had his own, which he takes without a word.

  In the fifth book in the DoM, Malfoy addresses all of them by name when he sends them after Harry and co.
#+end_quote

That's a specific group that might have gone on raids together in the past, we don't know. Also, that's in 1996. We're talking about 1981 here. Who knows how many people realised because of the trials who some of their fellow Death Eaters were? Quite a lot, I would imagine.

#+begin_quote
  In the fourth book in the graveyard, when the Death Eaters take their places in a circle around Voldemort, they leave empty spaces for the missing or the dead, but Pettigrew had his own, which he takes without a word.
#+end_quote

Of course he did. Everyone knew exactly their place in the circle. They didn't necessarily have to know /who/ was beside them for that to happen. Just what their mask looked like.

This is possible /in part/ as we see the pensieve being used in such a way by Dumbledore when he tells Harry the prophecy. Excerpt below from the fifth book.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and deposited them in the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, *he raised his wand and prodded the silvery sub­stance with its tip.*

  *A figure rose out of it,* draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enor­mous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethe­real, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before.

It's never explained just what happens to make you the keeper.

But. What I do know. Wasn't/Dumbledore/ the keeper and caster for Grimmauld? Hence why they had to share it via written note; implying that whomever had said notes were not the original secret keeper.

I say this because it *is* stated that only *the original* keeper may share the secret verbally. Any others must have a written piece, presumably made by the keeper.

Because the question here.

If you share the secret with two people. Wouldn't they also become secret keepers?

***** Well, I always liked to think that the Fidelius Charm needs a lot of power to be cast.\\
(Like, only above-average people can do it like Snape, Dumbledore, Voldy, Flitwick, etc)

Also, it should have 'reality-warping' powers to some degree - since it makes people that knew of the secured place simply forget about it.\\
...and only the Secret Keeper can tell people the secret because that is how the spell works.\\
If you know the secret - because the Secret Keeper told you - you can tell it to someone, but it will be forgotten just as quickly. So, the secret stays safe.

...or Voldy can simply catch an Order of the Phoenix member and legilimens the shit out of them (and gain access to all the protected areas).

Anyway, I also like to think that you can't be the one to cast the spell and the Secret Keeper at the same time. It would make the spell too powerful and Voldemort would have surely used it if it were like this to protect his babies (Horcruxes).\\
But he did not becuase he doesn't trust anybody, so he didn't use the Fidelius Charm.

That is what I think is a necessary ingredient of the spell: Trust.

You have to trust someone to keep the secret, becuase the caster of the spell is most likely the one that needs it for some purpose.

Well, this is my personal headcanon, at least.

There's parts of the movies that absolutely gel with book-canon and can make for good dramatic moments in fanfic, like Hermione's "MUDBLOOD" scar - granted, your example of "Voldemort hugging Draco Malfoy" is not one of the moments that does so often and really doesn't gel with book-canon.

What really grinds /my/ gears are the following things:

- Overtly politicking children. It's pretty unrealistic to see Harry, or anyone else under the age of 15 (and even 15 is a stretch unless their parents are politicians through-and-through and train their child to be the same way), discussing bills of law or making overtly-political statements.
- Americanisms - specifically, guns and their prevalence among Muggles. In Britain, guns are /rare/ - and when you do encounter one, it's usually a hunting rifle, not a self-defense kind of gun. That puts them relatively low on the list of threats to Wizardkind in Britain (at least, outside of an out-and-out Muggle versus Wizard war), and makes it very unlikely for random Muggleborn children to know the first thing about gun-safety.

Fun fact, I encounter both of those in a fic I otherwise quite like, and will openly cite as inspiration: The Accidental Animagus, by White_Squirrel.

** Snakes do not have eyelids and are not able to blink or close their eyes in anyway. Might seem weird, but I love reptiles and many fics that have snakes in them don´t put in effort to do even basic research. Some don´t even seem to know they are cold blooded. Or that Great britain only has a handful of species and they are rare to find in the wild.

And the Basilisk is just that much more terrifying for not being able to close its eyes.

(If you're curious, I think one of the better ones, can't remember it's name, had Harry show the Order of the Phoenix his memories to help combat their Voldemort, with Harry staying out of the pensive with a watcher -- 'cause of course some of the order didn't trust him. In that case, he was kinda being forced to tell his life and for a reason too. Another fic called Adrift in a World didn't have a retelling of the books, but it had an interesting twist in how Harry's history is revealed.)

He tried to make Hagrid a pariah using the giant thing. He joined the Inquisitorial Squad. He took the Dark Mark. He used the Imperius curse on Madam Rosmerta. He tried to kill Dumbledore, no matter how unwilling he was by the end. He let Death Eaters into Hogwarts.

Those are not the actions of someone who is "misunderstood", those are the actions of someone who was raised to believe they were better than everybody just because of their last name and actively /tried/ to be a bad person (even Malfoy knew that killling was wrong, come on) before eventually realising he hadn't the stomach to kill someone in cold blood.

If he is to complete the half-finished redemption arc we see in canon, he needs to work through his prejudices, /which he still has/, give sincere apologies to everyone he ever hurt, and actively try to be better. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.

The trace is actually pretty interesting because there are quite a few inconsistencies that need to be explained away (Hermione practising spells before coming to Hogwarts, Tom Riddle killing his family while underage, Harry not triggering it at the graveyard, etc)

This actually gives you a lot of space to work with (Is the trace activated at Hogwarts? Was it implemented just recently? Can it be jinxed/warded against?), which is why it drives me up the wall when people think its as simple as just buying another one.

*** I think Hermione practising spells before coming to Hogwarts is just written off as "slightly more controlled accidental magic". Tom Riddle killing his family while underage is most likely possible due to the fact that no underage wizard is actually supposed to be there, and therefore the Ministry doesn't know who cast the Killing Curse. The graveyard is another matter entirely; I can only assume the Ministry believed a Death Eater who had evaded capture decided to torture a child.

There is also the small matter of the /Lumos/ charm apparently not activating the Trace, as well as the magic Tonks performed before taking Harry to Grimmauld Place and the magic Dumbledore performed before taking Harry to the Weasleys' not registering for some reason.

The only slightly plausible explanation I can come up with for Tonks's and Dumbledore's magic at Privet Drive is that the Ministry was told that Harry would be picked up from Privet Drive by (an) adult(s), and that any 'underage' magic they may detect in that area won't be him.

The oversight on /Lumos/ is another matter entirely: Either /Lumos/ is such a commonplace spell as to "not count" (highly doubtful), or they ignored it in favour of focusing on the Patronus Charm, or it was registered as accidental magic, either due to Harry not 'technically' using his wand (how the Ministry would know that is beyond me) or because it was dark in Magnolia Crescent and it was not implausible that Harry would have /really/ wanted to be able to see, which could result in him summoning light involuntarily.

Let's not forget that /Priori Incantatem/ shows the way the last spell a wand performed affected the world around it, not the spell itself. (Cue: screams from Voldemort's wand). It's possible the Trace works similarly- seeing the changes that happen due to magic in a radius around a certain individual.

**** I agree with enough of what you said to not start nitpicking or whatever, but yeah, my point really is that look how much nuance and /stuff/ you came up with in just a few minutes. Much more interesting (and more logical) than it being slapped on a wand. Also just FYI you've confused Prior Incantato, which is a charm that shows the actual /spells/ a wand has cast in reverse order, and Priori Incantatem, which is a rare manifestation of this spell caused by brother/twin wands and causes 'echoes' of the spells.

Ohhh yeah thanks I forgot

I still think that kind of Trace is the most plausible though, given that they detected a floating dessert and immediately jumped to say "Levitation Charm" despite elf magic likely being different enough from wizard magic that the incantation (if there even was one) that Dobby used was vastly different from /Wingardium Leviosa/.

****** Oh yeah definitely, I don't disagree with that at all; that's canon as far as I know. The trace detects other wizards using magic around a child as well as their own (which is why underage magic isn't punished/followed up on by the ministry in wizarding homes - how would they know who cast the spell?) which definitely seems to suggest it's basically just a circle around them that 'pings' the ministry whenever magic is done inside it.

** OOCs where canon characters are made into "cinnamon rolls [sic]" or into BDSM practitioners are a definite turn off.

Or if they clearly haven't read the books and are getting basics wrong; I read one recently where Hogwarts had a matron!

** I've got so many, but the one that truly irks me is language that doesn't fit.

The books are set in Britain. So many non-British words being used. I've read countless fics that were on the verge of being good, if only they had somebody who knew British English look at it. For instance, the fic I'm currently reading has Fred and George referring to themselves as "bro" and it's just wrong.

On the other hand, they go the opposite way. Everybody is referring to people as "bruv" and say "innit" or generally talking like they all grew up in East London.
