What are the worst fanon nicknames you've read? I hate when sirius calls minerva "Minnie". Once Harry kept calling sirius "Siri". I generally don't mind "Mione" but I've seen hermione's dad call her "Mia"(???) In mauraders era I've seen "Remy" or (*Shivers*) Jimmy. I've also seen "Lils" or "Tiger Lily" (Tiger Lily isn't that bad though) On the flipside I hate when they give harry a full name like harold. Like, they establish the fact that harry is just his full name. For some reason when they call fred "Freddie" It makes me cringe. Are there any other fanon names that make you cringe?


** "Prongslet/Pup" is going to win this thread, hands down.

*** I'm not really sure what's worse: that they're using those names or that Harry is /allowing them to/. Like, what fourteen or whatever year old boy would tolerate that shit? Speaking of - is there a fic somewhere that has Harry just loose his shit over those stupid nicknames? Because I'd read the hell out of that.

Also: dogfather. It was cute coming from a five year old Harry, but that is the one and only time I found that word acceptable.

  “C'mon Prongslet, I'll show you your room!”

  “...What?”

  “Your room is upstairs, let me show you where you're staying at headquarters.”

  “No... what the /hell/ did you just call me?”

  “Oh, Prongslet? You've had that nickname forever.”

  “Do I look like deer?”

  “Huh?”

  “Am I still wearing nappies?”

  “Pup...”

  “I'm not a fucking dog either.”

  “But...”

  “No. My name is Harry. Not pup, not prongslet. I'm a human teenager, not a deer or a dog.”

  “But cub...”

  Harry whirled on Remus. “I'm also not a bloody werewolf!”

  “But you're part of our pack...”

  “You've got to be fucking kidding me,” Harry sneers. “Your pack? Like hell I am.”

  “You are. Your father and Sirius... my wolf considered them pack.”

  “But not me, obviously, so politely fuck off with the cutesy pet names. You haven't earned the right.”

  “Of course you are,” Remus insisted, taken aback. “You're Prongs' son, and that makes you pack.”

  “Of course I am. That's why I just found out that you knew my parents few months ago, right?”

  “But Albus...”

  “Pack is so important to you that you'd leave me with people who hated me, hated my parents, hated you, and hated Sirius.”

  “But...”

  “Who lied to me, who starved me, who treated me like garbage. You'd met them before- could you honestly tell me that you thought they'd do right by me? By James? By Lily?”

  “I'm a werewolf, it isn't that simple.”

  “Maybe not, but that's one day every 28. Why weren't you around the other twenty-seven days? Hell, I would've taken /yearly/ visits. Anything!”

  He stared Sirius and Remus down for a minute, then snorted. “My name is Harry,” he said again, before stomping up the stairs.

  “By the way, a baby wolf is called a pup and a baby deer is a fawn,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. Turning, she followed her friend up the stairs of Grimmauld Place, muttering to herself. “Cub. Prongslet. /Honestly/!”

*** They certainly get overused, but since Voldemort literally made me afraid of his name, I can see the humour in turning the boogeymans name into something juvenile. Dumbles, for me, is only acceptable if someone were to use it as an affectionate nickname, like old Chips (his name was Mr Chipping, but everyone called him Mr Chips, in an affectionate way).

** I actually don't mind Sirius calling Harry "pup" from time to time, but fanfics tend to overdo it so it can quickly become annoying (maybe Sirius just wants to emabarass his 14yo godson, and what better way than to give him ridicolous nicknames?). Prongslet is frankly baffling tho.

Also, I can see McGonagall as "Minnie", but only for her parents and siblings. Maybe her late husband too.

I don't mind Jim/Lils/Tuney/Sev unless overused. Hell, I don't even mind "Remy" as a teasing/joking nickname.

Speaking of Harry, I don't see how Harry could be a diminutive for Hadrian because they are two entirely different names. It would make more sense to have him be a Henry and going by Harry but I guess that Lord Henry-Potter-Peverell-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Le Fay doesn't sound as haughty as Lord Hadrian etcetera.

Nicknames I absolutely hate: DRAY for Draco. Or worse, DRAGON. Also, Moldyshorts, Dumbles etc.

** I don't actually mind Jim too much as it is a very British nickname for James and was massively common during the 60s and 70s, and seems to be having a come back. I think it's clear from canon none of his friends called him that, but his family may well have done. I much prefer it to Jamie which is achingly modern/American for the era. Similarly for Lils, it is genuinely what people end up calling people called Lily, in my experience, and as she was someone who called Petunia 'Tuney' and Severus 'Sev' I think she might have liked to have been called that herself.

I think the line for me is if the feel real - as in a nickname that could come about organically in the time and location the fic is set - or if they feel like something a dorky teenager has invented to sound cute. Prongslet, cub, pup, etc are all vomit worthy for me, Minerva would never entertain Minnie (and quite honestly I think Sirius and James etc were too cool to even try it because it would have 100% fallen flat), Siri sounds too modern, and poor Ginny is lumped with all sorts of atrocities despite already going by a nickname. Then you have characters like Hermione and Remus that just clearly go by their full names - idk why authors feel the need to change that. Plenty of people don't have nicknames and prefer to go by their full name and that's ok - I guess sometimes people see it as a shortcut to showing a close relationship.

** The only person in in fanon who can use “dogfather” is Snape as an insult, but no one else imo.

I hate “Minnie” so much because I immediately imagine McGonagall with mouse ears when I read it.

“Siri” is just awful. It sounds like something that fangirls who want to have sex with him would say. “Remy” I don't mind as much if it's used in jest.

I don't mind “Prongslet” if Harry's small, but “Prongsie”? Just no. “Pup” and “cub” are fine.

But honestly, I think that the one I hate the most is “Lily-flower” hands down. It's so cliché. I read a Severitus story where Snape calls Lily “Lily-flower” but it sounds like something James would call her. I honestly really REALLY hate “Lily-flower.” It's too much cringe for me. Just too much.

***** I disagree but I think I understand where you're coming from. I do get a kick out of folks that state that it makes Harry sound like a kid when he uses such childish names as insults. Newsflash harry is a kid so I would expect that level of childness in the insults he uses.

** Hermy or Herms is probably the worst nickname for Hermione. I think the best is simply Mi ("My"). Mione isn't bad but you have to decide how it is pronounced. If Hermione is pronounced as "Her-my-Oh-knee" then Mione can be either "My-Oh-knee" or truly contract it and go with "Mine". Since I like the Harry/Hermione ship I'm more partial to "My" or "Mine".

"Siri" for Sirius is a little dumb as he already has a nickname of "Padfoot" or I"ve seen "Pads" for the one syllable name.

*** I always thought it was pronounced "Her-MOY-knee" - yes, I know what it says in the books, but I'm going by how my uncle from Manchester pronounced it. Because hey - I'm Canadian, what the fuck do I know? It's been years, and I'm set in my ways. So 'Moine is just MOY-knee. (And moy rhymes with oi, as in 'Oi! You lot!')

** Siri upsets me for some reason.

I like Minnie because I like the idea that she'd have a childhood nickname that she has been trying to eradicate from her life for years.

Tom Riddle Jr. has to endure every stupid, childish insult nickname because he goes by his anagram pseudonym that he made when he was 16.

Jim is.....no because I know a terrible Jim and sometimes that just ruins things on its own.

** I honestly don't see a problem with nicknames, so long as they aren't overused. I also don't see teenage boys using them very often unless it's a pet name for a girlfriend or they're mocking their friends. Now, teenage girls... That's another case.

** Please Mia is a godsend to people calling Hermione ‘Herm'. “You're the best, Herm!” Like no. Please just no no no no. It makes me think of hermit or Herman or just a really old man or a name for an animal. It's /awful/ and I'll admit I actually stopped reading one book because of it. I just couldn't choke through it anymore. Most nicknames/pet names don't bother me, and I can usually brush them off or find them cute, but Herm is quickly approaching the “I can't read this book because of ___ issue” which literally exists for ridiculous insane OOC books (and I don't mean crack either as everyone could use that in their life, but I mean really bad OOC) and books in first person that never capitalize “I” because that just drives me mad.

** Never really liked Prongslet/Pup/Cub for Harry. It just always sounded weird to me. Especially when the fic has Harry happy to have those names used. He's 13/14 by the time he really gets to meet Sirius and Remus, I can't imagine any early teen liking their childhood/baby nicknames. They're usually trying to ‘grow up/be mature' because they're teenagers now and reject their baby things. Maybe he'd like it for the novelty since he knows basically nothing about his time before Voldemort. But after that he's probably be really embarrassed by it.

I don't really like Hermione with any nickname. ‘Mione for Hermione is weird, but I generally overlook it if it's not overused. Mia just makes no sense at all. And Herms sounds like the name of Percy's owl (Hermes) so I doubt anyone, especially from the Weasley family, would call her that.

For the Weasleys I feel like nicknames work best within the family (mainly used by Mrs Weasley) or for teasing occasionally. A lot of their names are already nicknames or shortened forms of longer names.

Ronnie/Ronnikins is alright if it's the twins taking the piss out on him. Maybe from Harry, Hermione, or Ginny too if they wanna tease him. Same for Won-Won, its okay if it's Lavender or someone teasing him about Lavender.

Ginny is already a nickname for Ginevra, why give her another one? Gin is an alcohol and Gin-Gin is hardly any better.

Freddie and Georgie are tolerable. Perc is okay, but I doubt he'd allow people to call him anything but Percy. Char for Charlie or Will/Willy for Bill, just no.

Drake/Drakey for Draco is really cringe, so I only can see someone like Pansy using it as some form of endearment. Kind of like Lavender and Won-Won. Or similar for Ron, someone trying to tease Draco by embarrassing him. I find Dray a little more tolerable, but just barely. It feels like a more “refined” version of Drake. But still only for teasing purposes.

I've also seen Nev for Neville which I find alright. But Pans for Pansy, Daph for Daphne, Tracy for Tracey feels really awkwardly. With the way fandom portrays these three, I doubt these “high class purebloods” would accept these butchering of their names.

Lils/Sev/Siri/Reggie/Reg I don't mind either if it's occasional, but I've never heard of Remy before in a fic. And Minnie is just weird being used by anyone that is younger than her.

Generally to me, any nickname is tolerable if used sparingly. Or used by certain people. But if it becomes their new name or is overly used it becomes annoying.
