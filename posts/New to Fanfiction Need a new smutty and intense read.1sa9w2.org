So I read my first ever fanfiction piece the other day, Silencio. It was wonderfully intense, smutty and even romantic and heartbreaking. I tried to find another fanfic to read, but I became so overwhelmed on how many are out there.

Does anyone recommend any fanfics? I enjoyed the Draco-Hermione pairing, because it was completely unexpected to me, but I'm open to other character pairings as well. I also like the Hogwarts theme (but keep it smutty... guilty pleasure of mine)

Thanks! (Links and website names would be great too, cause I'm not sure I'd be able to sort through the millions that are out there)


** If you like unexpected pairings, I would suggest giving Severus/Hermione a try! They are my absolute favorite pairing, and I'm actually getting ready to dive into some Draco/Hermione this weekend. The best site for Snape/Hermione is [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/]]. This site is fantastic for great quality fanfic. I know some people are uncomfortable with teacher/student pairings, and if you are let me know. I'm linking a mix of stories for you! The smutteir the better! =D

[[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=9160]] This is Weekend With the Professor. Hermione Granger is a professor at Hogwarts and is forced to spend the day chaperoning a Hogsmeade Weekend with GASP! Professor Snape! But things go much better than expected!

[[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=26761]] This is Transcendent Quality of Rememberance and it is a story that involves Hermione married to Snape as a student. They are in hiding during the war with the rest of the Order, and is told with a series of flashbacks to their wedding night. Lots of sexy times, and a very well written story.

[[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=16930]] This is Care of Magical Creatures and it is one of my absolute favorite stories, and I re-read all the time. This is a Marriage Law fic, so Hermione is forced into marriage with Snape during the war. Long and a bit different, but soooo good.

I think this is a good mix so far, and I have a long list to recommend if you'd like more! Happy reading!

** You're not going to find a whole lot of really good smut on fanfiction.net, so I'd second another poster's recommendations of [[http://www.restrictedsection.org][The Restricted Section]] and [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][HP Fanfic Archive]]. I'd also add [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/main.php?cat=3][Adult Fanfiction]], but the overall quality on that site tends to be pretty poor so you'll have to wade through a lot of crap. I've never been much into Hermione/Draco, but a good friend of mine used to be obsessed with it and I remember her loving pretty much anything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1353450/][AkashaTheKitty]]. That's a link to her profile on ff.net, since I couldn't find it on adultfanfiction, but I would recommend trying to find her works on other sites since you can't have NC17 on ff.net so it will be milder.

There's also [[http://archiveofourown.org/][Archive of Our Own]], but that site tends to have much more slash than het and I don't know if that's your cup of tea.

*** Akashathekitty posts all of her fics (of which many are smutty and heart-wrenching) on Hawthorne and Vine, Granger Enchanted, her Livejournal, and I think Archive of Our Own. The first three have all of her stories uploaded, whereas Archive of Our Own may not, and I know for sure Fnet is missing her more recent stories

** It's been a while since I looked at it but I remember really enjoying Necessary by the Order. It is Hermione/Sirius, its a marriage law fix, but from what I remember an especially good one. It was on ff.

**** There are tons of great marriage law fics on GE- there is actually a category just for them! They make for very interesting stories.

** /That Need/ on The Quidditch Pitch

My fave smutty fic ever. Pairings: Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Hermione/Ginny, Harry/Ron, and 3-ways and 4-ways of all four characters.

[[http://thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=3776&index=1]]

Edit:

Here is another one. Not complete, but smutty and intense. Post DH Canon, but some scenes are Hogwarts.

Turned to Real Life. Ron/Hermione.

** The Fallout, by everythursday. Really long. Intense. Smutty. War fic. Dramione. (Also, check my most recent post history for some other Dramione recs) it's on Hawthorne and Vine and Granger Enchanted. The first is a Dramione site and the second is a Hermione-centric site. Both are pretty good places to look for more fics of all kinds in this pairing.

(If you are okay with WIP, akashathekitty has written the first five chapters of Silencio's sequel called Secrets. She hasn't updated in AGES, and those five chapters are tantalizingly good).

*** Oh these sound amazing! And I read Secrets as soon as I was done with Silencio, but I was so sad when I realized it was completed... It was fantastic, so fingers crossed for a couple new chapters (it was just starting to get intense!)

** Well...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It Could Only Happen to Harry]] is an interesting one, though the plot is...somewhat cheesy.

Harry gets it on with a few characters.

** If you really want to explore a lot of pairings at once, Including Draco/Hermione, I really enjoyed Eros and Psyche, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6200937/1/Eros-Psyche]]. It's about a number of Slytherin and Gryffendors getting together on the last night of their 7th year playing a really intense, magic card game. It follows each of the 6 pairs through the evening and I find it very well written.

Be warned it's over 340,000 words right now and still going! I also really enjoy this author, they do a lot of suggestions and overall have one of my favorite writing styles that I've come across.

** I recommend Granger Enchanted for some really amazing stories- dark, intense, sexy... whatever you want. The stories are also conveniently categorized by pairing.

I would suggest Severus/Hermione, Lucius/Hermione and Sirius/Hermione. There are a couple amazing Fenrir/Hermione fics too- but they are pretty dark.

Every fic on GE has a great summary, warnings, and other info clearly displayed, so you don't have to worry about running into something that squicks you. GE is also heavily beta'd so you're all but guaranteed quality. Every single story that gets submitted is looked over by one of the admin, so no crud is getting through!
