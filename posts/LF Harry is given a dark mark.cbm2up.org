** I've got two, one of which can't be reached by the bot, and I'm on mobile so I'll just tell you title, author and site.

The first is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Curse of V'Ardian) which is ancient, but which does involve Harry ending up with a Dark Mark quite unwillingly. The fic was well written for 15 years ago, so it has some age issues now.

The second is titled /Normalcy/ by notadryeye on SIYE. It's not really new either, but it has some of the more creative Horcruxes I've seen and there is a sizable arc concerning Harry unwillingly serving Voldemort. Like everything on SIYE, it is H/G so consider yourself warned. I will also mention that it is quite heavy on angst and angsty romance.

Anyways, cheers

  Harry becomes a vampire and in doing so sets out on the path to fulfilling a second prophecy that carries far darker consequences than the first. Secrets, lies and changing alliances force Harry to trust those he never wanted to. Snape backstory. HarryOC.

** I remember a time travel one in which Harry travelled back from a terrible future in which he was marked unwillingly and where while he was weak Voldemort threw the imperius at him a dozen times until Harry killed Ginny. He came back just after his first year. He tried to lie to everyone and keep his secrets, but Snape found out about his dark mark and demanded answers (Luckily he did not tell Dumbledore). Sadly, he was rubbish at telling lies - even an idiot could figure out whether he lied or not. He developed a distrusting relationship with Dumbledore.

There was also one named No Escape by Quillbreaker in which I think this happened too. It is /really/ strong, and although the writing is good, I didn't like it because it was way too strong with the amount of creepiness and darkness. Other people may handle it but I did not. Imagine undiluted fruit squash - that was how it was like for me.

** You might enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/][Turning of the Times]]. It's a time travel fic with Harry ending up in the Marauders era at Hogwarts. Harry tries to stick to a policy of neutrality to avoid changing the future (and thus getting stuck in the past), but things don't work out so well for him. linkao3(10413771)

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.

** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?)

When Lily said that she'd do anything to save Harry's life, Voldemort recruited her and had her raise Harry loyal to him. He doesn't have a mark yet, but Lily gets hers pretty quickly.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)
