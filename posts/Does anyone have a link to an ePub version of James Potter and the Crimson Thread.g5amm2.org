** There is plenty on [[https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffcm&q=James+Potter+and+the+Crimson+Thread&ia=web][your search engine]], when you just throw there the name. There is [[https://archive.org/details/206aJamesPotterAndTheCrimsonThread2G][audioversion]], and [[https://bookfrom.net/g-norman-lippert/56076-james_potter_and_the_crimson_thread.html]] and others.
