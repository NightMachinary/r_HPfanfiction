Edit: Something similar (Tom Riddle in the future) has been done a few times, but I want something that focuses on Tom's reaction when he meets someone who is getting pretty much everything that Tom wants but completely hates it.


** dam i was hoping this wasn't just a prompt but actually a request or a searching for post! this is an epic idea here. id love to read any actual fics about tom riddle going to the future and seeing how it all ended for him! maybe makes him reconsider, or at least try a more subtle redo approach to it. like more hitlery politiciany style of takeover.
