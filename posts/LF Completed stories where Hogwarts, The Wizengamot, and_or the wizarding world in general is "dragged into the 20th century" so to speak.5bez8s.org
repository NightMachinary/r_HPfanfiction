Better teachers/classes, less discrimination, modern conveniences, that kind of thing.


** I think people used to fanon have got used to an idea of a wizarding world "stuck in the past" which just isn't supported by the books. It's one of my pet peeves. Some illustrative examples:

- Contrary to the idea that wizards know nothing about the universe, they have for sale to regular consumers a working real time model of the Milky Way galaxy. We know it's an accurate model not just an ornament because it is noted that it could be used to complete Astronomy work. Such a model of the galaxy is far beyond anything the Muggles currently have.

- Contrary to the idea that wizards are sexually conservative or prudish, the changing rooms in the Quidditch stadium are unisex. We see in PS that the male and female members of the team change in the same room. We also know from PoA that they include showers. We also see that wizarding dating culture is largely the same as Muggle dating culture.

- Contrary to the idea that discrimination is rampant in wizarding Britain, a Muggleborn Minister for Magic was elected in 1962. We also see in CoS that the reaction to Malfoy saying "mudblood" is comparable to the reaction you might see in the Muggle world to someone saying "nigger". "Bloodism" in the magical world is about as prevalent as racism is in the real world: certainly present, but apparently not accepted within polite society and rejected by a majority. The difference is of course Voldemort: in the magical world, the leader of the KKK has nukes.

- As for conveniences, wizards have instantaneous transportation, more reliable mail than the Muggle world, instantaneous audio-visual communication.

- With regard to constitutional matters, it's worth noting that Muggle Britain does not have strict separation of powers, has an executive branch that is essentially capable of doing anything it wants (because the executive branch by definition has a majority in the legislature, and the legislature has no constitutional limits on the laws it can pass), and has twice permitted indefinite detention without trial of terrorist suspects in the last 50 years. So while wizarding Britain is certainly flawed, it is no more so than its Muggle counterpart. It's hard to say anything more on this matter because we lack information about the constitution of magical Britain.

Ultimately, all that you really have to create the impression that wizards are stuck in the past are the fact that they wear robes. But actually robes were never worn in the Muggle world as everyday wear. They're not old fashioned, they're just different.

*** Despite these examples, I think it's fair to say that JK Rowling included many example of "old" things in wizarding culture to give it a sense of charm. And there's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't mean the culture is "stuck in the past," merely that they've picked up various muggle things along the way and kept them because it makes wizarding culture more interesting.

The best example I can think of is the currency system with knuts, sickles, and galleons being similar to pence, shillings, and pounds. Rowling even wrote on [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/measurements][Pottermore]] that, "I do find the old system much more picturesque, much quirkier, and therefore more appropriate to the kind of society I was describing."

Another example is the wizarding wireless, and how there's no wizarding equivalent to television. Rowling also wrote about [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/technology][this on Pottermore]]. My favorite part is where she says muggles will sometimes pick up wizarding wireless channels, but it's not as big of a risk to the statute of secrecy because, "the radio-listening Muggle population seems altogether more tolerant, gullible, or less convinced of their own good sense, than Muggle TV viewers."

Owl post is not the equivalent of email, it is the equivalent of mail. And on that front the wizarding version is definitely superior, as it can find the recipient directly.

The wizarding equivalent of email would be, I suppose, floo.

Of course, the existence of teleportation kinda undermines all these comparisons. Communication mediums act as a proxy for being able to talk with and interact with a person face to face. Really, wizards have no need for communication media at all.

***** The wizarding world not having an understand of muggle technology is actually a huge threat to the Statute of Secrecy. It might not have been as necessary in the eighties or even the nineties, but in 2016 a large majority of 'muggles' carry phones with video capabilities in their pockets. All it would take is one viral video of magic being performed for the wizarding world to be exposed. Not needing technology and not understanding its capabilities are two totally different things.

And floo is not an equivalent to email, it's maybe a payphone. And considering the floo is regulated and monitored by the ministry it's not exactly private. And apparation requires training, licensing, and adulthood. The maurader's mirrors are the closest thing to personal phones we see and they aren't widespread. And to suggest that wizards don't need communication capabilities because they can apparate is absolutely ludicrous. Sure people use phones/email to communicate with people over far distances, but they also use phones (and more than ever, text messages) to schedule visits, to send reminders and to clarify needs.

**** This is a rather baffling argument. Knowledge of Muggle science is not a requirement for wizarding modernity/level of advancement. The question to be answered there is "To what extent do wizards understand the world around them?" And the answer to that is that they understand it quite well. And they certainly understand it more than Muggles, who don't even know that magic exists.

Wizards don't need to know the Muggle description of nature to count as advanced if they have their own description of nature which has greater explanatory power.

There's nothing "advanced" about knowing Muggle physics in a world where Muggle physics is a fundamentally incorrect description of the nature of the universe. It's a body of knowledge which is rendered defunct by the existence of magic. Saying wizards have to know Muggle physics to count as advanced would be like saying in real life that physicists have to understand phlogiston to count as advanced.

More fundamentally, the entire scientific-modernist world view is false. This is a dualist world where souls and other non-physical substance exists. It is a world where human language interacts with and determines the behaviour of nature: beetles can be turned easily into buttons because the words are similar. It's a world where all concepts and ideas are real existing things that can be interacted with: you can cast spells on names, job positions, and other items of abstract information like secrets. It's a world where the line between the subjective and objective breaks down: the human idea of food, which is subjective, forms part of an objective rule of the universe.

  I would go so far as to say that wizards likely have a different understanding of "electricity" to Muggles.

  It's like in transfiguration: wizards almost certainly have a theory (or theories) about the nature of substance and composition, but at the same time it is unlikely to be a theory that looks anything like Muggle chemistry with its system of elements as represented by the periodic table. The magical theory of composition is likely based in alchemy and in turn the theory of the world as composed of 4 elements.

  And here's the thing: given that alchemy and transfiguration work, the wizards are right. That is the way the world works. And yet how is it that Muggle technology based on the theory of elements works as well?

  I think that the nature of the universe in HP has to be pluralistic. Scientific pluralism is the idea that there isn't really any single "true" way the universe works. Rather there are multiple ways you can describe the universe, and those ways each describe the universe accurately and yet are fundamentally incompatible with each other. Muggle science accurately describes the universe, except for the existence of magic. Wizarding magical theory also accurately describes the universe, including the existence of magic. Neither are "true", they're all just descriptions.

  That said, given that magical nature supersedes non-magical nature, personally I would prefer to have the wizards' understanding to the Muggle one.
#+end_quote

Essentially, wizards and Muggles each have their own descriptions of the universe. The level of wizarding advancement should not be judged relative to their knowledge of the Muggle description of the universe, because the Muggle one isn't true, it's just empirically adequate for the limited phenomena that Muggles are in contact with. Electricity isn't a fundamental part of the fabric of the universe, it's a description of certain phenomena for which wizards will have their own descriptions which are incompatible with the Muggle ones and take into account magic.

Also, wizards do question things. Magic is developing all the time. They have academic journals, they have a government department devoted to the study of magic, they have huge libraries full of works attempting to describe and explain magic.

Assume you read a fanfiction where a character said that. What would you think of that character. All I did was take what you said and swap out some of your terms with wizardly ones.

Your reality may not be their reality. Remember this is a work of fiction, and the rules of the "real world" do not apply. I think that if magic were discovered to be real, a lot of our scientific discoveries would be completely invalidated and have to be researched from the ground up. Magic has the ability to completely disregard time and space, something that physics tells us is all but impossible.

Firstly, to address that, she's a smart 13 year old (I doubt other 13 year old Muggleborns would have figured it out), and operating with more information than the adults have. None of the adults were told Harry could hear voices in the walls, to my knowledge. They might have been perfectly rational operating under the assumption the monster is some other magical creature. It takes a Parselmouth to narrow down the clues. Did they even know it was moving through the walls ?

Secondly, we know there is active research happening in Magical Society: The Department of Mysteries studies fundamental questions about the universe, like time, death, love, etc. The only bit that seems backwards in this society is the lack of electricity-based technology, which is useless to wizards since it doesn't work in magical environments.

From what I remember this is only told to us from Harry's perspective, and I didn't really have any reason to think he'd know that for sure.

He's not particularly great at Astronomy nor does he demonstrate a special interest in it. So I wouldn't trust his knowledge of the usefulness and application of that tool.

  Contrary to the idea that wizards are sexually conservative or prudish, the changing rooms in the Quidditch stadium are unisex. We see in PS that the male and female members of the team change in the same room. We also know from PoA that they include showers. We also see that wizarding dating culture is largely the same as Muggle dating culture.

This is true, but then you also have the dorms set up such that boys can't go into the women's side and women can go to the men's. Seems strange considering that the changing rooms are unisex.

  Contrary to the idea that discrimination is rampant in wizarding Britain, a Muggleborn Minister for Magic was elected in 1962. We also see in CoS that the reaction to Malfoy saying "mudblood" is comparable to the reaction you might see in the Muggle world to someone saying "nigger". "Bloodism" in the magical world is about as prevalent as racism is in the real world: certainly present, but apparently not accepted within polite society and rejected by a majority. The difference is of course Voldemort: in the magical world, the leader of the KKK has nukes.
#+end_quote

This one is convincing enough. Only reason I might hesitate is because if Wizards can realistically be described as just as advanced a society as muggle society, I find it incredibly bizarre that they have an issue with blood purity at all. Racism, in so far as I've experienced it, is nowadays formed around non-genetic influences. People looking down on others cultures as inferior, but generally no longer as much about others being genetically inferior. And that's in part due to our better understanding of genetics in general and how educated everyone is.

  As for conveniences, wizards have instantaneous transportation, more reliable mail than the Muggle world, instantaneous audio-visual communication.
#+end_quote

Instantaneous transport? Yep. More reliable mail? I'm assuming you're comparing owl mail to normal mail, in which case yep. Instananeous audio-visual communication? I have to disagree.

I'm assuming you're mainly talking about floo here. Floo is still kind of limited by the need for a fireplace. It doesn't compare to the ease of use that having Skype on a phone with 4G has.

  With regard to constitutional matters, it's worth noting that Muggle Britain does not have strict separation of powers, has an executive branch that is essentially capable of doing anything it wants (because the executive branch by definition has a majority in the legislature, and the legislature has no constitutional limits on the laws it can pass), and has twice permitted indefinite detention without trial of terrorist suspects in the last 50 years. So while wizarding Britain is certainly flawed, it is no more so than its Muggle counterpart. It's hard to say anything more on this matter because we lack information about the constitution of magical Britain.
#+end_quote

I know very little about government and I think I agree with what you're saying for this one.

To be fair that's probably one of the kinder and more reasonable things Draco has said on the matter, and that was in the first book which was very much a children's book.

#+end_quote

Yeah, and correct me if I'm wrong (Can't remember if this is fanon or not), genetics don't in any way affect someone's aptitude for magic which is something implied by the blood purists. Hermione is great at magic despite being a muggleborn, and Crabbe and Goyle are quite poor.

So yes genetics plays a role in whether or not you have magic to being with, but how good you are with it isn't affected. And that's what purebloods seem to imply.

#+begin_quote

Fair enough. I don't honestly think much would've changed even in modern day, but I can't prove it so it's a moot point.

  Better teachers/classes, less discrimination, modern conveniences, that kind of thing.
#+end_quote

Less discrimination: There is considerably less discrimination in the Magical world than in the Muggle world. While blood status, speciesism, and to a lesser extent classism exist, there is no evidence of sexism, racism, or discrimination based on sexual orientation. The muggle world is far less tolerant.

Modern conveniences: Wizards have a demonstrably better standard of living than muggles. Longer lifespans, no scarcity of resources (the poorest family we know of in canon isn't that bad off compared to most British muggles). The only conveniences we would miss are electricity-based, which malfunction in magical environments.

Better teachers/classes: granted, Hogwarts has a bit of an issue here, but that's because of all of the adventure plot. And I'm not sure what you would bring into the culture from muggles to help improve teaching standards. Do you have any examples for this point ?
