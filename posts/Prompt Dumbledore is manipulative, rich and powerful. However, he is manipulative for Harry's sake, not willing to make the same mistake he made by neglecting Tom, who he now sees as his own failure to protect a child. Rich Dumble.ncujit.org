Basically, after finding out the Dursleys neglected Harry, he could go "Harry, my dear boy! How about I buy you a mansion and take some of Petunia's blood to blood-adopt, let's say, Ron? Then the Weasley can move in and you get a loving family without the Blood Wards falling! Obviously, they will also be richly compensated with ‘alimony,' so to say, so they can afford to take care of everyone properly!" /Wink wink/ And buys Harry an entire luxury wardrobe, both muggle and wizard. He does it with the help of a fashionable wizard so it doesn't exactly mirror his own colourful robes, since that would stand out too much.

He could also hire free House Elves to clean the mansion so Molly could focus more on family, and Harry, who is Dumbledore's main priority.

Dumbledore could also lie about the destruction of the stone and secretly feed Harry not loyalty and compulsion potions, but the Elixir of Life.

Thus Harry looks way healthier and also gets an eye-correcting potion made by Snape that needed the Elixir as an ingredient so he doesn't need glasses anymore.

Dumbledore also ensures Snape cannot help but fall in platonic love with the child right from the first year, thus making Snape /also/ dote on Harry like that one sarcastic, introverted uncle.

He secretly makes people tutor Harry to be brilliant at everything, and since Snape also adores Harry, he is way more helpful at Occlumency right from the first year.

Snape also uses the Elixir of Life and a few drops Phoenix Blood (willingly donated by Fawkes) to develop a potion to make Harry immune to Basilisk Gaze once Dumbledore catches on in his second years.

When it turns out Sirius is innocent, Dumbledore /instantly/ goes "Let's get him a trial! And then a nice stay at St. Mungo's with the best mind healers - it will do Harry good to have someone to talk to about his family!

He also makes Snake use the Elixir of Life to make Lupin permanently a healthy werewolf in control of his transformation.

When Harry is in danger because Goblet of Fiyah, he asks calmly like in the book instantly Believes Harry and makes sure Harry is perfectly prepared for each task through subtle manipulation of everyone around, tho Harry still more or less wings the Dragon and just flies.

Ron, who at this point loved with Harry for 3 years and is much more well-off with his entire family, knows Harry well enough to believe him from the start as well.

And so it continues for the rest of the years, so Harry either easily defeats Voldemort with more than just lick, or he even saves Voldemort, restores his Soul and Sanity with Elixir of Life (yes, I love the Elixir of Life too much) and still keeping Parseltongue because of the basilisk potion reacting to the Horcrux and extracting the power.

Voldemort would still have it then because the rest of his Soul didn't lose it.

So, please, show me a rich, powerful, manipulative Dumbledore who, instead of forging Harry into a mindless weapon, actively manipulates the others in order to give Harry the very /best,/ as he knows Harry /deserves./


** I've posted this piece a few times here, but that's what my "good manipulative" Dumbledore would do:

Three years after Voldemort's defeat in Halloween 1981, Dumbledore decided that the Ministry couldn't be trusted to carry out justice against Death Eaters and dismantle Voldemort's sadistic genocidal terrorist network.

As the first step, he riled up Augusta Longbottom and together they confiscated the Lestrange vault, as the Longbottoms found ample sympathy among the public and in the Wizengamot. In addition to gold, Dumbledore also obtained the Cup, and could start the Horcrux Hunt 10 years earlier.

Next, Dumbledore managed to search the Malfoy Manor before Lucius got the dope, since Lucius Malfoy didn't have the time to corrupt nearly as many in the Ministry as in canon. Lucius was found guilty of possessing many dark artifacts, including the forbidden Death Eater regalia, and received 20 years in Azkaban. Most of Malfoy fortune ended in Dumbledore's and Minister Bagnold's coffers. Dumbledore further obtained the Diary.

Now that two Death Eaters turned out to have extremely valuable artifacts from Voldemort, maybe it made sense to investigate and confiscate more? The Ministry could use more gold, Minister Bagnold could use more gold, the Weasleys could certainly use more gold, and Remus could definitely use more gold to hire some werewolves, and send the pack after Greyback? *Converting vital enemy war materials to your own is after all a fundamental war objective*.

So, which rich Death Eaters next? The Blacks of course! They had to pay for the hideous betrayal of the Potters. Yes, this Sirius Black had to be thoroughly interrogated, with a combination of Veritaserum, Legilimency, and some secret DoM means. What?! He was innocent? Well, then the Ministry should officially grant him the head of the house, and Sirius Black would in turn let us search the Black residence and ‘donate' some gold for the Greater Good. What?! His brother Regulus also defected and gave up his life to get one of Voldemort's artifacts? How many of those things did Voldemort make? Time to knock up on Horace Slughorn.

“Ah dear Horace, we already got three. He talked to you about this, didn't he? So how many more? You don't remember? Maybe we shall take you for a visit to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure they can help you remember. Good, I'm glad you found your courage, Horace. You will be greatly honored once this is all over.”

“Yes Millicent, I've obtained irrefutable proof that he cheated the death by using Horcruxes. The Head Unspeakable can verify that. Yes, he could have made three more. So far, two of the objects are Hogwarts founder artifacts, one his personal item, so you can see a pattern here. All of them were obtained by searching Death Eater estates and vaults. Therefore We should first fully investigate every imprisoned Death Eater, to find more leads to his Horcruxes, to identify potential falsely imprisoned ones like Sirius Black, to uncover more potential crimes, to better understand Voldemort's organization, to allow arrests of more escaped Death Eaters, and to seize more of their assets to pay their victims. No, I'm opposed to Dementor's Kiss. Those convicted of murder should be sentenced through the Veil. Even if Voldemort regains his body one day, he will find his supporters and their gold gone.”

“The Wizengamot thereby has sentenced Gaius Avery, Amycus Carrow, Alecto Carrow, Walden MacNair, Adolphus Travers, Markus Selwyn, and Corban Yaxley to death through the Veil for mass murders, mass tortures, multiple counts of rapes, conspiracy to overthrow the Ministry, reckless endangerment of the Statute of Secrecy, and high treason. The Wizengamot has further judged, given the heinous nature of their atrocities and crimes, that ALL their assets, including gold, properties, businesses, among others, shall be seized and their victims be compensated.”

/Jews don't try and learn about our culture and integrate, so if we're racist it's their own fault!/

****** I cringe out of my fucking mind whenever I see those kinds of fics, especially with the intense politicking that tends to go on.

It's always some fucking eleven year old Draco talking about intricate magical bullshit and how the Wizarding SS was completely and utterly justified in doing insane shit.

If you want to write a story where the Death Eaters are the good guys (or at least the less bad guys), you have to do something completely and utterly AU which involves way too much work for half the people who say "I want to make a Pureblood fic."

I understand most people who write this shit just have a hardon for the Bronte sisters or Jane Austen novels, because 90% of the time that's the sort of tone with which it's written, but /holy shit/ try to cut down on the Nazi vibes.

** When Albus Dumbledore was younger, he chafed at the burden of caring for Ariana. The thought of possessing the Resurrection Stone, second of the Deathly Hallows, enthralled him, not for any power or knowledge, but for the idea that his parents could return and take responsibility off his shoulders again.\\
 \\
Perhaps, this trait, this hatred for being saddled with unwanted liabilities, stayed with Dumbledore. Whether it was poverty, or lack of education, or political repression that prevented people from following their dreams, he hated it.\\
Battling against Grindelwald, becoming Headmaster of Hogwarts, befriending Nicolas Flamel in hopes of learning the Philosopher's Stone's secrets, battling against the Death Eaters...all that prestige, power and wealth, all went to satiating his innermost need, to be free, to be able to do what he wanted without any constraints but those he chose for himself.\\
 \\
It's not just Harry; this Dumbledore uses his position at Hogwarts the way it's meant to be used, pushing the school's budget to its limit to ensure every student in his care has the knowledge they need to do what they want, offering grants or the assistance of house-elves to ensure nothing interrupts their education or stops them doing what they want after Hogwarts.\\
Harry, though, was a bit of a special case; when Dumbledore finds out that the Dursleys, paid well to care for Harry, have instead taken the opportunity to neglect him...well, after many, many, jinxes, some never intended to be seen in public, Dumbledore removed Harry from the Dursleys, blood wards or not, and after caring for him for a few months, reached an agreement with the Weasleys to adopt the Boy-Who-Lived.\\
 \\
Something something, Dumbledore's motivation is basically 'I want to see what people do when they can do anything'. Or something like that.

Come to think of it, perhaps that's why Dumbledore has Fawkes' loyalty. Not just because he's good intentioned, but because he works to give people freedom to do what they want, rather than trying to shape the world to his ideals. Free as a bird, or in this case free as a phoenix.
