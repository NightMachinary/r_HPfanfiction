/Spoilers for the fanfic I'm looking for/

Basically right after Harry's name comes out of the GOF he's in the library meets Hermione (they aren't friends up until now) and she's one of the few to believe him. And she's a Ravenclaw I think. She had a leg broken by the troll and in one of the later chapters when Harry's at her house over Christmas he has a breakdown in the living room and begs for forgiveness from her parents Been trying to track it down for a while now, idk if it got taken purged or the author deleted it but it was a really good one

  Abandoned by his House and his friends after his name comes out of the Goblet, Harry feels betrayed and alone. Help comes in the form of know-it-all Hermione Granger. A less forgiving Harry, a Ravenclaw Hermione. HHr.
