I'm aware posting this on this sub is probably an exercise in futility but ah well

I've tried to give the ship a chance. Plenty of chances but all the the fics are just utter tripe imo even the ones that are constantly hyped up in this sub as better than canon and the like


** I enjoy some of the Haphne-is-canon jokes on this sub, and I appreciate the attempt to make Slytherin more interesting than it is in canon. I don't tend to like the sort of political stuff and macho power fantasies that I've seen in the Haphne I read, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are very good Haphnes out there.

** The way I see it is that Daphne is Jane doe from slytherin and many people want Harry to have a romance with slytherin girl. Daphne hasn't been characterised in the books and we only know the name, so she is the best choice (gives an authenticity since she is a character made by JKR but gives complete freedom to characterise her as she is a blank slate).

And I personally like Daphne because when I Google her, the first image that comes (I think the actress in the movie) is quite beautiful. So of course, I ship emüòÅ. And her younger sister is Draco's wife in the books, so it gives Daphne more authenticity even without talking about her.

** Honestly the "Haphne is the best canon ship" joke was funny at first but after reading about the "Ice Princess" and "Slytherin politics" for the eightieth time I'm fucking sick of it. The fans (stans?) of the pairing aren't as bad as others I could name, but that's a /very/ low bar to clear.

If you want a complete destruction of fanon!Daphne tropes, may I recommend linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5287437/1/A-Half-Blood-Prince-Indeed]])? linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess]]) is another one you might enjoy.

** I don't mind Haphne itself as a ship but I generally dislike the typical way it is executed (Slytherin politics, etc). However, some people like it. And vice versa, there's things I like that other can't stand.

I'm very reluctant in calling something "better than canon". Sure, there might be fics that I enjoy more than canon, but that's just down to taste. Canon isn't perfect but is generally far better written than fanfics.

** The average Haphne story is as well written as the average, say, Dramione story. Which translates to both being pretty much garbage. However, the usual Haphne story contains almost no Draco (who I have zero desire to read about, unless he's being cruciated) and very little Hermione (who I can take in very small doses). Thus the average Haphne story is vastly preferable to a variety of other pairings.

It's not like I ship it even. I just dislike most other ships thoroughly. like Harmony (ughhh Harmonians) and Hinny (ughhh canon zealots) and Drarry (just no). The above ships make up something like 80% of all fanfiction btw.

So yeah Haphne is not perfect, or even good. I still prefer it to most other ships. (except HONKS, but we only get like 2 fics per year of that).

** I absolutely /loathe it./ Partially, because she's always absolutely insufferable, and partially because the Harry in these fics is more often than not a total fucking edge lord.

Also, ironically, instead of making Slytherin more dimensional, and fascinating they often make Slytherin overly simplistic and moronic. (See: Eleven year olds talking how thirteen year olds think Lords and Ladies spoke in time yonder. SO MOTE IT BE)

** Harry and Daphne is my favourite pairing.

I really like fics where Harry isn't so clueless and floundering as he is in cannon, and I find Daphne is one of the best ways an author can get him 'caught up' in the Wizarding world. She can show him the political side, the darker side, introduce him to how Wizarding society works (Harry is a Potter after all) as well as introduce a way to explain that not all Slytherins are evil.

She can be a fantastic counter point to Harry's blind loyalty to the light, without turning him dark.

When I think about who I want Harry to be with I just don't think he suits any of the major characters (Hermione, Ginny etc) so I'd rather him with an OC. Daphne is pretty much that, all we really know about her is that she's in Slytherin. She's a great blank canvas to write her personality pretty much however the author would like.

That being said, I also like stories with Harry getting with Susan, Tracy, Hannah, or anyone else who isn't one of the major characters.

** This post pretty much perfectly summerizes the meaning of my flair here. Finding a truely good Harry/Daphne fic is a struggle to say the least, the vast majority of them are full of bad tropes, and to be fair most of them are common tropes in all HP fics, but H/D fics are a magnet for them. So finding a fic for the pairing that doesn't have Harry Potter Black Peverell etc., helpful goblins, Ron/Dumbledore/Molly/Ginny Bashing, and other tropes is like finding a needle in a haystack.

But everyonce in a while you get absolute gems like linkffn(13323518) or promising but incomplete fics like linkffn(13648757) or the minimally tropey and quite fun fic linkffn(13133746) so it's just /mostly/ trash but occasionally pretty good. Also, you're under no obligation to like any ship if you don't that's fine, it's not for everyone.

I know enough to include myself in that though I hope I have improved. When I started in the fandom (probably 2 decades ago!) there were sites that required you to have a beta to post there.

She's basically an OC and I'm not a fan of OCs but that's just a matter of personal preference. Also, I strongly dislike edgy Harry, child politicians, and lords and ladies, which seem to make up a lot of Haphne fics.

I will say that I see Ice Cream recced to death (and it is in this thread as well) and I was excited to read it but didn't even make it halfway through. It's not bad but it's hardly the amazing work people made it sound to be. I'm not exactly inspired to check out other Haphne fics.

**** That depends on your defintion of "wanking" (which usually means "portrayed more positively than I can stand!!!!!!!" for those who use the term). In my stories, muggle technology's use ranges from barely mentioned to prominent depending on the plot and the characters involved. A squib or muggle main character will, naturally, use technology more than a wizard or witch. An AU with a wizarding world more divided from the muggle one will generally see less muggle technology used. Further, if the plot doesn't offer the opportunity to introduce muggle technology in a plausible manner, it's not going to be used - contrary to what people who haven't been in the military think, guns need training to be used even half-way proficiently. So, whether and how muggle technology gets used varies a lot. As to Hermione - those who hate the idea that she could be as important and skilled as Harry would naturally call it wanking, but I generally aim for the trio - Harry, Ron and Hermione - to be overall about equally skilled/capable.

****** Wow, people really parrot lies without actually reading the story. All the wizards got from a member of the IRA - massively overpaid with gold from Sirius Black - was a tiny sample of Semtex and a few triggers. Hardly reaching to think that an individual would sell some a sliver of explosive and some replaceable detonators for a huge sum - especially in a time when the troubles were ending and they weren't supposed to use the stuff any more. (The wizards then used the Duplication Charm. A lot.)

Now, I know some people think that muggles drool, but, generally, explosives do get off when triggered correctly. And, using magic, it's not too difficult to place such explosives close to your target. The first time, when no one expects it. That's really not wanking. As we saw in real life, most such gambits work the first time.

However, since my characters on both sides of the conflict aren't idiots, the purebllod wizards did react. Potential targets moved to locations not known to the public, others sought hostages, some hid among muggles - and Voldemort happily used a bomb himself to blow up Dumbledore's people and blame the muggleborns for it. Actions have consequences, after all.

In the same way, plans and tactics in my stories tend to work until the enemy reacts to them - and that depends on how much they know and what they can do. Further, if people have the initiative and can plan to their heart's content, attacks tend to work well. have the same people react - or rush and attack - and casualties tend to pile up. In this conflict, both the Death Eaters and the muggleborns were generally striking from hiding, and vanishing quickly, so casualties stayed low at first, and attacks were generally successful - if they found a target. That changed as things heated up.
