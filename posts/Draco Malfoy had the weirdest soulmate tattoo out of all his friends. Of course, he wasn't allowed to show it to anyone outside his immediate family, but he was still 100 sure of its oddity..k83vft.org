He looked down at it for the fourth time that day. The scrawl was in between the borderlines on messy and neat. It was an unusual sight for a pureblood. The font, however, was not the oddness Draco whined about, it was the writing.

Written on his left forearm, supposed to the first meaningful thing his soulmate would say to him, was the sentence ‘Severus wanted to Bang my mum?!”

Draco didn't know who this ‘Severus' was, but he was determined to find and reprimand him for doing such a thing to his one and only. He supposed he would ask Uncle Snapey for help.


** Snape reads it, starts choking on air and stammering out excuses. He then flees screaming at Lucius to never let any see Draco's mark ever!

** I negative zero percent ship Drarry, but I very much appreciate this hilarious prompt.

My favorite part being " He supposed he would ask Uncle Snapey for help." I almost choked on the hilarity of it.
