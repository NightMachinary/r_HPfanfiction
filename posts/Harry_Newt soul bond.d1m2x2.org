:END:
I've been searching for a fic I read once about Harry getting accidentally sent back in time from an odd mix of curses during a fight. It's post-war and he's an auror. He ends of hiding out in a desert to avoid the awkwardness of being an accidental time traveler without a backstory. Finds Newt and also helps out some desert tribe. Leads to them getting completely drunk and getting magically bonded.

Anyone know it??? I can't find it on AO3 or FF.net, but I was sure it was on AO3.......
