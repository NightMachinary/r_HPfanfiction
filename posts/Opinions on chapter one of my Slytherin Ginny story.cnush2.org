*Chapter One: Luna*

Ginny and her parents made their way through the chaotic rush of the London train station. For eleven years she had watched her brothers one by one leave to go to Hogwarts, but this year was different. This year she was going with them.

“Now remember Ginny, stay close to your brothers and don't get into any trouble,” her mother said, giving her daughter yet another piece of helpful advice.

“Yes, mom,” she said half-heartedly paying attention.

“And stay away from bad influences dear. I don't want to hear about how you've fallen in with the wrong sort,” her mom said, apparently without Harry Potter's presence around her mother went full force with her doting.

“I know, mom,” Ginny said rolling her eyes. Ginny knew right from wrong; she wasn't going to do anything stupid, so hearing her mother go on and on was becoming quite taxing, especially when her dream was a train ride away.

“Remember dear, if you ever need anything your brothers, your father and I will do whatever we can to help,” she said.

“Can I get on the train already?” she said, tugging her parents forward, eager to go to Hogwarts.

“Ginny. Listen to your mother this is really important. We know you're excited, but try to be patient,” her father said kneeling down to meet her at eye level, his voice softening by the end.

Ginny felt her cheeks flush with warmth,“I know. I'm just so excited to finally be going to Hogwarts!”

“Do you have everything you need? We don't need to leave again and grab something,” her mother said.

“Nope, I've got everything I need,” she said waving her diary at her parents.

Her parents smiled and gave her a tight hug.“Remember, you like yourself for who you are, the other kids will too,” her father said. “Now go on and find your brothers.”

“I promise to write every day,” she said, forcing herself out of her parents' embrace and boarded the train. She glanced back and gave them a tiny wave goodbye.

Ginny's eyes widened once she entered the train. The interior was much smaller than she imagined it to be, it didn't help that there were dozens of kids running around with their own luggage.

“Hey, move it, kid,” an older boy said as he pushed past her.

Ginny's feet felt glued to the floor. She had no clue where to go. A part of her regretted going home for her diary and separating from her brothers. Percy was busy in a perfect meeting. Fred and George would be busy with their friends and taking orders from their customers. And Ron was probably with Harry and Hermione.

She sighed as she began to look for a free compartment. This started a depressing routine for her. Each compartment she'd knock on the door asking to come in, then she'd scan the room looking for friendly faces, then she'd apologize and move on to the next one. Every compartment she'd come upon either had students much older than her, annoyed kids, or Slytherins. She frowned as she made her way into another train car.

Inside was a girl around her age looking at her. The blond girl had this far off look like she wasn't all there. She also had these weird earrings made of real radishes. All that might have been forgivable until she saw the girl was reading a magazine upside down.

“Room for one more?” she asked hesitantly.

The girl looked at her for a moment, her lips dipping lightly. “Yes, but are you sure you want to? You looked like you want to leave.”

Ginny sputtered; she was about to tell this girl that she was not going to, but they both knew that was a lie. Instead, she smiled and closed the door, sealing them both in the compartment.“Yeah, but you seem pretty cool.”

The girl's eyes widened as her slight frown morphed into the biggest grin she'd seen. “My name is Luna, Luna Lovegood.”

“Ginevra Molly Weasley, but my friends call me Ginny,” she said.

“It's nice to meet you, Ginevra,” Luna said.

“You can call me Ginny,” she said.

“I thought you said that your friends call you Ginny,” she said looking at the other girl. Clearly, social cues were lost on the girl.

Ginny laughed at the odd girl. “Yeah, and now you're one of them.”

After their brief introduction, both girls became rather silent. Luna kept reading her upside-down magazine while Ginny played with the page of her diary.

A part of her was tempted to open her diary and start writing to Tom, but the last thing she needed was to seem too entertained by writing in her diary. She wasn't going to let the weird girl think /she/ was the weird one. “So, I take it you're a first-year too?” she asked, tapping her fingers on her diary.

Luna poked her head up from the magazine. Apparently, she too thought their train ride was going to be spent in silence. “Yes, I'm a first-year.”

Ginny felt nervous as it seemed like if she wanted to be entertained she was going to have to take the reins of this conversation. “Me too. I'm probably going to get into Gryffindor. What house do you want to get into?”

“Ravenclaw, dad says I'm a shoo-in,” the blond said rather dismissively.

“Was your dad a Ravenclaw? My entire family on both sides were in Gryffindor, so I'm set,” she said not waiting for the awkward silence to return.

“Yes, so was my mom,” Luna replied.

As a new silence began to loom over them, this time it was the other girl who broke it. “Why do you seem sad about going to Gryffindor?” she asked.

Ginny looked at the other girl before looking out the window into the distance. She had completely misread this girl. Luna might be odd, but she wasn't stupid. Ginny scrunched up her face before she reluctantly answered. “I was excited, but a friend of mine has been talking to me and now I'm not so sure. It's just, I don't think I want to be in Gryffindor now. I don't want to be the runt Weasley of Gryffindor.”

“Well if you don't want to be in Gryffindor why are you forcing yourself?” she asked.

Ginny huffed turning to the other girl. “My whole family has been in Gryffindor, I can't just refuse to go.”

“Well can't you just ask to not be in Gryffindor?” she asked. Neither girl knew how they'd be assigned houses, but they probably could ask to switch houses.

“It's not that easy,” she said, her irritation growing.

“I think it should be. You should choose the house that makes you the happiest,” Luna said.

Ginny looked at Luna. This girl looked at the world in simple terms. She didn't look at the world as if there were expectations; she just saw the simplest way to do things and did it. “Well right now I think we should change topics,” she said.

“I heard we've got a new defence against the dark arts teacher,” Luna said.

Ginny brightened at the mention of the new teacher. “Yeah, Gilderoy Lockheart, I saw him when I was getting my school supplies. Harry Potter gave me the whole set of his books.”

“Harry Potter? As in the boy who lived?” she asked.

Ginny smiled, it seemed like even Luna wasn't immune to the lure of Harry Potter. “Yep, he's best friends with my brother; he also spent the summer at my house,” she said.

The train ride wasn't as bad as it started, after a brief chat about Harry their conversations started to branch out into other non-Harry Potter related conversations. Ginny learned that Luna's father worked for the Quibbler. She told Luna about all her brothers and quidditch.

When the train ride ended the two girls made their way with the rest of the first years to the boats. The girls were mystified by the huge castle as they rowed across Black lake. Luna told her about the giant squid, but Ginny had a hard time believing that Hogwarts would allow a dangerous creature so close to school children.

Ginny and the rest of the first-years began their trek from the lake up to the castle. There were dozens of towers that loomed over the castle. Orange lights shone out form hundreds of windows. The gates to the school were easily twice her size. It was exactly as she imagined it to be.

After a brief introduction the kids made their way into the great hall. She waved at Fred and George and gave Percy a curt nod. Much to her dismay, she couldn't find Ron or Harry.

One by one the first years went up to a stage to sit on a stool and have a hat placed on them. After a few moments the hat would call out a house and the student would make their way over to the respective house table. True to her word, Luna ended up in Ravenclaw.

Ginny was one of the last students remaining when she heard Mcgonagal call her name. She rushed up the stairs only to trip on the final one. Her face became nearly as red as her hair as she rose to her feet and dusted herself off. Fred and George were probably laughing their asses off, and Percy was probably trying his hardest to school his features.

Ginny held her head high as she made her way over to the stool despite the continued laughter of the students. McGonagall gave her a pitying look before she placed the hat on her head.

*/Hmm. Another Weasley./* the hat said, as his voice rang in her head.

/Let me guess Gryffindor? she thought, not quite sure how this thing worked./

*/Maybe, but let's see what our options are./*

*/You work hard and fight for everything you have. Perhaps Hufflepuff. No, no you're much too used to cheating and breaking the rules for a puff. Or how about Ravenclaw with your friend Luna? Ha, Ravenclaw is never going to happen. You can study, but you hate it./*

Ginny frowned at the hat, nobody mentioned that she'd be humiliated before she got sorted. /Are you going to put me in Gryffindor or not?/

/The hat bristled at her snide comment and muttered to itself./

*/You don't seem happy about it?/*

Ginny paused for a moment before she spoke.

/I don't know if I want to be in Gryffindor./

*/We've got two houses to go let's see what we've got to work with./*

*/You're brave as a lion, you got nerve and daring, you're a perfect Gryffindor./*

/Ginny's stomach started to roll./

*/Hmm. Let's see if what Slytherin has to offer? You're pure blood, but you don't support blood purity. You're cunning I'll give you that, sneaking at night to steal your brothers' brooms. You're resourceful too. Hmm, tell me Miss Weasley; what do you want in life?/*

Ginny sighed and thought about what she wanted. She told Tom she didn't want a thing, but deep down she knew that wasn't true.

/I want to be special. Don't want to be another Weasley. I'm more than the runt of the family. I'm more than the girl. I want to be more./

*/Perhaps Slytherin./*

Ginny's heart sank.

/No, please don't./

/The hat sighed in frustration./

*/What's wrong with Slytherin?/*

/I'm not a Slytherin./

*/Oh, on the contrary, you have the makings of a great Slytherin. Tell me why are you afraid of Slytherin?/*

/My family hates Slytherin house, and if I join I won't make any friends./

*/I see your family's views on Slytherin are what's holding you back, but you don't want to join them in Gryffindor. I don't know how your family will react, but I can tell you this; Slytherin is a house where you will make lifelong friends./*

Ginny shuffled in her seat and looked into the crowd at the students. The Slytherin students seemed to be having just as much fun as the other students. They seemed like normal well-adjusted kids.

/Will I be happy in Slytherin?/

*/Only if you're want to be. Only if you're willing to put yourself out there in.../*

*/Slytherin!!!/*

** I think it's rather good and I enjoyed reading it. Thank you for sharing it with us! You've got a good grasp on grammar and it's a coherent first chapter. There's one small thing about the plot though. The Lovegoods and Weasleys both live near Ottery St. Catchpole, so Ginny and Luna probably should know each other already.

*Chapter One: Luna*

Ginny and her parents made their way through the chaotic rush of Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. For eleven years she had watched her brothers, one by one, leave to go to Hogwarts, and this year, she'd finally be going with them.

“Now remember Ginny, stay close to your brothers and don't get into any trouble,” her mother said.

“Yes, mum,” she said half-heartedly, not really paying attention.

“And stay away from bad influences dear. I don't want to hear about how you've fallen in with the wrong sort,” her mum said. Apparently, without Harry Potter's presence around her mother, Ginny was the target for her doting.

“Remember dear, if you ever need anything, write or go to your brothers.” she said.

“Can I get on the train already?” she said, tugging her parents forward, eager to go to Hogwarts.

“Ginny. Listen to your mother. We know you're excited, but try to be patient,” her father said, kneeling down to meet her at eye level, his voice softening at the end.

Ginny's eyes widened once she entered the train. The interior was much smaller than she imagined it to be, especially with dozens of kids running around with their own luggage.

“Move it, kid,” an older boy said, pushing past her.

Ginny's feet felt glued to the floor. She had no idea where to go. A part of her regretted going home for her diary and being separated from her brothers. Percy was busy in a prefect meeting. Fred and George would be busy with their friends, and Ron was probably with Harry and Hermione.

It seemed to Ginny that if she wanted her first train ride to Hogwarts to have any meaningful memories, she was going to have to take the reins of this conversation.

“Me too. I'm probably going to get into Gryffindor. What house do you want to get into?”

“Ravenclaw, dad says I'm a shoo-in,” the blond said rather dismissively.
