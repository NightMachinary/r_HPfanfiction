Do y'all know any good fics that have a really good basis of its magical theories? Like really focuses on magic? It doesn't have to be dark magic, but that's where I see it come up the most. I'm up for any of Harry deep diving into a specific branch of magic or magic as a whole like Evitative explores. Thanks ^{_^}


** The Victoria Potter series by Taure has some really fantastic magical theory in it.

** I rarely read Harry centric fics so I can't really help there, but there's some classic Hermione ones that get super into magical theory such as The Arithmancer by White Squirrel or Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady.

** I think zeitgeistic is an author with good magical theory, and there was this one fic where Harry and Draco have to break curses in Hogwarts left by the death eathers who scaped at the end of the war, a lot of how to identify and disable them, but I can't remember the name.

EDIT: Sorry, zeitgeistic is the author, azoth a fic.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)
