It sucks out your soul apparently. Well, then the question becomes, how to prevent it from being able to do so?

I think a way to answer this is to look at what the concept of a dementor actually represents. I think the first clue is the effect their proximity has. It takes away your ability to think positive thoughts. It stands to reason that their increased proximity increases the effect of /taking something awa from you/.

This is further evidenced by the fact that what is left after the demontor's kiss is a body that doesn't seem to respond to any stimuli. In other words, there is nothing there to respond anymore. It's like the anchor behind all of our functioning has been removed so that nothing can find any purchase anymore. The mind is empty, more than empty, there is nothing there anymore at all.

So how do you defend against something that takes away everything?

My guess is this. It has to attach to you to take away your soul. This is a clue as to the method. It needs to /pull out/ everything there is. But what if it can't attach to anything? What if there is already nothing there for the dementor to find purchase to? I bet a demontor doesn't get much from kissing somebody who is already kissed, so what would happen if the person who is being kissed by a dementor could make their mind as void as the void that is left by the dementor after the kiss?

I can think of two methods. One would be an artifact or spell that presents this kind of mind to the dementor /instead/ of the one it's trying to reach. This would have to delve into "soul-magic", stuff like horecruxes and whatever else fanon has come up with. Maybe there would be a way to transplant the soulless properties of a kiss victim into a kind of talisman. I suppose some imagination might be needed here but it could be a method.

Another method is to reach enlightenment in the moment of being kissed. According to interpretations of Buddhist lore an enlightened mind can be seen as empty, void, having "no-self". It has already let go of everything. Therefor there can be no purchase for the dementor to exploit to pull out all of your being. Some way to implement this in a story might be to make a particular (exotic and hard) kind of meditation on void and nothingness that a person can engage in willingly, that allows them to let go of everything they have, let go of all attachment to use another Buddhist term, to temporarily negate the dementors influence completely. This could be trained by learning to overcome dementor exposure in increasing amounts and maintaining this state of non-attachment where they cannot influence you.

This was just a little brainwave that came to me after reading something about dementors in a fic. It got me to look at them in more depth and this is what I came up with. Thank you for reading and I hope someone perhaps has some use for these thoughts.

** Does the dementors kill actually suck out your soul or that just the assumption based on what people see? Maybe it eats some kind of paste that sticks your soul to your body and getting kissed means you just go to the afterlife like normal. Maybe dementors are the scariest glue eating morons to ever exist.

Suppose everyone was born a wizard at the beginning of humanity and getting killed by a dementor means they sucked out your magic and now you reincarnate as a muggle.

Maybe you have like 7 different souls that go to various afterlives but since they're all perfectly mirrored with one another it only seems like one and they just get the one and the other six scamper off to wherever.

What if everyone is their own dementor in a sort of yin/yang relationship and when a dementor finally devours its other half it goes off to disappear from the world because it is now complete and all the bad memories it gave them in life turns into positive karma in death. The worst kind of soul mate.

*** Damn. Now I'm imagining Dementors made by some dark ritual to find some desperate romantic a soul mate. The ritual says that in order to make loves true kiss and be one, first they must see all of their loves worst memories. That doesn't sound too bad, and wouldn't it be nice to truly know the person you're going to unite with? So they do the ritual, and suddenly they can't seem to get warm no matter what they do, depression and apathy sink in. They start to feel hunger for their friends happiness, but when they are around others everyone has a sort of lame time. The affected person starts to draw away from people, which means no one is there to watch them turn into a shade. The dementor comes to, only knowing that it's seeking, seeking it's other half in a world full of souls, and somewhere out there is their perfect match.

Granted, we know dementors seemingly breed, and also that other than that there's no known data about them, but the idea of a ritual goes wrong is pretty chilling. After all, who doesn't want a perfect match ?
