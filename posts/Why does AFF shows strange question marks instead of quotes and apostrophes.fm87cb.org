Wasn't sure of the flair on this, so let me know if I need to change it.

Pages on [[https://AdultFanfiction.org][Adult-FanFiction.org]] show up with a strange character in place of all quotation marks or apostrophes: a black diamond with a question mark in the middle of it, as though it's an unknown character, as shown below.

#+begin_quote
  �Maybe it�s a surprise for your Birthday or something?� Neville muttered sounding far less awake than he seemed.
#+end_quote

I tried copying-pasting the text, but the strange character is carried over to both text and Word files (and Reddit posts, as you can see).

I also tried changing the display font for my browser, but it didn't help. I am using Chrome, if that makes a difference.

Any suggestions?


** I had the same problem some time ago.

[[http://www2.adult-fanfiction.org/forum/topic/64097-question-marks-replacing-quotation-mark-in-stories/][This]] thread should explain why it happens

Also, in latest versions of chrome there's no option of changing encoding anymore, you have to use a browser extension called “Set Character Encoding”. After installing it, open AFF, right-click on the page and choose Windows-1252. You should have to do this only once, after that it would become a default opinion for AFF.

*** Thank you!!!

For some reason, a simple extension search turned up "no results." I had to find a help thread that had a link to a specific extension. It's [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/set-character-encoding/bpojelgakakmcfmjfilgdlmhefphglae][here]], in case anybody else has this problem.
