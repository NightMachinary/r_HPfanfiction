Like I said in the title, I enjoy it if sometimes topics like philosophy, literature, religion, politics etc. are breached. I would love something with debates with actual content, not just "You can push someone from a tower with you hands, so your hands are as bad as an atomic bomb". Or Harry and Dumbledore actually talking about ethics instead of just mentioning that Harry has read the entire library before ever going to Hogwarts and is soo smart.

A good example in TV is Dr. House. They show him as a genius in medicine and not just tell it to us in the introduction. And while I understand next to nothing about it, it is still enjoyable to watch :) For ff there would be something like linkffn(10847788) where you have amazing introspection into the 'Jewish perspective of magic'.

Dumbledore for example is described as a 100+ years old, well read, well travelled, curious man who has met people like him from all over the world. Why is the best he can do say: "Don't do that because it is evil" when we know he has build an entire political ideology with his friend which managed to convince hundreds/thousands of people to go to war over it. Not to say that it is a good one (or particular complicated, stolen from real people, that he acts smart in canon ect.), but come one there is so much potential.

I feel like I have to mention this, by no means would call myself an intellectual or even smarter than the average person, I just enjoy reading about them. So please don't take this the wrong way. Gory warmongering and explosion are as enjoyable for me as for everyone else but I am sure there are some gems I haven't found yet ;)

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014.

** Side note: watch the west wing, especially seasons 1-4. While there is an interesting plot, individual episodes like to explore and discuss a single idea. These include, privacy, capital punishment, etc.

** Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery by semprini. It's the first story in a trilogy that includes a lot of discussion about politics and ethics in the context of leading a war.

Actually, the other series by semprini is also ethics heavy as well. Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link.

** I feel like Methods of rationality fits your request, but I only read a couple of chapters, so I can't be sure.

You should probably check out linkffn(pureblood pretense) Harry in there has a lot of discussions with multiple people on multiple topics be it potions, alchemy, politics, philosophy, transfiguration etc. All in all it's an amazingly engaging story with a lot of content and many more to come.

*** Yeah, MOR is kind of a mixed bag in my opinion. I also read the first chapters and for me it doesn't fit into the universe very well. To me it seemed the author was more occupied by finding plotholes than creating an immersive world. But to each their own :) I will check out Pureblood Pretense though!

**** That's mean and unfounded. Knowing this or that philosophical theories and understanding physics has nothing to do with IQ. And calling people idiots and pitying them simply because the part of the world's knowledge that is praised in HPMOR is not the part they were interested in is not only rude but also reflects on your rather close-minded look on what makes a person worthy of respect.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
