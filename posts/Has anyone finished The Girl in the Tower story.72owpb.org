I randomly remembered this while browsing some author favorites. It was started way back in 2003 (pre-OttP) and I made a couple attempts to read it but always lost interest.

If, by any chance, you've read it and want to satisfy my curiosity, drop a reply and tell me wtf it's about. Feel free to spoil the entire plot.
