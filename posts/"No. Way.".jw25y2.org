"Harry groaned. He should be happy. He really should be happy. After all, he hadn't been sent back in time by himself. It would have been a huge burden, having to deal with all of this foreknowledge alone. The thing was that neither Ron nor Hermione had been sent back with him, no.

His time-travel-partner was Lavender bloody Brown."

Edit: Thanks, everyone, for the amazing response! And for the award as well! I hope I could inspire some people for more Lavender-content üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and, since I've been asked in this thread: feel absolutely free to make use of this prompt for future fic ideas!

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** While she's not Ron, Hermione or Neville, she should be taking things extremely serious after seeing kis being tortured for a whole year. She participated and died during the final battle, so while she might be a girly girl, that doesn't make her less courageous and willing to fight for what's right.

I would love seeing a story centred around Harry and his preconceived notions being broken. Like Lavender wasn't fighting Dragons and Basilisk during her years at Hogwarts, but she was still actively working towards her dreams of being an xxxxx, so she's competent in the fields of magic needed to go into that field. This could be something like becoming a fashion designer (and needing transfiguration and charms) to fully embrace the girly side or something like a magical engineer, because you can be a girly girl and have interest outside of it.

*** Well, obviously. In my fic, I have Lavender competent as well. She's not how she's usually depicted in FF, you know, like, your average dumb blonde. She's a girly girl with a huge emotional range where she spends lots of time at either extremes. Very touchy-feely, a bit flighty here and there, a huge gossip, but if she sets her mind on something she is damn well capable of achieving it.

Though I want to point out that courage, when it comes to Harry Potter and Gryffindor, is usually seen as willing to face life/death situations, which I find very superficial and limiting.

***** It used to. Given the error message, it's a problem with the site that is being linked to, not with the link to the site. I'd try again later.
