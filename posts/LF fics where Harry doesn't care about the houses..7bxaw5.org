Essentually he doesn't care about the house rivalries and makes friends/family in all houses.

I don't mind any suggestions, but I prefer stories that are 40,000 words or more, and well written. If it's a smut fic, then I don't mind the suggestion, but I want plot in there as well, and the well written part is a must


** I'm not sure about the many friends but I remember one fic, think it was fifth year, where he moves out of Gryffindor and says he is neutral. I also remember it having some Weasley, Granger, and I believe DD bashing though.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
