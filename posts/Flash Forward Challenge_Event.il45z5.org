A friend and I were discussing the use of flash forwards in writing; the merits and drawbacks. We delved deep into the idea of fanfiction and how it could be used as a “trailer” so to speak and have decided to have a challenge which I'd like to extend here to my favorite fandom (also the fandom I am writing for in the challenge)

The Requirements are;

1) Cannot exceed more than 5,000 words 2) Must elude directly to the plot of the story the flash forward is representing 3) Must stay within the ‘flash forward' for the entirety (aka you can't go back and forth from the ‘present' ) 4) Must end on a cliff hanger

If your interested PM me! We have a discord and sub channel all to do with Harry Potter fan-fiction and bouncing ideas off of each other!
