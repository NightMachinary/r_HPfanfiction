Considering the chain of events and all the rest, with Dumbledore only being forced to leave because of the DA getting caught out, and Dumbledore taking the blame for it for Harry...would Dumbledore continue to be Headmaster all year? And at the end, would Umbridge be forced out by the curse anyway, or would she stay on for another year by coming back again? If she did get knocked out of her job by the curse, then would Fudge assign a new Inquisitor or whatever? Maybe a nicer one?

Wouldn't Harry just have had a normal, smooth year, ironically enough?

Was it always Umbridge's intentions to become the new Headmistress, start the Inquisitorial Squad, etc? Would she have been ABLE to make all those reforms and shit if she WASN'T the Headmistress - if Dumbledore was still around, and she was just the DADA professor?

Just some thoughts I'm having about some fifth year divergence fic ideas...

This all happens in like April. Dumbledore was gone for like 2 months lol. Throughout the series JKR has like 4-5 big moments before shit truly hits the fan. One of those moments is between March and May.

So, Harry still has most of the school hate him, Dumbledore ignoring him, Voldemort in his head, no Quidditch, extra bs from Snape, in addition to Umbridge's detentions and OWLs.

The DA provided him with some peace, tbh.

*** Even then it was extra work.

I wouldn't mind a fic with no DA, and a Harry that gets out of detention with Umbridge.

** The beauty of the year is something is going to snap.

I'd imagine allegations of Umbridge torturing students would get her fired, as she was lost in the bureaucracy, but wouldn't be.

** Each class starts with Harry stunning Umbridge and stuffing her in a corner. Maybe trapping her in a conjured box for variety. He then turns to the class, "For today's lesson..."

** Umbridge did almost everything she did in the book prior to Dumbledore leaving. It was the Inquisitorial Squad that caught the DA meeting in progress that caused Dumbledore to leave the school to protect Harry. Her becoming Headmistress functionally didn't change anything. Conceivably, had she remained in charge beyond the end of OOTP, she could have kicked Trelawney out of the school, but pretty much everything else she wanted to do, she was able to just by being the High Inquisitor.

** I'm just writing a fic and I don't think that Harry will start the DA. It's kinda a dark Harry/MoD Harry fic so I will probably just let him kill her.
