What if ... Harry saved Merope, Tom's mother? I've honestly never seen this done in a story. After all who to better take care of Tom than his own flesh & blood mother? To grow up with mother's love? JKR herself has said in an interview that if Tom's mom had survived - there would never had been Voldemort.

I'm fairly sure Harry would wish to keep an eye on Tom. He could either be a family friend looking after them, just a stranger who keeps an eye on them from afar, or heck ... ship Merope/Harry if you like. He could later be a teacher at Hogwarts, or rejuvenate himself and be Tom's classmate...

Anything goes, as long Harry saves Tom by saving his mom.

** I don't think that Merope who is a rapist should be allowed anywhere near children, especially one who is a doppelganger of her victim.

*** All part of the prompt I suppose. I think Harry would want to stick around to make sure Tom doesn't grow evil. Perhaps he helped Merope through the hard times and helped her find her a job down the line. Perhaps he left her enough gold to get by in life...
