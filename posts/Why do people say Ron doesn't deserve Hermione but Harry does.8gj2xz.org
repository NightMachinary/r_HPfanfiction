** I think people feel like when one person is relatively accomplished or displays extraordinary attributes (in this case, Hermione's drive and intelligence), then they should have a partner who is equal in those attributes. But this is simply not how romantic partnerships work. Hermione seeks a certain type of personality in an ideal partner. She doesn't seek someone who is her intellectual equal or has the ambition to be Minister for Magic. She seeks someone who makes her laugh, is loyal to her, has shared experiences, and brings her back down to earth. Ron does that for her. I am reminded of Philosopher's Stone where Hermione essentially downplays her own attributes (books and intelligence) in favor of bravery (which Ron certainly displays).

Now does Harry display bravery and exude traits Hermione might find appealing? Yes. And is he determined and ambitious? sure. But they simply don't have that romantic pull to each other, and I don't think Hermione finds Harry funny or finds his intense personality appealing. People think Hermione is this perfect person who only deserves the absolute best partner (without realizing what actually makes someone the best partner) Harry saved the wizarding world so naturally only he would deserve the perfection that is Hermione.

The idea that one character /deserves/ another is wrong and shows that some people don't really understand how relationships work.

*** I also believe that the casting in the movies played a huge role in cementing this idea. Many view Hermione as Emma Watson.

** No one ever DESERVES anyone else. People aren't objects or prizes. Hermione will be with whoever she chooses to be with.

** "Deserving" is kind of stupidly objectifying way to think of a woman regardless of your views on this.

That said, my take is that Ron did enough to earn himself a permanent spot on Hermione's shit list so them ending up together (especially in a rushed epilogue) just seemed odd given the proceeding books. Constant bickering is not a romantic indicator, no matter what some may think. It sets any future relationship on very turbulent ground, hence some of Rowling's comments about this subject.

I don't think Harry "deserves" her, nor that they would be a "perfect" couple (that's a silly notion in any relationship anyway). I just think that the canon ships were a mess, and those two seem like they could work well together given some decent development and growth.

Anyway, I suspect the real point of this thread is to start an R/Hr and H/Hr argument. Stupid me had to go ahead and get it started too. Dammit.
