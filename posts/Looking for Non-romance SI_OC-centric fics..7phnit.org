I've been on a bit of a multi-fandom binge of this genre lately, but the HP fandom's got a shit-ton of SI's who are only there to romance canon characters. Anybody know some stories that are both at least passibly decent stories and not romance (or, failing that, where romance isn't the main priority of the story)?

I'm especially interested in stories where the OC has a limited or tangential relationship with the golden trio, or where the SI isn't there to "fix" everything.


** linkffn(The Evil Overlord List) is what you need. I also want to mention linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals), but it doesn't fully match up --- there /is/ romance, except the SI is romancing /another/ OC (a very interesting one, too!).

*** Read the Evil Overlord List and loved it. I'll take a look at the other one, since my issue is OC/Canon romance.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

*** It's overdone and cliche ridden. First year Harry is too competent compared against his canon self and especially when compared to what an actual eleven year old is like. The SI also picks up skills too fast to be realistic. Hermione has the same problems as Harry, too competent for her age. I also literally know nothing about your story and made this up on the spot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]] A comedy/adventure story, wherein a young D&D wizard from a world that blatantly follows the rules of the game finds himself in well over his head when he's summoned into the Potterverse. There he is forced to undergo the most horrifying fate that any D&D minmaxers, optimizers, and munchkins can suffer: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-magical-awakening-hp-si.246476/]] What does a gamer do when he wakes up in the Potterverse as a young Potterverse wizard knowing the books from the outside in? He optimizes the hell out of magic, of course.

**** Does it count if Harry himself is pretty much unrecognizable from his canon self?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525320/1/Oh-You-Didn-t-Know-Yeah-He-s-Awesome]] Harry is both fabulous and quite the smartass. Both Hogwarts and the Triwizard Tournament will never be the same again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]] Combine a hyper-competent Voldemort with a Harry who is both a genius and extremely genre savvy. This is pretty much what you'll get. Soapboxes a bit in the beginning. It gets better.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12698097/1/The-Inglorious-Wonder-Woman][The Inglorious Wonder Woman]] stars a mute mermaid OC main who gets adopted by the Chang family. I think the author's intending to be more representative of certain characters, especially ones that were brushed off or minor; seems pretty alternate universe already, doesn't appear to be going for romantic angle.
