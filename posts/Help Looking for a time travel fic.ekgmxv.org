Draco goes back in time, I know it's a drarry fanfic.

Draco gets sorted into Ravenclaw. Ron is friends with Harry and Draco.

I remember this one scene where Draco's in the bookstore and Harry's looking at him, he's mesmerized by Draco and loves the way that Draco tucks his hair behind his ear. Draco doesn't know that Harry has a crush on him.

Please help! I've been looking for this forever, it's on ao3!


** Nvm, found it. It's called History repeats itself, on Ao3.
