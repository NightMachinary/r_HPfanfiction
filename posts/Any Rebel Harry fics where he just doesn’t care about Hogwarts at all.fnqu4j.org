** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8975202/1/Have-Chrome-Will-Travel]]

This is an undeclared crossover with the Serrated Edge books by Mercedes Lackey (elves who like to race cars), but you truly don't have to have any idea what those are about to enjoy the story.

Also Harry the Weapon by Slytherinsal. Harry would be just as happy to NOT be at Hogwarts but, as Petunia pointed out, that was never going to be an option. linkffn(12834497)
