** Alas no. Not even my own, and the whole point of writing those is to have fics where I get to determine everything that happens. So in theory they should suit my preferences to a tee. But of course, ideas change over time...

About a year ago it was brought to my attention that JKR originally intended Vernon Dursley to be a government minister. I immediately took to the idea - it explained so much, like where the obsession with normality came from. They were terrified of being outed in the press. It would also explain the deference of the local community to the Dursley family, and the fact that Vernon and Dudley went to this posh boarding school even though Vernon is depicted as working class. Those things are all holdovers from when Vernon was meant to be a member of the political class.

On top of that, I felt that this background would have been perfect for Victoria Potter. Victoria coming from that background - moving within the world of Muggle privilege, but never being a part of it, always relegated to the sidelines - would have been perfect for her character arc where at Hogwarts suddenly she's part of the privileged group. It would also have been an interesting point of AU difference to keep the reader interested in the early chapters.

So yeah, if I was rewriting VP I'd use that idea. But VP is already a rewrite, I'm just not willing at this stage to go back and rewrite /again/.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Here are some crossover to add into the list :

- For LotR, I truly consider Linkffn( *The Shadow of Angmar* ) as a perfect fanfic. Steelbadger really respected the universe, his Harry changed while still being believable, I loved his OCs and I even get a Tolkien vibe from his writing style. And no, I do not check the fic every day to see if it has been updated.
- For Star Wars, Linkffn( *The Havoc side of the Force* ). I can't say I consider it a perfect fanfic, because there is one, tiny detail that bothered me, but outside of that, I have nothing to reproach to this fic and it has been one of my most untertaining read.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** First time trying to link a fic so sorry if I mess it up. Linkffn(Dark Heir) is without a doubt the best ‘Harry raised by Voldemort/dark wizards fanfic I have ever read. Doesn't go the usual route of making Dumbledore the main villain but instead gives that role to an often overlooked character that I never expected to even have any kind of importance in the story, yet the reveal still felt satisfying and believable because of how it was written.

  Most of you remember the day that Severus Snape went to Voldemort, begging for the lives of the Potters. What if Voldemort had actually considered this and decided that Harry could be useful to him? How would the Wizarding World react to Harry Potter after he was raised by a Dark Lord? Dark!Harry.

** I almost always want to change something, even if it's just a spellcheck. But I'll add a probably-unpopular mention of Methods of Rationality, not because I think it's perfect, but because the author knows his subject better than I do, and so I don't think I could do a better job of what he was trying to achieve (namely, introduce the reader to the idea of thinking about how you think and trying to fix some of the mistakes you're making). Plus, he's a talented writer.

Note that people often dislike the protagonist. But part of being a talented writer is that the author doesn't always agree with the protagonist either. When Harry is arrogant and dismissive to people, chances are it will return to bite him in the backside. When he thinks he knows better than adults because he has been exposed to different philosophies than they have, he's sometimes right and sometimes horribly wrong. The community behind the story is called "Less Wrong" for a reason; everyone gets things wrong, and at the end of the story, Harry realises he was /just/ smart enough to make really big mistakes, like coming within a hair's breadth of either destroying the planet with an uncontrolled release of sensitive information, or handing it to Voldemort on a platter.

So, there's plenty about /Harry/ that needs to change, but I don't feel like I'm qualified to improve on /the story/. It's a thought-provoking read, in any case.
