:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As title. I remember that they ended up at Hogwarts to build the ship, they successfully got into space and visited the planet after and I think they found Gringotts but everyone had died except for portraits?

Honestly it sounds batshit crazy and like a really bad fic, but I remember enjoying it immensely and I have very high standards, writing included. If anyone knows what it is I would be eternally (for the next day or two) grateful.


** Invincible by Darth Mars. It does sound like a crazy premise but it's execution is surprisingly good.

There's also another one where they find out that the room of requirements can also turn into a spaceship, and travel to another planet/s.

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.
