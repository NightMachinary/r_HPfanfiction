:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Lily and James divorce, leaving Harry with lily. James is a total dick and has another son. Sirius completely sides with lily and is like a father to Harry.

Thanks!


** Not this, but there was a story (I would love to find myself) of post-war falling apart of Harry/Ginny marriage. The crucial point was that one of their children (Lily?) was a squib and Ginny never managed to treat her as equal and always believed that as in proper pureblood family she should be gently sent away (after all, canonically, there was that cousin accountant). Aside from this, there was not much Weasley bashing. I am not sure whether it ended as Harmony or what.

  How does one deal with a child who is different? Some do, some can't bring themselves to.
