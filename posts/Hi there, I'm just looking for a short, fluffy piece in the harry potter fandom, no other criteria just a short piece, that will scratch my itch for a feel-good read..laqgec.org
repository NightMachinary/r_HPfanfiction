** I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile a month ago hoping to come back when I had time.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7432218/olivieblake][OlivieBlake]] has two series of one-shots, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12337045/1/Draught-of-Living-Death][Draught of Living Death]] for the darker side and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995576/1/Amortentia][Amortentia]] for light fluff. I loved the Draught of Living Death, but I never truly grew out of my emo goth stage in high school. *shruggies*\\
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is a lovely little fluffy piece by an author who excels at writing lovely little fluffy pieces. In this one, Harry meets Malfoy working at a coffee shop in muggle London.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] is a gem. In this amusing fic, Harry must buy a toilet. Who comes to the appointment but Malfoy, Lord of Toilets. (this came from a prompt)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16435904][yer a wizard, dudley]] is a weirdly touching oneshot that asks, "What if Dudley was a wizard, too?" Dudley's still a little shit in this world. Fortunately, he gets spotted by 7th year Tonks.

#+begin_quote
  Nymphadora Tonks kept an eye out at Hogwarts for Muggleborns, because her father Ted was one. Tonks also kept an eye out for anxious spoiled brats, because, according to Andromeda, her mother had been one, once.
#+end_quote

- By the same author in the same "what if series" comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501][the girl who lived (again)]]. In this case (again) refers to the fact that the author had previously put out a girl who lived in this same what if line. Anyway, here's the first few sentences that should summarize it: "When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy."
- same author in what if series (tbh, nearly everything in this series would suit) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] wherein Harry doesn't request to be placed in Gryffindor and goes into Slytherin. Harry does not immediately fall in with everyone else. Snape still hates him.
- same author, same what if series comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans]]: what if Petunia really and truly took in Harry. "

#+begin_quote
  Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).\\
  Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
#+end_quote

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/359705][Draco Malfoy, It's Your Lucky Day]] is an 8th year Hogwarts fic. It's by Faith Wood. If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, she has three of the top ten stories. Draco comes to with an injured, unconscious Harry Potter in the middle of the Forbidden Forest and without any memory of how he got there.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123729][Around You Moves]] is the sweetest little ficlet. I super love dense gay characters. It was inspired by a Reddit post on AITA. OP was roommates with a gay friend and got super mad when his roommate brought home guys. Finally in the comments someone was like, "Sounds like you're jealous" and OP realized that a.) he was gay and b.) he had a massive crush on the roommate.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the number one result. I quite resisted reading it for a while. I thought the summary sounded unbearably dumb. But then I caved. And so did mah heart. Check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234222][Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain]] for an 8th year fluffy oneshot by a very popular and prolific author.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1343047][The Fall of the Veils]] is the fic where Muggles find out about wizards, wars are fought, Apparition is abolished, political conspiracies abound, Draco is asexual, and Harry has Legilimency sex with him.

Happy reading!
