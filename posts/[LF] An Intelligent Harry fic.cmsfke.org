linkffn(The Mind Arts) She and Harry are not friends, although it's more of a difference of opinion rather than bashing. Harry doesn't wish her ill.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  What if the founders built in a safe guard to protect incoming students from abuse at home, in the form of the hat? How would the hat react to Harry's so called childhood? Rated for language and expected violence. As complete as it is ever going to get. Revised as another story.

**** I'll look for more.

I actually dislike bashing in general. Calling out character's for canon actions or their personalities is cool.

Like McGonagall is a failure of an administrator, whose competence and love in fics is a side effect of Maggie Smith being a great actress.

Snape, Draco, and Lucius to a lesser extent get treated well because of their actors.

***** You wouldn't need to look for more. I think i have enough fics to read for now as i have one being written as i read it and also two others.

Thanks for your offer to look for more though.

As for bashing. Well i don't like it if it's done badly, if it's done well it can be forking hilarious and if done badly can ruin the whole fic, but i do like seeing dumb door get destroyed in a word-off as i call it.

** linkffn(12155794)

It's quite well written has some unique ideas and matches most of your criterias. It's Powerful!Smart!Harry, it's Haphne, it's long and it doesn't bash Hermione(although her role is pretty small). It also isn't that nice to Dumbledore, although it doesn't bash him.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
