I just want to say openly that writing a fanfic is difficult as a bloody hell. yes, I want to share that. For a long time I just said that this and that story was pure garbage, bad writing, child/teen characters that act like adults, and that the author was lazy with no creativity or too arrogant to the point of being a machine of random words just to increase the counter. Now I'm trying on my own and realizing that I'm an arrogant little shit. It is extremely difficult to make a world-building without running away from the existing world, to build interesting characters even though they are children, funny conversations even though I am not a funny person, a powerful hero for a decent reason and still failing. all this trying a SANE number of words. It is difficult and I am almost giving up, for fear of building a divergent plot and getting rough, or addressing a controversial idea and being unwelcome. Not that anyone cares about my shitty opinion but I am publicly apologizing to every author on this site, you have a courage I don't have.


** "Funny conversations even though I'm not a funny person"

Ouch, same.

I think every author knows that it's hard to please but harder to write. When I first started writing I began to admire any one who had the guts to publish something, even knowing it wasn't that good. When you discover that it's hard to write, you might spiral down a hole searching for perfection but never ever publish anything, so. Can relate. But don't give up!

** I agree with you that writing is hard, but that doesn't mean you have to stop criticising if something is bad.

I mean - writing also means you get yourself feedback if you put a story into the world. That's what betareaders and reviews are for. A good beta tells you if something is garbage. A good reviewer does the same. Then you try to get better. If someone has no one who tells him or her what he or she does wrong - how should he or she ever get better? That doesn't mean you have to be an asshole about it - but betas, feedback and reviews are the only way to improve. I always am happy about the nice: "Your story is great"-reviews, but I really cherish the harsher ones that tell me how to get better.

** The way I figured it was that my early works would be rough. So the important thing is to just keep writing and move on. Don't worry about things being perfect, just keep writing. Maybe I'll go back sometime and polish that turd at the beginning, maybe I won't. But for damn sure my turd polishing skills will improve as I just keep going forward.

So, good luck in your writing. You're not the only one who is worried about the quality of their writing. Hopefully as you enjoy crafting a story your skills will improve and you'll be proud of your very own polished...story...lol.

*** Exactly. Everybody starts out as a beginner. I cringe while reading my older stories but in a strange way, I am happy I wrote them. There's still something good in them. I try to find the good parts about my older shitty stories. Like , this idea was cool, this character was very nicely interpreted stuff like that.

While it's important to improve, don't be too harsh on yourself folks.

** Last year or so, I was preparing to write a more or less novel-length HP fanfic that was, largely, fully original. It was an alternate tale of Grindelwald's rise, war and eventual fall, told from his perspective.

I went through developing lore and world building to the tiniest detail, describing Durmstrang, new magical nations with their own cultures and heritage, new spells, imo pretty interesting magical theory, almost 100% original cast of characters.

It was really interesting. I love writing anti-heroes. I loved the idea of depicting his movements become increasingly radical and ruthless as they realize the original utopia they thought of could never be applied. It had a lot of deep themes, speciesm, cultural tensions, racial tensions. The infamous /Greater Good/ philosophy, but done right. Also, depicting the Dumbledore-Grindelwald dynamic was going to be a blast.

I wrote a bit, and realized I really don't have the commitment to go through with it. It was such a large and in-depth project, for something which, at the end of the day, is not mine. I just couldn't justify putting in so much effort into something that would bring no benefit, and I could never put on a resume or make some cash out of. Gods know I have trouble enough focusing on writing my actual, original stories, committing to a fanfic of such scale would had been insane. That, coupled with personal problems I had around the time, made me fully gave up on the idea.

I totally respect fanfic writers, even if their work is on the shoddier side. Y'all have more commitment than me.

​

PS: I also did post on ffn a few chapters of another fanfic, but again, the reasons above and the fact that it was more or less disjointed scenes I had in my head which I had trouble joining into a full story, made me give up on it. While the story of it wasn't 'canon', the lore surrounding the WW and the characters was almost fully shared with this Grindelwald fic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13469465/1/Master-Mirror]]

​

Edit: Depicting the Flamels was also something I was insanely excited about. Trying to depict the psychology of someone that, for all intents and purposes, is immortal even though was born a regular human was going to be the most interesting I wrote, either in a fanfic or in my personal work. I fucking hate that old cripple they showed in Fantastic Beasts as Nicolas Flamel.

** Writing is hard, there's no denying that. Practice and learning from (good) feedback are really the only two ways I know to improve. I look at stuff I wrote 10 years ago and cringe, but that only goes to show how far I've come in that time.

Writing is a skill. The more you practice and the more you read and learn from others, the better you will get.

All that being said, this is a hobby. No one is getting paid for writing fanfiction. You should be getting something out of doing it, whether that's joy from the writing process itself, the joy of sharing it with others, or even the joy of having something that you want to read. Search to find out what brings you joy and then do that.

Finally, first drafts suck. That's why they come first. Drafts can always be edited and rewritten, but you can't edit what you don't have.

Good luck!

  funny conversations even though I am not a funny person

This hits home. How *hard* is it to write a character that has a vastly different personality than you do?? It's insane.

I feel like it's never going to feel genuine because, surprise, surprise, I have no experience in thinking like an extroverted person. Even though I do my best, I still feel I'm falling short.

** yes! Writing is fucking hard! So many fucking connoisseur here, but the truth is it's really tough to write good shit, and especially to write good shit and get it up on the internet in a timely fashion

good on you for getting dug in and giving it a go though. We only get better with practice at the end of the day, and on the funny thing, it might be true (I honestly suck arse at writing pranks) but I do think we all have different strengths, so even if you have some weaker point in your writing there will be other stuff your readers will enjoy

** If there are two things (not counting general anxiety) that are stopping me from making any progress on my own fic the first is being overwhelmed by how many things I'm going to have to do and am not experienced at yet, and the second is not being sure what I want to do with major plot elements.

** I'd argue that a fair few of these things can be ameliorated by just writing to your strengths (though first you need to figure those out) for instance I've read plenty of great fanfics without any comedy in them, and whil good comedy is also nice, badly done comedy is an absolute show stopper. Likewise, some authors like to make the HP world their own in their fic, and that's great. It's not such a big problem in HP, but in the Pokemon fanficdom there is /no/ good fanfic which isn't also heavily AU, that is to say Pokemon is an interesting concept and all, but following the games isn't very practical and obviously following the anime isnt great, but when authors take a part of the world and run with it to an extreme, or reimagine the whole thing I feel like they can let out a lot more of /their/ story and it really comes out. That is to say, despite what mid 2000s to mid 2010s authors like to put at the start of every chapter, the best fanfics are those which /dont/ belong just to whoever came up with the Canon, and instead make the setting their own.

** Same...it was after one completed one shot and one fanfic on hiatus until I finally wrote a proper good fic that is receiving a lot of recognition that it shouldn't be deserving so much love. It's hard, man. School kills my creativity and sometimes you are in cloud nine with all these ideas and then suddenly everything is gone. It's hard coming up with smth different and unique, not derived directly from HP series.

Absolutely right. I am astounded by not just the creativity and talent but also the perseverance and courage of those who write and publish stories. There are many fics that I don't like or won't read but pretty much all of them are far better than anything I can write (outside of my dreams and imagination).

** You have to make mistakes before you get it right. Tons of them. Just accept that, do as well as you can, you'll get there eventually.

Also, you might want to divide things into separate chunks.

Make your characters while thinking about nothing else. Plan out their arks (what you want them to be at the start, how you want them to change over time, where you want them to be, as characters, at the end), you'll be able to make adjustments on the fly later. Get to know them. Know how they would react to various situations and why.

Similarly plan your story. Have a basic idea of what you want your story to be about, what genre you want it to feature, which themes you want to include. Plan out your structure (which events will occur...).

Plan out your chapters. Know what each chapter is gonna be made of, that such chapter will include humour, dialogue or battle, which characters will be involved, these kinds of things. You'll have to change things as you go, of course. Plan out your Chekov's guns.

This way, it will certainly give you a lot more work, but it won't seem so overwhelming.

Don't worry too much about your style at first. Focus on telling as good a story as you can.

You have a huge amount of work before you even start the proper writing if you wanna do things right.

Also, this gives you various skills you can train separately and deliberately.

At least those are some advices I've found here and there which really seem to make sense. Hope it helps.

When you try to learn something new, you shouldn't try to grasp everyting at once. This would be setting yourself up for failure.

** I've only posted a couple of one-shots. When I did, I included a little disclaimer about how my dialog was not the greatest. I was expecting some negative reviews, but all the reviews I received were all positive. Some agreed with me on my dialog portions, but still liked my stories despite that.

Bottom line, don't be your own worst enemy. No one can criticize your own story more than you can.

** I mean, making sure to spellcheck and doing your research gets you pretty far for a good fic. If you don't want to have OOC characters, sit down and reread the books while jotting notes. Read guides to writing. It won't magically make your writing very funny, but at least it'll steer you in the right direction. Research the elements you're adding to the setting. It's a lot of work, but if you really are aiming to write a good fic it's worthwhile.

** Duuuuude. I have only ever attempted one, and it lies abandoned in my shame. It ended up being so well received and getting a lot of readers, but I am TERRIBLE for getting bogged down in unnecessary detail and overly verbose prose. Then the pressure I began putting on myself to keep posting, to finish it, to do it well, not to disappoint anyone, after it became this fucking /behemoth/ of a story (+250k!!!), I just ran away from it.

I have so much admiration for any author who can write a well written story and end it in a satisfying fashion. Don't even get me started on the people who have a litany of incredibly well written, finished stories in their arsenal. I have no idea how they do it!
