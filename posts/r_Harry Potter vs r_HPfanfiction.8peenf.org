** I think you're just obviously going to have two very separate types of communities. Ironically, you probably wouldn't be able to classify [[/r/HarryPotter]] as you have if this community didn't exist.

[[/r/HPfanfiction]] has a (relatively) large amount of subscribers. We show up on Google searches relatively often, as well. This means that if someone is searching for Fanfiction, odds are they land here before [[/r/HarryPotter]], despite the fact that [[/r/HarryPotter]] is /a much larger/ sub.

Because of that, the people who reach [[/r/HarryPotter]] are much less likely to be looking for Fanfiction. Meaning that while [[/r/HarryPotter]] is filled with excuberant fans who love the universe probably just as much as anyone from [[/r/HPfanfiction]], you're much less likely to find them tearing the universe apart and poking at it as you are here. Naturally that leads to much more in-depth conversation and debate than you're going to find from a sub that's predominantly not filled with people looking to expand upon the books.

On the other side, you're also probably less likely to find smug, know-it-all pricks on [[/r/HarryPotter]] as well. I love you guys, but don't deny it. We all relish in the "Gotcha!" moments when we get to hold our mostly-irrelevant-attention-to-minutia over another poster's head.

But, anyways, I was hooked immediately after. I remember waiting for Half-Blood Prince and going to my local library at the midnight release of Deathly Hallows.

Believe me, you weren't missing /too/ much. The midnight release of Death Hallows was, looking back on, very cringey, even if it's kind of a fond memory. I remember they "randomly" sorted us. I was so disappointed to get Hufflepuff, at the time.

Nostalgia, sorry.

** GoF was released in 2005, so I couldn't have read it 15 years ago. I got my school memories mixed up (I flipped between 5 schools between 2nd and 8th grade). I would have been in 6th grade, actually, so about 12 years ago.

** I like the general HP subreddit for casual browsing, but I hate bringing up any topics that I've thought about in depth because of fan fic up on that subreddit. Just mentioning a Dramione fic got me downvotes because "Dramione isn't realistic", let alone my opinions on wand ownership/lore or the epilogue. This subreddit has its faults (I'm tired of telling people that Lilly is a real name, it's my name, even though it's definitely misspelled in most fan fic) but I still prefer discussions here.

*** To be fair, you're going to get Dramione-hate nearly universally unless you're in a Dramione-specific community.

I think the relationship would have an interesting dynamic in an AU or perhaps as adults after both have matured and Draco has had a radical change of opinion.

I really dislike fics that blame the fighting and hatred between Draco and “The Golden Trio” as some kind of unresolved sexual tension, though. It feels thrown together and lazy, especially considering Draco literally believes them to be the scum of the Earth.

Granted, Draco is a teenager who's been indoctrinated with those beliefs, but at a certain point you have to just point out that he's blatantly ignorant. He's been in school with these people for 7 years, after all. Indoctrination alone, when faced with so much evidence to the contrary over such a long period of time, isn't enough of an explanation.

I'd really like to read a story where Draco's (or some other similar character) views change over time; Not because of a romantic push, but just seeing how obviously false their views are. A relationship with Hermione (or some other muggleborn) could be a happenstance of this, but I wouldn't want that to be the REASON for their personality change.

Yeah, in my opinion it's not the Dramione type of relationship itself that is unrealistic, it's just Draco himself. He's a little shitstain, that's all there is to it. /Nobody/ wants to date that kind of person in their teenage years.

***** I suppose, technically. Though his attitude didn't change much immediately, his beliefs shifted WAY too quickly for me. They did a single science experiment that immediately put Draco's life upside-down and other than being royally pissed off about it didn't seem to introspectively question the results at all.

To be honest, though, that's kind of just a result of HPMOR's generally science-wank and Mature!Children story-writing.

If it's a HP/DM or HG/DM pairing I'll usually steer away because I've been conditioned by years of poorly written wank-fics which make me cringe so hard I nearly shed my skin. But it's not that I hate the pairing itself.

**** That's why I love Columbrina's fics so much. Most of her Dramione has their relationship starting several years post-Hogwarts when Draco has had a chance to grow up. Dramione is one of my favorite ships, but pretty much only if the story is set post-Hogwarts/DH because it really is only plausible if Draco gets over himself first.

*** I don't really get this, I find it easy to both critique something and look at the flaws it has and still enjoy it. Almost nothing in life and in art (specifically music is what I critique most) is perfect. I have always found it interesting to look at something and try. to see the flaws in it. I honestly get a certain sense of enjoyment about doing that too though. Another thing to add is that, while critiquing something is about looking at the flaws it's also about looking at what is done well too.

I know what you said is mostly tongue in cheek, but I just really felt like I needed to say this.
