** this is my fave fanfic type of fic. If you have any reccs that I haven't mentioned please lmk

************

I can give more details about why the relationships are messed up in these fics, but idk how much info people consider spoilers.

***************

nonslash Voldemort raises harry: linkffn(In Death Standby). I know what you're thinking. Every voldemort raises harry fic has a way too kind voldemort. This voldemort is not kind, not loving, but they still have a close messed-up relationship. Funny too.

*********************************

in character Tom Riddle (tomarry):

linkffn(Their Verdict of Vagaries) by angstier. Harry is a little OOC in that he's more passive than I envision his canon character. However, Tom Riddle is definitely a sociopath and their relationship is very messed up.

*********************************

Most canon Harry and canon Voldemort Harrymort pairing I have read:

linffn(The Cave incident) and linkffn(Mirrored) : same author. More humorful than the other ones i'm reccing, particularly cave incident. As far as your request for a tom who doesn't sacrifice himself, cave incident is a good example of this. Harry and Voldemort are stuck in a cave by themselves, trying to get out before they starve to death. Their magic is inaccessible. They have an unusual every-man-for-himself alliance.

​

Obsidian Pen: No Glory, and the Haunted and Hunted Series. These are on ao3, and are locked, so you need an ao3 account to access it. Very very messed up Harrymort relationship. Most sociopathic Voldemort of all that I have recced and closest to canon Voldemort. Haunted and Hunted more so than No Glory.

​

linkao3(In Death We Seek Devotion): Souls are reborn into another person every couple of decades. Riddle keeps killing his soulmate Harry, because Harry keeps reincarnating as a muggle. Riddle keeps killing him, so that Harry will reborn hopefully as a wizard next time.

************************************************************

​

other reccs: linkffn(Animus, Anima: English Version), linkffn(Solace in Shadows), linkffn(Butterfly Heart)

*****************************************************

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort lives, Harry does not. In which Tom Riddle has been purposefully killing his soulmate every time they reincarnate. Kill an individual enough times, when all they want is to be cared for and loved, to be accepted---of course they will come back different. They become someone else.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

  In limbo, Harry makes another choice and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them? Time travel, UA but as canon as possible. HPTR - COMPLETE

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal inspired. After recent events in his life, Hermione refers Harry to the renowned psychiatrist, Doctor T. Riddle. He is unlike anything Harry ever expected or imagined, and soon proves to be a great help against the very shadows and name that haunts his waking hours. If only it remained that simple.
