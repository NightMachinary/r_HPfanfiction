~scribbles down a few plot ideas:~

- Harry gets the three Deathly Hallows at the same time.\\
- It turns out that the Peverells didn't create the Hallows; they unearthed them from a temple in Ancient Egypt.\\
- Harry becomes the Master of Death; with the Hallows being of Ancient Egyptian origin, he becomes Anubis.\\
- Because gods are shaped by belief, and the furry fandom has been...busy...'Harrubis' is not only a God of the Dead, but also a symbol of sodomy and lust.\\
- Harry stays hidden under the Invisibility Cloak for the rest of the story because he doesn't want to be a furry god of fucking.

"Harry, come out from under there." Hermione ordered.\\
"No." The voice under the Invisibility Cloak answered.\\
Ron chose that moment to speak up, "What's wrong, anyway? You haven't let anyone see you for hours. Since before you went to retrieve Dumbledore's wand, the Elder Wand thingy."\\
"I'm ugly." Harry's voice answered, "And sexy. It's complicated."\\
Hermione looked at Ron with a worried expression, "Did becoming Master of Death change your appearance in some way, Harry?" she asked the invisible boy in the room.\\
"It certainly changed his magic. That whole army of Death Eaters and You-Know-/Voldemort/, just, boom!" Ron commented.\\
There was a pause, then Harry responded. "Yeah...it made me different. More powerful. A god of death. But I look like..."\\
Another pause, before he continued, "I went to Madam Pomfrey and showed her, but she couldn't do anything...and at the end she had this really weird look, like she wanted to shag me or something."\\
Hermione and Ron shared raised eyebrows; even though Harry had just destroyed Voldemort, /that/ seemed a bit of an extreme reaction.\\
"Look, just let us see." Hermione said gently, "It's not like you, I don't know, look the splitting image of your Uncle Vernon now, do you?"\\
There was the sound of a coughing fit from Ron at the same time a sniggering noise came from under the Cloak, before Harry sighed, "...Alright."\\
And he removed the Invisibility Cloak.

Hermione's first thought was that Harry had become some sort of werewolf; he was a couple of heads taller, his body was covered in a coat of jet black fur, and his head was distinctly lupine (and currently giving her sad puppy dog eyes).\\
His robes were stretched tightly across his chest, barely reaching down to his furry knees, his trousers were bursting and showing his black fur, and just under his belt was a subtle (which is to say, /gargantuan/) bulge in a very suspicious location.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
Hermione continued to stare (her gaze drifting towards the suspect bulge in Harry's pants more than once), and so did Ron, though the latter was mouthing rapidly as though he were doing some very quick thinking.\\
"Well, you don't look like your Uncle Vernon, at least..." Hermione finally managed.\\
"Or Aunt Pe-" Harry started, but was interrupted when Ron blurted out "ANUBIS!"\\
Hermione and the furry Harry turned to looked at Ron, who was smiling as though he had won a championship chess game, "Harry, mate, I get it now, you're Anubis! As in the Ancient Egyptian god!"\\
Hermione turned back to Harry and tilted her head before she nodded, "I can see that...but the three Deathly Hallows were made by the Peverell brothers, what do they have to do with Egypt?"\\
Ron shook his head, "They didn't make them, Hermione, they stole them! When I was in Egypt on holiday that time, we went and saw...I forgot what it was called, some Shrine of the Guardian of the Dead. It used to hold a staff, a robe and a ring that together allowed their wearer to wield the power of the guardian of the dead, Anubis. But it was robbed of the artifacts in the 13th century! The Peverells must have taken the artifacts and transfigured them to hide the theft!"\\
Harry tilted his head, "Are you sure of that? It'd explain this..."\\
Ron nodded, "I'm sure...but, uh, mate, about the elephant in the room...why the trouser snake? Er, trouser basilisk?"

And that was when Luna Lovegood wandered into the room and waved, "Hello Ron, hello Hermione, hello, um, Mr. Lupin...?"\\
"I'm Harry." Harry sighed, his previous desire to not be seen considerably mitigated by, well, it was Luna, "What are you up to, Luna?"\\
Luna opened her mouth to answer, then paused, thought about it, and shrugged, "Plot device? By the way, did you know that you look very much like that Anubis god that some muggles worship?"\\
Harry, Ron, and Hermione all nodded at about the same time, having covered that about 15-20 seconds ago.\\
Luna took that as her cue to elaborate. "Daddy did a report on them, once, because he thought that the muggles might be trying to do magic. Apparently there's a group, called 'Furry Fandom', and they dress up in animal suits to try and become Animagi..."\\
("I think the costumes are just because they enjoy it." Hermione muttered under her breath.)\\
"And they draw a lot of art of Anubis, a surprising amount of which has him having sex. And Dad says that belief is key to shaping a god, so it's like they're trying to give Anubis incredible sex powers."

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-4
   :END:
Everyone in the room stared wide-eyed at Luna, before turning to stare at each other.\\
"There we go, then." Ron summed up, "There's muggles that worship you and think you have a big dick, so you have a big dick, Harry."\\
"Language." Hermione reprimanded Ron, though she didn't object to his reasoning.\\
Harry stared at them both (and spared a glance for Luna) before he ducked down, "That's it, I'm going back under the cloak. Forever."\\
"Harry, you can't just hide forever. It's only a cosmetic difference..." Hermione tried to cajole him.\\
"No it isn't!" the once-again invisible Harry-Anubis countered, "I know what Pomfrey wanted to do to me! She wanted to jump my bones! I'm not being a bloody bestiality sex symbol!"

   :END:
While Hermione (and Luna, after a few minutes) tried to coax Harry into coming out again, Ron was visibly thinking, again.\\
"Wait, guys, listen..." he spoke up after a while, "Harry could probably go back to normal if the Deathly Hallows were placed back in that temple. You have to be the wielder of the Hallows to be Master of Death, I think."\\
There was a silence at Ron's suggestion, before Harry poked his jackal head out from under the Cloak, "That's worth a shot, but I'm not going out there looking like this. I'm not interested in a furry harem comedy fanfic, thank you."\\
Ron shrugged, "I'll take them, then. If you're not the current wielder, you should go back to normal."\\
Hermione raised her eyebrows, "Yeah, but then /you'd/ be turned into Anubis. An Anubis with an enormous penis."\\
("Say that ten times fast." Luna quietly added.)\\
Ron sort of half-smiled, "Well, yeah, but I don't mind. My name anagrams and everything. I can live with being 'I, Droll Anubis Weasley' for...I dunno, a few weeks?"\\
Harry hesitated, "Well, if you're sure...please-take-it." And then he hurriedly tossed his wand, stone and invisibility cloak in a heap at Ron.

Ron vanished under the Invisibility Cloak for a few seconds, before his voice came out, "Hey, it worked!"\\
The Cloak was removed; in Ron's place was a tall, jackal-headed biped with short red fur matching his former hair colour; his robes, already a bit worn out, had torn to bits, exposing his muscular furry chest, and his trousers were barely containing his own gratuitously oversized bulge.\\
As for Harry, he had...\\
...\\
...Not changed at all. He was still a tall black jackal-headed humanoid, whose look of elation was slowly turning into a scrunched up frustrated expression (which looked very strange on a dog's face).

"Fuck." Harry muttered.\\
Hermione's gaze drifted between the two Anubites, her gaze lingering on Ron's furry red chest.\\
"Don't tempt me." She answered dryly.

Draco stays away from what he thinks is a creature-inheritance fic.

#+begin_quote
  Draco looked up and down the pair of barely-clothed jackal-headed men, whose Invisibility Cloak had been snagged on a passing suit of armor at exactly the wrong time.\\
  "Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley, I presume?" he asked, surprisingly cordially.\\
  The red-furred jackal nodded, "Yeah. Why are you being so civil, Malfoy?"\\
  Draco just looked at Ron in a patronising way, "I thought it was obvious; this is clearly a creature-inheritance fic. You both suddenly transformed into the author's furry fantasy the moment you came of age. And if I spend too much time around you then I will no doubt be afflicted by some narrative travesty like," the blond not-currently-a-ponce shuddered, "being a 'male veela' and 'seeking a mate'."\\
  His expression with that line left no doubt as to whom would be candidates for the mate in question. Harry and Ron stared at each other, looking horrified; Ron's bulge in his trousers even seemed to shrink a little.\\
  "So, I'm staying well away." Draco continued, "No rivalry, no politics, no bashing, I am the merest background character in your adventure. So good day to you Potter and Weasley and I hope never to speak to you again."\\
  And then Draco Malfoy turned around and completely ignored the two well-endowed furries standing in the hall.

In Worthy of Magic, the author portrays the ‘void' extremely well, but I feel the power in the spell(?) that created the desert would have killed him without aid, it is possible since he describes himself as a vessel, the one controlling him sent him enough energy or magic to keep him from dying from magical exhaustion.

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
