:END:
So I've read this fic a few months ago and I can't find it. In it Harry's parents lived and Harry's brother was the BWL. Because he wanted to help his brother he became some kind of spy for Dumbledore and the Order but the Order and Harry's family didn't know. He worked his way up to Voldemorts right hand while Voldemort thought he was loyal to him bc he killed Moody (he was dying anyway because some kind of curse was killing him slowly). Daphne became a lawyer and went strongly against Death Eaters. She is also the only one who knows that Harry is a spy. The first chapter starts after Voldemort's death and with Harry's trial.
