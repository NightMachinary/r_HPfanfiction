Fan fictions are a very enjoyable and beautiful feature of an author's canon, and especially so in case of the Harry Potter world where fans want to live their most desired fantasies in a fictional world which isn't always possible through the canon. For example, many fans badly want Sirius and Lupin to survive the Hogwarts battle as Harry should have at least some parent figure to look forward to post the Hogwarts battle. Others want many details of the story altered. For instance, they can't stand Harry being all so soft with the "nice guy" attitude, but want him to be bolder and more aggressive.

Then there are all kinds of parings since the canonical Harry/Ginny pair doesn't seem acceptable to many. For one, Ginny has got what amounts to a "fan-girl syndrome" towards Harry since her childhood, which means she could be a great fan or admirer of Harry, but not someone close and intimate who truly understands him. Many fans feel that Harry/Hermione (Harmony) could have made a great couple for this reason as Hermione is quite capable of filling that intimacy gap. I've read a lot of fics along this line on fanfiction.net. Another school of theorists fantasize that Harry/Luna could have made a better couple since their chemistry is so much in tune.

** We already had that article here once and it is completely overselling the "issue". The pairing is neither new nor trending

"Seduced by older, attractive woman" is a common fantasy and Harry being able to tell Malfoy that he fucked his mother last night would be the burn of the century if he had the photographic evidence on hand. You don't need a deeper justification to sell it.

And lastly, there are countless pairings which are more immersion breaking and yet more popular, just look at anything involving actual Death Eaters (like Narcissas son and husband).
