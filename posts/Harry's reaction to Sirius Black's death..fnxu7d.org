In the end of Book 5, Harry looks at Cho Chang in the train and thinks how his life has changed to the one with Sirius and one without Sirius in it. But in the beginning of Book 6, he is back to being totally normal, even Lupin is not very upset over Sirius' death and the Weasleys and Hermione are happy bashing Fleur. Only Tonks is shown to be sad, but even she is upset over Lupin.

Sirius is my favorite character, I can never get over how casually his death was treated in the HBP.


** I've noticed that in general Harry Potter books kinda start over, with many themes of the previous book just disappearing. Here are some glaring examples:

1. Harry never visits the Chamber of Secrets again, and Dumbledore doesn't ask him to open the entrance for him. Even though the Basilisk is dead, surely there is much interesting to see. However, everyone just forgets all about it until the Basilisk's fang becomes plot-relevant again.

2. In GoF Harry is desperate to get help from Sirius, but he totally forgets about Lupin. Keep in mind that Harry had one evening to bond with Sirius, but an entire year to bond with Lupin who taught him the Patronus and all. Lupin was in a much better position to help Harry with the Triwizard Tournament because he was not a fugitive, but still Harry never contacts him.

3. Also in GoF, no one ever suggests that Harry's participation in the Tournament could have been caused by Sirius. Apart from Harry and a few others, everyone thinks Sirius escaped from Azkaban in order to kill Harry. Everyone knows Sirius managed to enter Hogwarts three times within the last year. The previous year the Ministry went to considerable lengths to keep Harry safe, but suddenly, in the next book, the crisis has been totally forgotten, as if the Ministry knew that Sirius was not a threat.

*** 4.Nobody even tries to suggest to Umbridge that even if Voldemort isn't back, they should still be ready to defend themselves against other dark wizards. Like Sirius Black, who was suspected of kidnapping Harry and killing Cedric. Of course it's bullshit, but Umbridge couldn't just admit that, could she.

**** Hell yes. I know that Umbridge was just out to get Harry, and the only potential outcomes would have been to be humiliated by her or punished for "his lack of respect", but Harry is supposed to have a lot of sass, except when scenario say he doesn't.

"Why do you someone could attack you outside of school", asked Umbridge.\\
"I don't know" said Harry, "Sirius Black is still out there, and 2 years ago, the Ministry seemed to think he was really dangerous".

I really don't understand Lupin's character, he never tried to keep in touch with Harry for 13 years. And when he finally does meet him, he doesn't tell anything about being his parents' best friend until Harry mentions hearing his father's voice during the patronus lessons. Then he is almost non existent in year 4 and 5. And inspite of so many people considering wolfstar as canon, he doesn't really grieve much after sirius' death. Finally in the deathly hallows he decides to accompany Harry, but that is just his way to avoid a pregnant Tonks.

Makes me wonder why James and Sirius went through the trouble of becoming animagus for him, lol.

**** Lupin never contacting Harry: he didn't exist till book 3, and once he existed, can't go telling Harry relevant information before the halfway mark of the book!

He stops existing: he's a “book 3” character so clearly he can't help in book 4 /s In book 5 an argument could be made for him being too busy trying to sway the werewolves to not join Voldy to be seen elsewhere

Sirius' death: /no one/ grieves properly for Sirius, after the end of book five it's like it never happened

Running away from Tonks: this one continues to baffle me, not that he ran, but that he ran before he even knew if the baby would be like him. But the real reason it happened was to deprive the trio of any adult help for the Horcrux quest.

Basically it all boils down to “people, spells, and potions only exist when JKR needs them to exist”

** Harry's initial reactions were to /crucio/ Bellatrix and trash Dumbledore's office. Dumbledore let him vent and then laid the prophesy on him. Harry still walked around in a daze for the remainder of term and even tried to ... I guess find a loophole by seeking out Sir Nicholas. The ghost really did help put things into perspective.

***** I don't think they do - they have more evidence than we do but nothing definite. Ghosts are imprints? Souls? of people who have decided to remain on this plane (earth). They don't know anything about the afterlife. Voldemort shows that there exists a state where one can survive incorperally. However, he is still clearly in this plane - he hasnt gone beyond. The resurrection stone (which harry doesent know about yet) is the strongest evidence wizardkind have. It brings back people who seem to know too much to be mere memory manifestations - however we don't know for sure AND no one knows about it apart from a select few very learned individuals.

By far the strongest evidence there is for afterlife is Harry's journey into limbo. He meets Dumbledore who knows things Harry does not. He see's a shard of voldemort - a soul shard which points to a sign that limbo is indeed a stopping point for souls (something outside the material plane). He sees a train which would take him beyond and knows from the stone that people seem to be able to be called back. He knows this must be real in some way because he was hit by a killing curse.

He didn't know the strong evidence until his seventh year however.

*** Even with Luna's talk and Sir Nicholas, he still would have been hurting and torn up inside. Especially given that he saw it happen and how it happened. Going from enraged and grieving to almost completely normal in just a few short weeks is completely unrealistic for a grieving process. That shit can and most often does take months or even years, and it leaves you forever changed.

** There's a nice little oneshot that attempts to address this issue. Basically, while on Dumbledore-enforced isolation at Privet Prison over the summer, he meets a girl at the park who has recently lost a family member. They bond over their mutual grief, and for a few weeks he finally has somebody to talk to, albeit she is a fellow sufferer and not a professional.

And then the f-ing Oblivation squad comes along and wipes both their memories. So his grief is "buffered" but he doesn't have any clue why.

** The scene where Harry becomes undone in Dumbledore's office is one that never fails to bring a tear to my eye when I read it.

With the benefit of an adult perspective and better understanding of good writing, I am of the opinion (that is shared by many) that HBP was the lowest point of the series in terms of writing quality and story telling. He /absolutely/ should be torn up about Sirius through the whole book, but since that was a “last book problem” it gets toned down to ridiculous levels.

It's why I like so many of the “Harry smartens the fuck up” fics where he channels his self loathing, guilt, and anger into training himself to put Voldemort in the ground. Instead we get more “just skimming along” Harry who acts like he /hasn't/ just been told he has to fight a dangerous Dark Lord to the death, and teenage drama, and nobody goddamn listening to Harry about Malfoy. Cause not listening to Harry has gone sooooo well for anyone for the past five books.

** Yeah, this has always bugged me. JKR didn't handle grieving process realistically at all and Harry would not be 'back to normal' in just a few short weeks over the summer. The incidents with Sir Nicholoas and Luna certainly would have helped, but he'd still be torn up inside and hurting perhaps for months on end. I lost someone very dear to me when I wasn't much older than Harry and it blew up my entire world, and I'm still not entirely over it. So from experience? Harry got over Sirius's death much too quickly and easily. Especially given how it happened and that he witnessed it. I can attest that something like that will make it hit even harder than it would have.

**** No fam. I didn't because my history is quite similar to Harry's at the Dursley's and I have a stupid high amount of loss and suffering which I spent years suppressing. And from hard experience? You can only take so much before you burst and lose your shit entirely, and Sirius would have been a tipping point. JKR wrote his response to the abuse very poorly and she wrote his reaction to Sirus very poorly.

****** Fanfic has a concept for this. They're called mindhealers and even they can't work miracles.

Magic at most would speed things along somewhat, but to be blunt? Healing takes time and even magic could only do so much. It would not have shortened his grief and mouring into a nice neat few week period. Not to mention he had all the other shit you mentioned, and having untreated trauma makes any further much worse. Further traumatic events can and will worsen prexisting trauma as well, and its entire cascade and a real clusterfuck.

Again. I speak from long experience.

JKR dropped the ball. If that was her intent, she should have shown it and not left a unrealistic grieiving period or response to abuse.

"rue, but magic probably changes emotions and dealing with trauma."

Yeah no. Being a wizard wouldn't give one an innate resistence to psychological trauma or grief. Otherwise Harry wouldn't have been shwoing very clear signs of PTSD due to Cedric's death.
