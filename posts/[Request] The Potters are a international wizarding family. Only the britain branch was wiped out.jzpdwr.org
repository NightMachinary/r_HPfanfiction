** linkffn(The Power of the Potters by RockIll). The Australian branch of the family makes contact with Harry.

There used to be a story on fffnet called "Harry Potter a Clockwork Mage," in which James and Lily learn that Dumbledore's been manipulating their memories, so they join the US branch of the Potter family, but it's been removed.

#+begin_quote
  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings. Betaed by Marc the Unruly

** Harry is taken by his relatives upon his parents' deaths. He vanishes into their family, and noone in britain ever sees him again. His family keeps him safely out of the way somewhere else, he lives a good life and Voldemort is eventually destroyed by the greater wizarding community when he tries to expand his conquest out of the ruins of magical britain, towards the european continent.

** There was a piece of fanfiction where Harry tries to connect with the other branches of the Potter family. All I can remember is that one of his cousins tried to sort of take over and Harry betrothed her to Draco to get rid of her.
