** Yeah... Not sure where all that Ron-hate is stemming from. I think it's more than overdue for him to get a well-done treatment as a Villain Protagonist.

I like it. The writing is solid, there's a good hook at the opening, and it hints at turning something I generally hate ("Technomancy") on its head. Hope all goes well! :)

** The writing is good and I'm intrigued. Have a hard time with Ron being a this guy though. Even in the epilogue he had to cheat to get his driving license.

****** Dumbledore being manipulative is not a problem - he has the experience, and the skills, and the knowledge to manipulate people, and he certainly needs to manipulate people to save Britain. It's the "evil" part that's the cliche, and the fact that in many stories, he's easily outwitted by kids.

******* Well the manipulative side to Dumbledore's character is never implicitly stated, and despite his flaws he definitely does try his best. I can't deal with fics that make Dumbledore evil or too overtly manipulative--he's much more subtle than that.

**** I was also really into the story, until you mentioned Ron. Can't suspend my disbelief that far and I really doubt I could keep reading long enough for you to explain that away.

Why not use someone else? One of Harry's kids, an Auror, a classmate, even Hermione is more believable than Ron.

***** Ron's not as dumb or as much of a dick as people think. Remember that for two years, he wasn't even using a wand that choose him--imagine how that would stifle him academically.

Also, in the movies he got completely gutted as a character. Many of his nice lines in the books were removed. I think the Ron hate is a bit unwarranted. Sure, he's flawed--but he's a good friend despite them. Think about the train ride in the first book. He's willing to share one of his only sandwiches with a guy he doesn't even know.

Most people only seem to focus on the flaws that he has as a person (most of them correct themselves as time goes on) which is also realistic.

** I like it. I usually find Ron to be the character I find easiest to dislike (other than The Toad, of course), but I think I might enjoy this portrayal. The development of someone from not knowing what electricity is, to technomancer extraordinaire. Hope it goes well! Post again when you get it up on a site.

***** It's probably because a fair amount of people are sick of 'let's take anything interesting for Ron and give it to Hermione.' People who actually like the character get defensive (myself included.)

****** Pointing out that "magical research" fits Hermione isn't exactly taking away anything from Ron. He hasn't ever been portrayed as the research type in canon. I like Ron very much, but I generally see him as more the strategy/tactics/action type.
