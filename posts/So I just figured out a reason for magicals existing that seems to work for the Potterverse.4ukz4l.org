I wrote a few pages of a Harry Potter/Prophecy^{2} crossover^{1} some time ago and I was thinking about adding to it when I realized WHY magicals exist. Magicals are the descendants of Nephilim^{3.}

It works, right? 'Magical' powers is basically a given due to their being the sons of god mating with the daughters of man. And since Harry Potter is a Christ Allegory, it fits even better in the HP'verse.

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/34/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery][Prophecy]]

2. Does Prophecy even contain a prophecy in it?

3. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim][Wikipedia]]


** It's more than a little weird to compare Nephilim and Christ, seeing as the former are cursed beings that were never meant to exist in biblical canon, and aren't even divine. Dunno about Prophecy, though.

Edit: also this explains almost nothing, what with the existence of squibs and muggleborns

*** Actually depending on the translation you use Nephilim can be read as "Heroes" or "leaders" of men and has been thought to refer to men of taller stature. Not just the common monstrous interpretation.

However, when you take in the reference to them in the story of the deluge (which was in part to destroy the Nephilim who had developed a taste for the blood and flesh of man) and their other appearances in apocryphal texts they seem to have more in common with Vampires than Angels.

**** "Son(s) of God" is also an appellation given to the descendants of Adam through his third son Seth. There's an alternative interpretation where the Nephilim are the offspring of Seth's and the marked Cain's children.

In any case, they were apparently violent and bloodthirsty creatures that warranted wiping out all of creation to rid the Earth of. Harry Potter would be a lot more metal if that's what wizards actually descended from, aaaaaand now I want to write a Bible/HP crossover

***** Precisely.

Colour me impressed. Most people aren't aware of there being essentially 3 falls and not one. 1. Shemyaza and the renegade angels who refused to give up their wives/children who were then attacked/destroyed/imprisoned by the Seraphim. 2. The Morningstar, and "I shall not kneel" and the rebellion against God (The one prople know about most commonly, Satan's fall from grace). Which honestly can be viewed as an argument for free will and self governance and in which some figures suggest "fully two thirds the host of heaven" was swept away and fell. 3. The Children of Seth leaving the mountain to mingle with and be corrupted by the Children of Cain in their brightly coloured clothes on the plain below. That marked the end of textual efforts of God to maintain a "chosen" people.

Next time you're in the IRC hit me up and we'll chat, i have an original work in which some of this features.

*** Squibs are the result of inbreeding and muggleborns are the result of squibs' decendants breeding and reinforcing the magic enough to finally rekindle the magic in their child/ren.

Not canon

Also not canon

Also both things that would hold, if true, even if magic were the result of some distant ancestor eating too many bananas

****** There is canon beyond that. Not everything needs to have a big "this is talking about X thing" hanging on it.

In this case, we have a wizarding family that's the epitome of inbreeding, and all three extant members were not squibs. Ergo, your squibs as the result of inbreeding theory needs polishing at best and is simply wrong at worst.

******* Everything has degrees. I didn't say ONE SINGLE INSTANCE of inbreeding causes squibdom, though, admittedly, that could be inferred by my statement.
