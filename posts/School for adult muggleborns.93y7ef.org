I was just thinking; the Dursleys weren't able to prevent Harry from going to Hogwarts because of his birth parents' desires, but there have got to be plenty of muggleborn students whose parents don't want them going off to a magic school either; who would either keep them home to conceal their abilities or just come up with coping mechanisms to fly under the radar.

Are there any stories with this sort of character? Introduced to the magical world as an adult, already with bad habits of using magic incorrectly, and being taught the proper use of it?


** In Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches the character "Claire" fits your criteria. She goes to a smaller school called "The Shoe" and all the students alongside her are 11 years old. She is around 20 years old by the time she goes; her parents didn't want her to go.

** Not exactly what you're looking for but iirc there's a fic where the dursleys are able to prevent harry from going to school and then he learns about magic when he's like 17.

I think its called all at once.
