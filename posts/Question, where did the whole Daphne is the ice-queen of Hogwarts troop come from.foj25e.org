It's just that I honestly can't remember any mention of her at any of the books or the movies, but in most stories featuring her she receives this denomination, be it deserved or not. I'm curious to know how it began.


** I seem to remember someone saying it all began with smut and harem fanfics. Someone saw her name and decided they needed a tsundere, probably.

** Fanon Draco turned girl for those who enjoy m/f. There are mid-late 2000 fics that call him something like the Slytherin Prince and/or Ice King. Many of them gave him blue eyes, made him very handsome, and super smart.
