Hi all! I'm looking for your favorite Draco Malfoy fics. I haven't read a ton of Malfoy fics in the past, but I've read and loved a few recently where he's featured (Hermione Granger's Crammer for Delinquents on the Run; The Pureblood Pretense & sequels; Victoria Potter) and have enjoyed how he's been characterized, and would like to dip my toes in a bit further.

At this point, I'm looking for things that are as close to canon-compliant as possible, ideally set at Hogwarts. I've run across a few recommendations for post-Hogwarts fics that I plan to check out later, but I'd love to start with Draco at school.

Thanks in advance!


** Okay this one is set in book 7. I don't think it changes anything canon until later in the story. I really enjoyed it.
