At one point, I would have suggested this one. But it stopped being about either Harry Potter characters or Sherlock Holmes after a bit, so I dropped it. Has it gotten any better about OCs taking over?

*** Natural 20 is hilarious, and I know nothing about D+D or roleplaying. Chapter 21, where Milo gets hit by an Imperius Curse, has to be one of the funniest pieces of writing I've seen.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-Who-Was-Promised][The Prince Who Was Promised]] by cxjenious (XOver with A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones) is shaping up to be very good. It's written more in Martin's style than Rowling, but Harry is still Harry, even in Westeros.

#+begin_quote
  He remembered being Harry Potter. Dreamed of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature of ice and death, with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a 'spare', but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.
