:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic where the runes work because wizards all over the world believe they work, so harry creates a lot of some sort of fake minds that all they do is believe a language he creates, works, and he keeps creating new improved versions of the language. I know i've read it once, but can't find it again

*** it gets really fucking weird later on, be warned.

like, vivid descriptions of how "sculpted" a 12 year old is, and wow now that I write it out like that, it sounds really fucked up actually. Not inaccurate, though.

So beware. Read at your own peril. Don't remember where I made it before the urge to vomit at the author's diatribes became too strong and I abandoned it.

**** Yeah, but it's actually not that bad compared to some others i've read, so my bar is pretty low. At least it doesn't have actual sex, and some kids do start puberty early at eleven.

When you get eleven year olds flirting, making out, and in some cases, a goddammed harem, THEN it gets weird

*** Yup, that's it, thank you. Funny thing is i skipped this fic at least twice when searching, i thought the runes would be a main part of the story, so when i didn't see it in the description, i skipped.
