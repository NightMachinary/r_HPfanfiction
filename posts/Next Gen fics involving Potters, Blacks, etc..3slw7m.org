  Three years after the Battle of Hogwarts magical Britain is in a mess. This is the historical record of how Harry Potter became Lord-Baron Potter Black, amongst other titles. Multiple sources now present how Harry changed wizarding society forever with the help of trusted friends, a house elf and Gringotts. Non-canon compliant. Not a part of the Professor Muggle series.
