My theory is that it's an attempt at magical artificial intelligence as a response to muggle computers and Moore's Law.

Paintings are somewhat intelligent but you can't really use them to do complex tasks other than language processing and conversations.

Artificial brains could do complex tasks that muggle computers can do more effectively. But from what we see in OOTP, they haven't managed to get them to behave correctly yet.

The room with the planets might be an attempt at a space program with interplanetary portkeys.

The time room is obviously where they build time turners.

What other things do you think go on in the Department of Mysteries?


** Because if you kept them on a shelf they would dry out?

In Harry Potter is seems like consciousness is equated with the soul as opposed to the mind/brain. Even though Riddle is reduced to a creature of spirit with no body, he retains all of his memory and personality. When a new body is created for him, he can work his magic. He is his soul, not his brain.

Frank and Alice Longbottom were tortured to the point of insanity. This is a problem with their minds, not their brains (as I don't /think/ that curse has any physical effects as far as the books are concerned).

Lockhart lost the majority of his memories /and/ the ability to form new memories. This seems to be mostly a brain problem, as his personality is intact.

Maybe in the brain room they are researching the interaction between brain and mind in order to extrapolate what is emergent from the physical, and what has to come from the soul (if we look at the mind as property of soul influenced by brain, or a property of brain that is imprinted upon the soul).

*** Consciousness might not be desirable for useful artificial intelligence. Paintings are probably too conscious and wouldn't do what they're supposed to, artificial soulless brains could be used to crunch numbers or simulate interactions of spells.

** My original theory was that the Ministry was testing ways to preserve the minds of the greatest wizards and witches after their natural death, which is actually an idea explored in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths][7062230]]).

  Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.

** Madam Pomfrey called them thoughts and, as we know, JKR speaks through he characters. So, they're the physical form of human thought and they study how it affects magic.

So, in that vein, they research how the non tangible, I suppose, affects magic.

From what I remember, time turners weren't the only things in there. There was that jar of light with the little bird that goes through the cycle of life. They want know "what came first? The chicken or the egg?"

** Magic is magic, it avoids logic so I believe the DoM study concepts rather than details. Death, love and time all have their own rooms thought would fit.
