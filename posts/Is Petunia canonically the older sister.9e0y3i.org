Can someone provide a textual reference that Petunia was the older sister? I simply can't find anything that actually says older or younger. I've looked it up on every "official" source, but they normally fail to specify. Even JK Rowling doesn't state anywhere on Petunia's profile that she's Lily's older sister. She was engaged and married before Lily, but that doesn't mean anything. All of the sudden I'm completely doubting all of my knowledge on Harry Potter because of one line in a fan fiction.


** From Deathly Hallows:

  /There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister./

  /‘Lily, don't do it!'/ */shrieked the elder of the two./*

*** God bless you. I just spent the past half hour rereading PS and HBP. You saved my soul before I started on DH.

**** Wait, you just re-read a good 900+ pages in half-an-hour??!! Tell me your secret.

***** I skim-read and really only paid attention to the beginning of PS and the end. I was looking for any sighting of the word Petunia. Which stands out (for my eyes) in chunks of text. This took me maybe 10 minutes total? Skipped loads of chapters (like Quidditch) in HBP, and spent much longer on the memory sections. So no, not 900+ pages in 30 minutes! But I am very, very good at word searches and a very fast reader (and skimmer). :)

I thought my answer would be in either PS or DH. Should've started backwards!

****** I just had figured it had to be in Snape's memories.

Also did you try searching 'Petunia older sister quotes?' Turns out that also worked when I tested to see if it was online somewhere.

******* I thought it'd be mentioned with the introduction of her character or when Hagrid barges in on them. I also thought it'd be in a memory... but that led me to HBP stupidly. Maybe because I managed to combine Snape revealing himself as the HBP and giving Harry his memories as one occurrence.

I searched 'Petunia older sister', 'Petunia and Lily sister', 'Petunia age' ... I could go on. I looked on Pottermore (but not closely enough because your quote is in a linked section) at the Vernon and Petunia snippet. I also read a bunch of the wikis (under Evans, Lily, Petunia, Harry) but they don't reference quotes which is annoying.

******** I have a cheat way when I'm searching for quotes. Every single Harry Potter book is available as a PDF online-then just use the search to find a relevant quote.

********** Even better, copy and paste the contents of all of them into one text document so you can search all the books at once. Although you do get the chapter titles and numbers when you do that...
