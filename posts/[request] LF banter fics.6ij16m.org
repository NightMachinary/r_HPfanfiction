I have only recently started reading hp fanfiction but have found out my favorite kind of genre pretty early, and it saddens me that I have a hard time finding any fics, so here is my cry for recommendations.

My preferred fics are all about feel good banter with a touch of romance, preferably including some pranking and alcohol.

to use some fics as a starting point, I was absolutely overjoyed reading [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=329915][The Fred Weasley Memorial Scholarship]] , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4355808/1/The-Marauders-Class-of-2018][The Marauders Class of 2018]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10703712/1/How-not-to-be-a-Woodley][How Not To Be A Woodley]]

Normally I would just be searching for next generation fics but those searches only result in sappy rose x scorpius fics (which if there exists one that you think I would like, please don't hesitate to mention it).

I don't know if you guys know any fics that come close to my rambling, half drunkenly written, description, but if you do, please recommend me some because I am yearning for more!!


** You want banter/quips? Background romance? Alcohol?

I got somethin' like that.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** The only Rose/Scorpius fanfiction I've read, and the only one I'll ever read is Delicate. Yes, it's a pregnancy fic, which will never be my cup of tea, but it creates realistic characterization of the next generation, and how they deal with their fame and more. The plot is relatively straightforward, but the characterization is what sets it apart.

Another nextgen fic that I'd recommend is linkffn(Ignite by Slide). Great plot, great characters, and great dialogue. It's the first of a trilogy that's like 600k+ words total. I'm also pretty sure that Slide is a published author

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
