** Wrote it, but then returned and noticed that it's a request and not prompt thread. Well, have it anyway.

  “---And then I wrangled the beast, whipped my wand and cast the Homomorphus Charm---” Lockhart prattled.

  “Did you, perchance, mean the Homorphus Charm, dear boy?”

  “That's what I said.”

  Stifling a sigh, Albus studied the man in front of him. Golden locks, ocean-blue eyes and a bright smile brought back memories of his old love, if Gellert swapped his brain with Aberforth's goat, of course. Oh well, not everybody could be perfect. No teacher had managed to hold the position for longer than a year since Tom's tantrum after being rejected, so Albus long since learned to pick his battles. Gilderoy Lockhart might've gotten a T for his DADA O.W.L., but at least his pleasing appearance would make Minerva's nagging about paperwork and Severus's rants about Harry somewhat bearable during the staff meetings.

  “Welcome to the job.”

** Haha, this is my new headcanon. After decades of the curse, it's unlikely that there were any legit candidates lining up for the job anyway. Might as well.

*** It's mentioned in the books that he was the only applicant that year.

For year 3 we get Lupin, who was probably only convinced to take the position because Black escaped.

Year 4 we have Moody who probably did it as a personal favor to Dumbledore and to be there as extra security with the triwizard cup going on.

Then we have year 5 in which it was mentioned that Dolores was appointed the position by the ministry because a newly passed law allowed them to if there were no applicants available to fill the position. This is referenced again when Trelawny gets fired and Dumbledore was able to hire Firenze on the spot before Umbridge could fill the position with another ministry lackey.

Overall, the mention in book two, along with the inference from book 5, shows that the position has been basically unfillable for years. It got to the point where politically, the ministry knew it could get someone on the inside of Hogwarts immediately if they passed a law that granted them the ability to appoint a person if the situation came up that the headmaster couldn't fill the position himself.

** Actually a few, although them being good is debatable. I think Lightning Lord by Colt01 had it.

There's another that has him hiring him because he reminds him of Gellert, but I can't think of it.

** I don't think so. Nobody knew for certain (before the misshap with the Ron's wand) that Lockhart is truly fraud. Everybody thought he is just incompetent, which is the best what Dumbledore could hope for with the cursed DADA post.
