Essentially just the teachers teaching sex Ed.Preferably Lupin or Snape.All pairings are fine except DE and H/Hr.Slash is all well and good but no bashing.

E:I don't mean in a smut way I mean in a comedic way.


** I've seen quite a few 'Snape teaches SexEd' fics. Not really sure where the idea originated from, but this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2o6ox3/wp_snape_is_forced_to_teach_sexed_at_hogwarts/][writing prompt]] has some well written fills.

There's also this amusing example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/439510/1/Severus-Snape-and-the-SexEd-Snafu][Severus Snape and the SexEd Snafu]] linkffn(439510)

** The only stories I know have other students as "mentors" for the subject. Including mandatory practical lessons.

One is called "Hermione teaches the boys a lesson" and has Hermione teaching a bunch of OCs a practical lesson. Rather odd, and I heard people claim that she is, in fact, a teacher in this one. It is certainly set after the war, but no further specification is made.

There are a few more - no link due to underage - One is called "Training with the Quidditch Chasers" and rather cringe-worthy because it feels American (circumcision, overall language is not British) and the overall premise is the three chasers teaching the trio how to shag.

Even worse we have one where Harry is 13 and the story is of even more dubious quality - but if you really want to read/suffer through it, look for "Sex Education -- Hogwarts' Style" by the author Harry50.

***** At least in the Middle East there's centuries of religious tradition behind why they do it; in the US it was started by the inventor of Corn Flakes as a way to curb masturbation in teenage boys.
