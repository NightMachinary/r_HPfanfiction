My favorite pairing by far, and it seems I've read all of them, multiple times over. I personally prefer really long novel length fics, but I get that there are only a certain number of people writing those.


** I'd say these are probably my favourite of the long ones (in no particular order though). For such a great pairing, there really aren't that many - and even fewer that're good. It's weird, but probably a mark at how good the pairing is that even a crap story can get us shipping it. Definitely my favourite pairing as well, with Harry-Luna as a close second. :)
