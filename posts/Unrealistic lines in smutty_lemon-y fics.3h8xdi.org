The thing of stuff that makes you wonder if the writer has ever actually had sex (or done anything else) before. It can be a specific fic or something you've stumbled upon multiple times.

"Tongues battle for dominance" was mentioned in another thread.

- having first-time sex turn immediately from "a second of pain" to "absolute pleasure"

- characters conveniently forgetting to use birth control

- removing the awkward and messy portions of sex

What about those fics where Harry Potter is soul bonded to Gabrielle Delacour after saving her from the lake? That's pretty much pedophilia right there because of both of their ages. (I think she's 8 during GoF).

***** Hmm, typically most mainstream Gabrielle/Harry fanfictions tend to up her age, using the excuse that veela don't mature for a while, and then mature very fast. In this situation, I don't believe what Harry and Gabrielle do to each other could be considered pedophilia, more just horny teenagers getting it on.

Actually writing about the sex though is probably creation of pedophilia erotica. There's no way around it- writing about an underage couple, even if they're teens is depicting minors in a sexual situation. And of course, we do see this in many fanfictions, including Harry/Gabrielle.

So of course, Harry and Gabrielle, as fictional characters are not guilty of pedophilia, but the writers might be guilty of something, depending on what jurisdiction they are in.

** Not exactly a line, but a common theme seems to be where the characters have a quickie and the woman not only comes from it without additional stimulation, but comes twice. Now I know getting to an orgasm isn't the same for everyone, and some people come easier, but I really don't believe that.

I think authors should read [[http://www.goodinbed.com/miniguides/2010/01/female-orgasm.php#satisfaction][this]] or something like it before writing their sex scenes. A good sex scene shouldn't be a volley of orgasms, it should go into detail more about the activities, instead of 90% of it being how they are getting closer to their orgasms in a variety of euphemisms.

I have to admit, when I'm actually purposefully reading smut I don't mind too much. But when I'm reading a nice long story that happens to have some lemons in it, these things bothers me and make me skip the sex scenes.

***** It bears some resemblance, if only because often times that membrane is slightly smaller than the head of the penis, and therefore just the tip sliding forward would meet with resistance.

When every braincell is concentrating on the nerves in the penis, that slight restriction can very much feel like a "barrier" that you have to push through to continue. Much the same as the first time a woman performs anal sex and the man has to somewhat force his way in past her natural resistance to intrusion.

Maybe it is the term "barrier" that you have issue with, and not "resistance" which is what it normally is unless she has been stretched and well lubed (which almost never happens for teenagers).

edit: also I think "just the tip" means something different to a guy than a girl LOL. That is why its a joke. To me, if I say "just the tip" what I really mean is the entire head of the penis so that the vagina closes tightly around the shaft... not literally "just let me feel what a wet vagina feels like on my pee hole."

You have your soul bond fics, but there are also plenty of fics where the relationship just exists and everyone acknowledges that they're spesul snowflakes.

It's really hard to get losing your virginity correctly for either party. Any fic where the characters go through it without at least a bit of awkwardness or weirdness or any kind of discussion strikes me as highly unrealistic.

** Speaking of all the "incorrect" devirginifications people are complaining about, how about when directly after taking said female virgin's hymen away in a burst of mind-blowing underage sex, male sex partner suddenly has a tub of Magical Potion to rub on it so she can have another go and not be sore in the morning.

** I'll edit this after I read the other comments. But "battling for dominance" is something that does indeed happen. Especially as a teenager who is just learning how to French Kiss, both parties tend to make a game out of who can shove more tongue into the other ones mouth when "making out" or having a passionate moment.

That doesn't mean it is necessarily sexy, but in a Hogwarts fic it is entirely appropriate to how teenagers kiss if they aren't experienced.

EDIT: So after reading everything else I had to find something of my own to add...

Usually the only thing that throws me off is when the sex comes out of nowhere, or is immediately followed by both parties declaring their true love and intentions to be together forever etc etc. I prefer reality in my romantic encounters even when they are fictional.

*** I read a fic a while ago where Ron/Hermione were hanging out in Ron's room together and ended up declaring they liked each other and having their first kiss. And honestly it was pretty IC. But then instead of being like "hey that was new and different" they just went straight from kiss to actual sex. With literally no dialogue or hesitation other than one "are you sure?" from Ron to Hermione right before he actually "entered her."

Literally /no one/ does that, especially not during first-time sex.

** To piggyback on the virginity thing, when the hymen is penetrated, it stings for a bit and then it feels...odd. It's not a burst of pain followed by instantaneous pleasure. Also, there's usually a bit of blood, and some spotting over the next day or so. I remember reading a fic where Harry and Hermione had sex for the first time in a tub, and then took a soak afterwards. There was no mention of the tub being enchanted to clean water, or a spell to do the same. Just sex then soak. It threw me off for the rest of the chapter.

*** It isn't like there is such a large amount of blood that the water is going to be turning red and gross; and a little semen in the water is going to be unnoticed after a while, especially if its been all stirred up in a vagina...

It's a little gross to stew in their own juices, but I bet it would be more relaxing for her slightly abused vagina to soak for a while afterwards, than to be in a broom closet and then have to walk awkwardly for the rest of the day.

**** Well yeah, I know it's not a ton of blood, but it's still weird. There is still some, and the last I checked blood did stand out from clear water. I can't imagine dishing and not seeing the blood at some point.

****** It's not that I want a explanation of how it works - I'd rather not actually - it's just a case where doing task B doesn't make sense given what just happened with task A. Like taking a shower before a morning run - that's going to seem weird, unless you have something to indicate why you would do that. It's the same concept here, just involving other types of body fluids and exercise.

******** But it seems like it would be simple, right? "Harry pressed a button to magically replace the water." I know that it's an odd complaint, but to me it's a weird mistake, and something else contributing to the general impression that authors haven't really been intimate with someone, are bad at sex, and/or did not have good sex ed.
