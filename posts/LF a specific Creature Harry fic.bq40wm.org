:END:
I don't remember much about it (not even if it was slash or het), but here are the details I remember:

-Near the beginning some Death Eaters go to Harry's fancy house and one of them spills blood on his white carpet.

-Harry is in league with Voldemort but isn't a Death Eater.

-Harry is a rare creature that hasn't been seen in a long time.

-Harry transfers to Slytherin.

Thanks for your help!!
