First off, no A/B/O type tomfoolery.

Werewolves don't need to be a major part of the story but it would be nice. Crossovers are welcome.

Completed fics would be vastly preferred.


** I know of two stories where remus becomes the pack leader though i don't remember if they become bodyguards or mercs. I also remember a story where the werewolves go in to the forbidden forest and kill the older acromantulas (except for Aragog) and take the younger to farm them for silk competing with nott, malfoy(?). But I can't remember the name.

For Remus as a pack leader
