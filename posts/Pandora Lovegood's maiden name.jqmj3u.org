I've got this fanfiction going and she'll be a frequent character but I've been stuck on what I could have as her maiden name? Do I make her related to other canon characters? Such as Malfoy? The Lestranges??? Blacks??? I'm at such a stand still


** Judging by the fact that her husband's name, Xenophilius, means "foreign loving", and JK Rowling is not very subtle in her naming, she's probably a witch from Greece (the original Pandora was Greek). So I'd advice you to look through [[https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/100-greek-last-names-or-surnames/][this list of Greek surnames]] and other lists like that to find her maiden name.

*** Plot twist: She is related to Grangers through Hermiones mother. Thats why Hermione has a Greek name.

As a Pureblood, Luna is probably distantly related to all of these characters. But she doesn't appear on the Black Tapestry, which means that Pandora probably not a Black (unless she is a descendant of one of the burned one), and a relation to the Malfoy or Lestrange is also unlikely since never mentioned.

Now, this is fanfic so you are free to give her any relation you want. But I don't think it's really usefull to make Luna related to any canon character, unless you plan to "use" that relation.

Maybe Draco is nicer when she is around because she knows some embarassing stories about his childhood, maybe she knows that Moody is an impostor because her grandpa is different . . . If you don't have any precise idea about what to do with her "family ties", it's probably better to just make Pandora come from some no-name Pureblood family.

** I've read several fic where the Lovegoods are a seldom discussed offshoot of the Malfoy family on Pandora's side, but since she married a weirdo who wasn't an uber rich pureblood, you dont hear any pureblood talking about it. But you can use that as a reason Luna might be invited to pureblood events by a friend of her mother's, if you need that in the plot.

** It's a fair question.

Luna is an astronomical name and Pandora is rooted in Greek mythology. With that in mind, "Black" makes sense as a surname.

However, in canon, Sirius never mentions even a distant cousin named Pandora and given that Luna is featured most prominently in the fifth book, where such a connection would be obvious to mention, I seriously doubt that Luna, or her mother for that matter, would be closely related to Sirius.

I'd recommend thinking of a word that describes Pandora's personality and then use that for a base for a last name instead.

For example, the Latin word for creative is "Partum."

Pandora Partum could work.

** I don't think she has a canon one so you can make her whoever you want. I tend to have Xenophillius as a Malfoy bastard, but having Pandora come from that side could be interesting.

** It'd be interesting to see more members of the Prince family in fics. As far as we know there are no male family members who carried the name forward, but while they were supposed to be pureblood they're barely mentioned anywhere. So maybe that's an option?

** I don't believe that she's given a maiden name, but if you don't want to make her related to any of the other characters, you could give her the surname Fawley or Selwyn. Those two surnames are part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight ( A list of the "Pureblood" families from Pottermore ) and I don't believe that anyone with those surnames were in the books that interacted with the main characters.

** I think I would go with either Prince or Fawley (because it sounds nice)- pureblood family whose members end usually in hufflepuff. you would make to make her a hufflepuff though. there was a fic where she was in slytherin, don't remember what her name was there.

Or how about Ollivander? she has that weirdness in her I think?

I think Alice was Fortescue so you could also go with a shop idea. Flourish? Blotts?
