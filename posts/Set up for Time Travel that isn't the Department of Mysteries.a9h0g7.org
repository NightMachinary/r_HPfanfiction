Are there any canon plot events/devices that would be workable for a time travel set up?

I've gone a bit of a time travel craze recently, planning vastly different stories with the same premise (only one of which is being written and posted right now and it's the one with the least planning).

The go to for most fics seem to be DoM orientated - which makes sense and I applaud all of the interpretations, there's some really interesting works out there with that.

But I was wondering if there would be any other plot points/devices that could work to create a canon divergence time travel.

One idea I had was the Room of Requirement but I'm looking to see if there's others.


** Not really, lots of time travels don't involve DoM, for example:

Accidents, artifacts, rituals, and higher powers can all be time travel triggers.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** A good one that's always available is hidden books in the library's restricted section. You could find it stuffed on a shelf, hidden inside another book, hiding in a hollow cavity on a bookshelf, plenty of opportunities there.

If you're okay with using time turners but just avoiding general department of mysteries stuff, you could have dumbledore or someone possess a time turner, and have the character steal it, or just be involved in an accident with it.

Perhaps you could bring the mirror of erised into it? Either as a result of accidental spell/potion damage on it making it a portal to allow someone their hearts desire by time travel, or maybe a more sinister method requiring sacrifice or a blood-involved accident, or it simply offers a portal for no reason

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

** I've seen the following used more than once:

- A potion (Backwards with Purpose -- mental travel)
- Some higher power decides to give a second chance, during limbo (HP: after the AK in the forest, to 1991, SS: after Nagini, to somewhere between 1969-1991 -- mental travel, obviously)
- A ritual of some kind, sometimes involving actions that would usually just kill you (sometimes a self-AK, or assisted AK, is involved -- mental travel)
- The Veil of Death, the /only/ common (used by more than 1 fic) device I've seen used that involves DoM (sometimes mental time travel, sometimes AU, sometimes "regular" time travel)
- A Pensieve
- The Room of Requirement
- A special Time Turner (Cursed Child, Debt of Time, among others)
- An accident involving a Time Turner (very common if HG is the traveller -- a spell hits the time turner, it's damaged due to HG tripping, or whatnot)
- A mysterious artifact -- everything from a knife (Delenda Est) to some thing made with the sand of Time Turners, or whatever
- Some form of accident, which can be basically anything and can happen anywhere

*** Haha I did have one idea that was sort of like that which would be comical.

An object that transports anyone who touches it through time. Person A picks it up, disappears. Person B, confused, picks it up and the same thing happens. Person C, in a fine act of stupidity, also picks it up. The object drops and starts rolling, people accidentally stepping on it and disappearing. More able people try to stop it with magic but end up touching it too.

Something ridiculous like that. But I'm unsure how an audience may take to it over a more serious event.
