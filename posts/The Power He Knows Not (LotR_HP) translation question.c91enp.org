What does the title Beortwiga mean. Theoden mentions it in chapter 4 and I've tried to look up translation from elvish but I can't work it out. For the other title he receives they mention it means master of fire, but I've no idea what Beortwiga means.


** Never mind. It's in the author's note. Bright warrior is what it means apparently. Wish it was explained in the text!

*** Noted. Generally, in my stories, if there's something that's been left untranslated within the text then it won't be important. I keep them, however, as I feel like they add some flavour and as I know many readers like to have full direct translations I add them in the end of chapter notes for completeness (and so they can be ignored by those who do not care).

I don't like adding translation in text for unimportant details as I feel it often breaks flow, or can feel clunky. Sorry this was enough of a headache to prompt a question on reddit!

**** It's no problem! And thanks for answering! I can't wait for the next chapter of Shadow of Angmar! Best LOTR fanfic in my opinion.
