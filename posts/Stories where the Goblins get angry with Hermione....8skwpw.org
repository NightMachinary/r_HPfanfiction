...for defacing/forging Galleons in her Fifth Year (DA Coins). I don't think I've ever seen this before, but am curious if it exists.


** Hm, I couldn't find any. But it'd be odd I think. Didn't they clarify that it wasn't real gold (Ron thought she was handing out free gold)?

*** I'm not sure it'd matter if it was real or fake gold - if it were real galleons as the base, then they would have been defaced; and if they began as something else, then the goblins might consider them to be forgeries.

**** Checked OoTP and it definitely says Ron was incorrect in thinking it was real gold. The "don't spend it" bit from Harry was almost definitely about the fact that it was fake, so you'd get in trouble for trying to use a forgery. It refers to them as "fake galleons", and Hermione calls them "fake coins".
