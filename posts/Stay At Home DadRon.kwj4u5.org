** I'm imagining Harry and Ron as stay at home Dads...at least, that's all that Ginny and Hermione /think/ is going on. They're actually solving mysteries and bringing the kids along for the adventure in toddler backpacks.

The auror department uses them as pseudo-consultants because they know the aurors have to operate within the law- but Harry and Ron can be a bit more loose as long as everything stays off record. So no one talks about the collaborations, and sometimes the kids have surprise playdates with their cousins so that Harry and Ron can +get drunk and go bowling+ sneak into an escaped Death Eaters house that they /definitely/ don't have a warrant or any other legal right to be in.

But also, they're great with the kids because they're actually good Dads.

#+begin_quote
  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

** Harry using all the home - making skills he was forced to learn doing chores for the Dursleys and Ron all the stuff he picked up instinctively from his mother.

Their wives are the breadwinners as a Quidditch star and Unspeakable.

Together they run a pre-hogwarts day school that is primarily made up of all the children of their friends from the DA and some others.

** I imagine Ron is a stay at home dad once Hermione's job gets super demanding, but Harry and Ginny both work. When the kids are super young, Ginny has to go on a work-related trip for a week, and Harry is left in charge of childcare alone.

At 1pm, he shows up in Ron's fireplace with children and toys and unidentified baby spit-up all over him being like dude...how do you do this by yourself? So Ron very efficiently and professionally gets Harry straightened out.

Hermione comes home to find that they have three/four new housemates for the next week.

*** This would fit perfectly with Ginny going into professional Quidditch and Harry teaching: the first time she's away on tour (maybe the summer months are for international Quidditch, but the school year is the domestic British Quidditch league?) he stays over with Ron to get help.

** I'm working on an (as yet unpublished, very long) story where Ron and Hermione become parents before the battle of Hogwarts. I have so many one-shot and longform sequal ideas that definitely including Ron being stay at home Dad while Hermione carves out a career at the Ministry. One involves the kiddos going to a muggle primary school and Ron having to fly solo at parent/teacher evening, doing his best to explain the strange occurances that go on when the Granger-Weasley kids are around! I'm gonna have fun writing this.

If I ever get there, that is....!

** I think the only time I ever read stay-at-home dad Ron, was with Ron portrayed as an abused spouse, with Hermione as a tyrannical bread winner in a ridiculously high ministry function. It was a disservice to both characters.

I'd love to read something more wholesome and Ron being a true home-maker.
