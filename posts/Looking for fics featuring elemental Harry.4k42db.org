Preferably water elemental but I'll take what I can get. I'm also hoping for ones where him being an elemental features heavily in the story but I'll also take anything as long as its not introduced and then never mentioned again.


** Whelp, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry by hermyd]]. It's not a perfect fit for your request, because of instead of water [[/spoiler][he has power over air, and somehow that includes lightning bolts]]. But I'm going to recommend it anyways, because [[/spoiler][lightning > water anyday o' the week.]]

At conducting electricity.

Though I guess if you can control water, you could remove it from the body of an enemy. Or maybe freeze the water in an enemy's body. Either way it's a bit gross, I guess.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.
