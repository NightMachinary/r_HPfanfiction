Harry is the oldest child and is not the bwl. Harry's parents treat him like he's unimportant yet do not abuse him. There is a professor who has red eyes I think, who resembles voldemort even though it is never said. Harry has multiple sibling who aren't sure of him. Harry I think was Slytherin but also could've been in Ravenclaw!

Help me find it:)


** Could you be a little more specific? There are a lot of fics that fit this description. Also what exactly do you mean by "not sure of him?"
