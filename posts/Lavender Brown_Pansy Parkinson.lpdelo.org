  The War is over. Hogwarts has been rebuilt, and Lavender returned to Hogwarts for her 8th year. She hoped to find solace there, instead she's faced with the memories of her attack. This story is one of anger and fear, but also of unnamed feelings and vulnerability.

*** Also OP I have 4 more stories in the works that are centered on Pansy/Lav, including a multi chapter fic that is looking like it will be around 30K words. I am fully on this ship and was very excited to see this post!
