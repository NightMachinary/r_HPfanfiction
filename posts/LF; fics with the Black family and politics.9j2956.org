I'm looking for fics with the Black family and politics, where the title Lord Black means something. Where Harry or Hermione is a part of the family, Malfoy might be good or looking to Harry for help to defect, the Black family working together,just the old trope that everyone hates etc.

Already read “the reclamation of Black magic”, “time to put your galleons where you're mouth is” and plenty others that I can't remember. Looking for something new, something not recommended often. But it needs to be over 60k wording, and not abandoned.

Thank you!

** There is linkffn(Black Luminary), very AU, so far years one and two are released and year three will probably start being published this or next month.

If you don't mind a Harry/OC soulbond fic then linkffn(Black Bond) might be worth a read as well. It has magical cores, but they are not prominent and so far the story would work just as well without them. The first Book (year 1 to 3) is finished, the second one has only two chapters and hasn't had an update in over a year, but the authors said in mai or so that they are still actively working on it.

*** Would like to say Black Bond, while initially very good has a tendency to drag on conflict a lot and Harry ends up sidelined (and has his heart asolitely destroyed) but the OC who effectively takes his place as the main character. Its good and gets you invested in the characters but the payoff isn't worth it imo. Would not recommend reading.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** My own No longer alone fits this somewhat. The Black Lordship exist and has some power, but since I'm trying to write a realistic story, it is far from the power levels you see thrown around in the average IndyHarry fic. It's reputation comes from the fact that the former Lords had dirt on or favour from a lot of people, not from the title itself. And since the adults aren't stupid, Andromeda is the one who gets the title, not Harry.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

** My own fic linkffn(The Morrigan) is heading down that path. There is some bashing, but it's going to be well over 100k words, and I update semi-regularly, except for right now because of school. It's Hermione centric and veers hard into AU territory when it comes to magic and reincarnation.
