I keep starting fics I realize I've already read. What are some newer complete or almost complete fics out there that anyone would recommend? Or key filters to search on?


** I have several suggestions that I use:

1) Branch out into crossovers

Some crossovers are quite good and you don't have to know a lot about the other universe to get into them. It's very hit or miss, but it might helps you branch out a little, since crossovers are inherently different from pure HP fics.

2) Find a pairing you didn't read that often.

A bit self-explanatory, but there are several obscure pairings, although only a few fics are good among those, that people often overlook. Try to think of a pairing that you don't like, look for a fic, maybe you'll find yourself enjoying it.

3) Check the fav lists of your favourite authors.

It's a very good way to find good fics. Prolific authors sometimes, but not always, have a very well developed fav story list. Check them out, maybe something will strike your fancy.

4) Find a new fandom.

It's a bit heretical to say here, but search for fics from a different fandom. Sometimes it helps to orient yourself and consider HP fics from a different perspective by reading fics from another universe entirely. There are few as prolific and with such quality as HP, but there are some.

**** True, but applies only to a very small subset of the population, let alone the reader base.

** Im on the same page here xD for me i usually set searchfilters to be minimum 40k words (and without Draco and Snape in tags, but thats just me trying to avoid slashfics) and sort by update date. That way you get access to all sorts of new fics beeing written :) also crossovers! Click crossovers and check each one that sounds exciting, or just search all crossovers and spend time looking through the top ones :)

*** My standard search is: Update date, >10k, Harry. P, English, Any Rating

For crossovers: Update date, >10k, English, Any Rating

If I search for a particular pairing, I usually go for Favourites instead of Update Date.

** If ya wanna read some RonxLavender, you could read mine. Just broke 30,000 words. It's based off of a prompt where Lavender Brown's name is pulled from the Goblet of Fire, instead of Harry's.

Aside from that, I agree with what the other guy posted. Branch into crossovers, and look for weird pairings you don't usually read.

** What are the things that you like? I might be able to rec you some stuff that could interest you but I'm mostly reading slash though there might be some other fics I know or crossovers.
