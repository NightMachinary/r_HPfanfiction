To clarify, I don't mean pet peeves or things that make you angry... I mean things that make you go "huh... wait what? why would you do that?"

--------------

For me it's why people write fics where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived... but then turn Neville into what is basically Canon!Harry with a different name... at that point why not just write a fic about Neville? I would think it'd be more interesting to see Neville and Harry put their talents to use in their new roles rather than Neville being the Parselmouth who's great at Defense instead of Herbology. There's nothing technically wrong with the story, I'm enjoying reading it, but I just don't understand the reasoning behind the decision.


** Just because you recognise a goblin doesn't mean he's going to be all respectful to you back. These are bloodthirsty bleed-every-single-drop-of-your-blood fellows with warlike tendencies. Saying 'Hi Griphook' frankly aint going to do anything. It's just not logical.

** Maybe this is just something I hate, but why would you have Harry talking like a well-read adult when he's 11? Like, I get that he's bookish in these fics, but I was bookish too, and I never sounded like that when I was 11. In fact, when I was reading the books early on (10/11 years old) I thought Harry and Hermione sounded a little too mature. There's gotta be a point at which you write something and think, "Wait, would I have even phrased it this way before I started college? Maybe I'd better give my characters age-appropriate diction so I don't totally break immersion for my readers." Hmm.

**** so... Independant Harry where:

He's the last of the Potters who were reasonably well off Merchant/craftsman class types not nobles. Reasonably well off in that they've been dead for 10 years but Harry's schooling was covered and the pile of coins in his vault was still left over.

He inherits everything from Sirius... Everything as in the house and Kreacher. The Blacks ran their accounts into the ground over the generations just like the Gaunts.

Harry then tries to move forward to find his own way... hmmm... I think the problem is that Canon!Dumbledore wouldn't leave Harry be long enough for him to be independent (which on reflection is probably why a big falling out with him seems so common.) Independent Harry trying to leave the Dursleys and move into #12 kinda puts them at odds. But in order to break with the tropes listed above, we don't have to have Harry get along with Dumbledore I suppose... Just not toe his line constantly. So Harry would still have some manner of less explosive argument with Dumbledore where they reach some sort of agreement and Harry moves into #12.

... You know... If you're okay with the fic starting a summer early, this is starting to sound a bit like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] to me...

You can skip the shopping trip because Kreacher or Dobby can fetch anything Harry needs.

Rather than Dumbledore "insisting" on having them there... it's not unreasonable to assume that Harry would invite Ron, Hermione, et all, over for the summer.

Is this still an Indy!Harry... or is it the opening chapter(s) for a 'Harry Learns a lot one summer and turns into Merlin somehow' fic?

Although once I read a fic where Harry ended up with Voldemort because Voldemort would always take care of him and never hurt him like Vernon. What. The. Fuck.

Like, why did you write these characters in from another series if their only purpose is to react to things from Harry Potter canon?

Alternatively... I wonder if you would enjoy the crossover more (atleast in that particular aspect) if you were less familiar with the Potterverse? As in a fan of the other series and reading it for that reason rather than coming from the HP side of things?
