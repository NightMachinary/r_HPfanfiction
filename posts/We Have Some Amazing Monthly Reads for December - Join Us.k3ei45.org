Every month, our 18+ Discord group has several available monthly reads that we read as a group and chat about. Of course, we also watch movies, do trivia, host art classes, do art challenges, earn house points, make friends, and much more. We also offer professional writing help for HP fanfic writers at our sister server, which you'll gain access to after joining the main server.

You can read as many or as few monthly reads as you'd like.

*/Harmony/* - Baby It's Cold Outside by Potato19

*/Dramione/* - Remain Nameless by HeyJude19 and What the Room Requires by Alydia Rackham

*/Drarry/* - Soup-pocalypse and The Great Curry Cataclysm by SquadOfCats

*/Snape Centric/* - The Meaning of Mistletoe by Endrina

*/Slash and Femslash/* - Thistle & Stone by dulcedinem

*/Nomance/* - The Dog You Feed by JanuaryGrey

*/Crackfic/* - Malfoy's Secret by justasnake

*/Other Ship/* - Either 30 Days of You and Me by Mistress (Scorose) or Sugar and Spice by inlovewithforever (Hermione/Draco/Theo)

If you're a writer, let us know when you come in so we can get you on the writing server. We're doing a New Year Sprint to reach 35,000 words in January, so we can help you spend December preparing to join us for that. It's not required, but it's a great opportunity for a marathon if you missed NaNo!

Look forward to seeing you there!


** You have my interest.
