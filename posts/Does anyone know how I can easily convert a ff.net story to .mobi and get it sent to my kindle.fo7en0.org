Kind of how the bot on this reddit does it.


** I use the fanficfare, use calibre's ebook-converter to convert from epub to azw3 and then transfer over usb, all in command line.

Fanficdownloader supports mobi/azw3 directly, and has a gui, from what I recall. Also, as an alternative to using usb, amazon also gives you a special email, that you can email files to, to transfer to your kindle.

*** Calibre supports the amazon email. So you can add the file to the calibre library, convert, and then send it to the kindle all from the program.

I need to find my Calibre library. It's a 16GB USB stick. It has the portable version installed on it.
