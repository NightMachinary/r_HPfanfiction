:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, i've never posted on here before, so here goes. I'm looking for this fic i read a while ago, but cant seem to remember the name of. it was where harry and tom's souls are bonded and they get reincarnated many times, always meeting because of their soul bond. then they end up in a universe just like their own (like the canonverse) and decide to mess with everyone. does anyone know which one i mean and could help?


** This is what you're looking for. It's a wonderful read

#+begin_quote
  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
