:END:
Harry is Master of Death, but a disease starts killing lots of witches and wizards. Harry is blamed, specifically for being the master of death and Harry and Hermione try to jump back in time to stop Harry from becoming MOD. They get interrupted and Harry goes back to WW2, where he meets and works with Abraham Erskine on the SuperSoldier serum. He is eventually found and taken back to the future and given to Baron Von Strucker, who promised to make strong wizards who wouldn't die from the disease by sacrificing purebloods, and Harry is the last wizard with a strong pureblood heritage. Due to being MOD, Harry doesn't die and the resulting wizard has death-like-powers. The last thing I remember happening is Harry, as a winter soldier sorta thing, killed the US President on live television.

*** I see that it's marked M/M, but I don't see any relationships tagged. Would you happen to remember the pairing?

**** It was originally supposed to be Harry/Steve, then he changed his mind to make it Harry/Bucky, then he finally decided to make it gen, no pairings. So you're gonna see some fluff that might seem like it's leading towards something between Harry and either of those guys (and briefly Howard Stark), but it's ultimately platonic (and quite cute).
