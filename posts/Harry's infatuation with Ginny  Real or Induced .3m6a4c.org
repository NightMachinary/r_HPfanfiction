When I read the HBP for the first time, I was stunned with the sheer reaction Harry had to Ginny. The way his feelings were revealed, the sheer forcefulness of them, and the language involved. It always gave me the idea that it wasn't genuine. A lot of theories have been posted previously, and the most likely one that Ginny or Mrs. Weasley had spiked Harry somehow has been circulated a while. Do you think Ginny/Harry were totally real, or do you think it was induced ?


** She's pretty, tough and they like the same things. I'm not going to deny I feel the romance was handled rather poorly and introduced very suddenly in the books, but love potions is such a stretch Mr Fantastic couldn't pull it off.

  What I will say is that I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione with Ron.

She did not say Hermione should have ended up with Harry. She just questioned her motives for writing Ron/Hermione, and whether it would've actually worked. So many news articles took things out of context and put words in her mouth.

****** Her quotes were taken out of context. She never actually said that Hermione should have married Harry, she only said that in some ways they were a better fit compared to Ron/Hermione. And she goes on to say a few days later that Harry's love for Ginny is true (thereby denying anything between H/Hr). You should read the full interview.

Also, she never even mentioned GoF, nor did she mention Harry/Ginny in the original interview.

*** Poorly? - Forced is more like it (come on, how can you be attracted to your number on fangirl who probably just likes the same things you do because you liked them first, particularly if said fangirl couldn't even talk to you normally and stuck her elbow in the butter!)...Romances without any build-up are crappy! It's like Harry just goes "Oh - shiny" and we are supposed to believe she's the love of his live (hell, the whole premises is faulty, he's only had ONE prior relationship -.- come on that's unlikely...he should have dated some more (after dealing with Voldy, I can understand him not wanting to drag a girlfriend into all of that!))

**** I'm going to be honest and say that I disregarded everything you said the moment you used "Voldy" to abbreviate Voldemort.

She was never his number one fangirl. She was a kid with a crush when she was not even in her bloody teens.

So yeah. Poorly handled romance all-in-all, but not because of all the shit fanon has done to Ginny.

Fleur's too hot for Harry. That's why she dates magical Indiana Jones. I'm not saying I wouldn't want to see a well-written Harry/Fleur romance. Just that I very rarely have.

** My main problem is that the relationship development was so poorly handled.

The problems with their (Harry/Ginny) relationship is that the majority of feelings happened offscreen. And when they finally came to light, it felt like you were being hammered over the head with it.

"Over the course of one summer Harry falls for Ginny..." if that wasn't cliche enough, it just feels short handed because we (the readers) never witness much of their interaction. It feels pushed upon us and shoved into the books. All this time their development together/scenes together have been very limited and scarce - we know Harry but we barely know ginny. She is hardly a side character. Only in the previous book (5) do we see more of Ginny and it is shown that she's grown out of her fangirl phase. But that's still not enough to support their romantic relationship together especially since Harry's hardly with her and his feelings for her didn't get shown to the reader.

Ginny too I have a big problem with - she goes from being this painfully shy, Harry-obsessed fangirl (which, I admit, I found pretty adorable and funny when she was a little girl) to this outrageously popular, beautiful, talented, smart, brave, funny, compassionate, kind, loving well liked, never-without-a-boyfriend dreamboat of a girl.

But...when did that all happen?

My problem is that we never SEE that actually happening. We never see Ginny being truly fleshed out - and in contrast to the pages and pages of characterization and growth we get for the other characters her personality falls dreadfully flat and she feels very one-dimensional. JK Rowling tries hard to make Ginny likable but she comes across as being too..."perfect" because so little time is spent developing her = we only get told (repeatedly) of how wonderful she is. We never really see it.

People say that Harry/Hermione would have been "the Hero gets the Girl" but in all honesty I find that much more applicable to Harry/Ginny...after all: the Hero (Harry) ends up with the very desirable, popular, gorgeous, smart, brave, loving and funny girl! That strikes me as far more cliche than Harry being with the bookish, annoying, bossy, flawed and physically plain Hermione any day.

In all honesty, I dislike the pair of Harry/Ginny- but I feel I would have been more open to it had it got proper on-screen development instead of Harry suddenly realizing he's in love with her. Ginny too needed far, far more fleshing out as an individual before she was pushed up with Harry. And "the chest lion" was utterly stupid.

** It was one of those times when I would've told JKR to just go with the flow and write the whole thing into a Harry/Hermione. As someone already mentioned, she rather forcefully steered clear of H/Hr in Goblet of Fire just because she didn't want those two to be together.

True, Harry/Hermione could've ended worse than Harry and Ginny. By that I mean, it could've been much more of an artificially held together relationship /in the end/.

However, the substitute we got was mediocre at best, for it was a artificially /started/ relationship. Ginny was bland and barely fleshed out when she entered the limelight (or at least she seemed to be). I can't hold it against someone that the way it was in canon seemed to be forced somehow, because, frankly it was.

But I think that JKR just fell into the same trap a lot of writers fall in. They run out of characters. The only other girls in Harry's age-frame besides Ginny and Hermione, who had deeper character by book 5 were Luna and Pansy. Out of those two I could only see Luna conquering Harry's heart by just being who she is. Thats something I could've seen happening in OotP.

But anyway, could've, should've, would've doesn't matter. We got what we got and the rest is fanfiction.

*** The "going with the flow" /was/ H/G and R/Hr.

And you do realize that it seems badly written because the romance is not the focus? I would have loved more development for H/G and Ginny herself, but then it would have overloaded the books and overshadowed the main plot itself.

***** The quote you posted there is only talking in reference to Ron/Hermione, which was the topic of discussion in that interview. Even if they were a better fit in more than "some ways", they would still have to be better paired than H/G, which they clearly aren't.

The romance wasn't that well written, sure, but let's face it, it wasn't a disaster. It simply isn't one of JKR's strongest points (her world building is). That doesn't diminish H/G as a couple.

And BTW, only OotP was humongous, which is why she had to tone it down for HBP/DH. I'm pretty sure she had more H/G scenes planned for HBP/DH, but that the editors told her to cut on that because it was getting to big. Also, what tells you that she hasn't had other scenes cut too?

******* Is this the new Harmony creed now? For years it was 'Don't listen to JKR, she's an idiot!', and now that she's a bit more sympathetic to them it's 'Listen to JKR. She knows best!' That few people notice the irony amuses me.

The original comment was made that JKR should have gone with the H/Hr flow in GoF, which, of course, never existed. JKR considered the idea laughable back then. And had she actually 'gone with the flow' in DH, it would have led to an insipid twilight-y love triangle that would have absolutely taken over the plot, not to mention gone against the theme of the books, so the point there is invalid.

Harry's relationship with Ginny is built mainly on their moment about the possession, the Easter egg, quite a bit of shared time (she was around during all the best times in his life, being summers at the Burrow or parties in the common room, and there are casual interactions throughout), the Quidditch victory and no small amount of physical attraction. They share interests in Quidditch, and they share a sense of humor. There is also a story to it: A young girl with a crush growing out of her hero worship and having to prove herself as a strong character before the boy is attracted to her.

Would it have been better had there been more of it? Probably, and definitely as far as the romance was concerned. But then the books were never about romance, and there were limited time and space JKR spent on it before it felt out of place. Given how the romance was built up (more as a teenage romance than your typical 'true love' romance), I feel it was fine. And no, 'BAM HARRY'S CHEST MONSTER' isn't a valid criticism because it is mostly based on people willing themselves to forget all their interactions in OoTP, and the fact that the attraction actually had a build up from the Hogwarts Express to the Dean kissing Ginny scene, which is when Harry first realized his feelings for Ginny.

The OP question is obviously retarded and doesn't deserve an answer, so I'm just going to ignore it.

**** I remember that Rowling admitted to having Harry and Hermione too close in book five, so she needed to wedge them apart to get the canon pairings. It's just badly handled and they don't really make much sense. Sure have them date, but end up marrying? That was boring, it something I can't see working out.

Tell me, would you date a friend that has pissed on you and that you've wanted to beat the sense into? Also, dating a fangirl? Harry seemed more inclined for someone who would get to know him and see him for just Harry, Ginny was still the fangirl doing anything to remain as Harry's girl as per Hermione's instruction/advice. It's weird.

Ginny only was a fangirl of Harry's during the first book, when everyone else was, even Hermione. If anyone's a hero-worshipper, it's Colin.

No, Ginny got to know and see Harry as just Harry, she got over her worshipping and became his friend. It's all in the books.

****** It was in her interviews, where she stated she had Harry and Hermione too close at the end of OtoP for her plan of the pairings. Just because I can't find the interview doesn't mean it didn't happen. Its not like I stating it as concrete proof that Rowling was doing H/Hr pairing.

It's not Ron bashing, it's that those would fight with each other. She harped on him as well. Ron and Hermione are better off friends not lovers, it just seemed like they both settled.

Ginny was never really in Harry's purview much of the time, just when it was a big gathering. The damsel got her prince. They talked on the possession, but thing was, Harry completely forgot about her being so. Ginny asked Hermione for advice on how to Harry's attention which didn't really happen till the sixth book. She was just Ron's sister till then. She didn't get to know him as Harry through Harry. Face it, the damsel in distress got her knight in shining armor. It was contrived and better off having Harry not end up with someone in Hogwarts. If I wanted the damsel, Gabrielle was a better option.

** I always felt like Ginny offered nothing for Harry in terms of a real relationship. It felt more like Rowling decided that the main character should end up happily ever after with a girl, but Hermione is too much of a bookworm/friend relation. She picked Ginny just because the other options weren't good enough either. Tbh I don't know why Harry would end up with someone who's fangirling over him most of the time when he has a hard enough time with people not believing him and vilifying him and just treating him one-dimensionally. And she seems awfully bland for the rest of Harry's life considering that he's lived so long having a rival (i.e. Voldemort). It would've been better if he ended up with someone who was a strong challenging character, while being supportive of him.
