I've basicaly read all the top HP/SS fics several times now. I dont really care if its SS daddy, SS mentor, SS master or SS lover. I just love SS! So if anyone has any suggestions at all to fanfics I might have missed please post them here!

Thank you!


** Okay, I've got a few:

First thing I thought of when I saw that you didn't mean /only/ slash, was Lomonaaeren's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6730432/1/World-in-Pieces][World]] in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333][Pieces]] (FF.net and AO3 links provided). It's a "Harry goes to another Universe and has to kill Voldemort /again/" fic, but there's many twists, and this version of Snape is decidedly different in a very familiar way. If you like Lomonaaeren's writing, she has skads of other stories, and while a large majority are H/D in relationship, Severus is very often a major character in one or the other's life.

Next, up is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2233941/oliver-snape][oliver]].[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/oliversnape/pseuds/oliversnape][snape]]'s well... everything... A real quick look over the story list shows that they're all H/SS in at least a parental role if not the traditional shipping. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5878880/1/The-Definition-of-Home][The Definition]] of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/329404/chapters/531524][Home]] and its sequels are some of my favorite Severus adopts Harry Potter stories and wins big time on the most original Voldemort death.

I keep trying to find a second series/story of his to recommend over the others but I just can't! They're all wonderful and unique and I might just have to reread them after I finish...

Lighting on the Wave's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifice Arc]], which happens to be my next suggestion. I've recc'd it before and I will again. :) It took me over a month and a half to get through the 3+ million words the first time and six months and counting for the second time (I will remember more details this time, dammit! Even if its so good sleep loses to it often!) This has Snape becoming first a in-the-way-head-of-house, to something of an ally, to a mentor, to a father over the course of 7 years. There's times you'll want to shake them both to behave and support one another better, but... if that isn't real life what is? It's also H/D slash, and one of the most detail-oriented re-imagining of the series I have ever read.

Another good Severus mentors Harry is Suitesamba's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6500900/1/Moment-of-Impact][Moment]] of [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/54925][Impact]] and its sequels. (Doesn't look like Suite Samba has finished putting everything up on AO3 yet.) Her other work is wonderful as well, and I see she has a few new stories up that I haven't read yet, so Yay for me!

Well, that's what I've got for tonight. Can't find some of the slash fics I want to recc from my bookmarks, but I'll come back if I do. :)

** For mentor I'd check out [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Saving Connor, the first book in the Sacrifices Arc.]] The mentor relationship comes later in the series. It is three times longer than the original seven books, so be sure to bookmark. *" I've always enjoyed stories where Harry has a sibling who supposedly saved the world, and stories where Harry's Sorted into Slytherin, but most of the time all the characters except Harry wind up as caricatures of themselves. This is my attempt at writing a Slytherin Harry who's not necessarily evil, and a Snape and Draco who may be good but not nice, and a sibling (Harry's twin brother Connor) who's his own person."*- Lightning on the Wave

Another mentor fic is [Still Life by DianaArtemis16]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9186886/1/][www.fanfiction.net/s/9186886/1/]]). Snape is very "in character" for this fic. *"I lived my life a hundred times and always found myself holding him in my arms, knowing that he would never even remember me. I want to save him Severus, but I don't know what to do."..."Why did you bring me back, Lily? What did you expect me to do?"..."I expect you to become what I've tried to be in a hundred lifetimes."*

Another mentor fic is [Visions of Sugarplums Danced in their Heads by fawkesfeathers]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10239915/1/][www.fanfiction.net/s/10239915/1/]]). *Over Christmas break, Harry and Snape are attacked by a Ghangzou, a rare, magical genie that shows its victims what life would be like if one thing changed. What they see will alter their relationship forever, if they'll let it.*

[Yet Another Snape meets the Dursleys story by rabbit and -v-Jinx-v]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/601118/1/][www.fanfiction.net/s/601118/1/]]) It starts off "meh" but gets interesting very quickly.I like it because Dudley actually has a personality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4828645/1/][Everybody Wants to be a Cat by Les Dowich]]*Critically injured during the final battle, Harry Potter chooses a simpler way to live. As a cat, Harry finds love and acceptance but no man can be a cat forever and everyone has to grow up and face the world one day.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8646550/1/Far-Beyond-a-Promise-Kept][Far Beyond a Promise kept by oliver.snape]]. I don't remember too much about the ending to this one. *Snape never wanted anyone to know of his promise to Dumbledore, but has realised that he can protect Potter much better by taking a less passive role in the boy's training. Actually liking Harry Potter has never been part of his plan. mentor/guardian.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8888660/1/Forever-Young][Forever Young by Warviben]]. The slash is in Part 2 which you can find on the author's profile. Don't worry, nothing happens until harry is himself again. *Harry Potter goes missing during the final battle. Snape finds him in a most undesirable place.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2299450/1/Oblivion][After All by PissedOffEskimo]]*Dumbledore decides that he's had enough of the Dursley's abuse and brings Harry to Hogwarts at age eight HPDM main pairing, HPLM noncon, HPSS implied. Beware the cute.* I lost interest in this story. Snape is a major dick and iirc there is chan with Draco. That doesn't bother me, because like many kids I started playing with myself long before puberty, but I know most people dislike it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5263271/1/Alea-Iacta-Est][Alea Iacta Est By: EllaEleniel]]*When a bout of erratic magic delivers Harry into his professor's hands, the pair make a shocking discovery that forces Harry to face his toughest battle yet. Now, with Snape by his side Harry must fight to survive against a foe more deadly than Voldemort.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7375581/1/][Catch and Release By: Roozette *Harry has a "tell," when he needs affection. Ron never realized Severus had the same one. A Snarry told from a Ron-centric viewpoint. Yep.* Short.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8109637/1/][I'm Sorry by lastcrazyhorn]] Short. *Little Harry was rescued from the Dursleys by his Daddy, but not all of their lessons are easily forgotten. Entry in the P&S 2012 Prompt Fest. Prompts: It slipped from his grasp and shattered, Fight or flight. Is also a child fic, w/ adoption & self harm*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5482304/1/][ThE SeVeRuS SnApE FaN cLuB By: Lady Lianna Kari]] Crack fic. *Harry gets tired of Snape making digs at his fame, so he decides to get even. Not a Slash. Occasional references of abuse.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6855183/1/][Burnt By LastcrazyHorn]]. *WIP* I find Moody's character annoying and unrealistic, but I like the premise. I'm on the fence about this story still. *A disabled Harry comes to Hogwarts story. Everyone expects him to be like his dad, but how can he be with such a different past? A Slytherin Harry takes on Hogwarts in an unusual way.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/][Broken Mind, Fractured Soul By: SensiblyTainted]] I found this very enjoyable, though like most fanfics there are unrealistic parts. *What if there was a darker truth hidden in Harry's story? Summer before third year, Harry begins to question his memory blanks. What happens when he finds himself before Snape for help? includes mentor Severus, MPD, child abuse, protective Remus*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7558470/1/][Conspiracy by Maethoriel Raina]] *After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.* I loved this because Pureblood Traditions are a favorite genre of mine, but you won't actually see much interaction between Snape and Harry. If you like Ginny, you will hate this. Ginny and her family are wildly out of character in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5229890/1/][To Make It All Okay by Bonomania]] *When Harry goes back to school the year after Sirius dies, the unlikeliest of people start noticing a change in him. Mentions of child abuse, Dursleys, Draco and more brushes with death.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6141466/1/][6 Lessons From A Dead Man by Roozette]] *Harry Potter put himself in a vulnerable situation on Severus Snape's birthday. So, naturally, Severus took complete advantage.* A kidnapp crack fic slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/][Better Be Slytherin! by jharad17]] *YEAR ONE COMPLETED! As a first year, Harry is sorted into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, and no one is more surprised than his new Head of House. Snape mentors Harry fic.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4942221/1/][Broken Wings by Snapegirlkmf]] *Desperate to escape his guilt and nightmares after the third task, Harry transforms into a hawk by accident and ends up breaking both wings and suffering partial memory loss. He is found by Snape,who helps him and discovers the truth about his professor.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville]] *AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!*

(a lot more links coming, will reply to myself. I've read most of these however a few of them I never finished because they were WIP's when I started reading them and I lost my place. And a few stories I probably stopped reading if they became too cliched or if Harry ever referred to Snape as "Dad" within the first few chapters.).

Sorry for terrible formatting.

*** The last list had more mentor stuff, this list has more slash stuff. I didn't do this on purpose, it just worked out that way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2183302/1/][Things I Never Knew by youcantseeus]] When Snape's son comes to Hogwarts, Harry discovers secrets about his Potions Master that he never imagined and Snape learns a few things about Harry as well. NOT HBP COMPLIANT. *No romance. A very enjoyable read.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/][Digging for the Bones by paganaidd]] Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6408514/1/][Forget Me Not by Sa-kun]]: Everyone seems to have forgotten that the Boy Who Lived exists. Harry's friends don't remember who he is. Harry tries to hold on to reality as he knows it, while trying to come to terms with who he is. He finds Snape as an unexpected ally. 6th year AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5901596/1/][Twentyone days by evil minded:]] AU / Death Eaters besiege Hogwarts. A spell from Dumbledore is going astray. A cauldron explodes during potions class. And the old castle enfolds its own magic. Can some students survive the next twenty-one days? How will they deal with everything thrown their way due to "the tragedy of Hogwarts" as reporters call it? Accompany them on their struggle to stay alive ... thanks ... *English is not this author's first language. There will be grammar and spelling mistakes. I still think it is worth the read, though Harry's behavior seems to regress and he seems more childlike as the story goes on.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6741433/1/Cartons-of-milk][Follow/FavCartons of milk By: evil minded]] AU / Albus Dumbledore needs a teacher for the pre-school in Little Whinging, Surrey, to cover the raccoon class which one Harry Potter attends ... and whom do you think he will send? Well, I am sure you already can imagine ... /lol/ ... watch our dear Potions Master handling a bunch of "little snotty toddlers" ... all reviews will go to the kindergarden for a carton of milk for them ... *English is not this author's first language. There will be spelling and grammar mistakes.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3402347/1/Bonds-of-Water][Bonds of Water By: Heather68]] Harry Potter has never been entranced by music before now, but he is willing to do anything to learn how to play the same melody, even if it means learning from Severus Snape. *Slash. This author has a lot of stories with Snape and Harry in them, but I haven't checked out the others yet.* I may have read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3354694/1/Danger-In-The-Healing][Danger in Healing, though.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3535620/1/][Insane Asylum Escapees by RuneWitchSakura]] This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. Feel free to adopt. *Wonderful crackfic that has alas been abandoned. I'm putting this here since Snape was mentioned, but I don't remember if they interacted at all. Cheating, I know.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1922112/1/Crumbling-Pedestal][Crumbling Pedestal by Shivani Slash]], HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway. *I know I liked this, but I don't remember much about it so I can't warn you about any cliches. I do remember that there were a lot of cliches though.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1183701/1/][Let the Darkness Take You By: RadeliaPotter]]Harry goes back for his 6th yr. at Hogwarts to find that darkness is sweeping over them. He soon finds that the only people he can trust is none other than Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy. Better summary inside. Eventual slash! H/D

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3823410/1/][Pantogogue by BC]] Slash SSHP. Severus' POV: Potter is changing in front of my eyes, gaining a disconcerting resemblance to Tom Riddle. As usual, it falls to me to save the brat... for the price of 'only' my soul.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/][In Care Of by Fang's Fawn:]] During the summer before sixth year, Harry finds an injured bat in the garden and decides to try to heal it...and an unwilling Snape learns just what kind of a person Harry Potter really is. No slash. Part 2 continued in "Tightrope." *A good read*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5054723/1/][The Shadow of the Other by atypicalsnowman]]: HP/SS Slash, slave!Snape. As a creature, Severus has long known he will need to bond with his mate or face being made a slave to the whole of wizardkind. For Harry, the news is a shock made more difficult by the awakening of uncomfortable desires. *Basically porn*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4124611/1/][Foolish Gryffindor by DEATHmuse]] Harry Potter u:06-30-2008 - Snape has Tourette's. Harry is aroused -- That is, until Snape retaliates. SSHP. *Basically crackfic porn.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3818539/1/Property-of-the-HalfBlood-Prince][Property of the HalfBlood Prince by thesewarmstars:]] During his sixth year, Harry becomes very attached to the previous owner of his Potions text, but what will happen when he finds out who it really is? SSHP *BDSM porn. If this is the one I am thinking of, it's unrealistic but enjoyable if you like erotica.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/][Catechism by Dreamfall]]: AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP +02-12-2011 *Very messed up abuse in this. Worse, it is a WIP that hasn't been updated since 2011! I still have hope!*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3659281/1/Walk-the-Shadows][Walk the Shadows By: jharad17:]] AU. The summer after 5th year, Death Eaters find Harry abandoned in the Dursley house and bring him to Voldemort. Will one particular Death Eater give up his position and his hate to save his enemy's son? Snape mentors Harry fic. violence,chld abuse,rape *For some reason I don't remember reading this at all. I probably saved it to read later.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6056949/1/][a few syllables short of a spell by Ayla Pascal]]: Romilda Vane is pregnant. A paternity test proves that Harry is the father, and she insists on marriage. Desperate, he calls on Draco and Snape for help in working out how she did it. Snape/Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094080/1/][Breaking Forwards by lastcrazyhorn: HP&OP.]] The professors no longer can scare Harry with talk of lost points, detentions or Quidditch suspensions. He's been beaten down for far too long, and he finally has reached his limit. Severus mentors, maybe guardian. Abuse, non-con, AU, evil!Ron *You've probably already heard of this story, but just in case I'll post it.*

Lomonaaeren has a lot of stories with severitus AND snarry. Her stories vary greatly in everything from writing style to personality of the characters. You may like one of her books but dislike another. Here are a few favorites [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655048/1/Phoenix-at-Rest][Phoenix at Rest]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5428900/1/Practicing-Liars][Practicing Liars]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740583/1/Inter-Vivos][Inter Vivos]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9412759/1/A-Thousand-Days-of-Fire][A thousand days of fire]]

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=653&warning=4][Parseltongue-Tied by DementorDelta]]

I'm sure you've heard of Severus and The Crup by Josan but just in case [[http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/josan/hp/crup.html][here is a link to it.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2470334/5/The-Birthday-Present][The Birthday Present By: excessivelyperky]] Snape and his apprentices form a bond which may never be broken, not even in death. And at the end of it, Severus Snape is able to perform a spell that he has never been able to do before. Ok, it's not a million words. I tried.

Okay I am mostly done. The only thing I have left is just one more reply to myself where I will post fics that are very squicky for most people and I didn't want to post with the other stories without any warning.

**** *This last post contains stories that most people would find inappropriate or wouldn't like. I kept them separate from the others for this reason.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6634756/1/Desiderium-Intimum][Desiderium Intimum By: arielgobuss]]. "You want it. You love to provoke me so I can break you. You love it when I do this. When I call you to order, when I break your resistance, when I punish you. You love... ' the voice became hoarse, 'to squirm at my feet. And you know that no one else can give you this. No one else can make you feel like that. And that is why that Potion pointed you toward me, Potter. " *Humiliation, manipulation, unhealthy relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6587471/1/][Love In the Dark By: Hecateslover]] *Growing up on the streets did not prepare Harry for magic school. Then again, Hogwarts isn't prepared for him either. HPSS, many other pairings. SLASH, HET, FemSLASH, Dark!Harry. Rated M for a reason. Harry/Dean friendship.* This has chan in it so I'm putting it here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2142832/1/Incubus-Heredity][Incubus Heredity By: Tinkering]] PWP.Humil.UST.Hopefully you'll think it's a SQUEEE. Harry's got the dominant gene of a rare magical creature and the incident of an electric shock has awakened the gene.How will this change affect Harry's 7th year? *Porn. Harry is PERFECT LOOKING FEMININE SUB GUY. Everyone wants him. Lots of cliches, which is why I am putting this here. I still liked it, IIRC*

The Corvus Fallere series is made up of two books. It is basically a story of a dystopian world where voldemort won. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are taken by Snape and trained and manipulated mentally, emotionally, and physically/sexually. It's beautifully written and I am glad I read it, but I'd be lieing if I didn't say I felt sick at times while reading it. I don't really consider it porn since the sex is just a tool rather than the main point of the story, in my opinion.The first book can be found [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=1703&chapter=all][here]] The second book can be found [[http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=mousewrites&keyword=CF&filter=all][here]].

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2736739/1/][Light on the Dark Side of Me by cocoa-snape:-]] Harry comes into his sexuality & discovers he wants Snape. Intense occlumency lessons pull these 2 together, but is Snape too troubled or too dark to return HP's affections? DE meetings & Dumbledore stir the already boiling pot, HPSS Slash, Angst COMPLETE *I put this here because I don't remember anything about it, but I do know there was a story with a premise similar to this that I hated. So I am putting this here just in case.*

** Okay, so I know I'm super late to the thread, sorry! Cybele (the writer of If You Are Prepared) just finished [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/34560][For Auld Lang Syne]] in January. It's epilogue compliant, and covers from a few months after Voldemort's defeat to a few months post-epilogue. It does have HP/OC and SS/OC at some points - but no worries, it is /very/ well written. I liked the OCs while they were in those relationships. (Usually I just want the Snarry to happen already!) Brilliant, slow-moving. Their relationship has to overcome so many huge obstacles. The sort of two steps forward, one step back thing I like to see in this pairing.
