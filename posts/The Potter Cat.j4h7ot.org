When the Horcrux created at the Potters is the cat. Harry finds the cat in Diagon Alley, and the trio includes the cat. It starts out as a random cat, but ends up saving lives.

And helps Crookshanks befriend Sirius.

*** It wants to be the only crux left and be the new dark lord.

You know world domination is the aim of any cat and for that it has to get rid of the other horcruxes, obviously

*** Cats are amoral, selfish, fuzzy killing machines. The horcrux probably barely registers. Maybe it makes the cat slightly smarter, but that'd be it.

Horcrux (which is honestly just a tiny part of Voldemort's soul) or fully formed cat? I'd bet on the cat.
