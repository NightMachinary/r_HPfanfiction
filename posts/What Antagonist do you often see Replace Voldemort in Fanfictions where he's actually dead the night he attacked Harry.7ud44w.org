** Ideally, you start with Guildo. Then when Snape cuts off his head you move on to Recoome.

Now Recoome is a badass. So he should have no problem thrashing Baby Harry, Snape, and Flitwick. But before he can straight up murder them, Dumbledore shows up and intervenes.

Dumbledore makes quick work of Recoome. So Jeice and Burter step in. Dumbledore has no problem with them either. Snape, out of general spite, should just flat out murder the injured Recoome and Burter while Jeice flees to find his master.

Captain Ginyu should give Dumbledore some trouble. But be outmatched. However through guile and trickery he ends up winning. And then it takes a Hurclean effort for Snape and Baby Potter to beat him and Jeice.

Now you're left with an out of commission Dumbledore, a reasonably healthy Snape, Baby Potter, and Kril---Flitwick. They have to try to get Dumbledore back on his feet when the true menace shows up. Lord Frieza.

Now, Lord Frieza is utterly sick of this shit. So he just straight up murders everyone, takes the Sorcerer's Stone, and goes right the hell on home.

** Ron is often the antagonist, even in stories were Voldemort is still alive.

But, you know, since Ron is a background character that has (absolutely) no connection at all with Harry, so this can seem silly at first.

But Ron has evil motivations for the coming attempts at taking Harrys life.

- Harrys Godfather tried to kill his rat.
- Harry has talked with the girl he likes
- Harry was part of a tournament
- Harry has a scar
- Harry has spent food on candy
- Harry hasn't lobotomized a troll
- Harry has a broom
- Harry has dead parents
- Harry does not have any siblings
- Harry does wear glasses
- Harry has four different letters in his name (one more than Ron)
- Harry has a good wand
- Harry has killed a snake
- Harry forced him to visit a spiders nest
- Harry plays quidditch
- Harry was chased by a dragon

And the most likely in any story were Ron is a bad guy. - Harry married Hermione

I haven't actually read any stories where Voldemort died at the beginning and there was an antagonist. If he is dead, it seems like there was no antagonist.

This can be due to a bias against all stories with awkward summaries, so I may have simply missed them all.

** Dumbledore and Ron. Former has too much power, too much control and is ambitious enough to raise Harry like a lamb to be slaughtered for greater good and later is ambitious, self serving, jealous leech.

Malfoy has good thing going on too. He is a potential antagonist.
