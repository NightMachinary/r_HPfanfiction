I have had three beta readers so far, but they all ghosted me within a month or so...(wonder it's because my story is bad, but I asked them if the plot has serious problems, but none of them said such thing before they just stopped). My main problem is a grammar and phrasings. Criticisms on the plot would be nice.


** Summary? I've never beta'd before but I've been wanting to try it

** I'd be willing, as well. There are very few things I don't like to read, and grammar is my specialty.

** If grammar and phrasing are serious problems it may be that being a beta for your fic is simply too much work to handle long term. Would you mind posting a passage of your writing? I am happy to give advice on how to improve your grammar and prose, and I think if you work on that as a foundation you will find it a lot easier to get feedback on plot.
