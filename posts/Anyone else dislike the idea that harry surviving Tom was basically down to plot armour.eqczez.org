It took a fairly big coincidence in canon for him to survive and have his mothers protection

what happens if tom kill both his parent before they reach him ?

i prefer the idea that either lily or james or both performed some sort of ritual or protection ward/spell that was powered by their deaths or the magic of Samhain that allowed him to survive

anyone else agree? or have a different idea of how it works


** Yes, and I've been saying forever that the plot in DH is awful, and that good guys only won their Pyrrhic victory through a great amount of Deus Ex Machina, Plot Armor, Author Fiat, and the Lucky Hero trope.

I'm even less impressed with the Wizard Jesus thing JKR was so proud of. Sacrificing children because your adults are too cowardly and incompetent to fight sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums? Fuck that!

** Most of the plot was convenient coincidence - in my opinion, anyway. My reading of the books made me feel like she'd written her plot of each book before she started actually writing it and just bent or invented whatever she had to in order to make the story hit the stations she wanted it to.

Personally, I like both explanations of his 1981 survival - actively-cast magic or accidentally-found coincidence. The idea that Voldemort was genuinely willing to spare Lily and she actively chose to die which then activated the protection is quite interesting, especially linked with him trying to recruit her and James previously.

Having a cool ancient ritual that Lily found and ran with does make for a really interesting potential MacGuffin for a plot though.

But yeah, I like the idea that she essentially found a cheat code for the universe, where she had to line up a series of increasingly improbable events to make it happen. Dark Lord enters, kills the first defender, she expresses herself, then begs for her child's life, Dark Lord offers to let her live if she steps aside, she chooses not to, he kills her, and boom. Protection exists.

For all we know though, that could've been exactly what happened. Harry wasn't exactly interested in finding out the specifics on anything that wasn't directly related to someone being about to die, so... Useless little idiot. :)

*** harry being useless is what for the most part drives the plot

if he had been smart a lot events that are put down to him being "brave" could simply be seen as him being a dunderhead and not thinking things through

** I don't know. In my head surviving the Killing Curse was a one in a million thing. It's only under extremely crazy circumstances that it could happen, so of course once it does happen it's seen as extremely lucky after the fact. It's such a integral part of the story that I don't see it as plot armor, it's just the inciting incident.
