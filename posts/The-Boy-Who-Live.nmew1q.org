How exactly did Harry get the title The-Boy-Who-Live? The Potter's where hiding with a selected few people knows of there location, so how did the public know about their deaths?


** I believe that the popular theory (possibly canon?) is that Hagrid blabbed it out in a pub. It must have spread from there, someone must have asked Dumbledore, who reluctantly confirms that Harry deflected the Killing Curse.

*** I'm guessing by this time Hagrid has a reputation of blabbing while drinking? If that's the case why send his to get baby Harry?

**** /Shrugs in a Plot Hole or Points at Manipulative Dumbledore who seems to have lost the ability to apparate./. An even better question would be about how he got travelled there In the first place? He could hardly apparate and cannot fit into a floo grate.

** We don't know, the timeline at the start of the series is a little fuzzy, and Rowling herself admitted that she kinda fucked up by having a full day pass between the death of the Potters and the placement of Harry in Privet Drive.

A popular theory is that Hagrid did it (since he was one of the very few person who could have known that Harry survived, and is known to be terrible at keeping secrets). But he was also supposed to be with Harry at that time, and it's unlikely that he went drinking with Harry (especially considering the situation), so it's up to the Author to decide.

But one thing is sure is that people knew almost instantly that Voldemort was vanquished, and that by the end of the day, Harry Potter was praised by almost everyone as the "Boy-Who-Lived".

*** While JK feels like she fucked up, she could have easily explained it as the day of scouting is when Sirius went after Peter. That leads to the Aurors talking, spreading to other Ministry members, and makes them assume Voldemort was defeated. Then the Prophet reports it and gives it the Ol' Media spin of the hero being treated perfectly

** Well, Wizarding Britain is a very small and closed off society compared to Muggle Britain. So, I assume that any rumor would spread like wildfire. Especially one such as the Dark Lord failing to kill a little boy.

** I suppose that the backfiring of the Killing Curse was so huge that not only did it destroy the house but the Fidelius as well. A bunch of Ministry people came to obliviate the distraught muggle neighbors and, of course, Rita would be on site.

** What about the Lestranges? They would have known that Lord Voldemort went to the Potter's house to kill the child. They got caught at the same time, so maybe if their trial was same day then the public could've found out then or maybe the Aurors heard it when they were questioning them.

*** The Lestranges didn't get caught until after Halloween 1981. They at first evaded capture after Voldemort fell, and then got caught after they kidnapped and tortured the Longbottoms looking for information so they could find and bring back their master. It's unclear when exactly it happened, but it wasn't the same night that Voldemort fell.

**** Oh, thanks! I did think I was messing up the timeline a bit, I thought Voldemort told them to go after Neville on Halloween to eliminate both of the prophecy children at once.
