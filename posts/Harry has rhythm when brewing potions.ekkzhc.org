** I haven't read this one in a while, but could it possibly be linkao3(10588629) Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions? Harry doesn't have any natural gifts in potions in this one, but he got really keen on the subject and eventually convinced Snape to be his mentor. But I do remember Harry being distinctly bad at it, at least at the start.

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
