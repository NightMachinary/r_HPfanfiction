Preferably completed. I'm into Harry x Tom pairing right now but I generally like to read female perspectives more. But I'll take any rec you have regardless of pairing!

Also just to clarify, I mean Harry Potter characters in a Hunger Games world. Can still be magical as long as they have a competition like the Hunger Games. I'm not looking for Harry Potter x Hunger Games crossover, but if you know a good one then please rec is anyway! :)


** There's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23403907/chapters/56088451][this]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28625886/chapters/70163187][this]] fic- both WIPs, though.
