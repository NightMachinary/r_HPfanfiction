In honor of the start of the school year for Hogwarts, post your favorite Hogwarts centric fic. Whether it runs the stations of canon, is next gen or "historical", post some good fics that are all about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


** No, sadly. The whole area was cordoned off due to an outbreak of some kind. I don't remember what they said it was. The muggles will overreact to anything these days.

We had to Portkey to Hogsmeade and walk there this year.

*** Oh so it's not just me then. My owl was very annoyed at the whole commotion but at least we stopped at honeydukes and I could snack on some chocolate frogs on my way there. Got three new cards !

Also, where did you get a Grindelwald card from? He's not in the official listings. Someone might have conned you out of something good.

******* His card came out in 37' but they removed it from the official listings in 53' after a campaign by the families of his victims. There's a few paragraphs in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore where Skeeter goes into some evidence that Dumbledore waged a shadow campaign against the removal, but the support for the removal was too much for him to defeat without public opposition.

******** Oh, so maybe it /is/ a collectors item. Though, I have a gold card of “Herpo the Foul”, that just says “The Greatest Violation” on it. I tried to look him up, but I couldn't seem to find any record of him in the Hogwarts library.

Does anyone know who he is?

*** Silly muggles, ruining perfectly acceptable pureblood traditions that have stood in place for centuries. How will our children experience the wonder that is the Hogwarts train? Get rid with the lot of them, I say. Nothing but a nuisance!

** No unfortunately the plane to London was delayed due an outbreak. I had to use an international portkey to get to London and then take a taxi to Kings Cross Station. I got there late, so a professor had to pick me up from platform nine and three quarters.

** Ok, I don't know what the hell is going on. Last night I was coughing my lungs out in the corona ward and today I woke up to some nutter in a mask dumping me in this....train cabin? I can see kids walking outside the door but none of them seem to notice me, no matter how much I yell. And this stupid virus has me paralyzed because I've been unable to move an inch in the past hour (is that a known symptom?).

Oh shit...the train's beginning to move. Please send help and be sure to like and subscribe and hit the bell icon so you get notified whenever I update my vlog.

** I love this whole series but book 2 is my favorite so I will post the link to that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7786722/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-2-New-Version]]

It's called They Shook Hands and it is what if Harry had become friends with Draco in Madam Malkins Robe Shop when he was 11. He gets sorted into Slythrin and has a new group of friends(Crabbe, Goyle, Millie Bulstrode, Tracy Davis, Theo Nott, Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Daphne Greengrass & more) This has twists and turns which follow the genreal idea of each book(i.e: Harry is still in the Goblet of Fire, Chamber of Secerts is still open, Quirell is still possesed by Voldemort) but how they get there is differnt and so is the conclusion.\\
Book 7 is yet to be complete but the first 6 are awesome and each book is a good length(I think the shortest is 19 chapters with the longest being 31. The second book is about 400 pages long(there are 98,000 words and 100,000 words are about 400 pages so this is just an estimate)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
