Thought I would share this as I haven't seen it on here before.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1619871/Vekin87]] I should point out I didn't write these.

They are full book length stories following Harry's youngest son, Albus, through his Hogwarts years. They are very well written and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Definitely check them out if you want a good fan-fiction to dive into.


** Love these fics. Really got me into the fanfiction community and they're all finished as a series.
