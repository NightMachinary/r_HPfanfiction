I've been musing over a fic like this for some time where the professors have to solve/complete things while having to deal with the stresses of their main job as well.


** I've always enjoyed the idea that every Hogwarts student gets involved in their own annual adventure, and that Harry's were just the most extreme. But the magic of the castle (in the more fairytale, Disney meaning of magic, not a specific enchantment) makes sure that everyone's time at Hogwarts is special. And that's why it's the best school of magic in the world.

I'd never considered involving the teachers as well, though. Nice idea.

** This could be really interesting. If I were a more practiced writer I'd work on it myself.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7031677/34/The-Professors-Point-of-View]]

not exactly what you are looking for but its humorous. Formatted like a group text chat between the four house heads and guest starring the various DADA professors. Their perspective on harry's adventures. Everything from bragging over quidditch games to plotting ways to kill lockheart
