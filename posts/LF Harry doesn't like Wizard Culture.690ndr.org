Hey guys I am looking for something again (obviously ;) ),

this time it's a Harry (Bonus points if he's smart and well behaved etc.) who doesn't like Wizard Culture at all and voices that by:

- disliking robes (outright refusing to wear a "dress" for example!)
- saying that Hogwarts is DANGEROUS (trick stairs, fake doors, changing staircases etc.)
- refusing to work with teachers who don't teach (Snape, Hagrid, Quirrel, Lockhart etc.)
- hating (and refusing to use) quills and parchment
- wanting quality education and modern facilities!
- etc. etc. (there's probably a hundred more things that you could dislike about wizard culture and life!)

As always:

- No (main character) slash (so no Harry/Draco, Lucius, Voldemort etc. etc.)
- preferably not Harry/Ginny (burnt out on that pairing, especially since it IMHO makes even less sense than Harry dating a random pretty Slytherin, especially since that doesn't carry the risk of being pranked into oblivion (or worse: Cursed!) by the twins and Bill and the other Weasleys!)
- no canon rehash (can follow canon for a time, but not forever!)

So, once again: The stage is yours and THANKS in advance for your contributions :)

ps: Smut is fine (if it's not smut without a plot!)

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** My own story linkffn(Harry Potter and the Iron Lady) is about a Harry who generally has a strong dislike for wizarding culture, so much so he's out to topple the ministry and forcibly integrate wizards into the muggle culture. However, since he's also a spy for the SAS, he puts up with most of the Hogwarts nonsense to remain under the radar. Except for pumpkin juice, because that's just gross.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

** The problem with what you want to have is that it turns Harry into a annoying dick and an eleven year old child "boycotting" classes sounds like he's throwing a tantrum.

Now, if Harry would be criticising the whole thing rationally (and he'd need to be at least 16 in order to be taken somewhat seriously) the story would be much better. There are many things to point out, from Hogwarts safety standards to the casual use of rape drugs (Molly even praising them in front of kids).

*** Well, you bet I'd throw a tantrum because of SNAPE, that man is ABUSIVE (you don't have to be Harry to be abused by this guy, his shoddy teaching alone is abuse IMHO, but it "helps" to be Harry - if you are you get attacked for breathing too loudly etc.!)...they would have to drag me to that class (otherwise I would not go!) and any assigned detentions because of that man I'd ignore! (note: I was part of a class that forced a hardass teacher to give up and run out crying, a teacher that kind of was like Snape and we also forced another teacher to stop trying to teach us tradition folk dancing (all the boys in the class walked out after 4-5 weeks of that and refused to enter the classroom again if he didn't stop that, especially since the curriculum did not say we had to learn those! That was the one time that shitty class made me proud to be part of it - they otherwise bullied me and I hated them!)

Maybe, then again Harry is a celebrity, I'd think that if he talks to the right people (say if he had Rita Skeeter on his side, she'd print what he has to say for an exclusive interview, I am sure!) the world would listen (they'd have to with pressure mounting - it's not like Harry is the only one who doesn't like Snape's teaching (or lack of teaching!), most Ravenclaws probably hate him for his shoddy teaching, the Gryffs hate him for bias and the loyal Huffelpuffs would probably support both houses!)

**** He could get Snape sacked by pointing out to Umbridge that the man is a confessed Death Eater and only avoided Azkaban on Dumbledore's word.

The issue is that a lot of the "independent" Harrys are just dicks because they are whiney kids who say a lot of cringy stuff like the infamous "I WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED" speech or calling Snape Snivellus to his face instead of simply acting. Big speeches are something for cartoonish villains or the proletarian revolution, not for a young man fed up with a bunch of stupid adults (as they are portrayed in the books).

Edit: Hell, I'd understand murdering Snape for what he did to Harry's parents alone, not even considering his teaching or the mind rape disguised as occlumency teaching. But simply stun him from under the invisibility cloak and then throw him into Aragog's nest instead of long winded declarations that would fit better at a political ralley.

****** Sometimes, yeah, you are right :(

I love stories where Harry does stuff on his own (at best his still listening to good advice, while discarding shitty advice and not letting himself be led around by the nose (like a dancing bear/a puppet!)), killing Snape is something I think he should have done (I still think it's beyond cringy that he named a child: Albus Severus...it shows that Harry lacks self-respect IMHO (he doesn't assert himself often and thinks he isn't important, he thinks his feelings etc. don't matter!), because those two men are responsible for a lot of the bad things in his life! The whole Dursley abuse and neglect can be laid at Dumbledore's feet for placing him there (against McGonagall's advice and that McGonagall, who's largely apathic IMHO speaks out against her mentor is telling, it tells us that the Dursleys must be really really bad!), not checking up on him and sending him back there every year! Sirius's death can be laid at Snapes feet, then there's the abuse in class and the mind-rape (not to mention that Snape actively tried to destroy Harry's idealized image of his parents, which is a disgusting thing to do to an orphan child, you wait till somebody is an adult for that IMHO! Tell them if asked (don't lie to a child to preserve some fantasy, but also don't actively destroy it yourself!)) that he called "teaching occlumency"!)

Same for some Dursley payback (I love fictions where Harry's family helped pay for Nr. 4 Privet Drive and where Harry takes it back and kicks them out!), they deserve it (what goes around comes around, right? Karma and all that!)

******* I mostly agree with you, I hate the whole epilogue. Unfortunately, one of the symptoms of having a completely crushed self worth is that you really don't consider anything done to you as being wrong, after all, it's only you that is harmed by it, and whoever did it must have had a good reason. Killing those responsible either requires that A. Harry was a lot more resistant to being crushed, which would require an point of divergence that makes it HINO really, or B. Someone else to do it.

On McGonagall's advice about the Dursleys: I recently ran across a fic, that pointed out something I hadn't realized until then. When she said they are the "Worst sort of muggles" she likely didn't mean they are going to neglect and abuse him, she probably meant they are going to spoil him rotten, make him an arrogant prat, etc.

After all, what would she have seen observing them? A baby being spoiled, both of them making airs and thinking they are much more important they they really are... at worst, Vernon grumbling about foreigners while watching the news. It's not like Petunia or Vernon were going to talk about how much they hate magic when they can just happily forget it exists instead.

****** I consider writing something along those lines. I have two plot bunnies sitting on my GDrive which are going into that direction.

One would be Harry/Katie with Tonks as a sort of sister figure set at the end of PoA when Sirius gets Andromeda to take Harry in.

The other idea is a Harry/Pansy fic set in the fifth year where she wants to change sides and they use an marriage contract between the Black heir and House Parkinson (which was set up for Draco when he was presumed heir Black) and use the contract as cover.

** I'm not certain that there's enough in Canon that would qualify as "pureblood culture". Robes, quills/parchment and Quidditch are basically the main non-magical differences. The wizards even celebrate Christmas - and Harry gets a hand-knitted jumper, not a robe from Molly.

*** Agreed. I feel like anyone who gets that into the fandom develops an opinion, and you can see it reflected in a lot of their work. There are a lot of writers who are like, "Quills are so annoying and irritating, let's use pens instead", whereas those who are more interested in magic and magical culture might write about enchanted quills to write for you, or correct your work, or never run out of ink or splotch ink every where. With magic, there is no real reason pens should be superior, but I feel like they get put in as a reflection of how the auther sees the Wizarding World. I admit that I am biased towards Wizarding Culture instead of against though.

Since the Magicals were so bent on secrecy, perhaps they should learn more about the changes in the Muggle world and fitting in better. Even for wizards who didn't like Muggles and saw them as enemies, isn't it more prudent to learn what your enemies were up to and capable of?
