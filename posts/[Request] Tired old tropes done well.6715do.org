I've been reading fanfiction for a long, long time. Long enough to get very sick of pretty much every tired trope under the sun. Nowadays, if I see any of the more heinous of tropes (usually indy!Harry, "dark!Harry" or "gray!Harry," manipulative!Dumbledore, character bashing of any kind, etc.) I immediately close the fic and never go back to it. But I recently wondered if I was passing up some good fics just because they used some tired fan plot devices. Does anyone have any suggestions for stories with tropes like the aforementioned that are actually well-written? That is to say, with characters that are actually somewhat believable, a comprehensible plot, and a decent grasp of grammar and spelling and so forth.

No other restrictions. If it's really good, I'll read it regardless!


** "Nightmares of Future Past" is one of the original Peggy Sue stories, and as such, has some of the tropes that you've mentioned, though it does so in a relatively mild way [Dumbledore isn't evil at all, he's merely seeing Harry's actions as disturbingly similar to Tom Riddle's and conflict arises accordingly].

Seeing as it more or less started many of the tropes that make up a huge chunk of canon-deviant fan fiction (compared to Missing Moments like "Fire and Air"), it seems worth a mention.

** Hmm ... I will point you to “the heir of something or other” (linkao3(4330836)).

It has the “Harry gets sorted into Slytherin” that actually is, despite the story being pretty much a canon rehash with changes (it is a one-shot that spans seven years, it's quite hard to do /that/ without having a summary of stuff that happens to which you add the stuff that changes), done well. No grand politics or unknown powers awakening, just a story about a kid that gets sorted into Slytherin.

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense; The Never-ending Road) and two good examples of the fem!Harry trope.

linkffn(12386885) so far is an interesting take on the Hermione-goes-back-in-time-to-prevent-Voldemort-from happening. The way its set up, TMR isn't going to instantly fall in love with her at Hogwarts.

In which Hermione faces a rising Dark Lord in his prime. 1950 was never her intention.
