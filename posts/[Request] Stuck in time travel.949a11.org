Hey ! I just read "The wizard from earth" by Morta's Priest, and I liked the idea. linkffn(8337871)

Would you know of any other decent-length fanfiction where HP is stuck in the begginings of civilization ? I already read that one where he is sent as a baby in the past (Voldemort's last spell or something ?).

Thx !


** The only fic that's close enough to what you want is A Long Journey Home.

If anybody knows other fics similar to that would be very welcome, I've been looking for fics like these too.

** There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]] , although it is a bit tropy and even a bit cringy, at least in the first chapter. There are some good ideas in it and it's an interesting read. I've personally stopped reading it after 40-something chapters because I found the "past" bits repetitive ( basically, Harry goes traveling for a century or two, comes back, nobody recognize him and people are being assholes, Harry gets ancient and bad-ass in their faces, fixes everything, rinse/repeat). And the "presents" bit were uninspiring and uninspired.

But still, could be a good read and there is plenty of fun stuff in it if you are in the mood.
