So you can bash Ron for his laziness, or lack of loyalty during the TWT. You can bash Hermione for her going behind Harry's back during the broom incident in PoA(that's what I hated. Not Hermione going to a teacher, but doing it behind his back). You can bash Harry for a lot of crap to be honest. You can bash Ginny for her, actually I don't know. Never really paid attention to Ginny as a character, but i'm sure there's something.

Essentially only bash the characters for shit that deserves to be bashed, but not made up crap. The Weasleys aren't stealing from Harry, Hermione isn't a bossy know-it-all, Harry has a crap hand, sure, but so do a lot of other people. Build a bridge, and find a way to get over it. Be less of the follower you act like, and start thinking, but not to indy!Harry levels. Just grow a spine.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
