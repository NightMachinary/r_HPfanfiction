:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, all!

I've gotten back into reading fic and I remembered this story i read and can't get it out of my head. i'm hoping someone knows what i'm talking about and knows the name.

Unfortunately i don't remember much and all my google searches are dead ends.

i remember someone talking about it on twitter and i binge read it. it's not a traditional story, from what i remember. it's almost like a brief check in with each character in the present day. i remember it being pretty dark and sad. the clearest part i remember is ron being unable to cope and slowly drifting from harry and becoming addicted to drugs, specifically heroin i believe?

i know it's not much to work from, i'm sorry for that. but hopefully someone knows what i'm taking about. thanks in advance!
