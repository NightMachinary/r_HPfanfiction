I want help in finding 2 fanfictions. One is where draco stays with Hermione during war in grimmauld or somewhere. He has a blood curse which can be passed on to the next-generation. His hair is very dark due to the curse and it turns lighter as Hermione becomes pregnant. He and Ron Harry have become friends and after they return from a mission draco is pissed with Hermione because he thinks she pitied him and became pregnant on purpose

Second is where draco and Hermione are seeing each other in secret during Hogwarts. But he is on the other side and Hermione leaves him giving him a ribbon where he asks him to switch sides. He then approaches Dumbledore and asks him to hide his parents and then Hermione and draco unite. Hermione rides a broom to reach draco on top of the tower.


** I swear I know that second one, was it also that the ribbon was originally from him giving it to her after a quidditch match? I think it was on LJ

Edit: Found it! [[https://dramionelove.livejournal.com/40946.html][For Her Favor by captainraychill]]
