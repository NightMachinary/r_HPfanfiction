i find their relationship very interesting; snape seemed to be voldemort's favored death eater, probably because he saw something of himself in snape -- a young, brilliant half-blood who'd had a shitty childhood and was looking to rise above his upbringing.

i'd prefer not to read anything with a snape/voldemort pairing though, i'm just looking for fics that explore their platonic relationship.
