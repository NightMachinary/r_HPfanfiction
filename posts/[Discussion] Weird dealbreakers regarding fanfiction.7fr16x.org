** It doesn´t really show up in HP fanfiction, but authors trying to show their weeb cred, by using honorifics, which I can somewhat tolerate, but putting random Japanese words in it for no reason, is where I draw the line. Characters speaking English, one moment and then just trying to push dobe or baka into a sentence, like it´s a dry butt plug, just hurts.

**** I just recently read a Naruto fanfic, that always had author notes in the beginning, which I don´t mind and a really lengthy list of every jutsu, that was used in the chapter, that I could also tolerate, but what was really annoying, was that, after every jutsu, there was a translation in brackets, it wasn´t a dealbreaker though, but I stopped for other reasons, though I came pretty far because I didn´t have anything else to read.

*** I drop fanfiction with oc Sith Lords with edgy shitty names with no meaning, its why i cant finish Darth Maars Sith Harry fic. The names of a Darth either have a meaning (Sidious=Insidious, Tyrannous=Tyrant, Vader=Father) or a meaning to the persons past. Darth Shadix sounds like a shitty sonic Oc and ignores the point of a Sith name.

** Spelling a person's name wrong. I can understand once or twice in one chapter but after that someone should have told them that hey you were spelling a person's name wrong. That just irks me. And especially when they spell the person's name wrong multiple times in different ways.

Also something relatively minor that I'm okay with most of the time, but can get kind of annoying is when the A/N is really long. Like I understand the author wanting to update people or answer questions or whatever, but when the A/N gets as long as the chapter that's pushing it a bit. At least imo.

** I also really dislike ALL CAPs. Rowling apparently used in book five, I haven't read the actual books for a while, so didn't remember that, but I still find it annoying even knowing that.

Attempting a humorous tone is usually a deal breaker for me, which I guess is sort of weird. While I like Pratchett and Adams, most fic authors are not near that level and when they attempt this I just find the characters act in ways that don't make sense because it's funny, and the dialogue is usually unrealistic and cringeworthy, which constantly breaks my immersion in the story.

In general unrealistic dialogue is a deal breaker for me, which can often happen in non humor fics too.

On the opposite end, fics that try to be super dark and angsty also often similarly have a lot of stuff that breaks my immersion, like things constantly happening just so that the main character is shit on and can complain about it.

Basically I like fics with subtlety, being too in your face about stuff with the tone bothers me. Also that they are written like the author is trying to write legit prose rather than just throwing stuff on a page to get across a cool story idea. I like a fic to take itself seriously, in terms of being a story, not saying the plot itself needs to be serious. Not sure if that makes sense.

******* I just looked it up, Harry is the only character who uses caps for yelling. This is also really only in book 5, where he's angsting the entire time. So, in conclusion, using an exclamation point to make the character yell is easier, and makes more sense to the reader. I have read some of your stories, and in many of the points where you choose to use CAPs lock to accentuate your meanings, you could instead use italics. Thank you for telling me about CAPs Harry, however. I have read the books, but most of my memorization is from listening to the audiobooks every night for years.

I can't commit if I don't feel like it's going somewhere and have trouble buying a story as developed if it's shorter. However I like really developed drama/romance fics, which you can't really do in fewer words (in general). I'm sure it works okay for other genres.
