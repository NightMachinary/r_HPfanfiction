Hello there! I am looking for Fanfictions that deals with Harry reaction to what happened at the end of book five, more specifically what transpired in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Due to the events being spoilers I will not specify but I assume you all know what I mean. Regarding the kind of fics, I am looking for. Basically, I am looking for fics that show Harry's way of coping with what happened. Be it via suicide, self-harm, finding comfort in an unexpected place or someone, coming into his inheritance, another relative popping up... Basically anything as long as it's not slash and time-travel. There can also be other elements in the story such as Harry finding out that Ron and the others no longer wish to talk to him and blame him for their injuries and the actions it causes him to make like asking to be re-sorted for example.


** That's generally the starting point for thousands of indy!Harry fics. I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control][Taking Control]], linkffn(2954601), is a reasonable place to begin.

*** I know and I actually read this one but the reason I posted a thread here looking for these kinds of fics is that the way authors write it became too much repetitive. I do not mind a "Harry finds his heritage" fics but I would like it if it's done a bit differently be it the pairing that is unusual or anything else that defer it from the typical fics. Do you happen to know any fics like those I described here and in the OP?
