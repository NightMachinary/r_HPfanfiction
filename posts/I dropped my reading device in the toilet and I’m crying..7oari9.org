What's worse, I hardly log into my ff account so I bookmark the stories I'm reading instead... and now I've lost them all.

Edit: Thanks to everyone for sending tips and offering to help me with re-finding all my fics. I remember some of them, and if another comes to mind that I can't name I'll definitely be asking on here.

The device is old and unfortunately not worth repairing... so I'm currently just hoping for the best, but I don't think it will be waking up any time soon.

Learn from my mistake guys! Backup your stories or at least follow and fave them on the site so you can go back to them! I hope to never see another post like mine on this subreddit.

Thanks again!

*** Rice does nothing. OP should take it to a profession phone shop and hope.

Even if rice did mysteriously dry out the phone (it won't) the evaporated water will leave behind residue and unless dried properly within a day or 2 will corrode and be a paperweight.

***** Lucky is all. Or you did not try to turn it on. Has been proven again and again rice does nothing and can actually hinder drying out your phone.

Just do a short google search. Just trying to help op with my original comment.

***** Nope, it is well and truly dead. It was an old device so it's not worth taking to a professional for it to be repaired.. I'm just sad for the fics I'd saved and the pics I've taken on it.

******* It was 5+ years of reading fanfiction, a good 300+ were webcomics I either was reading or wanted to read, for reasons I can't even remember I had a folder full of tvtropes pages, another full of shit I looked up on Wikipedia, another full of games I would like to play when I could actually afford them... I can't remember if there was anything else.

Something like half were fanfiction though, I know because I took them one by one and categorized them in a Google sheet document. It took me a week to do it, and I ended up with a little less than a thousand entries.

And I don't bookmark porn, I like finding new things :)

If not, hope there's someway to access the device memory if it can't be repaired!
