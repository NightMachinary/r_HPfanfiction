No matter how the timeline changes, Harry Potter always ends up vanquishing Voldemort at Hogwarts, though the how may differ. The weirder the better!


** Timeline 156472- Neville longbottom didnt know if he could believe it, it happened right in front of him, but yet...

"No way that happened right?" He thought

Nevertheless, Voldemorts corpse was right in front of him, small shards of clay poking out from various places in his cloak, above him, stood the suspiciously hairy man from the muggle pottery club James and Snape had swore didnt exist.

** Attempt No. 7669

Everything should have been accounted for. Both James and Lily are dead, as are their parents and grandparents. Voldemort has been subjected to so many procedures his power approaches that of a god. Hogwarts has been destroyed via alchemical warhead.

Yet, Harry Potter was born. The child of a forgotten squib in the Potter line, we found and captured him. Killing him is not advised (see attempts 30-176), so we bound his soul and destroyed his magic, then set Voldemort on his trail.

During their "battle", Voldemort had a sudden onset of mental flux (common in those so powerful) ,and while concentrating to clear it, the boy took his wand. A surge of accidental magic (apparently, Hades Extract doesn't work on mudbloods, how /convenient/) channeled through a wand connected by destiny, and Voldemort's momentarily disabled defenses, meant my lord was no more.

I give up, let someone else try their hand at this.

** It BECAME an experiment but did not start off as one. It started off as malicious.

His name was Ragetti Crook, a lowlife known internationally (to those with an ear out for such things) as a rather... unique assassin.

*The assassin that stepped through time.*

The Department of Mysteries was already wary of him in principle, as his killings caused changes in time. Ripples that could drastically alter their entire way of life. But, they had no reason to move against him.

Until the Paradox Room, an instrumental part of the Department's scheme for monitoring their timeline, were alerted to a monumental change linked back to a killing Crook had performed.

/The date, July 2nd 1966. The victim: six year old Lily Evans./

The residents of the Paradox Room panicked. Harry Potter's parents on the list of those who had to be protected at all costs. The Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, without James or Lily he wouldn't be born. THUS the Dark Lord would not be defeated. Everything was put on hold to put this right.

However things got... strange when the resident Unspeakable went to the Head of their Department to requisition Hit-Wizards to catch Crook and revert the timeline.

Harry Potter did exist, and he defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Exactly when and how he was supposed to...

He'd actually recently been seen with his dear friend Colin Creevey at Fortescue's, enjoying a banana splir. The Boy Wh Lived finally free of the shadows of war.

From what they knew of him, he was the same as he'd always been. Gifted at Defense, the wielder of the Elder wand and looking exactly like his father James.

With his mothers blonde hair, greyish/blue eyes and being two years younger than he was supposed to be.

With those exceptions, with further studies, more came to light. His parentage had obviously changed, but the Dark Lord had failed to target the Potter's in 1981 as there was no destined child there with James and Narcissa. He instead slaughtered the family at Spinner's End in December of 1983, where the family of three was meeting with suspected Death Eater Severus Snape, the spell reflecting off of the newly orphaned child and his fathers friend sent to Azkaban for "leading them into a trap".

They of course thoroughly gathered information on all further changes from that point onwards, as was expected of them, and compiled them for later study. Crook was captured in a sting and Lily rescued. The timeline reverted and the Paradox Room looked out on all things normal.

She died a second time, this time at age eight on the 1st of February. However the time traveller in question did so under orders from his government (not a former Death Eater) and made sure to assassinate Lily at a later date so as to avoid crossover with the previous attempt.

Under strict orders, intelligence was gathered. Harry James Potter was born a year prior in this timeline, the eldest of five when his father James accidentally impregnated an upper-classman Alice Trent (better known as Longbottom in the prime timeline). Whereas the family was attacked, the Potter's were able to escape when tipped off by Snape that the Dark Lord was coming. The Dark Lord annihilated in a trap and no child bearing the moniker of "Boy Who Lived" in this timeline at all.

Yet, in May of 1998, Voldemort stormed Hogwarts castle and fell at the wand of Harry James Potter. Just as he had in the Prime timeline. Just as he had in the timeline where Harry was born the son of Narcissa Black.

This continued, every action leading to the same outcome. 2nd of May 1998, Harry Potter defeated Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Due to bureaucracy, they were limited with the changes they could make, but found the most interesting results when James Potter was targeted.

In the first timeline they attempted James's murder, the Hit-Wizard squad was violently rebuffed by a mixture of the timelines Aurors and some unknown force.

They were successful on the third attempt.

On their return to the modern day, they found the world was blitzed by an unknown calamity that the Paradox Room residents were the only survivors of. Forced to return on time themselves to put a halt to the murder.

They instead tried more subtle approaches...

*/▪︎ An infertility potion given to Potter was somehow ignored when Lily and James conceived exactly when they should have./*

*/▪︎Castration lead to the couple urged to study alchemy and blood magic to create offspring. Seeing results five years after Harry was due to be born./*

*/▪︎ An enchantment to alter James Potter's sexual preference initially failed in the face of Lily Evans, but eventually succeeded (in another timeline) where he entered a relationship with Remus Lupin. He was then assaulted by a lovestruck Delores Umbridge who conceived a child she would call Harry James./*

*/▪︎ A series of transfiguration's on Euphemia Potter's developing offspring lead to Jamie Potter's birth. The young woman mothering Harry James after a fling with Sirius Black./*

They were convinced long before this point, but it only, truly hit home at this point.

Harry Potter's birth was a requirement. Almost an inevitability (had the few successes where they prevented it not said otherwise) where the times he did not exist were subject to a tragedy on a far greater scale than Voldemort.

A cosmic force. Some feat of magic. Something (or even someone) decreed that James Potter [in whatever form he was in] would give birth to a child named Harry James Potter, who would kill the Dark Lord Voldemort on the 2nd of May 1998.

Yes, something was going on here. And whatever it was had just made it clear it wanted them to stop...

******** I said they were limited in what they could change (by their higher ups) for a reason. So they don't viciously alter the timeline.

Thus, in their limited scope of experiments they got their results. If they tried to alter it further (e.g. kill Voldemort as a child/stop Hogwarts from being founded etc.) I dunno. Maybe the 'mysterious force' would lash out at them, maybe their superiors would have a go at them for fundamentally altering Wizarding history.

I can see, for the purpose of the experiment, them wanting to try that. Maybe an alternate route would be that, if Voldemort wasn't born then Harry wouldn't be either. I can see them being allowed to get away with that.

But there are too many pieces to manipulate to completely stop the Battle of Hogwarts that I don't think they could do it even if they were allowed. There is no one or two things they can do to stop it that doesn't cross a big line (e.g. if they nuked Hogwarts they probably couldn't battle there, but maybe Tom would still want to kill Harry in the smouldering crater of his home).

Just as " Something (or even someone) decreed that James Potter(in whatever form he was in) would give birth to a child named Harry James Potter, who would kill the Dark Lord Voldemort on the 2nd of May, 1998." it would probably also be decreed that a child named Tom Marvolo Riddle would be born in the 31st of December, 1926, destined to try to take the wizarding world within his grasp, committing genocide in the process. No matter the circumstances. Decrees like this don't just happen, and they require a lot of careful planning and highly precise execution. there's a reason why all roads lead to god damn Rome.

It'd be interesting to see the Unspeakables try and fiddle with getting rid of Hogwarts and/or forcing the Battle to occur somewhere else and failing just as they did when meddling with James.

** Seeing him struggle, and despite his friends remarks against it, James plucks up third year Severus Snape and refuses to leave his side.

After three years with Sirius he has a very vague idea as to why Snape flinches at contact and why he's so reluctant to talk about his father.

Summer comes, James invites himself over to Spinners End, accompanied by his mother when she is uncomfortable with just leaving her baby in an unknown Muggle neighbourhood. As luck would have it, Mr Snape is there and has no qualms in trying to intimidate and assault the older woman that is Euphemia Potter.

A costly mistake.

Thus, when Sirius runs away from home in 6th year, he goes to the Potter's where a divorced Miss Prince and her son Severus have been living with them for nearly two years at that point.

Snape and Sirius are a bit snippy with one another, always at each others throats, but you would be a liar if you said that Severus and Sirius weren't best friends, just as all the Marauders should be.

** In one of the many universes across the infinity of space and time, Harry Potter -son of James and Lily Potter- was destined to bring down the fearsome Dark Lord known as Lord Voldemort. His amazing feat would spawn multiple universes with the same formula, only slightly altered by small details, for it was a milestone in the history of humanity.

But not in this universe.

The early demise of one Lily Evans destroyed all hopes for the brave young hero to be born, sealing away the opportunity of his story to told once again.

But...

Destiny would always find her way around.

After all, the title of "Dark Lord vanquisher" was not given to the infant after the amazing deed, but instead, long before his birth. It was a wish, or rather, the cumulation of many wishes from the wizarding people that gave birth to a hero. It was their yearnings for the war to end, for their deceased ones to be avenged, for a man strong enough to stand against him, that bestowed such a heavy burden on the existence known as "Lord Voldemort's slayer". His background was irrelevant as long as the timing was correct, for destiny would take care of everything that followed.

And this was the case, in a world where James Potter would never meet a fiery red-headed girl. His life would go on as usual, not knowing his wife of many timelines was taken from him by a rogue time-traveller. He met his life-long friends, pulled pranks and eventually fell in love a with a sharp blonde girl in his last days of school. His wife, intelligent as she was, would find a way to evade the clutches of the Dark Lord and secure their lives long enough for Harry to grow up knowing his parents. But alas, destiny would call and claim their lives as per it was written in the stars, and the young Harry Potter would rise from the depths of hell and vanquish the Dark Lord as usual, for it was his purpose as an existence after all. No matter his lineage, age or gender, Harry Potter was fated to kill the Dark Lord.

*********** That's for sure. But I think it's more to do with his upbringing. I guess he values his friends more because he didn't have any growing with the Dursley's in an abusive household.
