:END:
There was a story I read a while ago with Harry being very powerful and I remember a scene where I think Dumbledore or someone in power is trying to get him to do something so Harry and Pomfrey came up with a plan for him to become her Apprentice. I'm pretty sure there is a duel with Lucius Malfoy where he ends up killing him as well. Pomfrey is also like a war hero I think or at least knows killing and violence is necessary in certain situations. Harry also has multiple lovers I think as well. I thought it was Runestone Path but I don't think that's the right story. Any help would be appreciated!

**** It hasn't been updated for three years, except for an update from the author saying they were working on it two years ago.

#+begin_quote
  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
