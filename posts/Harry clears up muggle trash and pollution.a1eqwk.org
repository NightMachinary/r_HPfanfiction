*** THIS IS IT!!!!!!! I didn't mention the space program/new world bit because I wasn't sure if I was mixing up this series and Ninja Wizard or not. I have been looking for this for like a year!!!!\\
I completely forgot it was a crossover with Marvel.

*** Dragon_Tamer166 has found it if you want to have a look.\\
I completely forgot it was a crossover with Marvel, and there was another bit that I wasn't sure if I was mixing up this series and another (Ninja Wizard), I wasn't but didn't put it in just in case.

** Reading the tittle, my sleep-deprived brain thought that you wanted a Harry that killed muggles because they were trash.

And sorry, but I've never seen anything remotely like what you asked.

** Two titles into the series, thoroughly enjoying myself. The fic also gave me something I've never experienced before and really ended up enjoying (weirdly, because kind of best girl IMO)

*** Glad I helped you find a new fic then. :)\\
The author also has a series called Ninja Wizard which is similar but instead of Marvel it is crossed over with Naruto and Last Airbender that you may also enjoy.
