For reference here is the SCP website (note: many SCP stories are in the horror category and can be disturbing): [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/]] And it's wikipedia page: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation]]

In fanfic terms, SCP essentially consists of hundreds of oneshots told in the form of case files or interviews created by the Foundation (fictional secret organization that secures all the named/nameless horrors/mysteries). Many are horror based, probably the majority, but there are also crack-fic-esque stories, mystery, humor, etc. Besides the possibility of interesting crossovers, I think the SCP writing style would be good inspiration for fanfiction authors.

I searched fanfiction.net and found only 1 fic described as a SCP crossover: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9763839/1/Secure-Containment-of-Prophecy-Case-Number-368-SCP-368]]

Unfortunately, this is not a real crossover. It contains nothing from SCP. The connection is limited to the author changing the wording behind the SCP abbreviation.

A fic that has a similar feel to an SCP story is "Concentric Wavelengths" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/]]

It plays on the Dept of Mysteries containment of dangerous items and what happens when something goes wrong. I think it would be very interesting to see some crossovers with specific SCP items interacting with the wizarding world.

*the first two links go to stories categorized as horror.\\
What if wizards stumbled on SCP-087? [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-087]]

Or what if SCP-096 was seen by a wizard? [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096]]

Maybe SCP-055 is under a Fidelius [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-055]]

Any thoughts? Or does anyone know of HPxSCP fics?


** I could totally see horcruxes ending up as SCPs.

*** Marvin, fetch 963 please.

Oh, I don't think he works here :-)

*** Definitely. Maybe one gets picked up by SCP without them realizing what it was. All sorts of ways that could go.

What would happen if the researchers got a boggart and tried to use it to learn the greatest fear SCP-682? Naturally it would go horribly wrong.
