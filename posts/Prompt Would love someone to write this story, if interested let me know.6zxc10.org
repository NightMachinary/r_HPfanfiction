Name: The DA continued (Note the name can change if you want it to, not the best at naming titles).

Harry continues the DA after Umbridge is gone from the school, even getting more students that want to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts by the Boy-Who-Lived, even getting a few Slytherins along the way who are neutral in regards to Blood Purity and other believes that Pureblood Slytherins normally have.

Seeing that the DA is such a big hit with many students because of the tutoring; Harry decides to expand the DA, by not only teaching students Defense but also teaching Transfigurations, Potions and the like. But knowing that he isn't the best at the other subjects he has other students be the teacher for those respectful classes, even rotating students to be the teacher.

For instance one week Lavender Brown will be the Professor for Divination, then Parvati Patil ect extra.

For one week Hermione will be the teacher for Transfiguration, then Dean Thomas or whomever.

Neville Longbottom will be teacher for Herbology, then say Colin Creevey or Susan Bones or whomever

And so on and so forth, letting each student be a teacher for the certain subject that they excell at.

Pairings/Characters: Absolutely NO Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but other then that go for it. And seeing multiple characters being the teacher for different classes and getting to know Harry and other students better would be great.

Would love to see how the students teach each other, being able to get along with each other and even making friends with people that they normally wouldn't otherwise. Would like to see the rotation for each person teaching a certain class, for instance two or three chapters being about Neville, another one or two being about Ginny teaching or whoever; every few chapters or so. (I definitely want to see Neville and Luna teach the respectful subjects, especially Neville).

The prophecy can still be in place as well as Voldemort trying to kill Harry, but now with the students actually getting to know Harry Potter instead of just reading about him in the newspaper and believing what they read they stand behind him more.

Don't say that here. People get pissed.

Anyways, I was interested in what you were saying until your second to last paragraph. Stories with rotating perspectives are rarely up to par quality wise. Exceptions are present, of course, but limited.

*** Perhaps not changing perspectives, just showing lightly how the students handle the different teaching. And sorry, I just really don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, so thought I'd mention it.

Of course the way I said I wanted it written can be done differently, to be more helpful to people so they don't have say 10 different perspectives to write about or whatever.

** My biggest issue would be finding able instructors. Because most of the characters you listed would be unable to teach their peers. Sure, Susan and Dean might be good in their subjects but no way they could teach older students. Harry had extensive training due to the Triwizard Tournament as well as a natural affinity for DADA. He achieved the best score in living memory. The only ones that come close would be Neville in Herbology and maybe Hermione (I doubt her patience to teach dunderheads, not her knowledge).

The other problem is coordinating the lessons. The DA already had issues with this and they were only doing one subject. Between four different Quidditch schedules, the different clubs and coordinating seven years of students there is little free time where everyone can attend.

And maybe you should think about how politics work. No one in a position of power would radically change their position just because their kids like someone. Having a score of teens believing Harry will do nothing unless you turn Susan Bones into a plot device that allows Harry to influence her aunt. But that would be absolutely atrocious writing which I have seen far too many times. Characters should be individuals with goals and dreams, not tools for the protagonist.

And on the subject of including Slytherins: Please do not add Daphne Greengrass just for the sake of adding Daphne Greengrass. There are dozens of other Slytherins to choose from.

*** I only added those as an offer. The writer of the story is free to use whatever character they would like.

I always wondered why Hogwarts never offered tutoring to those who clearly needed it (Neville Longbottom and even Ron Weasley coming to mind). So I thought Harry expanding the DA to have other students help well other students would be a nice thing to have done.

And yeah I agree with you on Daphne, I like her and all but there's a certain way I like her written and how she's normally written is the Slytherin Ice Queen, which is rather annoying type for her in my opinion.

I always thought it would be nice for them to strengthen the bonds between the four houses, there's always fights between the four; mainly between Gryffindors and Slytherins, but still every house could stand to get to know people behind how they normally do.
