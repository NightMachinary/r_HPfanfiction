** In "Like A Red Headed Stepchild", Harry is born with a much greater resemblence to his mother than his father. Snape is much less antagonistic towards Harry due to this.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** It's only partly Harry, but, like in the other rec, his hair makes it impossible for Snaps to hate him. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy]]) .
