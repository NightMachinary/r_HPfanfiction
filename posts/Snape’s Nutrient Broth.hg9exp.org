Not a euphemism. I swear every time Snape is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù teacher one of his students ‚Äúoverworks‚Äù themselves and Snape's like ‚Äúutterly foolish, ignoring your health‚Äù then he's like ‚Äúwait here you insufferable buffoon‚Äù and ‚ÄúI doubt you could keep any food down but here is a nutrient broth that has all your vitamins‚Äù.

Honestly people, Pomfrey maybe, but somehow I can't imagine Snape preparing mini-potions and measuring out the correct amount of B12, Iron, Sugar, Salt, etc.

Petition to change the trope to ‚Äúhave some soup, Potter.‚Äù

*** Severus attempts to stiffle a groan. Why was it everytime that foolish boy dies something he's forced to step in and do something about it? If it wasn't one thing with this boy it was another.

Recovering from an unbalanced dose of thousand year basilisk venom and phoenix tears? Sure he was the one to ask, not the professionals at St. Mungos, why bother them?

Dementor exposure affecting you? Call Severus the potions Master! Hes the one to fix it all!

And now he had to deal with the boy having consumed HIS gillyweed, though it was supposed to have been disposed of soon, from his private stores.

He sighed as he placed a bowl of potion in front of the boy.

"Have some soup, Potter." He drawled as he stalked away, leaving the "golden trio" looking at him in shock.

** I just mentally transpose Madam Pomfrey over Snape's name whenever I read a story like this. 9 times out of 10 it fits perfectly.

Also, the few times I've seen nutrition-boosting potions mentioned, it was always in the form of a potion that boosts nutrient intake from /regular/ meals, not as having nutrients /in the potion/.

Mind you, I tend to avoid the kind of fic where it appears. While there are a few Snape-fixes-Harry's-childhood-trauma fics worth the effort of reading, the nutrition potion is a plot-device that usually signals it won't be in that particular fic.

***** I could just see a prankster Harry turning that into the following exchange:

"Have some beetle juice, Potter."

Harry, confused, asked the potions master "Beetle juice?", feeling like this was a new low, even for the Wizarding World's sometimes unjustifiable weirdness - drinking beetle juice, of all things!

To which Severus replied "Beetle juice!", exasperated at Potter's tendency to ask questions he wouldn't like the answer of, and decidedly Mugle attitude towards certain things. Beetle juice was a perfectly normal nutrient-boosting potion, and Potter had brewed and ingested - thanks to the frankly alarming amount of trouble the boy got into on a daily basis - enough potions with insect-based ingredients by now that Snape could not see the problem.

"/Beetle/ juice?" asked Harry again, making a face - until Severus noticed the insincerity /of/ said face, and realized what foolishness he'd just unwittingly played a part in as the boy's mirth broke through the mask.

Soon enough, the torch-flames lighting the room began to flicker...

** I don't take it this way at all... Pomfrey is a nurse. Snape is a Potions /Master/. Pomfrey gives out Potions.... where do you think she gets them? In a lot of fan fictions Snape has the nutrient potions and etc because he brews them for Madam Pomfrey. The student gets the potion from Snape before it makes it to the Hospital Wing.

Of course this is medical potions. Not like super secret weight loss potions for Neville or something equally as ridiculous. Things that Madam Pomfrey needs for students I image Snape has and brews. At least in fan fictions. I'd reckon cannon too but I haven't a clue.

*** I would think pomfrey knows how to brew them as well, and probably does sometimes. Especially the simpler ones.

Let's be honest, everyone at Hogwarts is being taught how to brew these potions. It must be considered important for everyone to know, so why only have one person stocking the infirmary? Most likely, Snape makes some, pomfrey makes some, and the passable ones the students turn in are probably used too to some extent.

**** I can see the students definitely. I always just figured Madam Pomfrey didn't brew. There has been multiple fan fic's I read where med-witches and wizards worked with patients and that St Mungo's hired separately potion brewers. Kinda like doctors/nurses vs pharmacists. They /tell/ you what to take and give you a script but they don't make the medicine. Pomfrey can, sure, but I never considered it her job.

So the potions have to cool off and then you have to bottle them separately into vials etc. Snape has paperwork to grade, students to yell at, detentions to oversee, Dark Lords to deceive, and Harry Potter to rescue.

** I dislike the whole concept of "Nutriment potion" but :

- The magic in HP world is really . . . conceptual and doesn't follow the rules of physic or chemistry. A "nutriment potion" would not need to measure the correct amount of Vitamin, Iron or anything else. Like any other potions, Snape would have to follow a recipe (1 rat tail, 3 crushed bettle eyes, a diced Valian root . . .) and the resulting potion would make the patient healthy, no matter if he just missed a meal or didn't have any solid food for monthes.
- Snape is the Potion Master of the castle. There is a pretty good chance that any potion used by Mrs Pomfrey is either brewed by him or by one of his students during a class/ detention.
