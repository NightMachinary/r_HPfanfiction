  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** Linkffn(3766574) Prince of the Dark Kingdom has this as a plotline. It's not a very important one from what I remember, but I know this isn't what you asked for but there are loads of great duels.
