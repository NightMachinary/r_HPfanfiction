It ended abruptly on the ninth chapter... It's insanely gripping! I want to read the entire thing now.

** it is so good. I ve reread it a good 20 times. Over the span of the last 1-2 yrs.

I love all the characters... All of them..

It's abandoned for sure. But if cywscross sees this, please know that I will read a continuation even if it comes after 50 years and I have cataracts in my eyes and cannot hold a phone or type on a computer.

** It doesn't, to the best of my knowledge. I haven't seen anything more anywhere and, from Cywscross' tumblr, they seem to have moved on to new fandoms.

Someone else did write a work based on it, Dimension Hoppers (Link below), but it's really quite different and only really has the dimension-hopping thing in common.

**** Yeah. It's the way of things in this fandom. Too many fun or interesting stories never get finished.

******* Near-canon or extending on canon, or deviations that aren't very jarring. Don't really care about pairings as long as they're written well and the characters aren't flat. Also don't like those "harem" stories. I'm okay with limited (sensible) bashing of characters.

** Yeah that's one of my favourite fics of all time, I've read it back to back so many times in the past years.

The author does have a tumblr that I have seen updating occasionally (I'm on mobile so I can't link) about all things c'est la vie that has fanart and non-canon fics from them, and the author says that c'est la vie is still technically not dead, but /shrugs/. It's been a long time since the actual fic updated, so I don't have as much hope.

** Stayed up all night hooked to this fic...I mean it has all the fanfiction tropes you may have seen over the years but they just mesh together so beautifully. The sheer disappointed that this gem of a fic is incomplete cannot be expressed in words.
