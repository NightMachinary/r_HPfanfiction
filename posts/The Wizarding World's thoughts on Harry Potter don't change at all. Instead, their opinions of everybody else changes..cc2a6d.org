** Honestly, I was always a bit surprised things never went like this. Realistically, a lot more children would have been like Ginny - raised on the stories, and raised to view him as a saviour, or at least a beacon of hope and safety. After all, the world was apparently it a really awful state, and Harry marked the end of that.

Harry speaking Parseltongue should have been seen as yet another sign that Harry was a counter for another villain.

Granted, that makes for a boring story, unless the author is really good.

**** But the only thing society loves more than a hero is a villain. Plus, the Wizarding society as presented in the books is wholly dependant on the Ministry to run basically everything and keep magic secret. That leads to a faith in that government that is indistinguishable from naivete. The government tells them Harry is making it all up to disrupt their peace, it benefits them doubly to believe it; both because if they can't trust the government, all is at risk, and if Harry is lying, they're still safe and secure.

When I first read the prompt, my first thought was that a Harry who grew up in that situation would likely turn dark.

*** They're still assholes, just they trust in Harry over everyone else. Basically if it came out Harry was a an abusive piece of shit to his girlfriend/wife, it would be his girlfriend/wife's fault rather than his in the eyes of the people.

** I've seen at least one fic wherein the reason why everyone is so damn fickle is an unintended consequence of Lily's Protection glitching out with the pseudoHorcrux, plus the Dursley's hatred of her and Harry further twisting it (because Petunia is hardlinked into the spell by blood).

​

The only people immune to it were those who liked/loved Harry as himself, and the entire effect died when LP faded when he reached adulthood.

​

So take that and invert - the LP and the pH still have that interaction, but instead of Petunia unknowingly twisting it, Harry's own desire to not be verbally abused by the Dursleys twists it into making everyone else view him as a saint (the Dursleys, sadly, are exempted because they are 'inside' the spell-source).

​

The second-paragraph conditions still hold - Harry's close friends are still immune, and the entire effect dies on his 17th birthday (which would have really... interesting consequences if he had really abused the power).
