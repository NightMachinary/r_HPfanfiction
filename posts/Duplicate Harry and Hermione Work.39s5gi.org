I'm interested in reading something based on a fluke in the PoA book where we're left with two Harrys and two Hermiones.

I would prefer a more typical storyline, but smut is okay if it is well written.


** *Harrys:* So, who gets to be the Gryffindor Seeker?

*Hermiones:* At last, a reliable study partner!

**** I think they'd get along splendidly, though "Close Hogwarts Now" directive may be applicable in that case as well.

*** *Hermiones:* If two of me is better than one, then surely four would be even better. I wonder if we can replicate this trick...
