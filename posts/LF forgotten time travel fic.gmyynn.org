:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
there's not much I remember. I think it was Harry time traveling, but even that is disputable.

what I do remember is the way he time travels, because it's kinda unique. they have some kind of magic mirror, like mirror of Erised, but it (I think) should show your future? and they have it in their class. like, in a lesson, and everyone looks into it but when Harry(?) looks, he only sees himself and nothing else. disappointed, he forgets about it, he lives his life, I don't know how long, and at one point he... I don't know, maybe dies???... and then he is in front of that mirror from the class again. so like, the mirror instead of showing him the future, he actually lived it.

*** thanks. I think it might be the mirror of maybe, but I really don't remember much of it, so it might be the second one. will read both probably, I like snarry good enough.
