I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a few years ago on ff.net (I think) it's about Harry being a sub or omega of some sort. Draco is his mate, Dom or alpha. I don't remember it very well as you can see. Draco is very controlling and abusive. People find out and Harry eventually end up with Lucius. I believe Harry and Draco were still at Hogwarts. Does anybody have any idea witch story I mean and if it is still available to read?

I'm glad the story at least has a happy ending.
