** If you haven't read escribo's â€˜These Four Kings,' I highly recommend it. It's very comprehensive, covering all 7 years at Hogwarts. linkao3(510433) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/25962]]

Another fic I highly recommend is written from Lily's perspective, and covers her changing attitudes towards James in the last three weeks of the school year. the time has come (let us be brave) linkao3(1119983) by: misandrywitch

hope this helps!

  In which Lily places a bet, does some investigating, gets in a fight, fixes a broken nose and learns a few things about her friends, that idiot James Potter, and herself. Three very complicated weeks towards the end of the year, because that's the only time anything actually happens at Hogwarts right?

** Linkffn(Before The Fawn - First Draft by andelyn kinsey) is pretty good, starts from the split with Snape or there about and carries on show their last years at Hogwarts and them getting together, it's being rewritten but I really like the first draft as is a lot.

  Before Harry, before Godric's Hollow, before the Dark Lord was defied three times... Lily Evans and James Potter discovered that neither of them were what the other had expected, and embarked on a relationship that would change the world as they knew it.

** Linkffn(Against the Moon) is Remus-centric, but has James character development in it! In the most recent chapters, he's developed the trait of analyzing people and their motives.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.
