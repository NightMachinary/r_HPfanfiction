I'm totally new to the fanfiction world and all the phrases and terms everyone uses. Something I've seen a lot is “bashing”.

This is something people usually seem to dislike and are even dealbreakers to new readers of fics. I had no idea!

So in my fic, a Slytherin OC who wishes he was +in Harry's arms+ Harry's bestfriend, I thought it would have been interesting to have him not get along with Ron. So naturally, my OC dislikes Ron. Additionally, even though he doesn't hate Hermione, he doesn't like her particularly well either. And then there's Ginny, who he is very much jealous of. I thought it was natural for my OC to not get along with these characters in particular because of the plot and how it unfolds, as well as because it is canon that Gryffindors and Slytherins (at least during a year that a Potter is at Hogwarts) are terrible rivals. Since he also is a Slytherin, there's a dark nature to him. So he does things that can be considered slightly cruel to them.

To a person who hates Weasley, Hermione, or Gryffindor bashing, this might be at that fine line. Apparently those are the most rampant types of bashing there is but I swear I personally have nothing against these characters or the Gryffindor house! It's all meant to serve the story and is something I've written out organically.

I'm not yet finished with my fic, and I don't think learning of this terminology will have any change on how I continue with it. But I also don't want to alienate anyone who is interested. Personally I don't think I'm bashing, but I also think it'd be valuable to know how to identify that fine line and where people draw it. Any help there?

Edit: THANK you guys so much for the input. I feel like I actually understand how to make sure I do my best to not “bash” but also make my peace with people not liking certain choices I've made for my fic.

I had a few people ask for a link to my fic but I wanted to leave the flair as “discussion” and not change it to “self promotion”. I don't know how strict mods are on here but I don't want to take any chances haha!

However I did reply to those people with a link so just look around in the comments if you're interested!!


** If the only reason you can summarize his actions with are "it's because he's dumb/evil/a bitch-ass motherfucker" then it's bashing.

Example : Ronald Weasley befriended Harry to steal his money, because he's tired of being poor -> Bashing

Ronald Weasley stole money from his friend Harry because his family was way to poor to sustain itself, and way to proud to ask for money -> Negative depiction of Ron, but not yet bashing

Ronald Weasley took money from Harry, fully expecting to pay off his debts. He forgot after a while, mainly because life is a bitch -> Forgetfull friend Ron, not bashing.

*** People don't trust writers.

This is an issue for me personally, if I saw those two bottom scenarios, I wouldn't read the fic.

9/10 it will be bashing, not nuance. I don't have the patience to find that hidden gem.

It's a real issue with writing actual morally grey characters. From an initial glance (usually at the summary), it looks like bashing.

** If your characters feel like they have thoughts and motivations behind their actions; are not needlessly stupid or hateful and actually play a more substantial role in the plot than just conflicts that if taken out of the fic wouldn't change the plot, you're good.

** I think that some people will always miss the nuances of this, but if a character who is the one whose voice we're hearing is biased, then I generally put a disclaimer in the author's notes. There tends to always be people who still don't want to read a fic where their fave isn't talked up or whatever and that's their choice, but I get annoyed when people call that bashing.

It's like if I'm going to bash someone you'll know about it, lol

** Honestly, there is very little fine line, since everyone in the fandom has their own mental interpretation of who that character is. Some people see Ron as a good, honest, brave friend and others see him as a feckless neo-Death Eater. Thus, bashing looks different to everyone. At the end of the day, there's no universally pleasing thing in the fandom, and there's no real way to do 'bashing' in a way that pleases everyone.

Your best bet is like A2i9 says. Give them thoughts and motivations behind their actions and make that dislike of Ron/Hermione feel like something your character would reasonably feel and you'll probably get most people at least semi-okay with what you're doing. Other people will flame at the slightest hint of mistreatment for their beloved characters, but that's the nature of the fandom, I'm afraid. :)

** From what you told in your post, the main reason why your OC dislike the Weasleys is because he is envious of them, he wish he could have the same relationship they have with Harry (best friend or . . . damsel in distress?).

I personally would not consider this as bashing, mainly because you did not downgrade these characters to justify an opinion. Your characters are the same than in canon (or at least "can be"), and this is these characters that are disliked by your MC (for bad reason I might add, mainly envy), not some bad parody of themselves who lost all their qualities.

You should still be ready for some people to cry about bashing, some Hermione fans can be riddiculous when they feel that their queen is disrespected, and fan of Ron and Ginny can be just as bad (though maybe in a lesser measure). But as long as you stay far from Traitor! Hermione, StupidPig! Ron and Slut! Ginny, most people would not care.

I would also add that your character can think whatever he wants about other characters, as long as you made it clear that it is a subjective, personal opinion. It is not surprising from Draco to think that Ron is a poor idiot, unworthy of his blood (it is even expected of the character), but I would consider it bashing if the same observation was made by the narrator, or even an move "objective" character (such as Dumbledore).

** I think it's important to show that even though your character doesn't like Ron and Hermione, the story doesn't validate his feelings and believes. Having him scoff in his head at Ron's friendship with Harry is one thing, but discovering that Ron isn't loyal is another. Doing some dark stuff to them is one thing, getting away with it another.

In short, show that the OC isn't in the right and that Ron and Hermione aren't idiots, evil or easy targets.

** I would just go with the easy way. Is the main purpose of a character's existence within your story to look stupid, be made fun of and get beat down? If the answer to that is "no", you are good.

Maybe others are more sensitive when it comes to bashing, but I would say that what I mentioned above is what the vast majority would define as the "fine line" when it comes to bashing.

** Hello! I personally think people think of bashing in many different ways, but something I believe is true about some bashing, is they make them so evil and twist all of their actions.

Dumbledore: He's now stealing from Harry's vaults, and Ron is in on it!!!!!!

Sometimes they have the main character start hating that person/friend, but it can go so many different ways.

In a Hermione/Ron/Ginny bashing fic, all of the three were after his money.

Like I said, bashing comes in many forms and many ways, so good luck!

** In my eyes, Ronald is an insecure, obnoxious ass, throughout the series. In my fic, Harry disappears for almost two years, and I let readers assume Ron's gotten better, and he did.

Then Harry comes back, and he's very different, both physically and mentally. Some things are revealed that make Ron's failings return, which causes him and Hermione to break up.

I wouldn't say I changed Ron's personality that much, because he's definitely not evil, nor useless, and would never, ever betray his friends. I just took what's already there, and took it up a notch.

** Why would Harry even want to be friends with someone who hates his other friends?

I'm pretty sure that every time I've seen something like that in a fic, it quickly descends into bashing, because they need to justify the Slytherin's actions and give Harry a reason to choose them over his friends. And anything that makes Harry choose to ditch his friends is almost guaranteed to be bashing.

The alternative is for your OC to realize that Harry's friends aren't so bad and eventually get along with them. And that probably wouldn't involve bashing.

*** Sure! So it's 3rd person. My story is Canon-Compliant so basically everything is the same. My OC is dreadfully obsessed with Harry Potter, and is willing to do just about anything to be close to him. He's jealous, he's ambitious, and he's petty, but not outwardly so. He's muggleborn so he's an outcast in his own house, but he's still very much a Slytherin. He's been basically invisible to the main cast until 6th year. My goal is to make a character who you can't agree with, but somehow still root for. It was also a reason I made him not get along Harry's friends, characters who (I believed) everyone liked.

Here's an example of the relationship my OC has with Hermione:

" /Next entered Hermione Granger. It looks like she's the only Gryffindor who made it to N.E.W.T level potions, which wasn't really a surprise. It was actually a relief to find out Harry and Ron weren't going to be in this class. After what happened yesterday with Harry he didn't need the awkwardness of being in such a small class with him. He probably told Ron and Hermione some crazy Slytherin went off on him and Ron was the type to pick at that situation. If he told Hermione she would never say anything about it, she just wasn't that type. She began to walk in his direction./

/"Bias," she greeted him./

/"Hermione," he greeted back. They both rolled their eyes at each other as she sat down at the table in front of him. If Hermione had a rival anywhere, it was Jason in potions. They were constantly neck and neck when it came to the subject. Their interaction is always cold, yet sophisticated. "/

My OC's inner thoughts of Ron:

/"Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions," he complained, "a menace actually, so I probably should just be going---" Ron's annoying voice was irritating enough when he had to hear him always whining about something in the Great Hall and now Jason has to hear him here? Jason thought he was free of him this year, but that doesn't look to be the case. And on top of that Harry is there. He'll probably end up sitting at the same table with Hermione...across from Jason. So much for his lucky day.../

An example of the slightly cruel actions he takes:

/"---so you bleed all over a Slytherin and you just let him walk away without cleaning it off? Bloody hell Harry aren't you scared he'll put a curse on you or something?" Ron gawked./

/"Why because I bled on him?" Harry guessed./

/"No, he could use your blood to put a curse on you. I bet those Slytherins bathe in dark magic like that," Ron gushed. Jason couldn't help but feel extremely offended by that./

/"Percello," Jason whispered the jinx and aimed his wand at Ron from underneath the table desk. Jason's jinx slashed the foot of Ron's chair at just the right angle that Ron immediately got knocked down and falls on his back. Jason made sure to look super busy. He heard Dean laugh a little and immediately looked at Jason after. Hermione didn't pay any mind as she was trying to complete her potion./

and

/"I've actually had mine since last week. It had the original date on it before but it changed to next week. I asked Professor Slughorn and he said it was your fault. That you needed extra time on a project or something and he wanted everyone invited to be able attend his first dinner party of the year." She was basically throwing verbal daggers at Jason trying to cut down his pride a bit. Usually Jason cares very little what anyone thinks of him, but the rivalry he has with Hermione is intense. He almost wanted to tell her he was making Felix Felicis just to see the look on her face but he wasn't sure if he should. Instead he just smiled and slightly made her hair even frizzier than it is already. He wasn't worried Hermione would notice, she's probably had it look worse before./

/"Well see you around Hermione." Jason said with a smile as he walked away./

**** Warning darling, I'm a bitch. I call it as I see it and I'm not particularly nice about it. I try to sneak in compliments but well...

So excerpt number 1.

Perfectly fine but I'm confused. I'm assuming the OC is named Jason Bias. Hermione refers to him presumably by his last name and he calls her by her first.

Without her permission (as they are clearly not on a first name basis). The result is condescending and it appears like Jason thinks himself better than her. I feel like you're trying to make them equals in potions and her a superior every where else but it's not working. Also you're telling not showing here. You're calling their rivalry sophisticated but another excerpt shows them as petty children trying to one up each other.

Does Jason think it's sophisticated? Is that what's going here? A character being immature while believing otherwise? And that continues until he gets the cliche scolding?

Also if he's been invisible for 5 years, how does he know their personalities? Is he a stalker, determined and possessive? Ultimately a shitty person but we stan because he's the protagonist? Does he even know the one claims to love? What does he know about Harry? Is he after him or his image? A way to break through the wizarding world despite his blood? Or is he just soothing his nerves by pretending to know who they are?

Excerpt 2 doesn't explain why Jason dislikes Ron. Does he even dislike at all? Because if he does why is he Ron and not Weasley? This doesn't come across as condescending. It comes across like Jason likes Ron but is in denial. So he tries to come up with reasons to dislike him and ends up with vague and useless results. It's like a boy pulling on a girls pigtails in primary school.

Also not that my opinion on any of this matters but I figured I might as well go all in. The dialogue tag “gushed” doesn't really work well there.

Back on topic, why is he mad at Ron for saying this? Is it a slight on his house (which he is on odds with) or a slight on him?

Why do either bother him to the point of jinxes?

You mentioned he's of a dark nature because he's a slytherin. Which to that I ask, why? Why isn't he just dark cause he's him? Cunning and ambition don't mean dark. Also what is dark? Dark magic? Or dark as in not anything the trio would do?

At this point in time I'd like to offer Harry and Hermione as exhibit A and B.

Hermione kept a woman in a jar and brewed an illegal substance.

Harry tried to use an unforgivable.

I'm just saying, they don't get to judge. And that's before Book 6.

Also how is Ron's little tumble cruel? I'm not getting it at all. Hermione sent birds at Ron that same year. And Ginny is praised for her hexes. This doesn't seem cruel in comparison.

The last excerpt just reinforced the first. Condescending.

Verdict: Hermione bashing is likely, OC has a secret crush on Ron and is in denial.

I'm very tired but that's what I got.

***** Haha I very much enjoyed that. Thanks so much I actually think your feedback is very helpful!

My OC is also an exchange student. He's American, and Americans go by first names even if you aren't acquainted very well....at least that's how I grew up. I thought that was a quirk he would have.

The “sophisticated” word choice is more because I couldn't find another word for interactions that weren't always cold yet still unfriendly. They recognize each other's talents and only cut each other down a notch when they have no doubt they are justified in doing so. But I admit I don't like that word choice.

Jason knows the core three's personalities the way any classmate who has gone to school with them for 5 years would. Especially when those three are basically always in the middle of something that the whole school becomes aware of. He's just been a background character until this year lol. I imagine even a character who just sees them around Hogwarts constantly would have an idea of what they're like. Also the title of my Fic is “The Boy Who Obsessed” for a bit more insight haha.

Ron being the bane of Jason's existence is more of their personalities just not meshing. We all had that one kid in school we disliked and disliked us back for no real reason at all. I thought I'd add that part of high school into Hogwarts. I do love that you think it's because he's got a crush but is in denial though. That would have been fun to play with.

Also definitely agree with gushed. I started this fic in 2016 (I'm 22 now, you can do the math lol) so I was playing around with “instead of said”-isms. I'm actually probably gonna go back to some of the chapters and revise them now that I'm very much diving head first into it again.

As for the darkness---personally when I think of Slytherins, I think of them having a dark side. Dark doesn't always mean evil to me though! Just...an edge. The people who think the ends justify the means, the morally gray characters, etc. So no, not necessarily dark as in dark magic. But Jason does things the trio would never do.

When I say cruel, I mean it more in a way of how teens can be cruel to each other. But Jason does commit some atrocities later on. (I also wanted to have heightened expectations for how cruel so if someone who is sensitive to bashing reads my fic they'll think it's mild and I was exaggerating...until it's too late ! Mwahaha. I maintain I don't believe I'm bashing any characters though!)

Anyways, any questions I didn't answer is because they are answered by the fic. You might have touched on actual plot points and motivations with your questions that I didn't want to spoil. Don't wanna give away the whole fruit basket here...just the nectarines 😁.

Overall I repeat this was amazing! I had a lot of fun reading this. Thanks for being so thorough!
