(First, yes this is a repost. I deleted the previous post for various reasons, the main one being an abundance of formatting issues I missed due to being tired that made it easier to just start over.)

I don't know if this counts as Misc or Discussion but with the many types of magic systems we see out there, I thought it could be fun to try and create an actual in-universe style report to try and give a simplified theory for magic, something anyone can use should they so wish.

I'd be really interested in hearing what people think of the magic of Harry Potter being interpreted this way, any ideas on it, just general discussion. Due to it being a google doc though, that is why I am uncertain whether this is Misc or Discussion so I am labelling it as the former to be safe.

So here it is: [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eccGHavA466nO23VdHqb6NqHWKDpPdwX/view?usp=sharing][The Magical Theory Report, 1981 - By Julia Riverheart]]


** “Magic is energy” doesn't really explain how magic fundamentally works, as the document claims later on.

I'm also unsure why you're carving out a difference between charms and enchantments.
