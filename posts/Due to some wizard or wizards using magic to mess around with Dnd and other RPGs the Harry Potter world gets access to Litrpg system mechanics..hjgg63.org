I don't really care how it happens. I would be more interested in the Wizarding worlds reaction to the whole muggle world having access to something that is so obviously magicaly in origin.

Edit:For the Muggle perspective I think there would be no one better than Vernon Dursley, Can you Imagen his Reaction to wakeing up to a Litrpg Pop up. and Seeing its effect on the world.


** When you said RPG I thought you meant Rocket Propelled Grenades.
