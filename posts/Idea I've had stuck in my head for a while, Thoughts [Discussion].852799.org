So I rewatched Unusual Suspect's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pR2Od55S7g][Harry Potter in the Style of Power Rangers Mystic Force]] and I thought a really good story would be a crossover of the two but in the Harry Potter Universe. Just Transplant the powers, zords and minions and make Voldemort the Big Bad. I imagine Dumbledore would make friends with someone who can give the morphers and have the Ministry Five become the Rangers. Harry as Red, Hermione as Pink, Ron as Green, Luna as Blue and Neville as Yellow. I'd write it myself if I had any writing skill but I thought I'd leave it here for people to think about. Just remembered their is a similar fic on ffn that creates a new team with these characters, but i cant remember if I finished it.


** I'd say, go for it! Although, I would personally write an original villain, with Voldemort as the 'Dragon'.

** What about Ginny? She was at the Ministry too, remember? She should be the Black Ranger.

Actually, I think personally I'd swap it so that Hermione was Black and Ginny was Pink, because pink seems to be more of a Ginny colour than a Hermione one, but that's me.
