Think J. K. Rowling crossed with E. A. Poe. The character can be whoever you want (as long as they're near the same age as Luna): Harry, Ron, Ginny, Neville, etc. Of course, Luna isn't insane (she's just as sane as we are), but I /am/ intrigued by the idea of someone going insane after falling in love with her. Is their mind truly as prepared for her as they thought it was?


** The closest I can think of is Bakuraptor's fic. But Harry goes insane slowly before meeting Luna, and marries her later. Linkffn(12361240)

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...
