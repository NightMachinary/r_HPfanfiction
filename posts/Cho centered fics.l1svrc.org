** I also actually think she would have been a good character and even gf for Harry if not for the crying/PTSD...but that was the point I guess. Why on earth would she ask Harry about Cedric's last words before dying on a Valentine's day date. Other than that she seems nice enough and they have Quidditch in common.

*** I have always dreamt about the story, where somebody adult (Lupin?) would explaining Harry that if he waits and sticks with Cho while she is grieving (and there is no rulebook how to grieve, everybody does it in their own style and time frame), he can get very solid foundation for the relationship in future.

Otherwise, “The Stag and the Swan by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14031036) is one lovely rewrite of their date in Hogsmeade (unfortunately, it is just a one-shot without much any longer story to it), and linkao3(26066122) is just a small complaint against (yet another) stupidity in films.

Also, “Harry Potter and the Gang of Giggling Girls by Glee-chan” linkffn(11268925), which despite its unfortunate name is neither stupid nor porn (as would fem!Harry suggest).

**** I guess but it's hard for Harry to be the emotional outlet for cho bc he feels responsible for Cedric.

** I don't know any but I agree so many of the girls could have been fleshed out more and a lot of fics still use Hermione as the main girl or use OCs where there are plenty of other female characters to work with.
