I don't remember exactly what happened in the fic, only one particular scene net the end where Dumbledore talks to Charlie Weasley and his daughter for a bit then goes back inside Hogwarts because it's going into magical stasis or something? And then Dumbledore dies at his desk.

Oh well at least it came in handy for someone.
