We see what happens when Harry continues to be insistent about Voldemort's return, which is pointless because the ministry obviously denies it, and won't change its mind based on his word.

But what about appealing to something they do support, namely the guilt of Sirius Black? Even if Umbridge knows he's innocent, or at least not as deranged and evil as her position says, she can't just go 'oh no, he's not a threat', because that would go against her mission at Hogwarts.

TL:DR, Umbridge knows it's bullshit, Harry knows its bullshit, yet it forces hands.


** Did she know it was bullshit? I never understood her character, she seemed to be an evil bitch just, because.

**** I don't see her fighting on Harry's side no matter how much he was winning. She'll try some asinine plan that has a high chance of backfiring to "fix" things to her ideal. Like the end of year 5.

Umbridge's career only survived because Scrimgeour wanted to show that things were "normal" to the populace". He was only /somewhat/ better than Fudge as minister. If anyone with a functioning brain became Minister, Umbridge would have been thrown in Azkaban faster than she could say "I'M THE UNDERSECRETARY FOR THE MINISTER OF MAGIC!!!one111"

**** I think she was death eater sympathizer and knew exactly what was going on. I do not think she was innocent or misled at all. Her actions after Voldemort took over were pretty sadistic. The only reason I think she wasn't a full blown death eater is due to the horcrux. She wore it openly, proudly proclaiming it to be a family heirloom. Had she been in Voldemort's presence - he would have recognized it instantly.

***** I agree with most of this, but I also still think that her motives were more self-serving rather than sympathizing. She went wherever she thought she would get the most benefit for her, personally... which, tbh, I think makes her even worse than the already rotten death eaters.

*** Here's my interpretation of the whole thing:

She was directly under Fudge. At the least, Fudge knew Sirius had a /chance/ of being innocent. At the worst, Fudge knew he was innocent. And Fudge tells Umbridge everything. She is one of his thinkers.

** I mean... all I really got to say to that is "Yeah, totes". It'd never happen, because Harry is a stubborn and overly righteous bastard that borders on Lawful Stupid most days, but if he did take the Sirius Black route it'd be inarguable.

Though really, the main argument is just 'okay, so we're supposed to wait for the Aurors right? Well, how do you think we get Aurors? If we don't train ourselves and just wait for the Aurors, then pretty soon we'll have no Aurors because none of us will be able to defend ourselves against the dark arts.'

"Harry, it's your destiny." Dumbledore's usually cheerful bearing was nowhere to be seen, replaced instead by a grave demeanor.

"What do mean, Professor? What destiny?" Harry did his best to not allow his confusion to turn to fear - the last time Dumbledore used that voice had been in second year while dealing with the basilisk disaster.

"A prophecy was made by Sybil Trelawney a few months before your birth. /The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord of Chaotic Evil approaches... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...the unpredictability of the complete absence of common sense... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... The Hero of Chaotic Idiocy will be born as the seventh month dies, and he will be legendary for his Super Chaotic Stupid .../ Harry, I'm afraid your bad OWL results were predicted more than a decade ago."

***** That'd be interesting. A rephrased prophecy where it's all just "Born as the seventh month dies, the Chosen one will just fuck shit up." type sentiments the whole way through. :D

The only reason Dumbledore never told any of the teachers about this prophecy would be Minerva's inevitable breakdown at the thought of a prophesied child who was even more bother than James, Sirius, Peter, and Remus were. :D

"He will be chaotic, and the Tabby will drink of the Glen of Morangie." :D

**** Heh. Touche. :)

Do we know how that training actually works? Like, are they paired with senior aurors and trained like Doctors? One senior auror wandering around with a little flock of apprentices trailing behind and learning from them specifically? Or is it a smaller school like Hogwarts? I don't remember anything myself.

** Well, Harry isn't a politician during a debate, he's an angry teenager.

And in any case, it wouldn't change anything. Umbridge would punish him for saying being, as far as the general public is concerned, right.

** There is a pretty effective rhetorical strategy where you adopt the opponent's assumptions and attempt to prove them wrong within their own paradigm.

For example, instead of insisting that Voldemort has returned and that's why they need to learn to defend themselves, Harry could have avoided mentioning Voldemort completely and just asked Umbridge why the Ministry has Aurors if there aren't any dark wizards out there.

But Harry isn't the best at arguing. He's too principled to be able to see things from anyone's point of view but his own. That means he would never use the above strategy - it's not in his nature to be able to step outside of his own assumptions/values. If he was capable of that kind of "decoupling", he would have been better at occlumency.

** I mean, yeah, but Harry wouldn't do that because, like someone said before me, he's loyal stupid. He wouldn't throw Sirius in front of the bus. I would in his place, or talk about the mass Azkaban breakout if I had that argument after it, but Harry isn't what you would call smart, clever or witty.

** To be honest, Harry is not exactly clever, nor all that smart. He has no verbal skills to speak of, much less ability to argue with a seasoned politician who has decades of experience.

Harry is too honest, too straightforward, too angry and above all - simply a teenager who doesn't quite yet know how to handle the world or situations he finds himself in.

All Umbridge has to say is "I assure you, Aurors, carefully trained under the watchful & nurturing eyes of the Ministry, will keep us safe. It is only matter of time before this minor inconvenience is dealt with by the proper authorities."

** Well it could be even more. Fudge insisted back in PoA that Harry was confounded by Sirius. So lets go with that and say that the whole resurection business in GoF was a ritual by Sirius and his followers and Voldemort was just a trick. Show Sirius as wannabe new Dark Lord and make sure he goes along with that to just force Ministry's hand.
