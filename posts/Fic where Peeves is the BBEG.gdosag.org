I remember reading this at some point, but that's all I can clearly remember about it


** Oh, I remember this one. I don't remember the name, and I'll have to see if I can come up with it. What I remember is that Harry gets transported into an alternate universe, and when he looks for other wizards, there aren't any. Hogwarts is a ruin, but it's sealed tightly. Wizards made their last stand there, and Peeves sort-of-merged with the basilisk.

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

***** Not really. The Peeves thing is a side-excursion, so to speak. Harry's in the Marvel universe, and there are no other wizards, but Hogwarts is still there and sealed, so he investigates.
