Im looking for a fic that is a little silly. Harry reforms the Marauder's with the twins, Launa, Hermione, and Neville. I remember that they are all aniamagus. Harry is a dragon, Harmione was a Cheshire cat, Launa was some crazy rabbit and Neville was an Ent. Thay had marauder names but the only one i remember was Neville was called Groot. Thanks a head of time.

  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus. Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Severe Ron bashing ahead.
