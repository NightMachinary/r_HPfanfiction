I love it and want something similar to that.

Also since i already made a post i'd also like to ask about a specific pic. It was also a slytherin Harry who was dating Daphne and was friends with Blaise, Theo and Draco. I remember Theo being a potions prodigy and the gang had a little underground betting thing set up for quidditch and the triwizard. The story was set in 6th year i think.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.
