#+TITLE: LF Either a dimension travel story like "Too Far from Home" without being so depressing/angst filled, or a TT Marauder's Era (No Snape) and hopefully being a complete story, but i can manage with ongoing.

Thank you for any suggestions.


** I am not sure what you are looking for, but will assume a dimension travel and alive lily or James and a competent Harry.

*I'm Still Here* linkffn(9704180) is a good though incomplete story, the first chapter is set in a dystopian world, but it neither gets depressing nor angsty and quickly moves to dimension travel.

*The Black Comedy* linkffn(3401052) is a completed and most recommended fic.

*Many Thanks* linkffn(4692717) Hermione time travels to marauder era, although does not strictly meet the requirements, still a good read.

*The Dream Trilogy Book 1: To Dwell On Dreams* linkffn(1563941) is part 1 of the series where Harry temporarily occupies the other Harry's body and returns back.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** Read both of the first, didn't like "Many thanks" that much, but i loved "I'm still here" and now i'm waiting for its next chapter. The third is actually on my list of "to read" so with your suggestion, i'll bump it up on the queue. But yes, its similar to those, where he goes back and such, or a different world, kinda like "To call a place Home" or "Give your best shot". Thank you though.
