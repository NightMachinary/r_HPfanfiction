Okay hear me out. I'm looking for fics where Harry is in a relationship with someone like McGonagall or Amelia bones. I can be one where he goes back in time or current time. As long as it has that kind of pairing. I've already read retrograde as well. Thanks for any suggestions.


** Theres a few where Harry is with Andromeda Tonks that I've enjoyed;

Linkffn(Found in the Ashes) Harry at 29 gets transported back in time to 1993 with his current family

Linkffn(Broken Reflections) Harry timetravels to the 70's

Theres also linkffn(Laughing All the Way to London) timetravel, ends up with Narcissa.

There is a lot of Harry/Bellatrix fics like linkffn(Delenda Est) and linkffn(Wind Shear) but Harry is older in this one

The only Harry/Amelia fic I've come across but have not read is linkffn(Retrograde) I'm not sure if its any good but the reviews seem to indicate that its decent.

*** I've tried retrograde. It had so much potential. But the author had a character slip up a secret in front of a certain character. Then they went about it as if it was nothing. There was no tension with that. He just rushed everything.

  What happens when Harry Potter at age 29 is transported back in time with his family by a meddling phoenix? Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them. Begins in Prisoner of Azkaban, the start of book 3.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** linkffn(For Love Of Magic)

Harry gets absurdly powerful and has sex with lots of women including, but not limited to Tonks, Narcissa (after brutally executing Lucius in front of all of Hogwarts), Zabini, Fleur, Septima (the Arithmancy professor) and Luna.

Voldemort takes a few more years to come back due to Pettigrew being short a head and has basically no chance.

In the end Harry becomes a Dark Lord because why not, kills billions, and somehow ends up in a GoT crossover sequel.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** I like Harry Potter and the Blood of the Pheonix.

He's with someone VERY much older than him.

Super well written and great action scenes, and I really liked the way the students were portrayed - especially Ron and Daphne. One of my favourites.
