You read the title, i'm looking for a morally flexible Harry. I would like the fic to be mainly sbout warring with voldemort, or him preparing for it (although this kind of goes without saying) I don't really care if he is OP or not, i just want a Harry with a strong, and determined character. Basically, a badass.

Thanks a bunch!


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood]]). I really enjoyed this one as I feel like Harry actually trains to gain his power. It's a complete fic which is nice

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** - Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): Harry receives unexpected assistance that compels him to get his act together
- Taking Control linkffn(Taking Control): /the/ indy!Harry fic, but he definitely works for it when it comes to improvement and fixing his failures
- Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): I have some problems with this fic, especially in the first five chapters, but by about 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through Harry is determined to fight in the war and bring it to an end. This is to such a degree that at one point he gets in a standoff with Dumbledore about not trying to reform or spare Voldemort like he did with Grindelwald.
- The Hero Trilogy linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): Harry refuses to sit by and watch people die while he flounders about. Possibly one of the most OP Harry stories by the end, but ironically also the most OP Voldemort as well.
- The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): possibly the closest to a "greater good" Harry I have encountered, he time-traveled back to 1995 to speedrun Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the most brutal manners possible. Dragons, dementors, undead worms, aurors; nothing stops him.

*** Thanks for the recommendations! I've read the unforgiving minute, taking control, and magicks of the arcane. I loved them all (not so much taking control because of the cliches, but it's still good).

I'll look at unlocked knowledge and i'm currently reading the Sword of the Hero.

I'm a little bit into Sword of the Hero and i'm not really hooked. When Harry was fighting the death eaters on brooms it was good, but then afterwards you get slammed with this DepressedHarry! PoorMeHarry! It'sAllMyFaultHarry! I just want to punch him more than anything.

I'm familiar with Joe's Wastelands of Time and i know he's a truly epic writer, so is it worth pushing through this part and reading the trilogy? Does it have action, mystery and awesome magic like WOT?

Thanks a bunch!

**** In a word, yes. Sword of the Hero ramps up as it goes, but it maintains a dark tone during the whole affair. Which is /utterly/ brutal here (I won't spoil it, but its enough to scar my memories). It gets even better in the next book, as the series takes a major shift. Defiance is probably the peak of the series, but Soul is easily one of the most meta!Harry fics I can remember.

Honestly, you will probably have more trouble with the 3rd book than the 1st.
