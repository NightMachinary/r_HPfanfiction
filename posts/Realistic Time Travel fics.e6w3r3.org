I've recently been looking for some time travel fics. I love them and they're very enjoyable, but you get tired of reading the same old trope. Harry goes back in time, is seemingly powerful and saves the world.

Isn't there a fic out there that

1) Time Travel is complicated as it is in canon 2) No unnecessary pairing or romance 3) By time travelling Harry creates more problems instead of fixing them.


** You should read the Second String by Eider_Down It does have some of what you want. Though there is a romance it doesn't start until chapter 20. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][Second String]]

** I found linkffn(the many deaths of harry potter) to be a unique time travel fic, where in his life isn't easy because he travels back in time
