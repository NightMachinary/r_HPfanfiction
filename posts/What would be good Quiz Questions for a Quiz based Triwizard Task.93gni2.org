A Quiz task would make sense, especially at Hogwarts, as it could be a "Ravenclaw" Task, but what questions would fit so that Harry still stands a chance (with Hermione teaching him for weeks or something) but still complicated enough for the NEWT students like Fleur, Krum and Diggory


** I feel like a test or quiz goes against the spirit of the Twiwizard tournament. That's just so mundane, it is the sort of thing you'd expect to do in a class, not a dangerous tournament.

*** You could do it Mario Party Style. Each question you answer correctly raises the Platform, so then you get at your wand/a key/something to lead onto the second part of the task.

***** It is an international tournament, with 2 schools that are not Hogwarts. I could see this if the tournament consisted only of Hogwarts students (A nice change perhaps), but having all of your tasks be named/themed after the houses of one specific school seems a bit off.

****** Not all Hogwarts themed, but one of them Hogwarts themed. For instance, have the first task be Durmstrang themed, the second be Beuxbaton themed, and third and final task be Hogwarts themes. The Hogwarts task would contain four sections, each of which would refrence one of the four houses.

I hope this clarified what I meant.

***** Have a Team Section - Loyalty - Hufflepuff. A Bravery bit - Face Boggarts or whatever, get past something, several options, A Cunning bit - Solving difficult Scenarios/Puzzles, and an Intelligence bit - Quiz?
