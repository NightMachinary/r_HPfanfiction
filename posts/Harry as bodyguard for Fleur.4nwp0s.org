I read a fanfic where the author starts off with a A/N where the author mentions that he/she have read many fanfics where Harry meets Fleur before his 4th year (read many of those) and where Harry is Fleur's bodyguard (Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Fanfiction!]] only one I could find). So I was wondering if there are other (Harry x Fleur) bodyguard stories that you guys have read?


** See, I saw this, and a thought popped into my head. Why would Harry be a bodyguard for Fleur? What on earth does she have to fear? She's older, generally seen as more competent by the public (if not actually shown to be in the books), and she's not an international celebrity... so wouldn't it make much more sense for Fleur to end up as /Harry's/ bodyguard, since he has at least one threat to his life every year? Harry is one character who, canonically, could really do with having a bodyguard, dammit.

Then I remembered that gender roles were a thing. Shame. I would totally read about badass bodyguard Fleur.

*** I would read that too. I mean, how desperate do you have to be to hire a bodyguard that he himself has a price on his head? People would try to kill him and you'd end up as collateral. Which is what you deserve for hiring Harry as a bodyguard.

**** Yeah... I'm thinking the main reason this exists is to fulfil the 'hot older girl' fantasy (why 90% of Fleur/Harry exists), and ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors, so screw making sense. It kinda bugs me. A penis does not make you an effective bodyguard, especially when you're a scrawny little 14 year old shit with little in the way of believable combat experience. Generally speaking, young!uber!Harry is the most irritating and immersion-breaking kind of uber!Harry.

That's not to say I dislike Fleur/Harry, because it actually fits quite well personality wise, but contrived bodyguard romance would work much better if Fleur was the guard.

***** Oh no, badass older Fleur who already made a name for herself as a mercenary could meet badass Hermione while on the job. You could name it The beauty and the bookworm or something similarly cheesy if that's already taken.

I imagine Fleur as the veela version of Draco Malfoy, only slightly more tolerant.

So Fleur seems to be all brawns act first, ask questions later which drives Hermione crazy. Sparks fly. Ron is in the background like "But! But!..." and Harry is worried his bff and his bodyguard will accidentally end up killing eachother and him before Voldemort gets to him.

I don't know how they end up together, but I can see some of that hate sex happening. Fleur is an equal opportunity sex fiend and Hermione never got to figure out her sexuality, but hey're both like this was a mistake and I regret it and it will never happen again.

The fight against Voldemort degenerates into civil war. It gets pretty grimdark at this point. They are forced to fight side by side, to rely on eachother while Harry is kept safe at home. More hate sex happens, just to relieve tension, you understand, only this time there's less hate and more kisses stolen in the night while waiting for an ambush. Meanwhile Harry is moping at home and Ron still doesn't understand what's going on. He's dealing with the logistics of OotP tho, and the strategics side of things, because he proved to be better at that than Hermione, to her chagrin. Maybe she just can't really see the big picture as he can, or can't think as clearly under pressure when people's lives are at stake. So that's why she's on the field while Ron is in the background.

So she's also dealing with a bit of an identity crisis, since the molds she thought she fit in are all shattered. She's not used to being average, and here she is, with Ron of all people upstaging her at the thing she thought she was best at and then Fleur is proving again and again to be better than her at practical stuff, and although that is only because Fleur has years of experience in the field and with guerrilla wars, Hermione's still not happy. She discovers her kinky side at this point. Harry suspects what's going on because he's perceptive like that, but he's all cool with it, which makes Hermione happy. That's why they're bffs.

Anyway.

** I like Fleur stories. And seeing a badass Fleur would new and pretty cool.

But your sexism/bigotry is showing when you say Harry is the bodyguard simply because he has a penis. Or to fulfill older woman fantasies, although I don't doubt this last is a major component.

Harry is usually the bodyguard because he was the main character in the books. And because he should have been the most awesome wizard since Ahmenotep, instead of the namby-pamby teenager who literally let Hermione do everything!

Harry was born with the "power the dark Lord knows not". I don't care if she has internal or external "plumbing", Fleur couldn't get past the grindylows in the second task!!

You can argue that Barty/Moody was helping him during the tasks, and I don't recall exactly how much he did help (play to your strengths, gillyweed, sabotaging the third task, but not details), but Harry did out fly a Dragon during the tasks and sent over 100 Dementors packing in third year. Both without outside help. Which is far more than we saw Fleur do.

**** In what way? I said "he should have been" amazing. The prophecy does say "he will have power the Dark Lord knows not", right? Unless his "power" was Hermione saving his butt, we only got glimpses of power: his wand reaction , performing the Patronus, and sending dementors scurrying.

During OotP Hermione said "You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't." So according to Hermione he has power, but beyond those two examples, we don't ever get to see it that I recall.

I don't deny that I've read and really like the Indy!Harry or powerful!Harry genre. But I do argue that it is canon and should have been more obvious.

He doesn't have to be Superman, but asking for Spider-man shouldn't be too much. We got [[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Phillip_Coulson_(Earth-199999][Phil Coulson]]), a hero, but someone without power.

***** I think you've really missed the point. JK named the protagonist Harry Potter for a reason, which is that it's the most common, basic, average name she could find. This fact is a great representation of the character. This series isn't about a great hero who uses his strength and intelligence to defeat evil. Its about an average kid who stands up for what is right and triumphs.

'It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.'

Harry is the best in class at Defense Against the Dark Arts, he's good on a broom, but in everything else he's around average. His strengths help him in the story, but never in any sort of logical fashion could a teenager beat a 70 year old genius prodigy like Voldemort.

I like a good powerful!Harry fic. But they are by nature anti-canon. Which isn't a problem until people start confusing one for the other.

****** From Rowling herself:

#+begin_quote
  'Harry' has always been my favourite boy's name, so if my daughter had been a son, he would have been Harry Rowling. Then I would have had to choose a different name for "Harry" in the books, because it would have been too cruel to name him after my own son. "Potter" was the surname of a family who used to live near me when I was seven years old and I always liked the name, so I borrowed it.
#+end_quote

The series is about a boy who grew up living in a cupboard under the stairs, had frying pans aimed at his head, was called freak his entire life by his family, and was fed through a cat flap. Dumbledore's choice, was to essentially recreate the circumstances of Tom Riddle's youth in Harry Potter to see if he would come out the same and to, hopefully, thereby absolve Dumbledore of the guild he carried for not protecting Riddle from the orphanage. But I digress.

My point, was that according to the books, Harry was to have some kind of power that could defeat the dark lord. That is *canon*. "Born with a power the dark lord knows not" Naturally, I would think, my mind went to the hero, Harry Potter, having an ability, that would foil the dark lord. Even if it is just the power of being immune to killing curses, would have been something. He could be absolutely terrible at everything but gobstones and so long as he used that power to defeat Voldie, I would have been content. Instead we're given glimpses that Harry is special:

#+begin_quote
  During OotP Hermione said "You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't."
#+end_quote

but never actually see anything.

Again, he doesn't have to be Superman. Uber!Harry is kind of boring. But if you say Character A has a special power to defeat the big bad, then Character A better have and use that special power.

I take your argument "never in any sort of logical fashion could a teenager beat a 70 year old genius prodigy like Voldemort." and I completely, 100% agree. But we're dealing with fiction and in the universe of Harry Potter, we're dealing with highly illogical wizards. Wizards who think a 14 year old can go against dragons, and a 17 year old, who they've spent the past few years alternately loving and hating, is their only hope against the dark lord. A 70 year old genius prodigy who spends 7 books and 16 years trying to kill a child isn't very logical either. "If the hero has already proven immune to the killing curse, I won't bother using it again on them. I'll just slit their throat," should be on the Evil Overlord List for magic users.

Just a note: if Harry's power was gobstones I would have been seriously pissed. I only said I'd be happy in the spirit of the point I was making.

First the prophecy:

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.
#+end_quote

"the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies." Actually, yes he was born with it. He has the power before he's born, therefore he was born with the power.

Dumbledore thinks it's the power of love. And this is repeated. But we don't actually see any evidence of this.

Harry's mom's love: he can't be touched by Voldie. We don't know why, but it is presumed to be his mother's protection. Born out slightly by Voldie touching Harry after the resurrection. But then why are the blood wards still working? The blood wards are linked to the blood of Harry's mother and aunt, therefore they should have stopped working, at least against Voldie, after the graveyard.

Harry's love: I can't say we ever saw any evidence of this. The second killing curse doesn't kill Harry? Harry was the wand's master, and the wand won't attack it's master. Plus there was that second soul it could destroy instead. Voldie can't silence the crowd? Again, Voldie wasn't the wand's master. Harry points this out.

********* Okay I'm not going to reply after this last post but your comprehension of the words of the prophecy isn't quite there. The 'born' part refers ONLY to the thrice defying parents and end of July. It does not say BORN marked as Voldemorts equal and born with the power - the power (and the marking) comes after.

Mum's love: it's not just that Lily loves her son. It's her sacrifice (because she loves him) that protects him. It prevented Voldemort from harming Harry, until he stole Harry's blood. However, the 'should have stopped working' point is moot, because as per canon it /didn't/ stop working entirely. The protection remained while Harry was near Petunia and home; that is, near Lily's blood. Also, IIRC, Voldemort technically didn't try killing Harry again until he'd left Privet Drive for good (he tried to get Dumbledore to kill possessed Harry in OotP), which suggests that Voldemort did realise that the blood protection could linger beyond when he stole Harry's blood.

Secondly, Harry's love is /also/ very clearly stated in HBP. 'so it just means...love?' Harry asks Dumbledore and Dumbledore explains that yes, the sacrifice borne of Lily's love provided him protection as a child, and Harry's love for his parents and Sirius (and his friends) is what compels his hero complex and desire to defeat Voldemort. It's a very poignant chapter actually, as Harry realises that he has a choice (as Voldemort did) between following the prophecy, or turning his back and refusing to fight, and Harry decides he wants to fight because it's the right thing and to save the people he loves.

Further on Harry's love: Harry does the same chosen sacrifice as his mum did, to save the people he loved (Ginny, Ron, Hermione, others) and to avenge the deaths of his loved ones. Voldemort being unable to silence or attack the crowd had zero to do with the wand and everything to do with Harry's sacrifice (it is explicitly stated in Harry's monologue at the end). The only wand relevant thing is that the wand won't work against its /real/ master - Harry. Voldemort was still able to attack and/or kill others (Snape, for example). He even says 'i have done my usual magic with this wand;' that is, the wand hasn't hindered him until he tries to attack Harry. Harry's sacrifice protected the crowd.

The second killing curse (the one in the forest) did work, because Harry died and went to purgatory. It worked because Harry was WILLING to die, so the wand wasn't acting against its owner. Harry was only able to come back to life because of his mother's sacrifice (again, the love protection) being 'alive' in voldemorts blood (ie, since he had Harry's blood). Harry had the choice to 'go on' which means that his soul /had/ been hit by the Killing curse that time. So again, the wand is irrelevant until Voldemort tries to hit harry with the final Killing curse (against its owner and against the owners wishes), when it backfires. The crowd's protected only by Harry's sacrifice.

So to reiterate: Harry lives (and comes back to life) because of his mother's loving sacrifice. Everyone else (who survived until Harry walked into the forest) lives/cannot be killed by Voldemort because of Harry's loving sacrifice. Supported with clear evidence from the books, most of it /very/ explicitly stated (if I had access to the books rn I'd even quote the entire relevant paragraphs). That is the power that led to Harry's survival and thus, to Voldemorts ultimate demise.

All my points are explicitly stated in the book, enough so that they're clear for the children reading. They require zero guesswork, and are essentially 'Harry Potter canon fact.'

You're majority speculating your opinion, whereas I'm literally just saying what's stated in the books. The books literally say the power is love. It's not 'Dumbledore guessing', because it's a literary work and the author intended it to be love, as was very clearly indicated . I'm analysing it solely as literature; you're trying to analyse it as something that exists beyond what the author meant. There is no extra power that we don't see, because if that power existed, it would have been written (at least implicitly) into the text.

Now, it's fine for fanon and fanfiction to want to promote and create this 'power beyond love's but speaking from a canonical standpoint, the power is love and it was a power Harry learnt and was blessed with, albeit not born with.

Thanks for reading. Once again, I won't be replying further because we've gone WAAAY off the initial topic, and I'm not sure if you're arguing based primarily on fanon or not.

I've only ever given examples from canon. Therefore, I'm arguing from canon.

#+begin_quote
  However, the 'should have stopped working' point is moot, because as per canon it didn't stop working entirely.
#+end_quote

This was my point. Because it didn't stop working, it could not have been Lily's protection that was protecting him there. You can't say that "because what you're saying happened in canon it is not canon." That Lily's protection was gone from Harry after the Graveyard, but not gone from Harry because the house was still protected.

Please reread the prophecy that I quoted above. It specifically states that "the one (Harry or Neville) with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies." "WILL BE born...," they haven't been born yet. They have the power in the womb and then are born. Voldemort merely identified which child it would be (Harry or Neville). He didn't give Harry the power. Especially not, if, as you're saying, Harry's power is love.

You're right, this is way off topic now. But people tell me I'm wrong using only their opinions and not backing up anything they say with any examples and darn it: [[http://xkcd.com/386/][Duty Calls]]. You at least have used examples. I'll leave you with this:

While Harry's mom dying for him was the catalyst, it was the charm that Dumbledore cast and Petunia taking him in that activated the power. Dumbledore explains this in OotP. Also part of the protection that Harry is talking about requires someone of their blood taking them in and it disappears when they turn 17. Everyone at the Battle of Hogwarts is not under 17, not with all the villagers from Hogsmead being there. Harry was wrong about what was protecting everyone in Deathly Hallows.

Excellent discussion! Would 100% debate with you again.

If you remember, Glinda took the shoes from the dead Wicked Witch of the East and gave them to Dorothy (right in front of the Wicked Witch of the West!!), then told her to head to the Wizard. At the end of the movie, Glinda tells Dorothy she had the power to go home to whole time, thanks to the slippers.

***** I think you're grasping at straws to make Harry seem more awesome than he is. We have very little reason to believe his reaction to his wand in PS was anything out of the ordinary, beyond Olivander's vaguely creepy melodrama over wand cores. It was flashy and cool, but, here's the thing... what if every witch/wizard had a similar reaction when they found a compatible wand? Crazy, I know.

Likewise, the patronus. It's a cool piece of magic that is meant to be quite hard to do. Naturally, by book five, everyone under the sun is capable of using it, but people fawn over Harry for being able to do it early. That's cool I guess, it just backs up my point about the cool factor being him able to cast it at a young age, rather than it being 'zomg the most powerful patronus ever'. It symbolises a single moment of happiness triumphing over any amount of depression/evil, and therefore Harry's ability to drive off a large number of dementors isn't actually that impressive by comparison to any other patronus. It's an impressive moment, for sure, with good dramatic timing, but it doesn't mean that Harry is secretly super powerful in canon, sorry.

He has some basic heroic virtues (stubborn will, hero complex, etc), is otherwise kind of an ass (a bit selfish and passive), and would likely be a solid professional quidditch player if he didn't have a madman after him. (Edit: He'd probably be a damned good DADA professor, too, speaking to his canonical strengths.)

I get what you're saying, in that you wish Harry had been more active and magical in canon. I would return that I wish /everything/ had been more active and magical in the Potterverse. The main plots often proceed at a crawl, due to the length of the school year, and there's tons of filler in the later books. We never get a solid idea of what magic can/cannot do, or how any of it works beyond the most superficial level. For a series about /fucking wizard school/ this is unacceptable, yes. We never get any idea how things work outside of Britain, and what we know about magical Britain is full of holes. Nothing makes any sense when you examine it closely, and JKR probably never thought any of it through for more than five seconds. So I get what you're saying about 'should have been'. But applying it to Harry only is to miss the forest for the trees, I feel.

#+end_quote

In Deathly Hallows, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione are attacked by "A hundred dementors" "advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a feast...", "Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade". Then "a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures' approach." (note that 3 patronuses (patroni??) couldn't force back the dementors) And then Harry gets in gear and sends out his own patronus, "It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again." So 3 patronuses could barely force back the dementors, but Harry's makes them "scatter in earnest".

******* I get that you are frustrated with the lack of payoff for the omens and weirdness that surround Harry vs Voldemort, but in truth, they're at least partly there to justify the conflict in the first place. Harry isn't the chosen one because he's awesome, but because that plot device was needed to give Voldemort a reason to go after him in the first place. Otherwise Harry is some random half-blood who has no reason to personally fight Voldemort, and whom Voldemort has no reason to personally hate.

Y'know what could have worked, if in a more adult context than childrens' books like Harry Potter? Hermione Granger dealing with the fact that she inadvertently becomes a symbol for competent, hard-working muggleborns during Voldemort's return, assuming that whole 'kill-the-muggles' thing was given more depth. It could deal with her subsequent conflict with a group of murderers in particular, and a corrupt society as a whole, both of which would like nothing better than to stamp her into the dirt, if not kill her outright. She has reason to be in immediate conflict with both, and this plot requires no prophecies, vague incantations, omens or characters playing chess in the background to justify that conflict. It could make allegory to social issues, and give some idea how magic works, while still being largely about a normal (if brainy) girl who is in way over her head, yet who rises to the occasion. Honestly, barring the existence of the prophecy, you would think that a muggleborn like Hermione would have far more reason to be in ideological conflict with Voldemort than Harry ever did. Harry is fighting in the spirit of dead parents he never knew and was never particularly curious about, against a guy who wants to kill him for initially unexplained (and later not very compelling) reasons. Our hypothetical Hermione's conflict is, by comparison, immediately understandable, and also more complicated if one delves into the reasons behind the anti-Muggle sentiment in wizarding society. If she doesn't fight, she and her entire family will most likely die, or at least live a life of horrible suffering, for the crime of existing.

Either way, it's a damned shame the books weren't better, but at least we still have fanfiction.

So, what you're saying is, the canon material doesn't count, because it is canon? Because that's honestly what I get from your first paragraph.

The books were fine for Young Adult literature, although I think the editing fell off later in the series. As adults we're going to have issues with things. For example: As adults, we find out someone is trying to kill us, we're going to figure out why and hopefully do something to defend ourselves: Self-defense training, running the heck away, something!

My editing issues in the books are the problems any series would have. At a certain point mistakes start cropping up because the author is too close to the work. They have written and rewritten so much that they think they did A but really they did A2. It's mostly the same, but they have slightly contradicted themselves from previous works.

For instance: In OotP Dumbledore explains how Lily's protection was is the base on which Dumbledore cast the blood protection charm, which was activated by a blood relative (Petunia) taking in Harry. This protection lasts until you turn 17. But suddenly in Deathly Hallows Harry has supposedly died and given his protection onto everyone at the Battle of Hogwarts. No one has cast a blood protection charm on them, no one with their blood has taken them into their home, and no where near all of them are under 17.

********* No, read it again. I'm saying that the stuff about 'power he knows not' and 'mark him as an equal' isn't a portent of Harry's impending awesome if it's used as a cheap plot device to get the villain into a conflict with the hero. Harry is billed as the 'dark lord's equal' and all that stuff because if that wasn't there, Voldemort would have no reason to go after Harry. Harry is some pissant half-blood who is mediocre at most things, and Voldemort would not give even a quarter of a rat's ass about fighting him if not for the prophecy. And then we would not have a plot. The end.

So Harry is reasonably normal, but has to survive the enmity of a powerful madman (read: a conflict with a clear underdog), and the justification for this in canon is talk of mysterious power and such, which Voldemort believes implicitly. Divination may even be mostly horseshit, we don't know, but the important part is that Voldemort believes it, and is willing to drop everything to go after Harry. Which is exactly what Rowling wanted. It's not hinting that Harry has the potential to be uberpowerful and the equal of Imhotep and such and such that you think he should be capable of. I think you've already reached that conclusion, and are trying to use canon to justify it after you've already decided. You've decided 'powerful Harry is what I want to see, now what evidence can I find?', at which point you might as well stop looking at canon, because what it says doesn't matter anymore. You've already made up your mind what you want it to say, and will see whatever you want to see from it.

Basically, I think you're trying to rationalise your adult dislike for the themes of the Potter books with the nostalgia you still feel for them. Hence why you espouse the idea that Harry should have been more awesome, yet cling to his actions in canon as a justification of that, despite saying that his actions in canon made him a namby-pamby teenager who can't do anything without Hermione. Can you not see how relying on canon Harry while dismissing it at the same time is contradictory argument? It's a cherrypicking argument at best, because anything that backs up your position is 'see! See! I told you he was awesome' and anything that works against it is 'see! I told you he relies on Hermione too much!'

Eh, there's a difference between the blood protection on Privet Drive and the one that Harry's mother gave him. The latter was the result of a powerful, willing sacrifice (and should therefore crop up significantly more often than in canon, yes). Harry's 'death' in DH was meant to be a big, heroic sacrifice for the people fighting there, so he gave them all protection, because 'it's magic, I don't gotta explain shit' (and because Christian subtext).

In any case, I think you've ODed on indy!Harry fics, because you're arguing from a position of 'should have' with Harry's power, rather than what we actually see of him. Point is, he's not hot shit either. He scrambles from situation to situation, lucking out so often that some people practically think Harry has the ability to synthesise Felix Felicis at the cost of his wits. You mention 'gillyweed', a notable point where Harry just got lucky because the plot said so, and him being able to compete at all in the second task was entirely down to author contrivance (aka 'luck' in universe). The 'over 100 dementors' thing is usually dredged up in uber!Harry fics to try to make their ridiculous powerups seem more canonically sound. It does not, in fact, make them more believable in my opinion. The implication was that any patronus could do this, but Harry being able to do it was impressive because he was /young/, and the spell was difficult, not because his was particularly powerful. I note that you ignore Fleur charming a dragon to sleep in order to hype Harry's ability to outfly one (flying being his main talent, for the record).

The 'power the Dark Lord knows not' is love, in canon. That's literally it. Voldemort is incapable of love, and Rowling wanted to make a rather shallow point about caring for your fellow man. No, this does not automatically entitle Harry to be the 'most awesome wizard since Ahmenotep', because those plots are usually boring as sin and full of pandering to fifteen year old power fantasies, in my experience. 'Harry is a super special awesome wizard who is more powerful than Ahmenotep and protects a hot french girl in his spare time. No, he is totally not a namby-pamby who needs to rely on a /girl/, ugh.' I don't know about you, but I don't see /anything/ immature about this line of thinking. The subtext kinda speaks for itself, sorry.

So while Harry may be the main character, I would argue that him becoming a capable bodyguard before 14 is far less believable than Fleur being assigned to guard him, regardless of her personal badassery. Because his age and unique circumstances (I.e the enmity of Voldemort) make him much more likely to be in need of a guard, and she was part of the Order, whose job for most of the latter books was to /guard Harry/. So Fleur pulling protection detail for Harry is vastly more believable than Harry somehow acquiring the skills to protect Fleur... and her needing significant amounts of protection.

And yes, a male bodyguard is the stereotype, and it plays directly into the stereotypes surrounding the 'rescue romance' trope, to which the bodyguard romance is strongly related. You know, white knight, princess, that whole caboodle? Arguing that those stories aren't culturally biased by gender would be... really, really dumb. So yes, to some extent, it's because he has a dick. It's probably not the /only/ reason, and it was my mistake to speak as if it was, but it's an important point to mention.

TL;DR: you had some good points, but I strenuously disagree with your conclusions.

The big question I come away with from all of this is 'Why the fuck are we talking about Ahmenotep?' I mean, is there some big fanfic I missed in which one of the Ahmenoteps (there are four, technically) was a powerful wizard, to which this guy is referring? The one that people are most likely to know of was Ahmenotep IV, aka Akhenaten, sole prophet of the sun god, Aten. He's the father of modern monotheism, in many respects (Christianity rips him off wholesale), but there's nothing really supernatural about him beyond the usual myths surrounding a dead Pharaoh (and most of them got this treatment), so I'm left really confused by that angle of the conversation.

Seriously, wtf. Please help me out here?

During OotP, Hermione said "You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't." According to Hermione he has power, so I haven't completely ODed yet.

I also want to point out you were arguing from a position of "'hot older girl' fantasy (why 90% of Fleur/Harry exists), and ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors, so screw making sense. A penis does not make you an effective bodyguard". You were implying that the remaining 10% of Fleur/Harry stores come from the Penis making you a bodyguard. I'm merely arguing that by claiming this you are committing the same misconduct you are blaming others of.

I didn't say he was "hot shit". In fact I said the complete opposite, that Harry was a "namby-pamby teenager who literally let Hermione do everything!" I completely agree that he got lucky and had outside help. And just for your general fund of knowledge when an author writes an unexpected power or event, saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel, is called a deus ex machina.

Again from OotP, Ron is trying to convince the others to join the DA, "Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once." I'll grant it's Ron and probably exaggerated, but even doubled that is still 50+ Dementors. In PoA we know there are enough Dementors to surround the school. It is presented to us as if there are enough there that Sirius can't sneak in (and Harry can't sneak out). Given the sheer size of the Hogwarts grounds, at least 50 - 100 seems like a not unreasonable number.

#+begin_quote

Honestly, I just didn't think of it, but thanks for bringing it up (I was eating lunch). Yep, she did manage to charm the dragon. But this isn't some kind of talent of hers, at least not that we know of. Fleur has had since Hagrid's date to prepare for the Dragon match. It could be some kind of powerful charm only someone powerful could do, but it could just as easily be a simple charm like the Conjunctivitis curse, remember Sirius was telling Harry to use a simple charm (the Conjunctivitis curse, in fact) and Cedric used, transfiguration to distract the dragon. We're not told how complex it is turning a rock into a dog, but according to the Harry Potter Companion a 6th year would work on human transfiguration. I would think this is more difficult than what Cedric did.

Nope sorry. It is never stated in canon that love is the power. Dumbledore thought it was love, a power studied down in the department of mysteries. And in the end Voldie was killed by the Elder Wand...backfiring? Punishing him for trying to use the Killing Curse against it's master? So Harry's power over Voldie, was his knowledge of wandlore. Voldie couldn't kill harry with the wand in the forest and couldn't silence everyone at Hogwarts, because he wasn't the Master and the wand wouldn't work for him. What's Love got to do with it? Harry going into the forest, literally accomplished nothing other than to cause anguish to his friends.

I didn't say that Love should "automatically entitle Harry to be the 'most awesome wizard since Ahmenotep'". I said the prophecy says Harry should be powerful (obviously I'm wrong, the prophecy says *A* power. And as I pointed out above it was, apparently, wandlore.

I didn't say he needed to rely on "a girl". I said he had to rely on Hermione. Unlike Ron, I recognized she was a girl from our first meeting with her. My point was exactly what I said, "Harry had to rely on Hermione." Harry Potter, the protagonist, the main character, *the CHARACTER WHOSE NAME IS IN THE TITLE OF EVERY BOOK*, could not effectively do anything beyond the basics from the classes he didn't sleep through. It was Hermione, a supporting character, who could brew any potion, memorized every book and spell, could figure out logic puzzles, create Mary Poppins' bottomless bag, set up wards, etc. If the books had been set up with Harry as nothing more than a [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425061/][Maxwell Smart]] and his trusty (read: competent) side kick 99, then fine, maybe it would have been funny.

And you assigning to me sexist notions "who needs to rely on a *girl*", is proving my original point, that you are showing your own sexism. Perhaps you should take a look at your self? It's called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection][psychological projection]] when humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others.

Namby-Pamby: lacking energy, strength, or courage; feeble or effeminate in behavior or expression. I was specifically going with the meaning: "lacking in energy" and "feeble in behavior" both of which Harry unarguably represents. He did nothing to prepare for the Horcrux hunt, for instance. Hermione, on the other hand, is definitely not displaying either of those traits.

Perfectly acceptable answer. I was arguing that as the main character, who is under the influence of a prophecy that says he "will have a power the dark lord knows not", makes more sense to be a guardian, than a character we know: is 3 years older than Harry; likes bouillabaisse; is part Veela (at least 1/4); has a lust allure; can charm a dragon to sleep, can't beat grindylows; has a younger sister; is working for the goblins to improve her English; loves and marries Bill Weasley; fights at the Battle of Hogwarts.

That's what we know about her. To me it doesn't add up to an obvious Xena: Warrior Princess. In canon, as you yourself point out, it's only her age that makes her more likely to be in charge of protecting Harry than vice-versa. I've read several powerful!Fleur stories (The Lie I've Lived, comes to mind), admittedly she's usually a supporting character, but we know so little about her she could be a total kickass and we wouldn't know it.

I also argue, again fully admitting I've read and enjoyed many indy!powerful!Harry stories, that Harry having a madman after him argues he should be more likely to be the guard. In my opinion, any competent guardian (I'm looking at Dumbledore here) would have ensured Harry was getting some serious education, if not before Hogwarts (so he could enjoy his "childhood"), than at least once he was at school, and failing that, once Voldie was back, and has made it obvious he is still after Harry, there should have been constant tutoring, etc., if only so Harry could better run away.

The trope is stereotyped as a male bodyguard. Not arguing that. I'm arguing that you ascribing to these authors a sexist attitude, "A penis does not make you an effective bodyguard", as if they have written Harry bodyguard stories because "ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors" is wrong. That the authors were merely familiar with the trope and wrote what they knew. They have no intention of saying a penis "makes you an effective bodyguard" or that "ofc women need to be protected, and men are protectors." That they made Harry the protector, and not the protectee, because of the reasons I said above (Harry is the main character, has a "power", Fleur is older, but mostly unknown).

****** Okay, my point about 90/10 split of Fleur/Harry fics being older women fantasy was hyperbole. I was being snarky at the time, so yes, using it as an actual statistic would be stupid, I agree. I apologise for being sexist initially, but I'm so sick of 'white knight' fics that turn female characters into bland, personality-free objects to be protected, so I was blowing off a bit of steam in that direction, my bad. My intention was to equally parody the treatment of 'bland love interest to be protected' and 'expendable bland meat chunk who protects her', because the sexism of rescue romance really does cut both ways. Of course there are Fleur/Harry stories besides 'older woman fetish and bodyguard penis fics', because not every Fleur/Harry uses this particular set of tropes, but my point was that this plot comes across as pretty heavy on those, imo, using hyperbole as a rhetorical device. I actually like Harry/Fleur, believe me. They seem like a solid fit, personality wise.

Regarding patroni, I admit that my knowledge of Deathly Hallows isn't up to snuff. I only read the damned thing once in its entirety, and I didn't particularly enjoy the experience, so the fact that 'a hundred dementors' showed up again is a nice reminder, thanks. Callback to PoA or Rowling reusing rhetorical devices? You decide! And yes, that's a fairly standard 'hero shows up and the hopeless fight becomes winnable' trope, so I'll give you that one. (Edit: upon re-reading the section you quoted, the Dementors were already falling back from the reinforcing patronuses which you mentioned. Harry's is the tipping point, because he's the main character, and it's symbolic damn it) The point where he uses it in Prisoner of Azkaban, on the other hand, is powerful, but at no point are we expected to believe that Harry's patronus is above the norm. If it later turns out to be the case, I'd see it more as an oddity of Harry's character than an indicator that he's the magical equal of Imhotep. Not saying he /shouldn't/ be powerful, but it seems like you confuse who Harry is in canon with who you think he ought to be.

So I don't know, it seems like Harry does become more personally 'special' in later books (OotP-DH), but never in a particularly meaningful way beyond his Plot Armour. He squanders any natural talent he has for things that could be useful for the plot, and doesn't really display much competence in areas outside of his DADA and flying, so... what are we working with, really? He's hyped in universe, and has been from book one, but his 'power he knows not' is underwhelming at best. He's very decidedly average outside of a few specific areas. You argue that this should not be the case. Honestly, given the opportunity, do you really think he'd put the effort in? Does he, as a character, have the drive to become the character you'd want, during his teen years? In light of his inability to prepare for future situations (as you noted with comparison to Hermione), general laziness, and mediocrity in areas outside of DADA/Flying? I don't think it's at all likely for him to apply himself in the way you expect. He'd lean on Hermione for help, and she'd do most of the work, unless you change something rather fundamental to Harry.

Like... honestly, I get the feeling that the main reason you're arguing that Harry should be more powerful is directly because he's the main character, and you prefer a competent main character. And everything else is window dressing to that point, really. He's not the character you wanted him to be, and you feel cheated. That's... perfectly understandable. I feel the same way about canon, for reasons I detailed above, and yes, Harry is underwhelming in canon. However, using his few shining moments in canon to try to justify that gut feeling that 'Harry should have been more awesome' is a mistake, I feel. He has a few cool moments in canon, yes, but not enough that I think making him a fourteen-year-old mercenary is at all believable, even for a minute. Changing him into /that/ really necessitates an AU. I feel that his lack of appreciable power/talent in the series is fairly intrinsic to his personality as presented. He needs to have a personality shift, with different habits and maybe even different talents, in order to be the person you want him to be. So if Harry was more powerful, applied himself, and had talent for a few things outside of DADA, I could maybe see it happening, yes. It would take a talented author to get me to read it, because I've seen way too many awful fics with a premise that started like that, but it's doable, certainly.

The problem with the bodyguard thing is that while having Voldemort after him might (with changes, and a considerable amount of pushing) make him a capable combatant, the fact that he has someone powerful after him makes him a poor choice for a bodyguard. As in, you, as the person hiring him, now have to worry about becoming collateral to Voldemort's attempts to kill Harry. So... you either need to hire a different bodyguard (unacceptable, we want bodyguard Harry as a premise), or somehow mitigate the fact that there is a powerful madman who wants Harry dead, and might just put your head on a pike for associating with him. Well, it's already an AU, so... what if Voldemort never rose to power, or was perma-killed in Godric's Hollow? That neatly removes the issue of Harry being an enormous liability, but one still has to wonder who/what Fleur would need protecting from, particularly the absence of Voldemort. I agree with the traits you assign her for her canon appearances, and she's largely an unknown, but since she's not really anything special... why would she need a hypercompetent bodyguard? So you need to invent a new villain, too, and make him/her hate Fleur far more than they do Harry, taking focus away from him again. So really, it will be Fleur's story, as told by Harry, her bodyguard, because the core conflict has to revolve around her character rather than his in order for the concept to make any sense. I get the feeling that this focus on Fleur would not be what you want, because you want hypercompetent Harry to be the main character and focus of the series. The hoops one needs to jump through to get this plot off the ground in a believable fashion are quite numerous. Not an insurmountable challenge to write, but far more difficult to pull off than the reverse.

Consider this. The Order post guards around Harry when he's staying in Privet Drive. Fleur is a member of the Order, possibly via the Weasleys depending on how you feel about that. She takes the short straw, or loses a hand of wizarding poker to Mundungus, or anything of that nature, and suddenly she has to spend (at least) one night a week watching out for Harry. He's very slightly more curious than in canon (i.e. not played by Keanu Reeves) and the fact that he's stuck there with nobody to talk to bothers him enough to actually do something stupid, as Harry is often wont to do when he doesn't think things through enough. She has to stop him, physically, because his plan was dumb enough that it might just work, and he recognises her from GoF, so they end up talking when it's her turn to watch over him... wow, that's actually incredibly simple. It requires the barest modicum of changes, such as maybe moving Fleur's association with the Order forward a year, and making Harry more assertive, but it fits quite well. Harry could even be naturally more talented than her at stuff, in a raw, unrealised fashion, but he's not a member of the Order, so her position as his bodyguard has nothing to do with her personal power. She just happens to know some people who shanghaied her into protecting Harry, and Harry does not have working inroads with those people. So you can have Harry start to be awesome, and maybe Fleur helps him with that, and sparks fly where they may. Together, they fight Voldemort, who exists in this universe. Harry's personal conflict remains central, as he is the one being protected from bad things. Have your cake and eat it.

This is the crux of my issue with the suggested concept of bodyguard Harry/Fleur. I, personally, find the latter far easier to believe than the former. Not because Fleur has a vagina, or because I think Harry should be stronger, but because it requires a lot fewer contortions of the established characters to get Fleur as Harry's bodyguard to work.
