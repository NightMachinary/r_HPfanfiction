  Full title: The One Where The Entire Gryffindor Common Room Lusts After Harry Wearing Quidditch Pants and Hermione is Persuasive. That's rather self-explanatory, I think. Really, it's just best to move on. Equally pointless second chapter now added.

** linkffn(harry is a dragon, and that's okay)

In which Harry is for some reason a dragon. Being that Harry is near invulnerable, can fly, and breathes fire, Voldemorts machinations are effortlessly thwarted and the actual story is a slice of life about going to a magical boarding school.

​

linkffn(What's her name in hufflepuff)

This story has some serious bits but is mostly light hearted. Focuses on the trials of growing up or pretending to at least, of going to Hogwarts and of learning magic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

#+begin_quote
  Marietta Edgecombe and Cho Chang have unleashed an unimaginable catastrophe upon Hogwarts in the middle of the Triwizard Tournament -- freedom of apparition. Showing all the common sense that wizards are known for, the students can't wait to start practising, and those in Gryffindor Tower are no exception.With chaos in the corridors and the teachers stressed to breaking point, Harry Potter is focussed on just one thing -- not looking like an idiot at the upcoming Yule Ball. That requires a date, but as he finds out, with just the right company, sometimes your problems almost solve themselves.If only the teachers could say the same.Imported from SIYE. Written for their Apparition Challenge (2016-1).

  As the mayhem resulting from the lifting of apparition restrictions at Hogwarts settles down, Harry Potter is trying to survive the last few days of term without going mad. His best friends are behaving strangely, Malfoy is being a git, and, most importantly, he has to learn to dance before the Yule Ball. He's not the only one with problems, however, and somewhere amidst all this he needs to help Neville Longbottom in his search for a way to restore Luna Lovegood to normality after her avian apparition aberration.If there's one person he can rely on to keep him sane amidst all this, it's Ginny Weasley, his best friend's little sister... and now, his date for the Ball. Oh yes, her twin brothers are very interested in that development.Harry may be in even more trouble than usual, here.A sequel (and very definitely the finale) to Wondrous Apparition Provided By Magician. You probably need to read that for this to even begin to make sense.No ducks were harmed in the writing of this fic, although one was severely inconvenienced and extremely confused.

** Repost from another thread: you might like linkffn(11994595). It's post-Hogwarts, Harry has a family with Ginny, Dudley Dursley has grown up and has his own family and is a decent sort despite Vernon's poor parenting. One of Dudley's kids turns out to be magical, Dudley reluctantly contacts Harry for advice, and the families end up meeting up and getting along. A nice story without much angst.
