There's not too much I remember, or even if the story was any good. Malfoy showed the great hall Harry's memories of his early life somehow, thinking it would be all pampered and great. I think later Harry shows the rest to everyone. I don't remember if this was any good, I was just wanting to reread it and see if it was.


** It's on chapter 15 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Griffindors never die]]. A rather good fic.

*** Ah okay. I like that fic quite a bit. Just had the memory of the one scene coming to mind and couldn't remember what fic it was in.
