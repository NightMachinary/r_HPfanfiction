*** This is such a pleasure to read. The author is french but has great command of english. Being foreign though, means that the story tone is different than the usual american/british fare. I found it very refreshing.

The Harry/Hermione conflict alone is among the best subplots in all the land.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

** There's one of my favorites from ye olden days, linkffn(Hidden by eQuasarus). Now that guy could write a mean AU, his fics were wonderfully unique, with a tone I haven't really seen replicated. A sort of rough, plain, in your face prose, that was paradoxically, also pretty lyrical and evocative. Or I may be remembering with rose-tinted glasses. Also full of wonderful extrapolations for magical effects.

Anyway, from what I recall, this story features Harry running away from the Dursleys before Hogwarts and ending up in the Forbidden Forest. Harry decides that, given how negative his experiences with humans have been thus far, he must stop being human and become a wolf. Now even in the wizarding world this sort of thing would result in confinement in a mental ward, but because of Harry's absolute belief that he is a wolf, his magic slowly begins to adapt to this belief. He begins to "commune" with the other creatures in the forest and his magic gradually works to sharpen his senses, movement and strength. Eventually the wizards figure it out and try to lure him to their world, so there's some fuckery there.

Ofc it's abandoned, but I think it's worth a read-through regardless.
