Additionally, I'm wondering if there's a story were Harry runs the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters (X-men universe) or something similar.


** Novocaine has this! It's still being written, though, but it's already one of my favorites.

Well I mean, he opens an orphanage, anyway. And does other things.

Dunno how to use the bot, so here's the link!

In case you actually want to know, you use a command that corresponds to the site that the fic is on (for fanfiction.net it is “linkffn”; for ao3 it's “linkao3”, and so on), and then add the ID of the story in parentheses (for some sites you can also use the fic's name, but this sometimes gives creepy results).

So, to give you an example, for the fic you linked the bot command would be this:

#+begin_example
  linkffn(13022013)

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

**** I've read some of it. The plot is slowly a bunch of girls end up living at his manor house for different reasons. Harry ends up as lord/head of many houses not through inheritance but through contracts. All the girls catch feelings for him while he's struggling to keep everything together. Managing a bunch of business and accounts while providing for an increasing number of residents in his manor is predictably hard on an 18 year while other people with power are trying to undermine him and take away everything he has.

The orphanage part of the story is that he runs a orphanage for the children affected by the Wizarding world, both Muggle and Wizarding. He goes there from time to time to have fun with the kids. The Patil twins are like the managers there.
