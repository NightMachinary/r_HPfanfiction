Can anyone here suggest any good fanfics? I really just don't want for there to be any Ron or Hermione as I am looking for something unique. Slash works but only if its on the very, very side prefered not to have it. Prefer relationships where Harry is confident and friends with Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, or Tracey Davis. No Gay relationships. Please give me your longest ones!


** How about linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5751435/1/Stories-of-the-Lone-Traveler]]) and it's trilogy and it's many, /many/ offshoots. That should keep you busy for a while.

It's about 1.5 million words, all told.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
