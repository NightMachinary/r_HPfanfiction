Things I specifically want:

- the golden trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione)
- the silver trio (Neville, Ginny, Luna)
- Draco (not really needed but would be cool)
- people from other houses (would be cool but not needed)

Things that I'd prefer to be included but isn't a requirement:

- an early start to the DA or something similar
- manipulative Dumbledore
- canon pairings/other pairings are fine
- inter-house networking
- Parseltongue use would be cool
- Founders stuff would also be cool
- The ruining of Umbitch and Fudge would be cool, too

Things I *don't* want:

- Harry/Hermione or Lavender joining them back in time
- harems
- evil people from the future travelling back with them
- marauder's era
- teenagers shipped with adults
- major deaths on Harry's side (such as Sirius, people's parents, Snape, or Remus. I don't really care about Dumbledore)

*Thanks for reading my requirements and responding with any recommendations! It means a lot!*


** Okay, so I don't know about a group of time travelers that big, but maybe [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1342282]] (Series Draco Does It All Again, it's still updating) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1733899]] Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards (Again, still updating).

If you have ur own recomendations, please let me know, I also enjoy time travel-fics. <3

​

Draco does it all again: Draco gets sent back in time by the centaurs to before he started at Hogwarts to "fix everything". How he's going to achieve that, he's not sure. Step one: befriend Potter. Step two: ? Step three: save the world.

Harry potter and the ticket backards: When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

#+begin_quote
  Caught in the backlash of Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry is thrown through time to a world so very different from his own.
#+end_quote

Quite possibly one of the best time travel fics that I've ever read. Harry gets sent back to the Founders' time due to the /Priori Incantantem/ in the graveyard. He is promptly found and healed by Salazar Slytherin, who invites him to Hogwarts as one of his snakes. Eventually, they manage their way back to only a few days or weeks after the graveyard incident.

  [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905/chapters/45993925][Messing With Time]]

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old.

  The past, naturally, rapidly goes quite off the rails.
#+end_quote

A pretty damn hysterical fic, if I do say so myself. Its updates are slow but the chapters written are worth it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8660149][Who'd Suspect a Hufflepuff?]]

#+begin_quote
  After losing the war Hermione and Harry are left as two of the last alive. In a desperate bid for their survival they travel back in time to kill Tom Riddle before he makes his first horcrux. Using cunning and intelligence learned from their time at war they work to save the world before it has even begun to fall. Lucky for them, everyone overlooks the Hufflepuffs.
#+end_quote

It's a 10k word one-shot. One of the best forties fics I've read that doesn't include Harry/Tom. It vaguely features Lordships, blood magic, and a cheerfully annoying Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1127441][Step Back in Time series]]

It's a series where an old, wizened, Master of Death Harry Potter steps through a time rip to right after the events on Halloween 1981. He basically raises himself and later gets into a relationship with snarky Potions Master Severus Snape. Harry's pretty badass in this and it rehashes some of the books, but quite vaguely since it's featured around the older Harry and not his son "Ry."

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20944511/chapters/49796081][Forsaken]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry was forsaken his whole life, nothing ever stayed the same and if it did it endangered or hurt Harry in some way shape or form. This revolves in all things, and his pass with fortune ends when after he finally destroys Voldemort, a Death Eater decides to murder him. Death is unhappy with Harry being his master, but acknowledges Harry never had a chance of anything but a horrible life. Granting Harry with his full amount of power with no compulsions, Death sets him up to go to Hogwarts in 1940s where he can truly discover who he is.
#+end_quote

Features a Master of Death Harry Potter who's dropped into the 1940s during Grindelwald's reign, gay and insane side characters, the personification of Death, sadistic teenage Tom Riddle, and manipulative Dumbledore. It's pretty much a crackfic that doesn't seem to be going anywhere but I love it all the same. The author's a cool person who's letting me write my own version of the fic, so that's a plus.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1144601][Grounding Magic series]]

Literally, /the best/, world-building and personification of Harry that I've seen to date. It features wizarding culture, Paganism, rituals, liberal use of wandless magic and runes, Parseltongue, and prankster Harry. I recommend reading every part of the series, even the extras, because the author's worldbuilding and characterizations are the best things in the world.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is the Master of Death and Lord of Time through his joining of the three Hallows together. During a duel that wasn't going well, he jumps to the 1940's and has a talk with the true Master of Death. Can harry prevent the destruction that will occur? Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP
#+end_quote

Basically, Harry gets thrown back in time as a teenager where he pretends he knows nothing about the wizarding world and gets himself in Slytherin with Tom Riddle. Dumbledore's a manipulative old coot in this and Harry's got quite the grasp on magic and a shit ton of sadism built up, but I love it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504][Full Circle]]

#+begin_quote
  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.

  At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.

  (cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
#+end_quote

I can't tell you how many times I've cried myself laughing like a hyena-fox hybrid. Not necessarily time travel, but Tom and Harry eventually get reborn into their original life and they fuck around with people, mainly Dumbledore.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15087428/chapters/34983008][Harry Potter and the Greatest Show]]

#+begin_quote
  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.

  Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move /on/ or go /back/ he does something else entirely.

  And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.

  Because that makes sense.

  (No. No it doesn't.)

  But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
#+end_quote

Er... I don't quite remember much about this fic but all I know is that its narrative is brilliant and hilarious at times.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10404927/chapters/22976058][Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light]]

#+begin_quote
  After the final battle Harry learns some unsettling truths about himself and those who he trusts the most. Forced to come to terms with the revelations, Harry decides to get even with those who've wronged him and embrace who he his by going back to when it all started.
#+end_quote

Basically, Harry puts Humpty Dumpty back together again. Or, rather, he puts his insane soulmate back together again after travelling back in time.

  How do you heal them faster? Get sent back in time and correct things. Some chars are OOC.

The Golden and Silver Trio, along with George, get sent back to first-year right after the final battle. They promptly begin to save everyone and kill Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds himself making a decision to give it all up just to change what has happened. What he doeesn't realize is that he gets a chance to set it right.
#+end_quote

It's pretty damn grim and gory but a good read. There's also an unfinished sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets: First]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one.
#+end_quote

The first instalment of a three-part unfinished series. I'd recommend reading it anyway considering the fact that the third part features the best political side of Slytherin that I've ever seen. Harry systematically dominates them all and it's /beautiful/. I've cackled more than once to myself.

*I could recommend a lot more but I don't really fancy scrolling through fifty pages of my AO3 history.*

*** Here are a few other fics that I recommend and didn't fit on the other comment. They're not time travel but they're brilliant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22327684/chapters/53334382][draw me after you (let us run)]]

#+begin_quote
  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  

  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. 

  “It seems I have finally caught you.”
#+end_quote

Wherein Harry escapes Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries, Sirius lives, Harry finds out about the Horcruxes and the prophecy, and he decides to play catch-me-if-you-can with a murderous Dark Lord after somehow managing to outwit him, and decides to put Humpty together again. Eventually, they come to an understanding.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19793110/chapters/46860157][Burning Red]]

#+begin_quote
  Around the time most young children's do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence.

  So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.

  And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor.

  Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.
#+end_quote

This characterization of Harry is amazing and funny and I love it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid, he's sick of constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up and take control of his life.
#+end_quote

It's a brilliant fic if you can get over the first few chapters.
