I'm thinking about the Diary. What would have happened if it was his only anchor and it got destroyed by Harry? I wonder wether there are any fics about this.

** Depending on when it got destroyed the effects may vary:

-Before 'dying' in '81 - no effect, but he dies for real when dealing with Harry

-While possesing Quirell - he stays alive as long as Quirrell does

-While staying immaterial - he vanishes

-While having that weird baby body he had in book 4 - he presumably lives.

**** Well yeah, but if he were to make one so far, i don't think he'd go on making more. There is no feedback to him about horcruxes being destroyed so for all intents and purposes he thinks he's still got it.

** It does sound interesting! Sorry if you already knew this, but “What's that fic?” is for specific fics and the “prompt” tag is for a premise of fic that you find interesting like your request.

** If he only had one, he wouldn't have entrusted it to someone else. He'd probably be sane enough to turn a grain of sand into a horcrux or something.

** There are two options:

a) to die you need a body first: in which case nothing much would change - he would still return to life, possibly same way. He would have still have Lily's protection - meaning potentially only Harry could kill him safely. He would know his Horcrux is gone - would he make a new one?

b) his spirit would instantly dissipate into nothingness and that would be the end of Moldyshorts.

** In linkffn(2788096) that's the case, so Voldemort uses a ritual that allows him to be reborn if killed during a mission (takes time to prepare, and it's limited duration).

  Harry decides to help Ginny recover from her experience in the Chamber of Secrets, causing a special bond to form between them. Rating is for violence in the later chapters. A French translation called Si tu peux l'aider is being written by Sined
