Looking for anything where Quirrell either has a bigger influence on Harry, or mentors him in any type of magic.


** HPMOR comes to mind first. Personally, it was fantastic, but I understand it isn't very popular here for many reasons.

*** ehhh as others have said it's dated and reads like a giant nerd wank fest, but if you can get passed some of the smugness the author has in them self it's an..interesting read?

**** It's very well written. I'm a bit of a giant nerd myself, and I found the rationality aspect of it to be interesting. Didn't mind the soapboxing too much either. However, the author does come off as a giant douchenozzle, and it does manifest in the main character. It definitely isn't for everyone, but it is probably the biggest name in HP fic, so it's probably worth giving a try to most.

***** I didn't deny that it was well written, I just said that the whole "I'm super smart here me nerd" thing got irritating especially with Harry being like "I'm super smart" and then being like "you looked down on me i hate you now" constantly.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

*** As an addendum, DLP has certain posting thresholds that need to be met in order to access the section that contains the four chapters in question. The rule in this sub that says don't use this sub to try to evade requirements of other forums was put in place because there were numerous posts and comments requesting assistance with bypassing the DLP requirements, primarily for this specific story.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
