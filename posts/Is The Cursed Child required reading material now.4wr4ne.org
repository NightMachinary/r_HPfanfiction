** I didn't like CC; as I said in another thread, to me it feels like a parody - not of the original canon, but of fanfiction - and that offends me. It also offends me that people call it fanfiction but that would imply that Jack Thorne is a fan, when I see nothing to indicate that he has any knowledge of, love for or respect for the original canon. And I'm offended that JKR has endorsed it. (and breathe). It has been important to me to stick within canon in my own writing and I wrote a story set in 2008/9 when Harry's children are small. I had expected CC to completely trash my story in terms of canon compliance . . . and it doesn't. I think it fits weirdly well in fact. It's even given me a new story (hopefully a fix if I'm honest), though I had sworn off fanfiction as a bad job. So I hate CC, but I'm writing again because of it. Inspiration can strike in the strangest of ways.

** I wouldn't think so. From my reading, CC didn't add anything new to what we actually know about the universe. It didn't add extra characterization to characters from the main books or fun, world-building details. It wasn't particularly imaginative or clever. It probably works as a play, but as reading, it didn't do much.

The only part I think will stay important is the characterization of Albus, Rose, and Scorpius, and even there, I wouldn't worry about it overly.

So if you're not writing in that time period, or don't care if you're a tad AU according to strict definitions, no, I don't think CC is required reading.

** I doubt it, I haven't read it myself. And as it will be in manuscript form, I most likely won't. If those writers would have taken the time to rewrite it as an actual book, then perhaps I'll have a go at it. No offence meant, but reading a play to do it is one thing. But reading it just to read it sounds like the dumbest idea imaginable.

*** Exactly.

Part of what I think made the original 7 so much fun was that Rowling kept introducing /new/ stuff. The entire world in the 1st. The history of the houses, politics and depth of anti muggleborn prejudice in 2nd. The Azkaban and issues with the WizWorld's legal system in 3rd. The Tournament in 4rth. The Prophecy and indepth look at WizWorld's govt in the 5th. Horcruxes in the 6th and so much more in the 7th.

Cursed Child added very little to that. It wasn't anything new. Much like fanfiction, she didn't introduce anything new, but grabbed hold of whatever interesting stuff she could find that she'd already written and then smushed it together with a new premise.

As a play it may be great to watch, but as a script, its definitely not worth reading.

If Rowling takes the time to convert the manuscript into a fleshed out book, then I sure might be willing to read it.

CC is canon, but I've been ignoring huge parts of canon since DH, so what do I care? CC is just the rest of the epilogue, equally as terrible.

**** The way I understand it JKR didn't write it, she just approved it and that's why her name is on it. Some people have said that she contributed to it, but no one seems to be really clear with how much...if any. I don't feel like it will spawn much fanfiction. If you do stumble across some that looks worth reading, i'm pretty sure this subreddit has summed the book up well enough to where the fic could be followed.

*** That's a rather condescending thing to say. Most people are fully aware that it's a script. And if it wasn't 'meant' to be published in a book, why was it? The problem is not that it's a script but that it's poorly plotted and ignores the rules of its own canon. As a play it seems it holds its own purely because of the special effects and stagecraft, which is no excuse for the complete lack of effort when it came to writing the plot. Professional writers were getting paid handsomely for it, for heavens sake. I can see no excuse for it being so damn bad.
