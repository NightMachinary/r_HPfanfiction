Is there a Story where Harry as an old man like Dumblesore age is pulled to another dimension by The Order of Phoenix?

Like he is just as powerful or even stronger then Albus and then they team up against Tom, would be epic.

This Idea has been bugging me lately and since I can't write story maybe one of you could or there is one already out there.


** Remind me!

** My first thought was something like Old Man Logan. I would also be interested in something like this. :)
