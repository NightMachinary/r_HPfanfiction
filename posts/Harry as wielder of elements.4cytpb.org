Hello my fellow fanfiction fans, I'm looking for some fanfiction, where can Harry wield some element. I've read linkffn(Harry Potter And The Elemental's Power) and I need more of this theme. Also, I would like the story to be long, at least 300k words.

Thanks for your time.

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

** I agree with you, I find it hard to find elemental!harry fics that are lengthy/still being made and not just op!harry who knows how to do everything. But there's:

linkffn(9570608) where he is a lightning elemental and his mum is/was a fire elemental.

linkffn(7863744) Harry is another ice elemental in this (I believe) and bits of it seem like Elemental's Power just rewritten but I really want this story to continue

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)

  5th Year AU - "There are those who believe that we should obey the 10 Commandments. But as our names suggest, Mr. Potter, Ms. Greengrass, we decide to follow an 11th commandment: Thou Shalt Not Speak. You have piqued our interest. We will be watching." The Dementors weren't the only ones to show up that day. NOTE: This story is not about religion or religious circumstances.

** linkffn(Elemental Genesis by Raven Dragonclaw) is an oldie, but a goodie. It's a great story, but the sequel is abandoned.

It's my favorite elemental fanfic, and one of my longtime favorites.

** There was a really good one that treated Potter's elementalism like he's a transfiguration prodigy. However, [[/spoiler][the killing curse left his magic damaged as he can't cast charms.]] I can't remember the name of it right now, but I'll get back to this thread if I remember it.

  He was lying in the mud dying, the world was already dead. Voldemort must be in his grave laughing, he had been right all along and now it was to late to do anything about it. Death didn't quite agree with that and now Death's son was going to make the muggles pay for everything they had done. This story will contain slash
