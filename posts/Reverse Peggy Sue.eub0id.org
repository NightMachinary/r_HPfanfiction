** I thought you meant a character that can't do anything right, gets it all wrong, and is utterly hopeless.

Was pretty confused. Mixed up Peggy and Mary.

**** Mary Sue is a super cool, "unique", perfect, well liked, badass, op, character with no flaws.

A Peggy Sue is a character that goes back in time to their younger body or sends their consciousness back ect and changes things. Often involving becoming super cool and OP and fixing all of their flaws therefore making them perfect. Hence the similar name.

Peggy Sue is still used to refer to any characters that go back in time for a redo though, even when they are well written, while Mary Sue is just bad writing.

***** That's because Peggy Sue is a reference to the movie *Peggy Sue Got Married*, which involved the main character reliving part of her life.

Mary Sue originated in the early Star Trek fandom.

****** Peggy Sue is one that always confuses me because of my own reading choices - as a kid, there was a french series I read about a Peggy Sue with supernatural elements, and that's a far cry from the reliving your main life time travel. Like I associate it much more with invisible ghosts, animals from other planets, a fantastical dream world living inside the sleeping mind of a god-giant, a giant butterfly whose shade puts people in a state of ecstasy and who gets chased around by moving houses just to try to catch that state of mind again, and a bunch of other such things. (like a talking blue dog who ruled a city for a few months before becoming a faithful sidekick).

It was a strange series.

** [[https://redd.it/6r9qzj][There was this one time]] that I wrote a short cracky story about a baby Harry accidentally ending up in stasis, his magical power growing until the stasis broke 5 decades later.\\
Instead of 'adult Harry goes back to the past with all of his knowledge', it's 'baby Harry goes forward to the future with all too much power'.

** Wouldn't all the reincarnation stories qualify?

Also the diarymort, ginnymorts (e.g. The Imposter Complex) where teen voldy wakes up to find that his older self screwed up, decides to take over the world the right way.

I actually really like these kind of stories because the displaced person has to work harder to be clever without the help of hindsight

** As long as they dont become Mary Sue in the process im all for it. I once read one non-canon compliant Harry sent to the future where he meets his blonde daughter. He discovers he died.

For the life of me I cant remember the name.
