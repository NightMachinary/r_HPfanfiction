** It's implied that souls coming back from the afterlife, even in shade form like through the Resurrection Stone, are "uncomfortable" in the land of the living. That probably means that discomfort would become pain, and then agony, depending on how long they'd be here on this plane.

While ghosts aren't in pain, they are in eternal misery, and there was a thing in canon that says they're either sapient "imprints" of people (meaning copies, implying the actual soul went into the afterlife), or they're actual specters that refused to cross over.

Even Voldemort, in his spectral, splintered form, was a miserable parasite.

It just doesn't end well no matter what angle you look at it from.

Lily being shoved back into her body or another body (possession? Taking a soulless body, thanks to a dementor?) would probably mean misery and agony in the long-term.

1. If it's her original body, rotted? She's in her own rotting corpse and is likely to feel the pain of that or nothing at all (animating a puppet), on top of the discomfort, pain, then agony of not being meant to be on this plane (and the discomfort of not being to feel anything due to her body being dead)
2. If it's her original body but restored to life/a soulless condition somehow, again there's the discomfort escalation -- on the upside, she has her son to get to know, after killing Snape for being the cause of her family's ruin first, of course. She'd also likely go insane from the pain and suicidal
3. If she "came back wrong" or not, aka Pet Semetary or The Crow
4. If the body she's in now is that of someone else:

   1. If the body was soulless, either through a dementor attack or from a ritual/technique to murder/remove the poor soul, she's now in someone else's body, having effectively stolen that life
   2. If she's possession that living body, what happened to its original owner?

      1. Did Lily merge with the victim, taking her memories, aspects of personality, and mannerisms as the soul is used for fuel?
      2. If the victim still there, trapped in their own body while Lily's trapped in the driving seat? (See Goa'uld).
      3. Was the victim's soul just obliterated when Lily took up residence in their body?

5. Given there's a link between the body/DNA, the soul, and magic, would incompatibility arise, since Lily would literally be a Frankenstein's Monster?

Again, back to the body: if it's not Lily's, the victim in question, as well as Snape's motivations (such as punishing Harry for some reason or having a body as close to Lily's as possible) and the state of his mental health would have an impact on the story, too.

1. Hermione? Harry's sister-in-all-but-blood, a smart muggleborn (like how Lily was), so the parallels are there
2. Ginny? Fiery, attractive red-head, and a way to say "fuck you" to Harry and the Weasleys -- after all, his girlfriend becoming his mother? Yeah
3. Tonks? A metamorphmagus in the prime of her life, just a few years older than when Lily was cut down by Voldemort. However, the magic/blood/soul thing may mean that Lily may not be able to look like herself again with Tonks' abilities, contrary to Snape's expectations
4. A muggle? Shoving a magical soul into a muggle woman's lookalike body: would Lily be unable to do magic despite having it, due to the body?
5. A random magical woman or a background character such as Madam Rosmerta or even Rita Skeeter?
6. One of Harry's classmates or year-mates, like Susan Bones?

There are so many twisted routes this prompt could take due to the underlying body-horror/fringe horror/Eldritch horror context.

**** Imprint implies echo/copy -- that begs the question whether the souls are just copies left behind while the original soul was dragged to the afterlife anyway, or whether they're the actual souls of the person that died but reduced to a shadow than being an object that casts a shadow (that's kinda abstract, I know)... maybe the echo of a sound than the sound itself?

****** Well, sucks for them: the originals went into the afterlife, that's all well and good for them, but they, the inferior copies, are damned to walk the Earth for all eternity. "Thanks alot, Me!" Edit: it's like the fringe horror of SOMA: each time your character transfers to a new area, you're led to believe you're still the same you: in reality, you're a new copy created from a seamless continuity, meaning each time you jumped? A copy of you, a sapient person with feelings, is left behind to rot and die alone. This is powerful in the ending: you think you've gone to the Ark, and are treated to a scene where "you" reunite with another character, Catherine. In reality, that's a copy you would have played as, had the game continued on like other sections did. In reality, "you" and a Catherine are still stuck in the transfer machine. "They're not us! They're not us!" /sadly dies alone in the dark/

** If it works, it ain't stupid. And if it doesn't nonconsensually harm any living person, it's not too far. And also "Necromancy is going too far" is an interesting sentiment to hear from someone who once had simultaneous possession of two of the three Deathly Hallows.

I think it all depends on just how much (or how little) power there is behind being the quote-unquote "Master of Death".

** Unless there's a risk that she'd "come back wrong" so to speak, and potentially harm her soul, or that of any other person (to "fuel" it), then I don't see why not. Hell, this might be the one thing he could get Harry on board with as Master of Death.

This does, however, remind me of a somewhat disturbing fic I stumbled upon once. Basically, Snape survives Nagini, but his mental faculties are somewhat disrupted. He somehow convinces himself that Lily isn't actually dead, but merely just "resting". He does a bit of grave-robbing, and with a bit of spellwork, actually successfully restores her back to life. Only, she seems to share Snape's problems in not being quite all there (maybe a part of both of them wasn't able to cling onto life fully?). Snape is arrested for grave-robbing, but not only did this distress him (which he arguably deserves) but also Lily who loses control in the process. Ultimately, they're left alone cohabiting with each other (it's arguable whether it was platonic or not), because trying to seperate them led to a lot of distress on both of their parts, and it was concluded that this was likely to leave them both at their happiest, a part of them being able to cling to their past with each other, given that each other is what they spent most of their life with of the surviving ones from that time, with Harry doing occasional visits to ensure that everything is okay, or at least as well as they can be. But neither of them is mentally healthy in the end.

The start dating long after war , but Hermione is killed right before a date by an escaped prisoner she helped put there. It's one break too many for Snape's sanity.

** Maybe the Lily that comes back is evil? Maybe she is twisted by the dark magic used to bring her back or the knowledge there is no afterlife makes her fear death as much as Voldemort does and she is willing to do anything not to die again. Even sacrificing her own son.

Either way it would be funny if the first thing Lily does is smile and cast a killing curse at Snape, kidnap Harry and join Voldemort.
