** I like this idea a lot. For the long term survival of Magicals (and humanities in general), space colonization is a necessity. If magic works in outer space, building space ships and stations will be significantly easier: just port keying your stuffs to Low-Earth-Orbit, no more expensive and inefficient rockets. The Magicals should also have the option of making dimensional travels.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/258048][The Ark and the Desert]] fits. Likewise, in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849816][Space Haven]], the residents of an besieged Hogwarts travel via hidden gate to Atlantis and must get everything working again. A group of students uses a defective portray in both [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4014733][The ever-changing tide]] Temeraire and Naruto crossovers respectively.

A future exodus is sort of implied in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346][D.S.S. Requirement]]. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3999286][FeS2]] is slash, but I don't remember it being very explicit. It was inspired by Xerosis. If you are looking to branch out... In a circular sort of 'inspired by' cascade, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724291/1/Stand-Against-the-Moon][Stand Against the Moon]] by the author of Xerosis came about from FeS2, and has Harry as the leader of the non-human magicals in which they rebel. It has the same themes, but they don't leave Earth. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2320601/1/Under-Siege][Under Siege]] Hogwarts is locked down, but they don't /leave/ and it's more about building a community. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3450026][The Wizard Beyond The Walls]] fits a little bit?

In Esama's Tumbling HP Crossovers [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3492878][Chapter 2: Because Why Not]] Harry ends up alone on an asteroid and has to terraform it, which is similar I guess? Likewise, in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3493007][Chapter 5: Forest Spirit]] Harry ends up creating a seemingly sentient forest on a distant planet. There are a couple of Pitch Black crossovers which have Harry and others trying to survive on Hades before the crash. For example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5494295/1/Alpha-and-Omega][Alpha and Omega]], but it is both abandoned and way too short. Almost all of those stories are slash (and often pretty explicit) and most Harry is alone.

** Both of my current stories revolve around wizards leaving/having left earth. In my STTNG/HP story(which is currently worldbuilding so is partially also focused on building a romance as well as the universe for the actual story(which should start in about seven chapters or so)) the Mages have colonized Sirius system and an immortal Harry has finally rejoined them after exile.

In my Darkness!Harry story, he wants the hell away from muggles like his aunt and her fat fuck of a husband and child and basically founds a company to research and fund a way to get magicals to Mars for their own planet(the moon is MUCH too close to his aunt for Harry but there will be a moon base on the dark side of the moon. It will be painted pink and it will be named Base Floyd).

**** For the darkness, knowing the series of comics isn't really necessary, think of it more as an allusion to the series than a melding.

For the STTNG one, knowing the STVerse is actually kinda necessary since events in TNG and DS9 and potentially Voyager will help shape the 'verse

****** heh. I imagine Molly has a pirate fantasy coupled with using anal for birth control methods(I may not have a potion for that usage like is common in most fics)--which was common at one time before condoms and rhythm methods were discovered. Once you do something enough times, you can start to enjoy it. ~_^

** Not entirely what you want but in linkffn(4944819) has mentions of wizards colonising elsewhere, with Weasley descendants on board the colony spaceships, and linkffn(5997662) chapter five, they visit a world colonised by wizards with a descendant of Colin Creevey as their leader, introducing the Enterprise crew to the legend of Harry and his friends.
