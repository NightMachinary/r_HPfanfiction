#+begin_quote
  “To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.”

  The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.

  “Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen... It's not a very good time for me... I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see... from the President of ---”

  “That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.

  “But I really was rather hoping to speak ---”

  “We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.”

  “I... oh... very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Yes, I'll see Fudge.”

You have a group of people who can control minds and actions, become invisible, unleash fire that would put the California wildfires to shame, and can appear and disappear in an instant.

Look how effective terrorism is right now in America and Europe. A few bombings in the right places, a plane into a building, and you have massive panic and society changes. Wars started, discrimination on color/religion and horrible fears that an attack could happen again.

Now think of this about a million times worse. That is what wizards could be. Muggles would be shaking in their boots, as they wouldn't know who is compromised, where Wizards would appear next and what else they could do. Honestly, wizards would be almost unbeatable.

***** So... You gonna bomb London?

Most wizards live in secret communities within major muggle cities. Nuclear bombs become a weakness not a strength. A single wizard could apparate and launch nukes if they wanted... Or imperius those who have the ability to launch.

BTW, all those 'strengths' can be countered by magic. Shields block physical objects (bullets), tanks are big bulky and can be easily taken down by a wizard popping in. We have no idea if going invisible also hides every trace of someone including heat signatures.

I don't know how snipers would be useful if they don't know where wizards are.

Long story short, We have all this tools today and still can't stop terrorism... And these people don't even have magic. All it takes is a single wizard casting fire onto London and millions would die. A single wand is a powerful as a nuclear bomb.

What's more unbelievable is the fact muggles aren't already subservient to wizards. It's disbelievable that no one has not tried to take over the world using magical means or revealed them. One wizard could ruin everything.

Of course they can. Muggles can, so can wizards. Wizards can do everything Muggled can and they have a magic as a plus. They only need launch codes. If only there was magic to find that...oh wait.

You are barely correct. Barely. Yes, it is very difficult to control/master, but you don't have to. Fiendfire and apparate out. Or Fiendfire from your brooms while you are invisible. About the casting part, Crabbe easily casted it. And he is an inbred, stupid, incompatant moron. He learned to cast it within a year of Dark Magic being taught at Hogwarts. He couldn't master it, but if he fought a huge muggle army he wouldn't have to. Fiendfire, apparate. How will the muggles counter that?

It is difficult to brew, I'll give you that. It wasn't mass used in Wizarding Wars because if one side used it, both would. So you achieved nothing except having to constantly have your potions masters keep making them to make sure the other side doesn't have an advantage. It would devolve into a cold war. And your logic is strange. Why would it not be an advantage? Say you have 5 average wizards all drink it. 5 wizards that are now nigh-inhitable and can cast magic far better than ever before.

Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world? Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.

It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'.

However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. As for a one-to-one fight between a wizard and a muggle? A wizard would win. However, a muggle soldier vs an Auror? Aurors and Wizards are not trained to kill. Muggle soldiers are.

However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely. And I almost forgot another key factor - speed. Let's say Wizarding Britain and Wizarding Bulgaria decide to attack muggle France. Fudge sends a message by owl. The owl would take several days to travel to Bulgaria.

In comparison, Theresa May gives Putin a call. “Let's attack Wizarding France.” “Sure. “ Within 15 minutes, both sides would have already scrambled a squadron of fighter jets each. Within 4 hours, both countries would have a battalion-sized force ready.

Edit: Also, you don't need to see something to hit it. You can fire artillery by aiming at a "hole" in the map. And again, good luck hitting tactical nuclear warheads as they come at you at supersonic speeds. An ICBM warhead has a terminal velocity of several thousand meters per second. Good luck hitting that with a spell, nevermind multiple warheads carried by one missile. Also, you'd need to track down all missile submarines before they can launch, and again, good luck with that.

That's why it's completely stupid and total wizard wank if someone thinks they could be intercepted by some spells in the flight. The obvious counter to that are SSBNs. Good luck finding every single missile submarine with standing orders to launch should their country fall. Each is capable of turning earth into a nuclear wasteland. Especially the Russian Typhoons, which have the same displacement as a treaty battleship.

It's nearly impossible for the navies which do that for a living, nevermind wizards whose experts are too stupid to consider buying a book to answer the question "what are rubber ducks for".

Not at all. Wizarding Britan's economy is vastly diffrent to muggle one. They don't actually need it. I'll link my comment explaning their economy. Here you go:

#+begin_quote
  You are looking at the wizarding economy like a muggle. Muggles operate on supply and demand, but Wizards don't have to. They have infinite supply of most things. The currency is there for convienience. Sure you can transfigure yourself a pretty nice table, or you can give a shopowner who has better transfiguration skills a few sickles to do it for you. Very little things in Wizarding world have any real value. The textbooks and brooms and rarer potion materials are the only things I cam think off and that's only because duplicating them is not really gonna work long-run. You don't want your book to go bad in the middle of the year, or your broom failling you mid-match. For example of their purchasing power you could use book two. The Weaseleys managed to buy all of the school supplies(bar wands, of course) for 5 of their kids for only a single galleon.

  Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion.
#+end_quote

That may be the only fair point you have made this entire debate, and you stole that from someone else. Good job. And its only a fair point since we don't know much about how Goblins fight and their equipment. I could point out the Goblin Rebelion of 1612 against Wizards as proof of Goblin power, but I'm sure you're gonna ignore it either way.

#+begin_quote
  ragon? Send an armour battalion.
#+end_quote

First of all, that's not a thing. Simple Google Search will show you that Armour Battallion is an infantry unit used by the Norwegian Army. It does have some tanks, so I assume the person you stole this comment from meant tanks. Secondly that person appears to be incapable of actual logic. Tanks are very slow. Dragons are very fast. While the tank shell itself is rather fast it actually needs to aim and hit the Dragon. And said Dragon is capable of evasive maneuvers making the tank increadibly hard to aim and hit said Dragon. The Dragons are also increadibly powerful and tough. Some Dragons have scales as tough as steel. They are capable of easily lifting muggle ships. Their flames can melt stone in mere seconds and some boast quite the range for their flames. So it boils down to the fact that Tanks can't hit them, while Dragons can hit Tanks.

#+begin_quote
  Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion.
#+end_quote

Oh, I am sure that tank shells can penetrate all the wards. After all, Diagon Alley was destroyed in the WW2 bombings. Oh, wait! It wasn't. And nothing canonically suggests that they could be penetrated by tanks. Let's assume that they can, for the sake of the argument. The only way they can reach Diagon Alley with their tanks is via the Leaky Couldron. Which is protected by charms that make it invisible to muggles. In fact, they are not even aware that something exists there or anything at all. It's fairy hard to hit something you can't see or comprehend. That's assuming they even know the approximate location of Diagon Alley. What about Gringotts then? Surely it has non protection? What about Thief Downfall? The magic enchantment protecting them against any magical enchantments used by the enemy? That means that they do have magic to use. It could be similar to House Elves or Wizards simply wanted to protect Gringotts against thieves. Either way, it is very likely that they have similar, if not better, protections as Diagon Alley. By the way, how are tanks going to even reach Gringotts?

#+begin_quote
  Wizards might use memory charms etc to manipulate the leaders of the muggle world?
#+end_quote

I just love how much he seems to be ignoring canon. Or maybe he simply never read the books. Wizards already control the Prime Minister and have infiltrated Wizards within Muggle Government. Anything Wizards want to know about it, they can. If Muggles flee, Wizards will easily follow. After all not even the prime minister knew that some of the men he employed were Wizards. And you know what? Muggles have no way of figuring that out. And it's not simply the memory charm that Wizards could use for manipulation. I mentioned it in my last comment. Let me repeat the list as I can recall it. Memory Charm. False Memory charm for implanting false memories or modifying existing ones. Truth potions for truth. Confundus is basically a weak imperius. Imperius curse. Love potions to make the world leaders madly in love with your Wizarding leader. And that's only on the top of my head. I'm sure if I looked it up, I could find more spells for manipulation that do not involve torture. I could also list plenty of torture spells as well. Oh, wait, just remembered! Someone like Snape, Dumbledoor, Voldemort, Bellatrix, could also use legilimency if they wanted to know something or manipulate the muggles with their deepest fears. I said that in my last comment as well.

#+begin_quote
  Well, once the war begins, muggle leaders are going to be hiding in fortified bunkers with dozens of guards.
#+end_quote

If only the Wizards could use some spells to mind control the guards. Oh wait, they can. If only there were super quick and easy ways to kill them all. Of wait, The Unforgivables and fiendfire. I could list some more. And before you say that Unforgivables are super hard to cast or require you to be a dark wizard, consider this. Harry Potter easily used the Imperius Curse. Harry Potter easily used the Cruciatus when a death eater spat at his teacher. During the first Wizardinf War the Unforgivables were allowed to be used by Aurors and they did so with no great difficulty. I already explained the Fiendfire one in my last comment. If you need me to explain that again, feel free to ask. Let's continue. If only Wizards could somehow change their appearance to fool Muggle guards...oh wait. They can. Polyjuice, invisibility cloaks, disillusionment charm, Animagus, Human Transfiguration. Do I need to go on and on about why this is a stupid argument? An argument that you didn't even see fit to make yourself and instead stole from someone else.

  It would be a draw. In the initial stages, the wizards have the advantage since muggleborns know about muggles while muggles know nothin'.
#+end_quote

If only there was a department that constantly deals with Muggles...if only...Oh wait. There is. The Obliviators. They known about Muggles and they work fast. A couple of their feats:

Teams of Obliviators were involved in modifying the memories of Muggles who had seen giants uprooting trees in the West Country. Upon finding and modifying all of their memories, they thought it was a huge hurricane. Obliviators regularly have to perform Memory Charms on Muggles who have see the Loch Ness Monster. That means they have a way to quickly find any muggle who has seen said monster. A rogue Welsh Green dragon descended on a beach full of Muggle holidaymakers. Tilly Toke and her family happen to be there, and her family casts the largest Mass Memory Charm of this century on all the Muggles of Ilfracombe. The Muggles later remember nothing of the incident, with the exception of an old fellow known as Dodgy Dirk, who still claims that a “dirty great flying lizard” attacked him on the beach. People think he's crazy, of course. One family was good enough to wipe out the memory of *All* of Ilfracombe except one person. That's 11,183 Muggles, modified before the news of the Dragon could spread. 11 thousand. Obliviators are no joke. But, if only there was another department heavily involved in Muggles...Oh, wait. There is. Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Department. The Department that went into the Muggle World and made sure all of their objects were Magic-free. If only there was someone else who would know about muggles...Oh, wait. There is. Minister of Magic controls the Muggle Prime minister and hS wizards infiltrated within Muggle Government ranks. Nobody ever noticed anything wrong with them. Do I really need to go on?

#+begin_quote
  However, sooner or later, the muggles will get their hands on at least a few wizards.
#+end_quote

Please, do go on and tell me how.

Mind you, you are heavily overestimating Muggles and their efficiancy. Isis(an terrorist organisation originally created by the USA) was fighting with USA since 1999 until 2017. 18 years that the might of USA took to defeat a terrorist organisation, leagues weaker than USA. But sure they could totally defeat a community of people who can bend reality to their will(*SARCASM*)

#+begin_quote
  And we know, how efficient the CIA's torture methods are.
#+end_quote

Even if they did catch a couple of Wizards, other Wizards could very easily rescue them. Oh, btw, you know what would happen if Muggles tortured Wizards? An Obscurial. Couple of quotes about them.

#+begin_quote
  It's an unstable, uncontrollable dark force that busts out and attacks, and then vanishes An Obscurial may lose control when they reach their emotional and mental breaking point, releasing their Obscurus as an invisible (or nearly invisible) destructive wind. In extreme cases, they may physically transform into an Obscurus. When an Obscurial releases the Obscurus within, their eyes become pure white and their physical form vibrates and becomes distorted. While the Obscurus is invisible, the Obscurial can physically interact with the world without making physical contact, though the ability is uncontrolled and triggered by the host's distress, anger, or other intense emotions. This notably damages structures and objects near the host.
#+end_quote

It seems to me that capturing Wizards would do the CIA more bad than good.

#+begin_quote
  As the battle prolongs, the wizards lose their advantage of having superior knowledge. Many of the commenters here seem to have no idea how the military works. I'm currently serving and have seen first hand how scary an organised military can be. Attack Gringotts and Wizarding Britain falls. Goblin guards? Send an infantry battalion. Dragon? Send an armour battalion. Protective charms and wards? Send an artillery battalion. Boom. Gringotts is gone.

  However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find
#+end_quote

What survivors? Muggles couldn't even begin fighting them. But he is correct. Wizards would be impossible to find and battle. Hell, if they wanted to, they could hide their entire community under Fidelius. What would the muggles do then?

#+begin_quote
  As for a one-to-one fight between a wizard and a muggle? A wizard would win. H
#+end_quote

Agreed.

#+begin_quote
  However, a muggle soldier vs an Auror? Aurors and Wizards are not trained to kill. Muggle soldiers are.
#+end_quote

Not entirely accurate. Some Muggle Soldiers still just shoot blindly hoping to hit somebody because they can't will themselves to kill. And, Wizards can kill rather easily even if they are Untrained. Harry had no problem killing Quirrell. The order of the Pheonix encouraged killing their foes. Death Eaters had no problem with killing. Aurors had no problem with killing in the first Wizarding War. And lets assume he is right, he is not, Muggle has no choice but to kill. Wizard does. He can flee via portkey(love how you never adressed the portkey bombs) or apparation. They can easily knock out, paralize, or make the muggle unable to aim by cursing them to dance. I could make a huge list of things a wizard can do to defeat a muggle while not killing him. By the way, not all Muggles have wands, but all Wizards have wands. Hence, not all Muggles are armed, but all Wizards are.

#+begin_quote
  And muggle military personnel alone are probably superior in numbers compared to the entire wizarding world
#+end_quote

And that matters why exactly? In an hour, Wizards could easily reduce Muggle population by half or more. Apparate, Fiendfire, apparate out. Rinse and repeat. Or make the Muggle Governments nuke eachother. What else? Wizards could easily crash Muggle economy therefore disabiling the army and everything else. Muggles do need equipment while Wizards don't. They can dublicate all they need. Wizards could easily cut Muggles of electricity. Destroy all internet servers. Have the Governments use rockets to destroy the satellites. What would Muggles do then? No money, no electricity, no internet, no tv, no equipment, ect.

#+begin_quote
  However, if the wizards change to guerilla tactics, it would be nearly impossible to eradicate them. Invisibility cloaks, disillusion, muggle-repelling wards etc would make the survivors extremely hard to find. Hence, a draw seems most likely.

#+begin_quote
  And I almost forgot another key factor - speed. Let's say Wizarding Britain and Wizarding Bulgaria decide to attack muggle France. Fudge sends a message by owl. The owl would take several days to travel to Bulgaria.
#+end_quote

...did you forget that Wizards can teleport? Fudge could just floo over to Bulgaria in a second. Not that he'd need to. One Dark Wizard could easily destroy all of Muggle France. Hell, Muggle France is doing a great job at that by itself.

#+begin_quote
  In comparison, Theresa May gives Putin a call. “Let's attack Wizarding France.” “Sure. “ Within 15 minutes, both sides would have already scrambled a squadron of fighter jets each. Within 4 hours, both countries would have a battalion-sized force ready.
#+end_quote

In comparison, Fudge tells his forces to defeat Muggle France and in an hour its destroyed. They can easily destroy it economically or physically. Oh, btw, how exactly would Muggle forces attack or enter Muggle France? Please let me know. Because I don't think they can. Even if they did know it existed.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: Also, you don't need to see something to hit it. You can fire artillery by aiming at a "hole" in the map
#+end_quote

The charms will not make it look as a hole. It will make it look as something completely normal by Muggle standarts. Hogwarts, for example, has this protection.

#+begin_quote
  And again, good luck hitting tactical nuclear warheads as they come at you at supersonic speeds.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry, are you stupid? Do you really think Britan would nuke itself? Or that America would? And even if they did, which is moronic, Wizards easily lived through WW2 bombings, which involved the bombing of London. They easily survived with no damage, so we can logically assume they are protected from bombs.

#+begin_quote
  Also, you'd need to track down all missile submarines before they can launch, and again, good luck with that.
#+end_quote

I'm sure Wizards would have a big problem with this. It's not like they control the Muggle Government and could get the locations...Oh, wait. They do control it. And they can get the locations.

#+begin_quote
  That's why it's completely stupid and total wizard wank if someone thinks they could be intercepted by some spells in the flight. The obvious counter to that are SSBNs. Good luck finding every single missile submarine with standing orders to launch should their country fall. Each is capable of turning earth into a nuclear wasteland. Especially the Russian Typhoons, which have the same displacement as a treaty battleship.
#+end_quote

I already answered all of the parts of this up above.

#+begin_quote
  nevermind wizards whose experts are too stupid to consider buying a book to answer the question "what are rubber ducks for".
#+end_quote

This argument is so stupid. Sure Arthur is curious what are ruber ducks for. Are there books explaining that? No. The ruber ducks serve no purpose except to entertain you in bath. Or your dog. And even if there is a book on rubber ducks, he might not be actually curious enough to look for it and buy it. And Arthur was smart enough to figure out how his car and Sirius' bike worked and enchant them. He even added Nitro to Sirius' bike. I can be curious as to how cakes are made but I won't nececarelly go and look it up. I don't care all that much, just a simple curiousity. By your argument I'm stupid. That is one of the worst arguments you could have stated.

** The problem with that whole scenario is that you have two dark lords, over half a century, planning to enslave, kill or at least segregate and discriminate against the muggle born and then take over the World. By the time of the Boy Who Lived events, they would have run to their muggle government for protection, in exchange for intel, wards, counter measures and not a few highly trained MI5/MI6 agents.

When I read about the PM knowing about the Minister of Magic and hence magic itself (a surprise as I had only watched the movies) I though it was all beyond implausible. No different than the governments in the X-Men universe hunting down mutants "on principle", as if governments had any, instead of weaponizing them.

It is a point of the whole book series is that Wizards and Witches are superior to non-magical people and while dreaming about it each person imagines him/her-self as magical (better) one, not a muggle or a squib. If it wasn't the case, the Magical World wouldn't be so popular.
