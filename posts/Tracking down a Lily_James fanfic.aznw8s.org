Hi, I'm looking for a novel length Lily/James fanfic. Lily has a best friend (I think her name is May) and they are shy and quiet. They met the Marauders on the train in sixth or seventh year. Lily has a run in with Lucius Malfoy and I think she faints, James and the boys rescue her. I think Lily has something like a remembrall? The fic goes until they are graduated. Hopefully someone knows what I'm referring to! Thanks!
