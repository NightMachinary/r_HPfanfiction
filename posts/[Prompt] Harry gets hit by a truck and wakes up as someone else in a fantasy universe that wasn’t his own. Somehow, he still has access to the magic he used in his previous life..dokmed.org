** Harry woke up, not bounced against the kerb and up against the buildings close by, nor in St Mungo's, not even in a muggle hospital. Instead, he was on a hill. Quite a small hill, covered in close, very green turf. Next to his hill was another hill, and another, and another. On every hill, large rabbits were peacefully grazing, now and then pausing to scratch an ear, or to glance around. They didn't seem bothered by The Voice at all.\\
It was The Voice that had woken him up, he was sure. It went on and on, but it was getting more urgent. He stood up and thought he saw the source: a giant baby's head, floating in the air, surrounded by a corona of flame. In fact, he realised, the baby's head was silent. As the head moved towards the carefully manicured horizon, The Voice gained an edge that was actually painful.\\
"Time for Tubby Bye-Byes! Time for Tubby Bye-Byes!"\\
Harry could see a rounded building nearby, lit in the evening gloom. A sense of cold menace was creeping near.

"Time for Tubby Bye-Byes! Time for Tubby Bye-Byes!"\\
Harry grabbed his wand and made his way towards the building, lighting his wand as he went.

*** It would be freaky if the telletubbies were actually horrifying behind the scenes. I mean, what's up with those faces?

Surely, those are not their actual faces. You can hear them talk but their lips do not move in sync with their words. O_O

**** My sense is that most fics of this kind start with Harry going through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries. (His reasons for doing so vary.) I can't think of any specific ones off the top of my head, but this might give you a keyword to use in searches.

** I actually think there's a load of comedy potential in adding Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the cast of Isekai Quartet: at first, they think they've just wound up in Japan somehow, right up until they see Ains and realise that some shit has clearly gone down.

** so I was running through characters from fantasy settings that would go well with this prompt and then I thought 'hey, what if regardless of age the body ends up with is the same age as his original one' so here is what I want.

I want 14 year old harry to end up in Kili's 14 year old body that barely looks seven in human terms and having an existential crisis over it, and for him to very sadly try and fail to explain what happened to Kili's family, because as it turns out Kili has been joking around saying he is a wizard ever since Gandalf (or Tharkun as his Amad and Irak'adad call him) came by in one of his travels, however because of the change in body his magic too has been altered a bit and during this he makes accidental magic so now Kili's family think he was somehow blessed by Eru Iluvatar himself, hijinks ensue.

I don't even need the events from the hobbit to ever happen on the fic, just give me Harry's chaotic second childhood and him eventually forgetting his name was ever Harry as most of us forget events from our childhoods or just turn them into what we think are self made fantasies and games
