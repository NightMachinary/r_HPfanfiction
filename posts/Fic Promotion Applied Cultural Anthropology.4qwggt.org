So I'm halfway through this fic and I'm absolutely loving it. It's the first Hermione-centric fic I've read.

It's much more nuanced than most other fanfics - events are often less black-and-white than they seem. The author is excellent in capturing character interactions and personalities, and it really gives the story a life of its own.

While not without flaws - you might notice the occasional spelling error - I highly recommend this fic if you're looking for a (relatively) high-quality read, with a story that makes you /think/ more than most fanfics would.

As I haven't finished the fic, I don't have a final opinion on it - but give it a shot and see for yourself! linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology)


** I don't know what it is about this fic, but something about it just doesn't sit well with me. Maybe how it portrays Harry, Ron and Gryffindor in general. Or perhaps Snape who just seems off to me. I definitely don't like the route he went with Tom Riddle, but that's the kinda thing I have no problem overlooking. And third year, to me at least, is definitely of lower quality than first and second.

I do have to say that I love the approach being taken with Occlumency. That's definitely a big plus in my mind.

But don't let my opinion stop someone from reading this! It might just be a YMMV kinda thing going on. And it is leagues better than the only other Slytherin!Hermione fic I can think of (Green Girl).

As a sidenote: We see plenty of Gryffindor!Hermione, Ravenclaw!Hermione and a few Slytherin!Hermione. What about Hufflepuff!Hermione? Is that a thing?

**** Well, I don't read a ton of Hermione focused stuff, but she's a Ravenclaw in linkffn(Great Things by redfoxrabbit) which is a Harry raised by Ollivander story, where the children and 11 year olds actually feel like children and 11 year olds.

  When Harry was left on the Dursley's doorstep, Petunia quickly realised he couldn't stay. Where else to leave him but with the very person who'd first lured her sister into the magical world all those years ago? With a very different upbringing on Diagon Alley, it's not exactly the same Harry that arrives at Hogwarts ten years later.

**** There's no shortage of them, but most of them exist to facilitate a 'ship with a Ravenclaw!Harry, and those that have her develop in an interesting way or have any interactions with anyone but Harry are few and far between. (Heck, Robst's /Harry Crow/ has Hermione in Ravenclaw!)

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew) is probably my favorite Ravenclaw!Hermione fic at the moment.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

*** linkffn(Mudblood Mistress by JoseHood) series has a Slytherin!Hermione. It's not as good (IMO) as ACA, but it's much better than /Green Girl/.

linkffn(Brilliant Majic by LJ Summers) is another, and it's also quite a bit better than /Green Girl/, but I still get the sense that the author doesn't really want think about the non-romance aspects of the fic, and spends as little time thinking them through as possible, focusing instead on just banging out drama. For example, it doesn't look like the author can keep characters' relative skill levels straight, and often muddles the social dynamics that would result from Hermione matriculating a full year before Harry and Draco.

In general, it's very easy to find fics that have Hermione in Slytherin, but next to impossible to find fics that have a Slytherin Hermione, if you know what I mean. Most of the ones that have her sorted there use it mainly as a vehicle for a Dramione 'ship and tend to cop-out: Hermione suddenly discovers pureblood ancestry, Draco is inexplicably friendly and protective, Stations of Canon are followed even if they make no sense whatsoever, etc..
