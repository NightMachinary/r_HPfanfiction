“Lucius, how were you able to fail me again at capturing the family and killing the muggles?” asked the Dark Lord.

“I tried to, but my magic failed me. I feel like it is draining me piece by piece. Then when I came out of shock, the muggle man just knocked me out.” said Lucius.

“That is an excuse, how is that your magic didn't work on the man and girlfriend. And how did he overpower you?” asked the Dark Lord.

“I think that the muggle man said something about how there is no magic in this world. Also, we are not dealing with a normal man. He forced me to tell him about our plans. He is a crazy guy, who uses barbaric ways to get answers.” explained Lucius.

“Don't tell me you are afraid of a little muggle, Lucius?” asked the Dark Lord.

“You have no idea. The eyes of this man, these are the eyes of a man who is in pain. The eyes of a man who will kill anybody in order to protect the people he cared for.” explained Lucius.

“No matter, I will deal with what your punishment forever. For now, just leave my face. I will track Potter.” said The Dark Lord.

“Harry, Harry, wake up,” I said waking Harry up.

“Where are we?” asked Harry groggily.

“New York City, City that doesn't sleep,” I exclaim, “Harry, are you alright. It seemed like you have a nightmare?”

“He knows about what we are doing,” said Harry putting on his glasses.

“Well, at least we know one thing,” I said.

“And that is?” asked Harry.

“He will try to kill us, which gives us time before he finds the fountain. Now come on, your friends are waiting. We staying the night here. Also later on today, you, Hermione, Ron, and I are going to the library. I have a feeling that there is going to be a challenge that we are going to face when we reach the fountain.” I explain as Harry got out of the car and we started walking towards his friends.

But he stopped. He turned to me and asked, “Donnie, is it true?”

“Is what true?” I asked.

“What you said to Lucius, about how you have seen your friends getting killed. How you served the Iraq war. Was all that true or were you saying that to scare Mr. Malfoy?” asked Harry, with a bit of curiosity.

“Sadly yes. There is a medical term called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or other words, PTSD. I had experienced night terrors and seen ghosts of the people who died. The reason why I have a gun in the glove compartment is that I always want to know what would happen if I end it all. I blow my brains open. But then I think of my girlfriend.” I explain, tearing up.

“How do you deal with it?” asked Harry.

“Sex, drugs, and alcohol. But hopefully, if I survive this, then I can find better ways,” I replied, “Now come one, let not keep your friends waiting.”

Harry and I joined the others and we made our way to the hotel. Now, this hotel is like an Embassy Suite. I asked for three rooms close together and they delivered our suitcases there. Arthur and the rest of the Weasleys were so amazed at how things like elevators, TVs, and computers worked. When we got to our room, I told Katy to watch the rest of the Weasleys as I gave her my loaded rifle that was hiding in the suitcases. I then took the golden trio out of the hotel and into the library. The library itself was built back in the days when New York was still a Dutch colony. We entered the library and all of us started looking for books on the Fountain of youth, Juan Ponce De Leon, and early Florida. What felt like 4 hours became celebrated as Hermione found what we needed.

“Donnie, I think I found something,” said Hermione, “it says that in order to reach the fountain of youth, for whom thy person is, they must follow the path of God. In order to gain immortality, they have to pass four challenges. The first challenge is to kneel before the cross of God and the lord. The second challenge is to know thy name of the lord. The third challenge is to forgive thyself and therefore asked God for forgiveness. The fourth and last challenge is to believe in God's work and creation, for that is how the gift of immortality will be given.”

“What does that mean, who is this god, what lord?” asked Ron

“In the muggle world, there are a lot of groups of people who believed in a mystical being. They called them gods. These people believed that God is the creator of humanity and the world. This meant that De Leon did found the fountain, but something stopped him.” I explained.

“What are these challenges, though? Believe in God's work, follow the teachings of the Lord. It doesn't make sense,” said Ron.

“Actually it does Ron, the first challenge is simple in itself with kneeling before the cross of god and the lord. The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ is where one of us would need to kneel. Follow the teachings of the lord, is simple. The lord is Lord Jesus Christ, who is known for his charitable and good deeds. The third is to forgive yourself for sins that you have committed and asking God to forgive you. The last is believing in God and his miracles. It is pretty much-doing things from the bible which I don't think Voldemort is able to do.”

As I said this, black clouds started coming inside the library. Then 8 death eaters appeared pulling out their wands. The spells that they are doing are smaller ones, but deadly. The golden trio and I are hid behind a table. I took out my pistol and cocked it.

“You guys stay here,” I said as I got up. I shot the first one that was near me. I then ran up to the second death eater and wrestle his wand out of his hand. I hit my head against his head and he fell to the ground. I shot him in the head. Then I felt a hit. I got tied up. The rest of the death eaters started surrounding me. I pulled out my pocket knife and started cutting. As soon they covered me, I heard Hermione picking up the gun.

“Get the hell away from him!” yelled Hermione pointing the gun at one of the death eaters. The death eaters started laughing at her and I took this chance to jump on the nearest death eaters as they were starting to circling around the trio. I stabbed the death eater in the neck. I heard Hermione shooting the gun to a death eater. But she drops the gun as she fired it. The death eater is as dead as an armadillo on the side of the street. I picked up the gun and shot down two of the death eaters down. The other two death eaters had those eyes that you know that behind that mask is a crazy person. As they were going to cast a spell, I just pointed my gun at the death eater on the left and shot him. Then I aimed at the other death eaters and shot him down.

“I am so sorry, Donnie? I thought I could help you.” cried Hermione.

“Don't worry kid, you did good,” I said, “I just wonder how they knew where we were. Shit, we need to go back to the hotel. We need to see if your family and my girlfriend are safe.” I said.

The four of us ran out of the library towards the hotel.
