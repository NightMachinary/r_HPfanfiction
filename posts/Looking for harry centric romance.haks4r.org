Like the title says. I'm in a mood and hating the fact that I'm single and want to escape. So harry centric romance. No slash but pretty much everything goes beyond that. Smuty,fluffy, weird pairings whatever as long as love and caring are a big part of it. Preferably during hogwarts years cause post hogwarts always just feels weird to me but I'll take what I can get.
