Because it seems like wandless/accidental magic isn't considered "real" magic in canon. It's kinda silly that without a wand, nearly every wizard is useless/can't do jack. I want to see some subversions/aversions of this trope.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** My headcanon is that casting magic using the latin wand system (invented by the Romans, reason why Rome was so powerful, Rome collapsed after other groups started using wands too and Rome lost the advantage, later gave Europeans a massive advantage over natives when colonizing the Americas pre-statute) involves three parts:

-Incantation (or rather the arithmantically determined rythm, the words are just anything that fits the rythm)

-Wand movement pattern

-Intent/focus

Casting any spell usually requires proper incantation with the right rythm (leviOsa not leviosA) and the right movement pattern to shape the magic and you also need to focus on what you want to happen. With some advanced spells you really need to mean (unforgivables) it or you need to be in a particular state of mind (patronus).

Casting a spell silently requires vastly more focus to shape the magic. Casting without tracing the complicated movement pattern (allowing you to cast without moving the wand, much faster and easier to aim) also requires more focus to shape the magic. Both are eventually learned in upper years.

Now, in addition to allowing you to shape a spell through a movement pattern, the wand also acts as focus, concentrating the magic. Casting completely without the wand is possible, but requires even more focus and control over your magic than casting silently and motionless, and the result tends to be less powerful since the magic is less concentrated.

Since the result with a wand is almost always superior to without, everyone uses wands pretty much since they were invented. Powerful wizards still learn wandless casting out of academic curiosity and many fighters learn to at least perform a wandless "/accio/ wand", but that's about it...

Oh, and using wandless magic to stir your tea is a neat trick to show off. Tea stirring doesn't require much power anyway. And doing it passively while concentrating on reading Hawking is a neat exercise.

*** Yasss. I like to think purebloods do this much more. Draco just uses weak magic casually. He pulls a book from across the room, lights a candle just by touching it with his fingers, and very small stuff like that. Where magic is a very intrinsic part of their daily life.

This is mostly because I like the idea that purebloods are more magical that muggleborns or half-bloods. It makes the point of treating people equally even when they aren't equal which is better than "we're equal so treat us equally".

** Hmm. Blindness by AngelaStarCat /kind of/ fits?

Harry can't use a wand so he learns to feel/see magic differently. He eventually ends up using a staff as a focus, but magic in the fic is described as Harry uses it, meaning no wand.

I can't provide a direct link as it violates Rule 8, but look it up for yourself if you're interested.

** My fic has Harry being able to do wandless and non-verbal magic after the war due to him not having the Horcrux anymore. The idea is that the Horcrux was dampening his abilities.
