One of the things which always annoyed me the most about that battle (other than the atrocious tactics used by both sides) was that Harry didn't even try to take anyone with him. I mean, he's walking past Bellatrix and all the other Death Eaters under his perfect camouflage, and he does... Nothing with that opportunity.

Alternatively, have Harry hold a breech in the walls against overwhelming odds or something in a similar spirit.

Preferably with a resurrection. No m/m, no creature fics, no Death Eater revisionism.


** You will like this one. Not exactly what you wanted but pretty good.
