So I've reading HP fanfiction this past year, and I've noticed both from this subreddit and the stories that many characters are altered in the fanfics, because they are based in the movies, so our interpretations change a lot due to the actors.

What are the scenes that defined the characters in the books that didn't make it into the movies, resulting in different characters? (eg Snape =/= Alan Rickman).


** My biggest annoyance with the movies is that they made Hermione perfect. She's brave, fearless, smart and beatiful. There are several moments in the movies that went to Hermione but should have gone to Ron. That really hurt Rons character as now all he's left with are his flaws and he has almost no reedeming qualities. Whereas movie Hermione is a combination of book Hermione and book Ron in that she has Ron's Street Smarts (He grew up as a wizard so thinks like one) and his bravery (He was put into Gryffindor for a reason). I'm not saying Hermione can't be brave but, she has no flaws in the movies whilst in the book her main two were her appearance and her confidence both of which aren't problems in the movie.

Of the top of my head I can think of the devils snare incident in the 1st year. In the book Hermione gets incredibly flustered and doesn't remember to use her wand until Ron says so while in the movie Hermione is calm under pressure and doesn't need Ron's help. I believe she also got the "Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself" line but I haven't seen the movies in a while.

You could almost consider Ron a side character because of how many of his lines were stolen rather than a main character like Harry, Hermione, Voldemort and Malfoy.

**** But +Emma Watson+ Hermione was perfect.

Her line about logic in the deathly hallows just rubs me the wrong way, as does her attitude when she's right.

I dislike Megamatt's writing, but he had a one-shot saying how less confidence would have been better for the character, and I heavily agree with that.

**** I don't actually disagree but I can't finish the movies past Azkaban and still ship Harmony.

I wish they had recast everyone every movie. I think Rupert Grint turned out to be a kind of slapstick comedian and Ron doesn't really stay that way. Hermione should not be obviously better looking than Ginny. Harry shouldn't be short. There are probably other things.

They were all absolutely perfect in the first movie but drifted, and it would've been impossible not to.

** I don't think this really “defined” Hermione, but her dress during the Yule Ball was periwinkle and not lavender, like it was in the movies. It's a small detail but it kinda grates on me a bit. I also would've loved if movie!Ginny would have been a bit more like her book counterpart. She just falls a bit flat in the movies. Way more of a side character and a purposeful love interest for Harry rather than her own pretty damn cool witch.

*** My biggest frustration is that Hermione was supposed to be rather plain looking until Goblet of Fire. They should have kept the fluffy hair, over-the-top bookworm/teacher's pet attitude, and Hogwarts robes until the dress reveal in GoF, but instead they put Emma Watson in a pink muggle outfit, styled her hair, and started hinting at the girl power bit.

The dress reveal in GoF was supposed to showcase just how much the boys underappreciated/underestimated her, and how they considered her 'one of the boys' to the point of ignoring her, at times. It was also supposed to show just how much Hermione was growing as a person, as well. Instead, it ended up being, 'oh, Emma Watson is in a pretty outfit and going out with someone who's not Ron. Ok.'

*** Yep. And it really contributes to how many fans kind of view fanon as canon...the movies and particular fan fic tropes (which tend to be heavily sympathetic to Snape) try and excuse it as "he lost his temper, he only called her a name (even though it's the magical equivalent of the n-word)" based off the movies and you see it repeated a lot on reddit.

In the books, you have the flashback to where Lily confronts him for using mudblood numerous times before he called her one and for hanging out with bullies himself---essentially calling him a hypocrite for getting so upset with the Marauders. With the exception of the epilogue, the books make it more clear that Snape, while being a major figure in the war and quite courageous, was also a deeply terrible person and it's interesting how the movies really change it to make him a tragic anti-hero who isn't all that bad.

I also think the movie , where Snape begs Albus to save them all, sets a very different tone from the books where he only begs for Lily and Dumbledore tells him he's disgusted....along with the scene where he rips up a photo of Lily, James, and Harry and keeps the section with Lily.

I think they changed it so much because of Alan Rickman and because JK herself kind of ended up "romanticizing" Snape by the end.

** I don't read Snape fics, but I've seen a scene where he is mentioned having stood in front of transformed Remus in PoA. That, of course, makes him seem more sympathetic and even heroic. Sometimes lines from the movies appear in fics. Someone suggested that Remus's portrayal in the movies infleuenced the way he's written in fics, though I can't elaborate on this since I'm not familiar with his movie portrayal. Someone already mentioned the mudblood scar carving. I was confused when I saw it in a fic,and I thought it was author's own idea. Well haha, you wish! Nothing's original these days.I believe even Sirius's tattoos are from the movies, but women just can't resist using them. I don't know why, but I get very annoyed whenever I see the smallest movie detail in a fic. I've seen the mudblood carving used as a way to relate her to other character, so I suppose that's not the worst thing in the world. But still, it was just so dramatic when Hermione kept covering her armand using charms to hide it. I mean, PTSD nightmares are enough for me. And if it's all so dramatic, why not come up with something original instead of something from a movie adaptation. I also wonder if that scene where Remus talks to Hary about Lily had any influence on people thinking Remus in canon actually loved her.
