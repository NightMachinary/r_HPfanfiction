** Harry / Rowena isn't really done much, if at all. Very few fics that have both characters. I'm not aware of a long completed fic with the pairing.

The author started rewriting this one but only got 25k into it.. Linfffn(5563863)

This is Harry/Hogwarts and complete, a shorter fic. - linkffn(9444812)

*** Harry had never realised how delicate the castle walls really were over his years at Hogwarts, he felt like this had to happen.

Swiftly looking around to make sure no one was nearby, he found a hole in the wall.

“Finally... Perfect.”
