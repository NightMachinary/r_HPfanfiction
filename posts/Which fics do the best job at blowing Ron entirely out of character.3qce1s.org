Cos that's probably one of the worst tropes out of the lot, up there with Draco the Slytherin sex god. This one does a good job of both tropes.

****** Yeah. All the horrible things we hate about fanfiction are based in reality, they just don't stay there. Ron bashing comes from what he did in GoF and DH. The love potion stuff comes from Hermione and Ron acting OOC in HBP and Harry getting a crush of Ginny 'from nowhere'. /Good Draco/ comes from him not identifying them at Malfoy manor. /Good Snape/ is from him being against Voldemort and ignoring his actions. Molly bashing is from her love potion story, plus she's an overbearing mother. Manipulative Dumbledore is 'I knew I was condemning you to 10 years of blah blah blah', and the fact that PS looked at logically doesn't make sense. All of these things are true, they're canon. It doesn't mean Ron bashing isn't because his movie character sucks. After all Hermione in FF is hugely influenced by Emma Watson. Draco Malfoy is looked at with rose tinted glasses because Tom Felton is so attractive. Snape as well because of Alan Rickman.

The point is that the movies influence fanfiction a ton.

******* The amusing thing about Dumbledore's one is that the guy meant that Harry wouldn't be able to use magic when he talked about difficult years and all that. Because Dumbledore himself had weird experiences with his family so he isn't the sort of person who'd automatically be able to tell that the Dursleys don't like Harry. Though I do admit his track record is not really stellar, with anything.

Oh well, that's what we get when people who don't know anything about actually interpreting characters---nor about the culture and law in the time period that the wizarding world is placed in---do it.

****** Yes...but not really. What of significant value does Ron actually do? Book 1) He plays a good game of chess. Book 2) Nothing that any other random character could not have done. Book 3) He sleeps with, loses, and is angry for losing Wormtail. Book 4) He plays the part of estranged friend. Book 5) Again insert anyone else. Book 6) Dismissive of his friend's concerns (Malfoy). Book 7) Abandons friends again. Pulls Harry from the water which any decent person would do. Somehow uses a parseltongue word he heard once, never spoke, and remembered from 5 years previously.

This is obviously a simplified summary. While Ron does not deserve to be bashed in FF, he doesn't deserve any praise either. His character is more fleshed out than others because he gets more screen time. But he is nothing more or less than an average immature kid.

******** Half those things happened because none of the trio actually used their brains which was inside that lump that was located three feet above their ass. Granted, Hermione did use hers more often, so Harry relied on her much more, especially since Ron has proven unreliable at times. How he got into the chamber was a complete fluke, I think Rowling had an oh shit moment at that point. Hell, even Dumbledore knew Ron would tuck tail and run. Yes he came back, but most of his role in the scheme of things could have been filled by anyone. I don't particularly like Ron, but I understand what he represents, the everyday child. I mean what kid wouldn't want to deal that shit. Personally, as an adult, I blame both the idiotic children and the teachers who let them get away with it all. Letting children fight your war for you was a shitty plan. Ah well, just a book with flaws.

************** This is going to on for a while. While Harry and Hermione wore it equal amounts of times, Ron's situation is a little bit different. Mainly in that he's already carrying a boatload of stress from having no idea how his family is currently doing, believing once again that Hermione favours Harry to him and old negative thoughts are coming back like his own mother favouring Harry as well. Granted, Harry and Hermione are most likely just as stressed, but in a lot of cases like with Ron, having low self esteem is the easiest to exploit and one of the bigger weaknesses you can have.

***** I doubt that, I hated Ron long before I saw even the first movie, and his portrayal in the epilogue only cemented my negative opinion of him. I genuinely don't understand how any well adjusted adult can like him in the epilogue. He's still an immature entitled brat with no regards for others.

And your reply to [[/u/hchan1]] is overly simplistic. For example, the books have other hooks used to explain Draco being 'good' in fanficition. The amount of stress he's visibly under in sixth year, him wavering when at the final part of his task even though there are literally death eaters coming up with the very strong expectation of him doing it. He's been a jerk in the earlier books, but really, as soon as he was put in the position to do actual evil, he faltered pretty much every time in the sixth and seventh books.

I don't like dramione because of Tom Felton, I like it because I think good fanfiction about it makes a good romance story, which canon was sorely lacking.

I'll grant you Snape though, while I can see some redeeming him with just the books, [[https://youtu.be/xP06F0yynic?t=19s][Alan Rickman's voice]] is probably the main reason behind the genre of snamione. And frankly, I have no issues with that. Each time I read him saying things in the books, it's his voice I hear in my head.

*********** Sorry but HBP reads as if Rowling realized the characters weren't growing together the way she wanted, so she forced them. Which made for some uncomfortable reading regarding Harry's 'beast in his chest' which came out of nowhere. When it came to Hermione however she decided to make her go against her established character in a big way, as well as make her less mature than she had shown to be in previous books. I think people would have been a lot less upset if she had just made Ron mature instead.

As for 'not necessarily right', Hermione has shown to have a rather strong sense of morality she values above established rules. This is the case from book one on. She makes obvious mistakes (with the polyjuice and with the bluebell flames on Snape), but each time she breaks the rules, she clearly has a reason to feel morally superior about it.

The closest I can think of as a precedent is her punching Draco Malfoy. She was over two years younger then, which is a lot for a teenager, but it was the main other time she broke the rules based just on emotion. That was however at the end of an entire year of Draco and his father working to do things she was morally against, even though his actions stayed within the rules. Mclaggen makes a few bad remarks and she nearly instantly loses composure to the point where she actually uses magic against him despite having two more years to mature? It doesn't fit, even if she suddenly fancied Ron.

PS, since this is necessary on this sub: I am not advocating harmony, I never thought they would end up together in canon, never hoped for it, and it's not one of the main pairings I read in fanfiction.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

**** It depends on your approach. If you read it as a crackfic, it can be funny. Otherwise, it will seem rather heavy handed, yea.

** Ron often gets turned into an enemy so authors can introduce a new, "better" friend for Harry. Hermione often gets the same treatment, unless she's Harry's love interest. (In which case Ron sometimes is changed to serve as a cheap way to add some conflict to the relationship.)

** I recall a story I read where Ron became a death eater and gave up the location of all of his friends and his family, even joining in on the raid to catch as many as possible... While I really, really hate Ron, I don't see him purposefully going to the enemy and betraying all of them like that.
