:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The DOM creates a type of time turner and sends Hermione back to 1981 to tell her story to James, Sirius, Remus, Lily and Dumbledore to end the war sooner and save the Potters. She is to stay there and ends up with Sirius. There is a sequel to the story. Both are complete. IT IS NOT A RTB STORY!! The trio just made notes on the "important" parts and Harry also sent a note back to his parents. I cannot remember the name of the story but that is the gist of the story.

Please Help and thank you in advance.
