"Solar? Electric? Hydro? Steam? Nuclear? You're telling me that there's kinds of power other than magic? And muggles figured out how to use like a dozen of them? Wow!"

"Hey, these staircases move! And they move you up? That's... Surprisingly practical!"

"So you can get money from your bank account at any ATM you want and don't need to travel to the bank in London? But how can they access your vault from here?"

"There's PEOPLE on the MOON?"

"Just how big IS this library? It's as if there were a thousand times more muggle authors than magical ones!"

I've read the Christmas holiday scenes in Coven by naidhe and the entirety of Exile by bennybear, looking for more.

Well, it's sort of like, the ATM has Galleons, Sickles and Knuts stored in it. When you go to it, it...sort of, floos the bank to ask how much money you have in your vault. Then the ATM lets you take some money from it, and however much you take, it floos the bank to tell them, they take that exact amount from your vault, and later they refill the ATM with that money.

*** I would say that an ATM is like a mokeskin pouch that connects remotely to your vault, and only works on money.

Of course, we know that it's actually just transferring information, and the cash is stored locally. But that's just an implementation detail. The effect is that the person who deposits money can retrieve it, and no one else can.

***** *AltaVista*

AltaVista was a Web search engine established in 1995. It became one of the most-used early search engines, but lost ground to Google and was purchased by Yahoo! in 2003, which retained the brand, but based all AltaVista searches on its own search engine. On July 8, 2013, the service was shut down by Yahoo!

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

** In linkffn(Exile by bennybear) Draco gets sentenced to live without magic for a while and ends up running away into the muggle world. It's a good take on a clueless wizard having to figure out how the muggle world works while learning that muggles have accomplished a lot.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

Yeah, but apart from Photovoltaic, all the current forms of power generation are just different ways to heat water into steam to make a steam turbine move. Also --technically-- the earliest prototype steam turbine was built some time in the 1st century; so it's really not that new.
