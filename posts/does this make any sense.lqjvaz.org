They are able to literally grow bones back from nothing but can't fix Harry's eyesight so he doesn't need glasses.

Wizards don't understand things like phones, muggle clothes, or muggle money. ...

They don't listen to any muggle music. ..

That none of the kids in Harry's first year knew about the sorting *hat*..


** 1) eyes are very complex... Bones are easy, eyes are spooky... Maybe it's just difficult.

2) I mean, I know absolutely nothing of middle eastern culture, clothing or currency (for example). If wizards wanted to know they could learn fairly easily but if they're not coming into contact with it then why should they know?

3) same argument for music. I don't know any rap.

4) With the last thing, I like the idea that it's just an unspoken law to keep the Sorting Hat a secret from first years. Like Santa.

Though realistically, all the first years knew about the sorting hat apart from Muggleborns (and Harry) and Ron who grew up with older brothers who of course would take the piss out of him at every opportunity because God knows I do that with my younger brothers.

*** I'm pretty sure it was at least implied that none of the first years knew about the Hat. I think that readers think about the Hat a lot more than most characters do, mostly because of the Sword of Gryffindor. As far as pretty much every character is concerned, the Hat is just some thing that comes out once a year to do some sorting. No one talks about it because it's not that interesting to begin with, so keeping it a secret from incoming first years isn't exactly hard to do. Though I am surprised that it apparently isn't mentioned in /Hogwarts: A History/.

*** For the last one, it's kind of implied to be a type of hazing ritual played on those going to Hogwarts for the first time by everyone else. Though I do suspect that some families, like the Malfoys, view such things as beneath them, and would tell their kids how they get assigned their Hogwarts House up front.

For all we know, healing magic might rely on the body's own view on how it should be 'whole', and given that Harry's poor eyesight might be an inherited trait (iirc James needed glasses from a young age, too), and thus to some degree determined by his very own DNA, any healing magic would act as if his poor eyesight is how it should be. I even had a crackfic idea that involved Harry practically bankrupting himself through repeated LASIK eye surgeries being performed on him that get undone any time he winds up in the Hospital Wing.

** I don't recall anyone actually discussing the possibility or impossibility of fixing Harry's eyes. Perhaps that lack of a discussion is surprising enough in itself.
