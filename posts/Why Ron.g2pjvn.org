Warning for profanity!!! (Sorry mods but this really grinds my gears, however I'm swearing in a professional manner. I'm very passionate about Ron Weasley, one of my favourite written characters ever)

Fuck every single one of you that believes in Ron bashing!

Fuck you and all of your relatives!

Do you know why????

Becuase I cant go with out one FUCKING day without someone in this community talking about how Ron was a "TeRrIbLe" friend.

Well I'm sorry you wouldnt care for your family while your on the run from a government controlled by a terrorist and is best friends with the most wanted person in the country. Whole of course wearing a soul leeching, emotion twisting dark magical locket.

Everyone would act the same way Ron would. And don't try to lie.

Honestly, you call him selfish yet turn a blind eye to Hermione who in Book 6 did a fucking temper tantrum at 17 no less!

"But but her HeArT WaS BrOkEn By ThE BaD FrIeNd RoN"

No!

Just becuase he went out with Lavender makes it Hermiones fault, she liked one of her best friends and did not think about telling Harry, her other best friend!

"BUt HeRmIoNe Is SoCiAlLy AwKwArD" So am I and I tell my friends important things! I dont hide like a fucking coward and throw a tantrum, especially from the fact she's a Gryffindor!

Stop milking the ever lasting fuck out of Hermione Granger, I swear down the lot you are pedophiles at this rate with the amount of worshiping you do to Hermione in 4th and 5th year.

And to my next point, Ron isnt a racist towards Slytherins.

In the books, the lines were said by Hagrid warning Harry about Slytherin, but in the movies unfortunately Ron says it as well.

I cant tell any point in cannon where Ron refers to a Slytherin other Draco as a "Slimy git" so him irrationally hating Slytherin makes no sense.

And finally Ron isn't jealous of Harry.

Harry canonically isnt rich, that's why he has a job as an auror you know. There is no mention of a larger vault for Harry, so why is Ron jealous.

4th year?

Everyone has had fights with their best friend, myself and literally every human included.

"Oh But HaRrY WaS iN DaNgEr"

So is everyone in the fucking planet currently, at any point we could be stabbed to death, or robbed. Or any other heinous crime could literally happen, Harry is always in danger. And by extension Ron.

Harry was a fucking prick in 4th year, "I didnt put meh name in the Goblet of fyre" Shut the fuck up Harry!

I'm a fan of deny, deny, deny when I'm trying not to be caught in trouble. You know, your in a school full of children who get into trouble daily. And they lie to get out of trouble. So you know, of course your class mates arent gonna believe you.

Honestly I just hate people making excuses for Ron bashing.

"Ahem personally Ron wouldnt be my friend if i was Harry"

Theres problem. Your not Harry Potter. Nobody asked.

So stop writing wish fulfillment becuase you clearly have issues with your friends if your writing Ron bashing as a human.

But you know I can already tell the comments.

"Ron is still a bad friend in my opinion and Harry should have ditched him to be friends with Hermione more."

Or

"Ron should never have been Harry's friend, if I was there I would have turned him down. He isnt very nice either and made Hermione cry"

In England, especially in secondary school which Hogwarts is fucking literally based of you always have people trash talking. Its school, I fucking hit people's feelings all the time as a kid and many others did back to me. It's the charm.

Its school life.

Hell I met my best friend after I punched him when he talked shit about me.

Ron is the best friend Harry could have ever gotten. If you dont believe so than your delusional and are clearly not human as humans male mistakes and learn from them, we adapt and grow. And we are far from perfect lives and make many many mistakes.

Ron is simply the best written and least understood character in HP.

Fight me.

A huge part of this is Ron's place in the narrative is as 'Unwavering Friend". Hermione's is not.

And a large part of the flack Ron gets is because he is used as a narrative tool for showing Harry having social issues. This isn't a problem in any one book, but the HP books are.... honestly better stand-alone than in a series. Much like a beloved serial television drama, there is a strong 'status quo is god' and rehashing of the same bits of character development over the different books. This makes it seem like Ron is a fickle friend.

As was already mentioned, the jealously bit is usually about fame an attention. Of which Ron is undeniably having a jealously issue.

JK was shit at economics, so any economic conflicts are not really fleshed out. If a fic puts more time into justifying 'poor Ron rich Malfloy' into the storyline, you'd expect there to be some changes to how it is handled?

First off, wtf? Objecting to getting pulled into a mandatory death sport is not a bad thing. If anything, Harry should have pushed back waaaay more. And his friends should have supported him in that?

Also, your school life seems like it had serious, serious problems.

Harry is a reader-insert character, written to have people imagine themselves in his shoes. People doing so and then objecting to parts they would not fit is literally the driver of a good chunk of fanfiction.

You think... altering the characters personalities is with fulfillment? On my sweet, sweet summer child...

I mean, people view how education should go differently from you?

To be fair, I can't really imagine school with my parents as non-involved as they would be for a boarding school situation. But there are a lot of things about Hogwarts I would find entirely unacceptable. The unaddressed bullying is one of them. As well as the shitty curriculum.

** No, at the beginning of the series Harry isn't rich, but he's clearly wealthy and upper middle class. By the end, between his own wealth and the Sirius' wealth/richness he should be rich. But that's besides the point as Ron isn't jealous of Harry's wealth, he's jealous of the attention he gets.

Ron wasn't a simple classmate. Ron was the best friend who had Harry pegged as a liar before Harry even entered the room. He then went on to refuse to speak to Harry for almost a month. Note: there are no more than 3 days between Harry hitting Ron with the badge and the 1st task.

We, and Ron, are also not being targeted in the same way Harry was, so that's a strawman. Even in DH Ron could have gone to Hogwarts and been no more worse off than any other pureblood.

In HBP, Hermione was wrong/abusive to attack him and that has been said many times in this sub. What hasn't been said that much is that Ron shouldn't have gone out with a girl because the one he liked kissed a boy two years prior. That makes him an asshole, /too/.

I mostly like Ron as a character and I'm glad the bashing isn't as tolerated as it was, but this 180 to absolving him and/or making someone else a partly at fault for his awful moments is annoying.

*** *Sees best friend come into dorm room with gryffindor banner draped over him from 30 minute party*

*Asks politely how best friend put said name into cup*

*Gets miffed when best friend snaps back at him*

*Gets into argument as 14 year olds do*

Man, I'd peg someone as a liar if they walked in with a banner draped over them after they've seemingly been partying for 30 minutes.

Edit: To clarify as it seems it might be mistaken, the asterisks are from Ron's perspective and the best friend is Harry.

**** Missing the part where Harry tells him he didn't put his name in the goblet and Ron calls him a liar. That's the reason the best friend gets miffed.

And as I said Ron had him pegged as a liar /before/ entering the room.

***** I'm a little confused? I think it's impossible to prove whether Ron had him pegged as a liar before or as he entered the room but I'm not sure it matters much. Harry had come from a loud party after half an hour with a banner tied around his neck. His first words to Ron are "Where've you been" and Ron even answers with a hello and congratulations. When Ron asks why someone would have put Harry's name in (instead of calling him a liar btw), Harry says "I dunno". Ron didn't even get mad, he was more hurt that Harry seemed to have found a way separately without involving Ron, until Harry snapped.

​

Frankly, even if Ron had him pegged as a liar before entering the room because Harry had just spent 30 minutes at a very loud party, it'd be kind of understandable because Harry had previously expressed excitement over the tournament, dreamed about winning it even.

Edit: Ah I see what you meant by missing the part now. The asterisks were all from Ron's perspective. Ron was miffed when Harry snapped first. The best friend was Harry.

It's implied in text that Ron is forcing politeness and smiles.

Right, he calls him liar.

The point I was making is that Ron was being a passive aggressive asshole and he shouldn't be absolved of that simply because he was hurt.

******* Ah, then I believe our opinions differ because I believe Ron should be absolved because of Ron genuinely believing that Harry had betrayed him by finding a way to enter the competition without him and yet still acted politely whereas you believe that though Ron felt betrayed and hurt, he had no right to act skeptical of his friend or act as if he was alright.

** I've said this before, the issue that most fan-fics seem to be dealing with with Ron is actually a Harry-centric issue, rather than a Ron-centric issue.

*Many* of the ways fanfic authors might try to change that clash with the role Ron plays in the story.

For example, one of the common points that gets changed is how Harry.. imprints on some of his 'wizarding firsts'. Harry seems to put a premium on Hagrid as the one who introduced him to the Wizarding world, Hogwarts as the Wizarding school, and Ron as his first Wizarding friend. As this is portrayed as a 'attaching to things as a way to get away from from abuse', it can be kind of creepy and authors that want their protagonist to take a more critical eye to the wizarding world (even if set in later years) this can be unwanted baggage.

Canon Harry isn't really intellectual, curious, or driven. Nor is he social, outgoing, or gregarious. If taking him in either direction, Ron is a very convenient fall guy for it.

** "And suddenly we have fallen into a foreign tongue."

I don't agree with your language, but I definitely agree with the spirit of your rant. All of it is spot on. Ron's grandmother was a Slytherin, so I'm very doubtful he would be all "YOu sLImY SnaKE!" to any Slytherin who isn't shown to hang out with Draco or Pansy considering his granny had been sorted there.

No, no, no. I'm talking about the comments here I'm this subreddit, in the H/HR subreddit while I'm trying to find fics to read.

Sly comments that make no sense, and the replies more.

But obviously I'm immature ;)

**** I understand having a stance on an issue and being vehement about it. I, myself absolutely hate Drarry, Dramione and any other pairing that involves Draco. Or when Snape is portrayed as anything other than the sad, pathetic man (With the exception of To Shape and Change). Or when peoe say Cursed Child is canon. It often feels like people jump on a bandwagon even though it's missing a wheel and is about crash into a burning orphanage full of experimental fireworks. But I can't just rant about how anyone that has opened the screenplay can tell that it is, at best, bad fanfiction.

What really gets me is the vulgarity. It's one thing to rant, but would be entirely different if I were to go overboard when pointing out that a death eater with a f**/ng super time turner would have already used it. I mean we've seen A Very Potter Sequel, sure, Death Eaters are f/*/ng idiots, but you'd think they would at least be able to decide to go back without an explicit order from no nose. Hell, they might even get a silver f/***ng hand out of it after being tortured for showing any brains. Which leads me to...

That got away from me... Buy my point is sometimes, the most idiotic things are in (And I use this term lightly) canon and it's no good getting too worked up over it.
