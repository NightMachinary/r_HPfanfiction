Any good recommendations? I trawled through Reddit and as always search sucks. Google isn't any use for searching Reddit like this either, some element on the page always makes Google think that 4 year old threads have updated in the last 3 days. I've trawled through AO3 several times and nothing catches my eye, and at this point I just don't feel like trying to use FFN to try to find something new.

I'm willing to read any fem!Harry, no matter the ship or whether it's trans!Harry. Only requirement be that it's actually good, I'm sick of seeing her paired with some Death Eater without an appropriate justification. And no, making James and Lily neglectful of her so that they can raise Alex/Jim/whatever Potter as the Hero of the Light doesn't count. Nor does any kind of bashing really. Unfortunately even regular gen fics aren't often good, though they're a rare breed as Tomarry and Drarry fics are a dime a dozen.


** It's not new, but all of my completed stories are FemHarry. They are also femslash, which may nor may not be a problem for you. I'll toss out a link in case you haven't seen it:

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

  If Ochako had to choose anyone to be psychically connected to as a result of an unfortunate quirk, Bakugou is about the last person she would choose. Really, the only people who she'd hate being linked to more are Deku, who broke her heart last year, or Minetta for obvious reasons. Naturally, that means that while she was in a fight with some evil child-killing bastards after a long day of saving lives, it had to be him the villain tied to her mind. They say two minds are better than one, but Ochako doesn't think they meant it for this particular context.

*** I can take Drarry, as long as it's actually good and justified. 99% of Drarry is not. I think linkffn(Girl in the War by astridfire) is a good Drarry fic, though it's been a while since I read, but I did have positive impressions of it. The Pureblood Pretense is a series I'd be happy to see a Drarry ship, but I don't think that's happening and I think Leo's the favoured one. A couple of other Drarry fics here and there that are good. Not quite Drarry but rather fem!Potter-Twin/Draco, linkffn(Green Eyed Monster by sphinxs-legend) is also pretty good.

***** I also liked Girl in the War, it's shame it was not finished.

My two favourite fem!Harry (both are Drarry):

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/169903016-the-girl-who-lived-draco-malfoy-x-fem-harry][The Girl Who Live]]d, which is very well written, the characterisation of Draco is close to the original imo.

If you like fluff, you should check out linkffn(Songs of Yesterday) . It has a somewhat OC Draco, but the quality is still fairly good. It also has a sequel.

** I wrote about it on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/cepls-introduction-to-femharrys.html][my blog]], but the conclusion is that there are some stories I recommend for reading, but nothing which I would *really* like. PG-13 version of linkao3(4876630) could be pretty close, or who knows what will develop from “A Different Persperctive” suggested elsewhere in this thread, it is still too early to judge. Perhaps, linkao3(Tea Cures All Ills by delizabethl22), but it is too long and too unfinished.
