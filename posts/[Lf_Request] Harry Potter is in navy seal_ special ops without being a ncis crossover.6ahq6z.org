** There's [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] which is an AU where there is no magic and "Harworts" is a school for super-spies.

It's /extremely/ well written and the "Dumbledore"(I forget what his actual name is in this fic but) is particularly amazingly characterized. Its only flaw is that it sticks a little too close to canon- I know that sounds ridiculous considering the premise, but basically it chugs along analogues of what happens in canon instead of going in a totally different direction. It starts moving away from canon after around fourth year.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
