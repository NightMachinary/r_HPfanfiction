:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a fanfic I'm looking for but can't remember the name of. Basically Harry disappears after the final battle and Hermione and most of their class look for him. Harry comes back 6 months later to visit his parents graves before leaving forever, but Hermione is there to stop him from leaving.

If anyone knows the name of this fic, or can link it, that would be awesome.

Thanks guys.

  It's Halloween. The night is clear, the moon is bright, and a witch waits patiently in the graveyard. Harry Potter's been on the run for six months, and that ends tonight. H/Hr

Where did you read this? What was the rating? How long do you remember it being (word count ballpark)? Any other prominent characters? Any kind of keywords?
