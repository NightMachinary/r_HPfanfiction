I'm getting into the last book of my long series now, and I'm approaching the Second War - it's exciting for me 'cause I'm doing a few different things with it, making Voldemort colder and a bit less insane, necessitating Death Eaters having to die, et cetera, et cetera.

I was going to write a post asking about war strategy, and then I realized that isn't /actually/ the thing I'm having difficulty visualizing - there are lots of ways Voldemort can work out power over Magical Britain and engender a conquering of it, as it were.

But what next?

Voldemort wants power, most of all. He wants to kill Albus Dumbledore and kill Harry Potter - two threats to his prestige - and he wants to gather up any really special artifacts and surround himself with these elements of historical importance. He wants the unwavering loyalty of his followers, but seemingly out of pride rather than an actual care for how he's viewed. Voldemort wants to control Magical Britain, and seems to enjoy torturing and killing people - under his regime, Purebloods are given the bulk of power and people are allowed to run with blood supremacy as a leading ideology, although Voldemort likely doesn't have any /particular/ belief in that ideology himself.

But after the war is through, I guess I just don't see what Voldemort really envisages, or what he /wants./

Alongside the apparent belief in blood supremacy, for example, he also seems to reach out and connect with magical creatures such as giants and werewolves (lead by Greyback they would be "creatures" more than "people"). Is the point of this encouraging these groups to polarize and bind together? Perhaps with the long-term ideal that these groups will be afforded their own separate privileges so long as they remain separate from Pureblood wizardkind, and let everything stay "pure" in separate streams?

It's all very well to think to oneself that Voldemort wants power, but what's he meant to do with it once he has it? How would he run the wizarding world? Would he really want to? If Voldemort is in the Minister's seat and looking over the wizarding world, does he really care about infrastructure or taxes or education?

Does he just want the prestige of an entire country fearing him? If that's the case, what does he do with his time? If he hands off control of the Ministry to somebody else and establishes himself as a sort of monarch with the deciding vote but no active involvement, what does he do with his days? Torture Muggles?

Surely you'd run out eventually?

As I see it, there are a few potential goals:

- To move from conquering wizarding Britain to conquering wizarding everywhere else. Voldemort turns his whole life into a game of Risk.
- Conquering Britain is just a means to an end.
- Voldemort genuinely /does/ want to rule wizarding Britain and has an actual plan in mind.

Or maybe he wants to do something else entirely? Does anyone have any clear thoughts on like, what precisely Voldemort's idea would be after the war is over, whether all of his enemies are dead or just no longer fighting back?


** I don't really see Voldemort's desire for power as a separate goal to his desire for immortality. Because the thing is, even after you have achieved immortality (as Voldemort did), you still face the problem of external threats. The only way to be truly immortal is to have ultimate power. Only then can you be sure that no one else will be able to unravel your safeguards.

So I don't think Voldemort wants power for any particular end. He wants power for power's own sake, because anything less than absolute power is a form of insecurity/weakness.

I do think Voldemort genuinely does believe in blood purity, in his own twisted hypocritical way, but that this is a secondary goal to his own self-advancement. The icing on the cake, as it were.

I see Voldemort's ultimate aim as godhood - completely shedding all humanity and ruling as an immortal entity.

One avenue I have considered for this relates to Ministry powers. We see hints at points in the books that magic can be bolstered by positions of authority: consider, for example, that Snape in PoA incorporated his position as Potions Master of Hogwarts into an incantation, apparently in the belief that it would make for a more powerful spell. This theme can be extended to the Ministry itself, which of course is the authority over magical Britain. The Ministry seems to have a number of powers that groups of individuals cannot mimic: the Trace, the Taboo, and an extremely powerful ability to pierce magical protections (Death Eaters were unable to gain access to the Burrow, but then the moment they gained control of the Ministry, they were able to enter the Burrow with ease).

With these "authority powers" established as an element of the world, my take on Voldemort's goal in the long run is that he wants to become the magically recognized authority over Britain, and thereby absorb the Ministry's powers into himself. At that point you might very well consider him godlike, at least locally with respect to Britain. The even longer term goal is to replicate this over other magical nations, until he is the god-king of all the Earth.

At that time I see him tearing down the statute of secrecy, destroying Muggle civilisation to regress Muggles to a medieval level of technology, and ruling over the Earth for all eternity in an static society in which pureblood wizards openly rule over Muggles.

** There was an extremely good character analysis of Voldemort on this subreddit arguing that what Voldemort wants, in the end, is to prove himself the greatest sorcerer of all time. He wants to be admired and respected as the best at wizardry, and sees ultimate power over everyone as the best way to achieve this. I don't fully agree with it but it was /very/ well-thought-out.

What Voldemort wants first and foremost, for me, is to live forever and unhindered. Also, for me, he doesn't give a damn about blood purity --- it's only a way to manipulate the purebloods into doing his bidding. In the short term, after winning, he'd reorganize the government of magical Britain, centering it on himself. Maybe he'd have some jolly good fun playing god-emperor for a few decades. Then he'd get bored, but at this point, he could start forgetting his "blood purity" fa√ßade, secure in his unquestioned position of power.

He'd gather up his strengths to conquer the rest of the world, or at least a sizable enough proportion thereof that the ICW isn't so much of a threat to him anymore --- enough that he can finally get rid of that pesky Statute of Secrecy. He'd hope, within a century or two, five tops, to be in charge of Planet Earth. After some more decades having fun ruling it, he'd get bored again, probably try to destroy the Himalayas for kicks, succeed, and retire for a while. During this time he may work on breaking other laws of magic to prove his worth, now that he knows how to cheat death and subvert prophecy. He may try to Transfigure edible food or bring someone truly /back/ from the dead by improving the Resurrection Stone.

Whether or not he succeeded in these scholarly pursuits, he'd come back years later burning for more conquest and would try harnessing muggles' knowledge, and combining it with magic to establish Voldemortian settlements throughout the Solar System and possibly beyond.

Beyond that... well, we're past the millenium mark at this point, so I don't suppose he planned farther ahead.

*** I agree that he's a dog chasing a car, and that he wouldn't know what to do with it if he caught it. But I doubt that he's the scholarly type that would personally work hard in order to push the boundaries of what magic can achieve. And personally mixing muggle and magic to achieve space travel? No way. Maybe he'd force the best and brightest of the planet to invent space travel, but he would personally do so.

** It's an interesting thought. Personally I always compared him to Alexander The Great. Both liked... no /craved/ conquest and defeating their enemies and would put everything on hold just to defeat their arch nemesis. (Harry for Voldemort and Darius for Alexander)

And ultimately neither actually cared much for ruling what they had taken, delegating it to their subordinates. I believe its that sort of megalomania that drove Voldemort. And no he wouldn't stop with just England.

The reason he allied with the Giants and the Werewolfs was for no other reason than to use them on the front line and then throw them away. Hence why Greyback didn't receive a mark and was delegated the somewhat dangerous task of hunting down resistance members and face possible ambushes with the bait being the Taboo.

** In the Harry Potter universe, the odds are so stacked against the authorities and in favour of a competent, malicious minority it's unreal. Voldemort and his followers can appear /anywhere/, wreak havoc and mass murder and disappear again in an instant. We see so many magical powers that can be used to commit crimes, and so few that can be used to detect and stop them. When you think about it, Voldemort should have totally snuffed out any resistance and utterly subdued the British Wizarding World in about a week. Muggle Britain should have been a mere afterthought. The only real threat to Voldemort in my mind is the ICW.

*** Not... really? The government has access to just as many broken tools to fight back against any organized rebellion (mind control, truth potions, etc). The only reason Voldemort's guerrilla revolution wasn't immediately snuffed out was due to a combination of corruption and incompetence. Apparently Veritaserum is perfectly ok to use on schoolchildren, but not on enemy combatants who are all but confirmed as mass murderers.

**** The government can't catch bad guys to use stuff like truth potions on them, because the bad guys can operate from a hidden base and teleport in an untraceable manner wherever they want at will. The Ministry and Aurors, as far as we've seen, are basically employing Muggle methods of crime prevention with a little bit of magic on top - whereas any Death Eater who can Apparate and use the Killing Curse can do so much, so easily. Throw in stuff like the Polyjuice Potion, so infinite disguises...

The Ministry's only real option is infiltrating Voldemort's camp, a phenomenally difficult undertaking.

**** Heh, yea. This actually came out of my idea of 'Have Hermione ask Snape the OP's Question'. Basically, how the hell is there enough support for the straw-man ideas put forward in the book?

Have it set up for him to do a complete bioshock, would you kindly, as he destroys his soul and violates his own principals in order to keep his organization going.

I actually have the entire world scoped out and I think it works, but I'm working on how to reveal it in the story. If you want, I can type of a summary XD

(The goal was to paint less black vs. white world, and doing so by having Hermione confront Snape. It isn't really muggleborn rights, more of a 'separate-but-equal', well all the complete mess that phrase implies. It wasn't to make them good, but to make them less evil than a bunch of genocidal freaks)

***** I remember reading a story where riddle asked why blood mattered in 2nd year of Hogwarts. He disagreed with the answer but by 3rd year knew he couldnt fix it without being the best. But he heard/saw Dumbledore teaching someone. And he saw that he couldn't be dumbledore. He couldnt see how in this life time he could. At the same time he was obsessed with his heritage and in 5th year found the Chamber. He eventually decides immortality is the only way thus horcruxes which shift his mind towards sociopathic tendencies

** Here's my theory:

Voldemort does not actually care about blood purity (he's a half blood and he knows it) or wizard politics, only power and revenge. The blood purist faction was simply easy to manipulate to achieve his goals and had a ready source of monetary assets and arcane magical knowledge to draw from. He despises being weak and will do everything he can to secure power and ease his fear of death and enhance his sense of superiority and security. He also feels he's special and better than everyone because of his talent. He was also simply angry at the wizarding and muggle establishment for how he was treated and simply wanted to lash out, which is another reason he chose to pit the opposing old families against each other rather than rally the muggleborn. Opening the CoS and attacking muggleborn was one of his opening moves used to incite the latent conflict that he would use to manipulate his chosen power base. His ultimate goal was to force all of magical Britain to choose sides while tricking them into killing themselves off by prolonging the war before massacring his own followers, eliminating the competition (Albus and the Prophecy Child), and usurping control of what remained, thus creating a society free of the blood-purist bigotry he was subjected to as a teen while securing himself a position of ultimate power and wealth. However, due to the damage to his sanity caused by his horcruxes, he has gotten far more invested in the whole ‚Äòevil dark lord' act than he intended causing him to risk his grand-plan in favor of satisfying his increasingly worsening anger issues; not to mention he never really expected his death eaters to so handily win their war.

** I've always felt that deep inside, Voldemort is just a scared and angry boy in an orphanage. He doesn't want to be bullied so he becomes the bully. He uses power and fear to rule others so that he doesn't have to be afraid. Then Dumbledore comes along and with a wave of a stick lights all of his belongings on fire. The way the memory describes his reaction makes me feel that Tom was afraid. He had no power or control in the situation and could have done absolutely nothing to stop Dumbledore if he hadn't extinguished the fire. My theory is that Voldemort's only real goal has ever been to become more powerful than anyone else in the world, because his two greatest fears are feeling powerless and death.

*** It's a very reasonable theory. Everything we see of Voldemort indicates that he's obsessed with control. As a student he controlled those around him through manipulation, making everybody short of Dumbledore believe what he wanted them to about him. He seeks absolute control over himself, thus horcruxes, meaning that he'll never have to die, the one fight every person otherwise meets. He maintains absolute control over his followers through fear and torture. He controls his enemies through fear tactics to the point where they're too terrified to even say his name. Taking over the ministry enables him a greater level of control over everything around him.
