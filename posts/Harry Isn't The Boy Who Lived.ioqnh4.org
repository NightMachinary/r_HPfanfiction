Is there a fic where Harry has a brother or sister who's the real chosen one? Harry is still an important character, but maybe he's taken up more of a protective roll over his sibling, perhaps?

Or maybe it's not a sibling but a different character altogether.

I don't know. This thought just came to my mind, and I love exploring how OC's can change the story.

*The only things I don't like are dark fics or Draco, Snape, and Voldemort pairings.*


** I have never read it, so do not know what the pairings are. Also, it has not been updated since 2015. What has been posted is supposed to be really good though.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry James Potter is not the Boy-Who-Lived, but he does go to school with him. A little off if you ask Harry, that Neville Longbottom, always running around getting into trouble.

  Prior to his fourth year, Harry had lead a quiet, solitary life. As a series of remarkable events unfold, his life is irrevocably altered. AU. Re-posted.

Harry's twin sister is the Girl Who Lived. Harry apparently has an evil plan, but he's still a good brother, loved by his parents and not a whiny emo. It also has by favourite portrayal of Lily Potter.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16
