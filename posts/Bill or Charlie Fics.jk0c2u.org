Inspired by the Bill comes home before second year print. Also by a guilty pleasure Dumbledore and Hadrian fic Im currently reading. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495]]) .Here, Bill and Charlie serve as mentors to an abused!Harry and speak to him through enchanted mirrors. It has a few nice ideas to it though some parts are drawn out and it's over all very tropey. Anyways, does anyone have any Bill or Charlie fivs. They don't have to be Harry centric, but I'd prefer if there's more to the story than relationships and smut.

** I just linked this one on another thread, it's short but Bill is gnarly. There isn't much interaction with Harry though. Linkffnet([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12873571/1/]])

When I was reading your post I was like â€˜I know a fic like that' and then you linked the one I was thinking of. There really aren't enough fics that have Bill and Charlie without having them be love interests
