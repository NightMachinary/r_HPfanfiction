** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7017751/1/Harry-Potter-Rise-From-Dust]])

The only one I can think of off the top of my head, although I am sure there are better ones out there.

He is older than his brother, really popular, good at Quidditch, and receives tutelage from Merlin I think.

This story has the same generic forgotten Harry shtick as so many of them do. From what I can remember the angst is actually not awful and overdone. I just mean that he doesn't straight up hate everyone and acts like a big bag of butts.

His three main friends are OC's or one of them is...an unspecified amount of his close friends may or may not be OC's. I don't remember them being particularly bad.

Also, standard disclaimer, this fic is most likely dead.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]]: no magic AU and no equivalent of Voldemort either, but Harry is an interesting celebrity in his own way. Very nice romance.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): He is no BWL, but he is a far greater celebrity because he is the Emperor.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.
