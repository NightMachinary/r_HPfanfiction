Spoilers for whatever fanfic I remember. Anyway, I briefly recall reading a fanfic that includes Bellatrix's Daughter, but I cannot remember its title.

I don't think it had to do with that one play, and I don't think she was the main main character (more of a main side character like Hermionie and Ron). What I recall is Bellatrix did the deed with Voldemort and that their daughter actually fit the choosen one prophecy (defying Voldemort in bed, if you get my drift). Bellatrix falls into insanity (more insanity?) after her birth, and her daughter ends up adopted into, I think, muggle family. Harry (or was it a male main OC? I'll just call him Harry) befriends her and, eventually, finds a portrait of a sane-ish Bellatrix. As attending her birthday party, Harry gives his friend the portrait while informing her of her parentage since she never knew before that. Bellatrix is the one who informs her and Harry why she was abandoned (how else would Harry know Bellatrix's daughter fit the prophecy because of her and he-who-must-not-be-named actions while under the sheets together?). Pretty sure Bellatrix daughter soon encounters Draco afterwards and pretends to be an uppity pureblood and/or new student as a prank of sorts. Pretty sure Harry is closer to Sirius and Remus then in canon -- he might even have move into Grimmauld Place (with or without permission from Dumbledore) and I'm pretty sure there might've be at least a hint of the Black insanity being a thing in the fanfic...

Anyway, yeah, does anyone knownwhat fanfic I recall? If so, please may you tell me what its called so I can reread it???

EDIT: Prett sure Bellatrixs Daughter and Harry start dating, or at least were heading that way in the relationship.
