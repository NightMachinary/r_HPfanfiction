:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's this fic that I barely remember but am curious about. Basically Snape takes Harry for the summer (unwillingly) and makes him work at somewhere for squibs, which ends up being dangerous? I think Draco is around too. Probs a theme is Shape realising abuse by Dursleys?

Edit: omg squib not squid, but if anyone finds one where Snape makes Harry work at an aquarium I'll read that too.


** maybe linkffn(7104654) ?

  Harry is called up to Dumbledore's office at the end of his fourth year and told he is to go and live with Severus Snape. Severus does what no one else bothered to doâ€• he takes care of Harry. Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.

**** So I think it was similar to this but the key part was that Snape made Harry get a job at a local squib home/charity and it made him sick? I'm re(read) this though and see if it's in this!

Cheers

** I can't help you, sorry, but thank you very much for the squid typo, which has helped me to find and submit another entry for linkffn(Minuets in B Minor) :). I just went to Google and searched for an appropriate misuse of "squid" instead of "squib" in fan fiction until I found a good one. It's fun!
