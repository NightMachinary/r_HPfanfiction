Organized Crime AUs are probably my biggest guilty pleasure across all fandoms, but you don't see a whole lot of them sadly. Anyone have any reccomendations? The good, the bad doesn't matter. I just prefer they aren't abandoned. Any pairing.


** linkao3(Business by esama) is one of the only I know about. I've heard of gray markets and some misc other stuff, but that's the only one hyperfocused on it.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

  Remus had the Dursleys whacked. Tactfully, of course, and well after Harry left the house.

** I remember really liking this when I first read it but on rereading it, it's fairly average. The magical concepts are relatively interesting and the plot based in japan is quite interesting but the plot based in the UK is very mediocre.

That being said out of all the organised crime fics this is probably my favourite. The Yakuza dynamics are somewhat believable and it's a guilt pleasure.

There also was a Godfather crossover as well which was OKish with Harry controlling masses of Ravens but
