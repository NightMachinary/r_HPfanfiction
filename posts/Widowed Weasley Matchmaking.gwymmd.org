A horrible tragedy leaves Fleur Weasley and Harry Potter as widowers.

Years pass.

Molly and the rest of the Weasley family, pained to see the pair still wallowing in grief and loneliness and unable to heal, can't stand to see them in such dire straits for much longer, and they want to have them move on as best they can.

After seeing the two comfort one another as close friends and perhaps catching the tiniest glimpse of something more (awkward obviously due to the situation) that's developed over time and from their shared grief, Molly comes to an epiphany that she shares with the rest of the family.

Knowing that William and Ginevra would want their spouses to be happy, the family agrees and attempts to play matchmaker with the two.

At least some good would come out of this tragedy: Harry and Fleur being happy with one another for the rest of their lives, Molly thought. Neither deserved to be miserable and lonely.


** Bill goes off to Egypt on an "easy" assignment for Gringotts. He's overconfident and gets a little careless, triggering an irreversible mummification curse. Survived by his wife Fleur and daughter Victoire.

Ginny is a successful chaser for the Harpies. They haven't won the league yet, but get closer each year. She takes a bludger to the head in a playoff game, gets looked at, but keeps playing. Claims she's fine, but succumbs to a brain hemorrhage in her sleep that night. Survived by her husband Harry, and son James.

Harry and Fleur, as now single parents, lean on each other a bit: babysitting, outings(zoo, movies, sporting events etc.) and whatnot.

They grow closer with time, but grief/mourning/guilt keeps them apart. Molly and the rest of the Weasleys conspire to close the gap.... and now I'm seeing it play out in my mind like a cheesy rom/com movie :P

Several years later as Harry and Fleur Potter, hands clasped lovingly, watch the Hogwarts Express carry James off to his first year at school, Fleur leans over and whispers into Harry's ear "'I'm pregnant."

*** Yeah, it's how I see this going down. :) Maybe if they had their full canon families first, so the added drama of the kids seeing their mother and father, respectively, dance around each other and their own, various reactions adding to it all.
