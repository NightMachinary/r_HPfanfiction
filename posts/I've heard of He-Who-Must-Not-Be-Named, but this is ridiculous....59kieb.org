  "Stolen...and not just the ======. The word ======! They stole it too!"
#+end_quote

Does anyone remember that scene from the very start of Kingdom Hearts II? With someone not only stealing photos around Twilight Town, but somehow managing to steal the /word/ 'photos' as well?

What happens if you apply such a trick to the Harry Potter universe? What would happen if you stole different words?

- 'Voldemort' (or 'Tom Riddle') could be used seriously, or for a comedic one-shot. If you play it for drama, the idea of a nameless enemy could be played for horror, or you might be able to work ancient-egyptian magic into it, with Voldemort casting a spell rendering his name unable to be spoken or written to prevent it being used against him in rituals.

- The names of Gilderoy Lockhart's victims could have a namelessness curse placed upon them; a mind trick so that people who can't remember who did the original deed can be convinced that Lockhart did it instead.

- Combining the concepts of damnatio memoriae and 'speak of the devil', you could have an ancient, maybe still alive-via-Horcruxes, dark lord who can curse anyone who speaks his name; placing a spell of namelessness on said name could be a measure to help to prevent that happening.

- Steal 'detention' if you want to find a new way to tweak Umbridge's nose.

- Or 'vigilance' if you want to tweak Moody's.

- What happens if you steal the words 'Avada Kedavra'? Or the incantations for various other destructive dark magicks? Only those who can cast them silently would still be able to use them, and whoever/whatever's fueling the namelessness curse would become a high-priority target...

- If Harry Potter left the Dursleys, stealing his name could make it a lot harder for Death Eaters to find him. And as a side note, turn the 'Boy-Who-Lived' into just 'Who'.

I think it was in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][/Prince of Slytherin/]] --- TMR had placed a fidelius on his own name, so after he returned to England as VD, even Dumbledore couldn't connect this new dark lord to that previous perfect student of Hogwarts. [[/spoiler][There's also a reality warping ritual that can remove almost all knowledge about a particular subject from the world, including written notes about it, references in books, etc.]]

**** So far, Hermione, Neville and Theodore are just his best friends. There hasn't been a lot of romantic subtext happening during the story so far, because it's just the first two years. I expect the third year to be when Harry starts noticing girls or guys.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** This would be very, very cool if written the same way as SCPs that screw with memories: either antimemetics: information that actively tries to remove itself from people's minds, or the other direction: memetics: information that is hard to remove from people's minds, and usually harmful if present. For those interested in a good (non-HP) mindfuckery story (and are at least somewhat aware of the SCP universe) is the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five][Antimemetics Division]] storyline. Just follow the links at the bottom of each page to the next story. It's also complete.

*** «And then, Vernon mumbled something that you think might have meant to sound like the word “...”, but strangely there wasn't really any sound. It did not take long after that for his face to turn an unhealthy shade of purple, and for him to should “...! Stop this nonsense right this instant or you will not .... to return to the place of freaks.”»

So yeah.

**** I /like/ your flair.

"That ... has gone too far this time!" Vernon slammed his hands onto the kitchen table. "I refuse to call him by name! No good freaks like him don't deserve proper names when they go around stealing our respectable words!"

Dudley sniggered. "Who, Dad? Who're you talking about?" but Vernon was not in a mood to joke. "OH, YOU KNOW WHO!"

Petunia, having entered the house just in time to hear Dudley's comment and Vernon's response gasped in horror "What, where? Who're you talking about Vernon??"

" HE WHO CANNOT BE NAMED, THAT'S WHO!!" Vernon bellowed, completely out of control, and with no thought to neighbours. "WELL I'VE GOT HIM NOW! I'VE LOCKED HIM UNDER THE STAIRS!"

From the front lawn, Arabella Figg gasped in horror. She had seen Petunia go in, and was hoping to have a quick word with her, but this was serious! You-know-who was in the house! Locked under the stairs no less! Perhaps she had misjudged Vernon - he was an uncouth brute, but he did have Gryffindorish bravery! But...he-who-/cannot/-be-named? Ah, word stealing, that was it! He must've stolen his name so now he could not be named, rather than must not. Either way! Albus must be contacted immediately! Hold that thought, the entire Order! The -Who- must be protected!

In her haste, Arabella didn't realise that she had been unable to say either 'male child' or 'didn't die'.

** This would probably be too OP, considering some of the "contract" stories that have spawned with a similar concept. Cast a spell, or sign a contract with some arbitrary idea of what power is. Taboo is something that actually exist in HP, and I've never actually seen it done well in a fic, so why not place a taboo on a certain word instead?
