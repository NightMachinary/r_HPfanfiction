A few years ago... or many years ago I read this fic, but trying to find it again is proving... difficult.

Probably because I only remember a little.

So Harry leaves the Dursleys and rents a room either in Diagon or Knockturn Alley for the summer before school. He finds out that there are two types of dark wizards, the Voldemort kind or the 'passed down from a pureblood line' kind, and that the latter is just ritualistic or something.

He gets a job at a shop under a disguise, though his boss, who is a dark wizard of the second kind, knows who he is. Harry decides to become one too, and figures out that he is descended from the Peverell line, which was dark.

The right of passage is to carve the symbol of your family into your cheek, which glows blue when it heals, and only other dark wizards can see. I think the peverell's was a circle or something.

The Malfoys were dark wizards too.

And this all happened before 5th year.

And that is all I remember. Please help before I go nuts thinking I imagined it.

It was abandoned and removed from ff.net, so you'll have to download yourself a copy [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][here]].

*** It's definitely this. The story is really good and I really wish there were more than a handful of similar fics that handle pureblood stuff like that in a reasonable fashion.

****** You could also go with Buck or Bucky. Rolls right off the tongue.

I'd read this story in the past, same as you. I found it on the Dark Lord Potter forums. Most good dark!Harry stories are over there.
