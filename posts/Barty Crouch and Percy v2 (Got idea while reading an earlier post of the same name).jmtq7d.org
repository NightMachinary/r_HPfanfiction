Barty Crouch Jr can't find Moody before the start of GOF, instead, he finds a young Ministry employee who is not being careful on keeping an eye around the corner. Crouch Jr. manages to take Harry to the Graveyard and events unfold close to canon, only that he does this posing as Percy instead of Moody, and he escapes by the end of the year, undiscovered.

During OotP, Percy apparently is a Death Eater, and all of Dumbledore's intel seem to point to that, to the Weasleys' distress. Things scale to 100% when at the BoDM everyone sees Percy cast the killing curse on Fred.

What happens when, after Percy brokes free from the dungeon he was kept at, stumbles upon the Burrow with no idea of what has happened in the last 2 years and finds himself faced with the wand of an angry Arthur, Ron, Bill, Charlie or George?

BONUS: What if instead of George, Crouch Jr kills Ron... then you add Harry or Hermione as the ones to find him?

Percy would get fucking killed on sight

*** fanon Harry, for sure...

canon Harry, I'm honestly not sure. The closest scenario we have is the "not strong enough" crucio to Bellatrix just after Sirius death.

- In pro of not killing him: There would have been more time passed after the death of Ron to facing Percy than it was when he faced Bellatrix (so not as hot headed)

- In pro of not killing him: He didn't even try killing curse against Bellatrix, just crucio, which is a step down.

- In pro of killing him: Harry might feel Percy's betrayal to the Weasleys even bigger than Bella to Sirius.

- In pro of killing him: MIght be the drop that spills the glass

Of Hermione... we don't really have anything in canon to know how would she react to this.
