I binged linkffn(Shadows of Angmar) a few days ago. After taking a slight break to adopt a cat I need more fics with Harry Potter and Middle Earth playing off each other. Gimme your best.


** The Power He Knows Not [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/8]]

A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** It's a fantastic intro to the expanded Tolkien lore. And a decent story with enough hardship to be interesting without straying into edge territory

***** As someone for whom reading any of Tolkiens works is some years in the past ( I can remember nothing but the main plot of the LoTR movies) I really enjoyed this fic. Theres explanations for most of the stuff I didnt get in the end of the chapter and the story is really solid with writing better than almost anything I've read in fanfiction. I can wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try.

**** Just caught up! I really like Harry's character. (Quite different to canon, of course, but there's a clear reason for that change.) Also, it's nice to see some exploration of Middle Earth without the time constraints of the ring quest.

I'm a little bit disappointed that we haven't seen much of him showing off what he can do now that he has a wand, but the interlude was a nice sample.
