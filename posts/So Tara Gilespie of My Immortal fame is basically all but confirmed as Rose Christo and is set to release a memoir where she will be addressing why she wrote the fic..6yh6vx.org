** Speaking as the person who [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6x4jrw/in_case_you_missed_it_my_immortal_author_tara/][first broke the news of the FictionPress updates on this subreddit]], I have to say... I really didn't expect it to snowball this far. I thought the FP account would be another piece of possible evidence to add to the mystery, but I didn't imagine it would actually lead to the author being unmasked.

But as you said, "all but confirmed". We're still waiting for verification from an outside source - either her publisher or her lawyer. As it stands, they seem to be rather pissed off that this has leaked, judging by the FAQ on Christo's Tumblr:

#+begin_quote
  I am not answering these questions [about whether "My Immortal" was a trollfic or a serious fic] at this time, just because I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to. If Macmillan says I can, then I will. I'm trying not to get in deeper trouble.
#+end_quote

This is either the real deal, or it's the most convincing and elaborate "I'm Tara Gilesbie!" hoax that we've ever seen.

*UPDATE:* The publisher has now released an [[https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/exclusive-first-look-under-same-stars-my-immortal-memoir?utm_term=.afRplDoRn#.dq3VQnmPa][official cover, description, and author's statement]] for Christo's memoir, and Christo has also [[https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/faq-personal][updated her FAQ]] to include her publicist's contact info and to confirm that "My Immortal" was a trollfic.

*SECOND UPDATE:* Apparently, she lied about several different things - there's some elements of her backstory that aren't adding up now - and [[https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/9/16428248/my-immortal-still-a-mystery-rose-christo-fake][the publisher has now cancelled her memoir]].

*** I saw the first part of your post last week and decided to post this as a sort of update (I missed your actual edit). There's a part of me that's very relieved that My Immortal was a troll fic lol

That being said the more I'm hearing about her the more I'm wanting to read her memoir. Smart marketing I guess. Either way, this is honestly all unexpected.

**** Well, ya know, Reddit gets so many new threads each day that things can become old news pretty quickly (although it depends on the individual subreddit). Thank you, fellow Ravenclaw, for picking up where I left off.

The book description says she created "My Immortal" "with the help of one beloved foster sister" - I'm guessing that sister was her equally mysterious co-writer Raven, although we'll have to wait to learn the full details.

I guess the moral of this story is that nobody can hide online forever.

** I saw that on the BF last night. I'm not familiar with Rose Christo, so I suppose I'll have to look into her work.
