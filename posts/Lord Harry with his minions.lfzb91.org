Hi! Does anyone have a fanfic where Harry starts gathering followers in Hogwarts, with Ron and Hermione as his most fervent followers ?

I can read in English and French, and sometimes in Spanish. :)

Thank youuu


** This is more of a post-Hogwarts one, but still involves Lord Harry!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** Why do people always do this ?

There really should be a rule against ignoring what the OP actually wants in request threads and just linking whatever

**** Not sure what the big deal here is. The requirements were:

- Harry starts gathering followers in Hogwarts CHECK
- Hermione is a fervent follower CHECK
- Ron is a fervent follower NOPE

That's 2/3. And there's Weasley hate. I didn't write the damn thing.
