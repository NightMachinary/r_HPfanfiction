I binge read the entire story last night, and I just don't know what to do with myself now. It's been a long time since I've been this disappointed by a fanfiction. And I don't mean disappointed because it was bad or it was abandoned or it just dropped off in quality. The story was amazing, all the way through.

But I just so wanted the both of them to have a happy ending together. Whether romantically, in friendship, as family. I was rooting for it the whole time. And for it to end the way it did just fucking hurt.

Ugh. What a story. I don't think I'm moving on from this one for a while


** I just remembered that I've never read the last few chapters. So I have to say thank you for the warning, I won't read the last part then.

*** The ending seems to be incredibly rushed. It's a very poor climax to an otherwise brilliant fic.

**** I have to agree. I'll be honest and say that I didn't read the epilogue. To be honest, I only skimmed the second to last chapter. Limpieza was, to me, Harry and Emily's story [Edited for spoilers in case anyone wants to read it]

** I just read this whole thing today. I think it ended rightly. Don't get me wrong, I would have loved to see them together happily ever after and all that Jazz, her dying and Harry having to deal with that is more realistic. Does anyone have more fics like this with femLV/Harry??? Would be cool.

*** There's definitely something to be said for the tragic ending. They aren't any less valid than the happy, ride off into the sunset endings. And, hey, I spent literally all day today thinking about it, so the author did something right!

That's not necessarily a badge of quality though. I spent a whole day annoyed by the ending of a "FemHarry becomes a sexual slave of the goblins" story because I was hoping for "the Order breaks Harry out, levels Gringotts and decorates Diagon Alley with Goblin heads on spikes" or something the like, instead it ended with Stockholm syndrome and FemHarry voluntarily returning to the Goblins. Like, that story permanently ruined the "helpful/friendly goblins" trope for me and I wrote a story where Bellatrix Lestrange (well, Black at that point) is the hero for going all IRA on the Goblins. And if a bomb laying (simple chemical reactions don't show up on any magical detector) Bellatrix is the hero, that says a lot about my opinion of goblins.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
