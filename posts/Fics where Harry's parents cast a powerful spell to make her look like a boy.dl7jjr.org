, and it's a very complete spell that effects her physically, but then when she turns 17 and the spell is undone and she's all girl again!

Now don't get me wrong I absolutely love me a good femHarry fic but this whole concept seems just as cruel, if not more so, than anything Voldemort would do.

How psychologically damaging would this be to someone who hasn't had the nicest of lives to begin with? Hell even if your life was the best it would probably destroy just about everything in your life. To live your whole life thinking you're a straight boy and to make attachments as a boy, to get a girlfriend, to plan out your life, to think you finally got a handle on things... only to have it all upended on your 17th birthday!

Now being fanfiction i've yet to see anybody accurately explore the obvious psychological impact because the acceptance is usually rather quick.

But really the only thing more cruel than that is if there's a betrothal contract to some boy on top of everything else. Even torture seems like it'd be almost preferable.

Although I guess it would make for a 'good' drama heavy fic.


** That's a half of all fem!Harry stories just right there. These Harriets (or whatever they call themselves) take it with a different level of panic. Harriet in linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) takes it rather well, Brogan (yes, I still cannot believe that name either) in linkffn(Snape's Daughter by Tribi) with plenty of Calming Draughts (fortunately, it is also a Severitus, so there is plenty of potions available), and Melantha Black in linkffn(To Reach Without by nwardtransience) didn't take it well at all (it is also femslash story so there is plenty of angst and depression).

*** I read Becoming Harriet. It started out with plot. It did. But somewhere along the way they substituted that for porn and never went back. Ugh.

**** I would be more gentle with it: I think there is a plot, there is actually pretty good story there, but it is drowned with too much smut. With a lot of skipping, it is rather readable.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** People never think about the implications of what they write. Or heavily introduce their own issues into the writing until it's unrecognizable except for the name (/cough/ Cursed Child).

** There is linkffn(Effects and Side Effects, by Pheonix Dawn).

It's a "Magical Accident turns Harry into a girl" kind of story not a "Harry was born a girl, but was forced into a boy form as a baby" story.

I've not finished it yet... so maybe it devolves into pointless sex before the end. But this is maybe the only Fem!Harry story I've read where Harry doesn't immediately go full acceptance that he's a girl now. Even through chapter 29/37, Harry still thinks of himself as a Guy trapped in a Girl's body, hoping for a cure. He practically has a panic attack when he has to take shower cause he feels like a pervert just looking in the mirror. Everyone still uses masculine pronouns at home, and barely remember to call him 'Harriet' when they go shopping in London.

There are still plenty of other cliches in this story: Powerfull!Harry, Harry/Multi (though that's not progressed too far by chap 29), Muggle Training montage (keep edging closer to MuggleWank)...

But, it is the only Fem!Harry story I've seen to even acknowledge the psychological struggle of suddenly waking up as the other gender, much less make it a primary story arc. Another things I really appreciate is the author did NOT make all the other girls in the relationship conveniently Bi/Lesbian. Like, some of them are not sexually attracted to Girl!Harry... and that causes awkwardness between the characters.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
