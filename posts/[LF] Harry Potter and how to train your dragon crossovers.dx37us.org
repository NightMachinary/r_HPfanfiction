Any fic please, only requirement is that it's some form of crossover

Oh this is also a type of what's that fic because I remember a fic where Harry gets his animagus form to be toothless aka the night's fury aka op dargon and I want to know if it has been continued


** nope, last update was in 2014. and no one has been able to get in touch with the author. so the fic is considered dead.

and FYI, the fic is called "Harry Potter & The Curse's Cure" by Dragon Raptor. the basic version is on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]

the EXPLICIT version is on [[https://Hpfanficarchive.com][Hpfanficarchive.com]]

they are the same fic, just one has smut and the other doesn't.

i have yet to find any other fics with harry as a night fury animagus. though i am constantly looking.

*** Awww shame, it is a great fic though and Harry's transformation is. Expected but in an unusual time and I like the originality in it.

Also the form is yes

So am I, maybe I should write one, though I suck at writing

**** i'm not terrible at writing, i just procrastinate a lot. so my updates are few and infrequent. that and i began a policy last year of not posting a fic until it is complete.

mainly because i procrastinate. and if the fic is already done? i dont need to worry about deadlines. because those dont work for me. i stress out, get stuck, and abandon stories when i try writing with a deadline.

****** actually i was commenting on you statement about being bad at writing. i was commenting on my own talents.

â€‹

you mentioned potentially writing your own harry potter fic with harry as a night fury animagus, or something along those lines. but you also said you suck at writing.

i was commenting on how i have thought about doing the same thing... but it kind of spiralled into a minor rant. so i do apologize for that.

******* Ahh, yeah I think I might've said that at some point, which is true as is the fact that I can't write a story on my life.

No need to apologize for anything, rants give new perspectives that are great to have on things.

** If you're still looking for HTTYD/HP crossovers to read, I'd like to offer up my fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20820530][Of Sorcery & Shenanigans]] for your consideration. It's a How to Train Your Dragon / Tangled / Brave / Rise of the Guardians Hogwarts AU.

  /When the Ministry of Magic revives an ancient wizarding tournament, the students of Hogwarts School eagerly vie for a chance to make a name for themselves and earn some gold. But when things begin to go awry, Rapunzel, Hiccup, Merida and Jack realize that there may be more to the tournament than meets the eye, and it could very well threaten the safety of the school./
