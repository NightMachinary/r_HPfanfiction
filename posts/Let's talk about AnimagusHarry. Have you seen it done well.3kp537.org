This has been pestering me for a hot minute. As much as I like the idea, like most others, I draw blanks when I try to recall fics that have handled Animagi decently - whether it's a question of the form itself, the transformation, etc. It would be interesting to hear what would draw people in/turn them off when it shows up.

"So-Bad-It's-Good" examples are more than welcome!


** jbern had a pretty good take on the Animagus transformation in linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle by jbern).

In "So bad it's good" land are the multiple forms in link(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold), where Harry is some sort of Basilisk, a Thunderbird, and (eventually--she stopped writing before it could happen, but it was pretty obvious this was where it was going) a Quetzalcoatl.

I'm fond of the form I gave Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]], which allows me to claim victory in any "which story has the most powerful Animagus form?" competition.

**** Among other things, it was commented on by the author that Rakhesh's Central American time skip would have a major influence on his final animagus form. More telling was the author commenting in one of her author's notes that someone had in fact guessed correctly in one of the reviews. (This form was the most logical one there.)

It seems a bit irrelevant now, given how the story hasn't updated in six years. (She could have imagined him to be an Undead Imperial Arch Flobberworm Animagus and it wouldn't have changed anything.)

** I can think of many that I've liked, but there have been dozens that turn me off a story. Probably my biggest pet peeve is Harry being a Phoenix ... which is unheard of because no one has ever been a magical animagus!!! Harry you're so cool!! It's seriously so overdone and never well done. I've angrily had to stop reading a story that I've actually enjoyed so far because of that little "surprise."

That and having multiple animagus forms. There are so many possibilities in a fictional world of magic to give a character some surprising superpower, so defaulting to this overused trope annoys the crap out of me.

In my personal headcanon, I don't think his form could be anything other than a bird. But I'm also never all that interested in seeking out any of those stories.

Actually, I just thought of a story that, for the life of me, I can't think of the title, but it used the animagus form in such an interesting way that I couldn't help but love it. It was a slash story where Severus and Draco lived in hiding because their crimes were never pardoned or something. Harry escapes from where he was held captive in animagus form into the two Slytherins' hands who don't know that it's Potter because Harry was stuck by a spell and can't change back. What made this story unique in my mind was that his form is a parrot. So he's actually able to somewhat communicate, except they think he's just a bird that was taught a lot of words.

Dammit. What is that story called??

** linkffn(Teeth by Hathanhate) features Harry botching the Animagus process and having to deal with the consequences of it. It also turns into a Marvel crossover later on, and introduces a few cool concepts. Runs over 420,00 words currently,and still updating.

There is some slow progress severitius isn it, but it's done well enough it's not a total dealbreaker. Some undertones of various relationships have started to come to light in the more recent chapters. It also has some of the best side characters I've ever seen in an HP fic.

Not sure if this would be something you're interested in, but it's a nice long and enjoyable read.
