** Is there any pureblood/slytherin hermione that doesn't pair her with Draco?

I saw this post as well and it started my search for slytherin!hermione paired with Harry. I suppose there's no real point since there's other Slytherin pairings but this one does sound pretty interesting.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
