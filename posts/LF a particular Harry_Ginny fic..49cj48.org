Years ago I read an unfinished Harry/Ginny fic and I just wanted to see how it ended, if it did.

It was an adult fic set after OOTP with Harry and Ginny starting a relationship in Grimmauld Place. I think they went to Hogwarts for a bit before they went to an establishment in Ireland and one of the characters from there came back to teach at Hogwarts. I vaguely remember there been some sort of mystery in Ireland to do with a female witch that lived hundreds of years ago.

I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty sure there was more sex than plot and the plot there was wasn't fantastic but it just came to mind and I can't find it after a quick google.
