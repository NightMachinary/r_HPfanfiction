Hermione Stared in horror As the ceiling of the great Hall Began to crack , It was a great Enchanted mirror According to Hogwarts a history , A massive ward Weaved by the founders themselves ,To seal “the inverse” or mirror realm away . The world on the other side Made Voldemort look like A Niffler by comparison.

At the cracked grew larger A segment fell And an arm popped out. The entire hall watched in shock, As a woman pulled her self out. She dropped to the floor with almost no sound. Her hair was Crimson it's silhouette almost like a crown . An audible gasp Could be heard from her right. Ron stared in shock at the witch just entered his eyesight, It was Ginny , Or at least the mirror version of her. Ginny Had fallen in battle only days before. A gruesome fact that they were all still trying to ignore, Ginny, Fred, Neville ... Harry they were all gone slaughtered in the last moments of the war. Voldemort's last stand, Had cost them more than the castle's last ward.

The Crimson haireddoppelgänger, Strode toward them down the hall. When she reached out and she spoke with a voice both melodic And cruel.

She had an offer for them , A way to restore the school. It was a second chance she promised, See their home again to walk amount friend and see their families again. She offered to combine them Their world With her own. She offered them a chance to see loved ones again but they had to let her World cruelty into the very foundation of their own.

It was a desperate chance that they both wanted, They were the last , The only survivors of a war that had left them divided. They needed their brother they needed Harry. So what if it was a darker world, Everyone would be alive , Not buried in a field.

The crimson haired women's Eyes danced with glee when they agreed. She said they smiled and said everything will be fine you will see.
