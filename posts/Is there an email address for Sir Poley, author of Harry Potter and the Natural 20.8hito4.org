Hey, I hope this kind of post is allowed. Sorry if not.

I've been wanting to get in touch with Sir Poley, to tell him how much I appreciate his work. He has a "Send me a message" box on his Tumblr, but the message I want to send is longer than the character limit.

Is there somewhere I can message him?


** He has an FFN profile where you could send him a message up to 8k characters long.

I'm not sure how many characters you need but it is an option.
