The only ones I've found are linkffn(What was your plan?) and the first chapter of linkffn(Wait, What? by Publicola)


** An evil Dumbledore would have neutralized Tom Riddle in 1957 when he tried to apply for the DADA position. Wizarding Britain would be firmly under his thumb by early 1970s, and he might call himself the "Phoenix Lord".

Alternatively, an evil Dumbledore could have joined Grindelwald way back in the late 1800s. On the Muggle side, you might see Germany winning World War 1 in this extreme AU scenario and Britain becoming some kind of co-ruler of the world.

In dimensional time travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4849382/1/Inverted][Inverted]], Unspeakables Harry and Ginny swap bodies with their counterparts in a world, where Tom Riddle is good and Dumbledore evil. That Dumbledore though, is very competent and scary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]] features a Dumbledore who has won the first war and can be considered evil.

  Points of divergence in the Harry Potter universe. Those moments where someone really ought to have taken a step back and asked, "Wait, what?" An ongoing collection of one-shots. Episode 16: Why I Like You.
