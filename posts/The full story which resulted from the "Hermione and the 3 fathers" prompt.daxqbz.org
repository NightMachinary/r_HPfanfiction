I didn't find the prompt (Hermione is pregnant and has three suspects for the father) very believable, which is why I decided to have some fun with it. A few people asked for a longer version and I had enough ideas to make the 300 words drabble I wrote at 2 am into a proper oneshot. Cracky as usual.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger is pregnant. Trouble is, she has not slept with a man during the past decade. Which is why the whole pregnancy business is rather unexpected, and the reason she sought out Harry and Ginny for advice. Postwar, EWE? Cracky.

*** Exactly. I'm always surprised by the mental gymnastics people use to explain veela procreation when the obvious answer, magic, is right there. Although my experience might be biased after binge reading a lot of FemShep/Liara.

**** Heh. I have a new headcanon now. I also need a fic that explores this concept more thoroughly...

(Personally I prefer Liara and M!Shep though. Or Jack. I want a girlfriend like Jack...)

***** I never really got into MShep as a character. He comes across as generic soldier #45 while FShep at least has the gender swap and more unique looks going for her. Sadly, almost all ME fanfics rehash canon and don't explore possible divergences.

I'd love to read some Shepard/Shiara (the green Asari from the first game), Shepard/Consort (there was one fic which did this really well instead of porn, but it got abandoned and rewritten with an OC instead IIRC) or even just Shepard taking Lia'Vael along (the Quarian "thief" from the Citadel). Sadly, almost all there is to the ME fandom are "missing moment" type fics and porn.

****** I've always preferred playing male characters when given the choice. I can relate to them better. Same when reading. I generally imagine myself in the role, which is why I don't care for most Hermione centric fics or FemHarry. A few exceptions exist, but not many.

As far as relationships in ME go, I like the idea of Shepard and Shiala, but I've never much cared for Sha'ira (the Consort). She gives you these supposedly important words of wisdom that are just generic statements wrapped in cryptic bs. She's the day to day Trelawney of the Citadel.

******* I don't know what fanfics you have been reading, but unlike Trelawney, you can actually bang the Consort. She's basically a vip therapist with benefits. It makes for an interesting comfort dynamic in fanfics, especially given Asari melds.

I generally prefer female playable characters if given the choice as in most games, because proper badass female characters are sadly still a novelty. Although I don't mind male characters as long as they aren't too tropey. The hunk of meat isn't appealing to me. Book Jon Snow would be a good example for a male character I like. Or Harry.

The best ME fanfic I've read was FemShep/Miranda, something that's actually in the game files but someone at EA decided to cut it out. I'm a sucker for fics where she comes around and plays an important role. And I'd love to read some good Shepard/Kelly, even if the ship is dead.

**** I'm surprised people try to explain the mechanics of magic.

Don't get me wrong, I like world building done well, but magic is a great answer to everything in fantasy.
