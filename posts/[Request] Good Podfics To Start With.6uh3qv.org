Hey, guys, I've decided to start recording some podfics; at the moment I'm starting with a longer HP fic of mine, which is part of a Slytherin!Harry series I've written, and I have a few oneshots of different fandoms I'm probably going to record separately as well. For the uninitiated, podfics are just like audiobooks of fanfiction.

Does anyone have any suggestions for works that you think are in need of podfics, whether you've written them or someone else has? I'm open to any suggestions, honestly!

I have some stuff selected from my back catalogue to start with, but I think out of like, 400 non-explicit works I have, only a few of them are well-written enough and relevant enough to bother recording and editing.

Thanks in advance!
