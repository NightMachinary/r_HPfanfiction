The only things I remember is Harry coming down a rope from the great hall's ceiling, coming up from below the Hufflepuff? table, finding some kind of obstacle challenge or something?set up by Hufflepuff and believing all Hufflepuffs are secretly terrifying.

***** ðŸ˜‚ this fic is gold. How he levitates the feather, imagining that scene : Harry just coming down the ceiling. I really like that he is friends with Dean, Justin and Morag
