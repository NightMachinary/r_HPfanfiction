I want to read stories where Snape plays a mentor role to either Harry or Draco or both. OOC is alright, but no slash between any of the characters.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I have two go-to's for mentor!Snape.

linkffn(Stronger than Hope) is Snape mentoring Harry seriously and Draco... not so much.

linkffn(Wit of a Raven) has Snape mentoring Harry in a very AU setting. Sadly abandoned.

** In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/992265/chapters/1960418][Laocoon's Children]] and the whole "Stealing Harry-verse" in general, Snape is a mentor to both Draco and Harry. However, there is some slash between Remus and Sirius, but they are not in the stories much and the slash is mild and not at all the focus. The fics are centered on the kids and their time at hogwarts.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.
