As I remember, Harry was master of death and gets sent to the Percy Jackson universe, takes over percy's body gaining percy's powers in addition to his own then what follows is a smutty, overpowered run-through of the percy jackson books.

**** The first one wasn't terrible, but man did it get crackier as the series went on. The one by the same author that is crossed with the Inheritance Cycle is a lot worse right from the start.

****** Oh yeah. And instead of using 'Harry' or pronouns he uses 'The Green Eyed Potter Heir'. Man, I'd forgotten about that. ðŸ˜‚
