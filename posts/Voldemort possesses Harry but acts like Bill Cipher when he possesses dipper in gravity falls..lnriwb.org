Like, I love gravity falls and I think it would kind of be a funny humor fic, idk, it was my sisters idea. It could be the dairy, or in OoTP where Voldemort tries to possess Harry. Just like, he acts silly in Harry's body kind of, and Harry can see all the stupid shit he's doing in 3rd person.


** What is every Horcrux contains part of Voldemort's personality. Like, one is all about pranks and jokes, one is like a total Casanova, another contains his compassion and is a super-Hufflepuff, etc
