I'm currently out of new fanfictions to read and I'm looking for some that cover multiple years, they don't have to be slytherin fanfictions but from the ones I've read those and ravenclaw ones were the most interesting for me.

​

I prefer a more independent / acting Harry who doesn't just stumbles over his adventures because he is the heroic hero and has to...

Bonus points for sarcasm !


** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Secrets of Vipers) is a good one that's been updating recently.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin) is one that is particularly well known. The writing is pretty bad for most of book one, but improves dramatically later.

Both stories are in the WBWL genre, in case that bothers you. I might pop by with more fic tomorrow, but it's 2 am and sleep is important.

  Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** I know both of them but didnt see that Secrets of Vipers got an update thanks !

Regarding PoS, I have to say I liked the Lockhart part but the way it's currently going is a bit... meh in my opinion.

​

Thanks for taking the time before sleep, if you have any more recommendations I'd love to hear them.
