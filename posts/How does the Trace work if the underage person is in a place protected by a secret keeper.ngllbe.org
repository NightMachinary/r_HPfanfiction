Just trying to figure out the limitations and reach of the Trace in canon, because it's pretty confusing to me.

If an underage person used magic somewhere like Grimmauld Place during OOTP, would it register with the ministry? If so, would it register as an unknown location or would it expose the location? If the location is exposed, does that just mean they know it happened there but still can't physically reach it due to the secret keeper's protection?

Ugh, maybe I just need to get more sleep but I can't make my brain make sense of it. Any thoughts?


** From what we see in canon, the information the Ministry receives from the Trace is:

1. What spell was cast, and

2. In what location.

The Ministry does not receive:

1. Who cast the spell; or

2. Whose Trace detected the spell.

As regards enforcement, the Ministry appears to operate on several assumptions:

1. Where magic is cast in a location where adult wizards are known to reside, it is assumed that adult wizards cast it.

2. The Ministry assumes pre-Hogwarts magic is accidental and does not investigate it.

3. When Ministry officials are present in a location, magic cast in that location is assumed to be cast by the Ministry officials rather than children.

The Ministry then enforces underage magic regulations by cross-referencing the information from the Trace against the locations where underage wizards are known to reside without any adult wizards in the same area.

In the case of the Fidelius, I suspect the location would be concealed. So the Trace would still work, but the only information the Ministry would receive is that a spell has been cast, without a location attached. So - completely useless.

** The Trace is a nonsensical idea that retconned how underage magic detection works in and for DH. So if you can't make sense of it, that's baked into its creation.

Here's how I would answer the question /without/ Trace: There is no blanket spell that picks up magic anywhere, there's only monitor spells installed at a location. One such spell covered Privet Drive. Such a spell would not be around Grimmauld Place, so the question doesn't arise. This explains how Harry can do and be around magic during the holidays (Hagrid's magic before first year, Grimmauld Place, Slughorn's hideout, ...) and not get whacked with an owl.

/With/ the Trace you have to come up with some reason why sometimes they ignore what they pick up and sometimes they don't. As this includes your example, the first thing to note is that they /factually/ ignore the magic being done around Harry (he doesn't get any other/more owls). As for the reason -- in this case, I'd probably argue they don't pick it up in the first place, due to the spells hiding Grimmauld Place. Not necessarily (just) the Fidelius, even.

It's a lot harder to explain if Harry's Trace supposedly should have picked up magic in random Muggle locations where no hiding spells possibly could have been.

*** What do you mean? Maybe the name was not yet invented but the idea that casting spells outside of Hogwarts for underage could lead to expulsion is introduced in book 1 and the concept of trace is introduced in chapter 2 of book 2. If anything, I believe JK was too rigid in her approach and that's why Tom murdering his parents and altering the memory of his uncle seems forced: like there's no known underage wizard in the area yet the trace gets activated.

**** Nah, like I said, what's introduced is the idea that there is a way to detect underage magic, and the most natural explanation is a location-based spell, not a spell on the person (or the wand, for that matter).

And hence, no owls for Harry when Hagrid gets him from Hut-on-the-Rock in PS (Dudley with pigtail and the charmed boat) and Hermione experiments with magic (spell hadn't been set up yet), when they visit Sluggy (Dumbledore and Slughorn repairing the house), and, for that matter, when Tom visits his relatives -- why did you think the Trace (or whatever way to detect magic) activated then? Tom got away, and the bodies of his grandparents were found by Muggles the next day, not by wizards.

***** The legal implications of trace are actually stated that they only become effective after they become students at Hogwarts. I explained that Dumbledore specifically allowed Harry to use magic if necessary when they went to Slughorn. In Tom's case I'm confused as I said in my comment above. The trace should have gotten activated (and Dumbledore says it should have) yet an adult wizard got blamed for the crime. JK just says that the Ministry was happy they got someone that eagerly confessed, but seriously? No suspicion about the fact that the trace got activated? At least to confirm that there was a magical child in vicinity.

****** And Dumbledore can do that how? He's a headmaster, not the Ministry.

But regardless, my point is not that you can't contrive of a special explanation for every individual instance where Harry doesn't get an owl. My point is that the very fact that you have to do so means the Trace is a bad concept. It's hammering the square peg into the round hole: a good concept needs just one general explanation covering everything, and little or no special ones.

******* Dumbledore may have his hands tied in front of the Ministry (without using force)... that much we're told in the books. But he still gets some authority as a headmaster and I would assume that if he says he will permit it, it means that he will permit it without legal consequences for Harry breaking the law.

As for the trace... I'm not saying it's not inconsistent. In fact I specifically mentioned some inconsistencies I've noticed and I apologize if English might not be your first language but I don't know how else I could be clearer. However I disagree that the Trace was a retcon. In fact it was invented early on with some strict rules and JK, instead of adjusting it as the plot needed, just stuck to it as it was designed originally and found explanations that don't hold much water.

******** Well, yes. What you call "inconsistent" I call the reason why it's a retcon. It's not inconsistent (in an out-of-book explanation) if you assume it didn't exist until DH, and prior to DH, it was a location-based spell, and not on the person. The evidence prior to DH neatly fits with that, so it's an 1:6 thing.

IMO, if assuming something was added later solves basically all confusions and problems, then that's what I'll do. YMMV, I guess.

********* I see your point but the thing is it's introduced as early as second book. And even earlier on it's hinted at its existence. Just because it's not named or, for all we know, it might not even had a name then, doesn't mean it wasn't thought of. It just means that the actions that it influences later weren't thought of.

I don't think you do, or this sentence makes no sense ("it" is introduced, yes, but what is "it"?). But then again, I don't really care enough to argue either. I wouldn't know how to make it clearer anyway. The relevant part is this:

******* A; that's not completely true and B; there may be legal ways around that.

Dumbledore isn't just the Headmaster of Hogwarts (more on that in a sec). He's also the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, although he was briefly suspended during OotP. Fanon, and nothing in canon seems to disprove this, seems to agree that CW is something like the Lord Chancellor of the House of Lords, in that it gives Dumbledore a good deal of authority of his own. There's no reason the CW wouldn't be able to, in essence, issue a temporary waiver to the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery (even if such waiver was merely a verbal acknowledgement). Also, even as Headmaster, he might have the authority to issue a waiver on educational grounds ("Harry, do you fancy some extra credit DADA work? Good lad.").

**** But also, in book 6 Dumbledore takes Harry to Slughorn, who is living in a muggle house, in a muggle suburb. Harry, Dumbledore and Slughorn all cast spells whilst in the house. There is no mention of underaged magic, either cast by Harry nor in his presence. It's just JKR being inconsistent again

***** How is that inconsistent? Dumbledore explains in HBP that the Ministry doesn't actually know anything about who is casting the magic, they just have the spell that is cast and the location.

Since the magic in question is cast far from Privet Drive, where Harry lives, what basis would the Ministry have to connect that magic to Harry?

****** The idea that they don't even know /whose/ Trace picked up the magic is just terrible. It entirely defeats the advantage of making it a person-based spell to begin with.

Everything becomes much easier and natural if you assume it's a location-based spell. But I think we talked about this before.

******* Yeah, your approach is "What system would it be logical to set up, assuming magic can set up any system you imagine?"

Whereas my approach is to simply look at all the pieces of canon and see if it is possible to articulate a consistent system that reconciles all the textual evidence. The fact that the Trace is on people is stated clearly in the text. Once that's in place, the idea that they don't know whose Trace detects the magic is necessary to make sense of the Tom Riddle killing his family episode.

The system depicted in canon might be bad, in the sense that you wouldn't create a system like that if you had the freedom to create any system you liked, but it is at least possible to find an interpretation where it is /consistent/.

From that, I think we have to conclude that the Ministry doesn't have the freedom to make any system they can imagine, but rather tracking magic is an area of magic which is relatively undeveloped and the Ministry is attempting to make a tracking system with very limited tools.

***** I don't actually recall Harry casting magic but Dumbledore specifically gives him permission to do so if necessary in that instance. The inconsistency is more glaring in the Death Eater chase in DH when obviously a bunch of spells are cast including by Harry. Later Harry wonders how the Ministry didn't try to expel him for his infraction and the explanation is that the Ministry is staying silent on the topic because they're worried it may cause panic if it's found out that Harry was attacked by Voldemort. But now the question is? Would they even know it was Harry in the first place since earlier it's stated that the Trace only tells you the location and the Ministry just assumes who the culprit is based on people living at that address.

Another inconsistency appears when the Advanced Guard comes to Privet Drive in OotP. Harry is under the threat of expulsion for performing underage magic yet the Order freely performs magic thus activating Harry's trace in the process and making him look like he is just casting magic around. Or maybe Tonks had clearance to pick him up.

****** My theory is that the reason Dumbledore gave him permission is because he was giving permissions to do so in his role of Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwamp.

Tonks, in my theory has clearance to cast spells in a Muggle area because of her role as an Auror. Especially if she's near someone who the Ministry has accused of being delusional and insane (or had got clearance from the Head Auror or DMLE Head who believed Harry, or could have been hoodwinked into believing that Tonks was going to 'investigate' the Patronus usage, just like Shack was feeding 'information' about the location of Sirius)

******* Honestly, my guess was always that Dumbledore's titles don't mean anything, other that of the Headmaster. The Ministry easily removes them when they butt heads so my best guess is that they are honorary titles. It's the Headmaster title that the Ministry has to pass a bunch of laws and even then struggles to remove until the DA is discovered. I would believe that the Headmaster still has some autonomy over the students rights considering he also represents Harry at the hearing.

*** Yeah. My view is the "Trace" started as a valid idea that quickly turned detrimental to Muggleborns. I mean, not having magic seen by non-magicals? Makes sense.

I figure there are magical spells that 'sense' magic in areas around Muggleborn homes to detect magic that are likely placed when people go to Hogwarts.

This fits with how Hermione apparently practiced magic a lot pre-Hogwarts, but never got into trouble. Which is rather unlikely with how anti-muggleborn the Ministry is, if they detected her.

** I don't think they'd follow up any magic that's done in a more magical area, and I think London has enough magical inhabitants and visitors that the Ministry wouldn't care. So Grimmauld Pl is fine.

If you put the location in a completely muggle village somewhere, I'd imagine they'd send someone to check, they wouldn't be able to find the person responsible for the magic, and they'd leave. If this happens a lot they'd maybe start wondering what's up and try to investigate it more, or they'd assume there's a magical animal or rock or something that's causing a disturbance, who knows. Or your protag could put up an enchantment in the area that makes any Ministry worker forget they didn't find the cause of the magic or something like that.

If you put the location in an area with just one other known wizard or witch, they will be thought to be responsible for the magic, not your guy underneath the fidelius charm, and if they too are underage they'll get the angry letter.
