It does not matter if he is an antagonistic villain or a protagonist villain (although the latter would be more interesting to me). No romance please. Thanks


** I am working on a story where Harry ends up adopting Snidely Whiplash, the villain of the Dudley DoRight cartoons. So Harry is raised with an understanding of the Whiplash version of Evil, that being, "Just because you're evil, you don't have to be an asshole."

Harry arrives at Hogwarts (because, of course, he did) and is promptly sorted into the House of Evil Overlords (Hufflepuff) and immediately spots the Hero of the Story: Draco Malfoy.

Draco is the hero, because of his impeccable grooming, something he and Dudley DoRight share, though if he were honest, Harry expected his story's hero to have more of a chin.

Poor Pansy Parkinson finds herself frequently kidnapped and tied to Railroad tracks, and occasionally to the feeder track of the never before mentioned Hogwarts Saw Mill. Oddly Draco never shows up to rescue her, and Draco doesn't have a horse like Dudley, but Greg and Vinnie happen along occasionally and Harry figures that between the two of them they are almost as smart as a horse, so they count.

Pansy is a bit torn as to her reaction to these kidnappings, as they aren't just kidnapping. Harry always has a catered lunch laid out for the two of them (because he paid attention to how his dad treated Nell Fenwick) and Pansy is confused why this odd boy in the opera cape, top hat, and drawn on mustache is treating her better than Draco ever has.

She starts to look forward to her weekly kidnapping because other than the whole 'tied to a railroad track' thing it's quite fun. Ultimately, sometime in their 6th year, Pansy derails (Ha! Derails, I kill me) Harry's plans and takes him to bed, where Harry finally figures out what the whole fuss was about.

Over the years, Harry's plots against Draco, all of them failing miserably, end up ruining all of Voldemort's plots, and makes him long for death.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) - Evil!Harry in which he's the protagonist

linkao3(Dead Things by EclipseWing) - Dark!Harry mainly from Hermione's POV

Note- I classify Evil!Harry as someone who commits atrocities for fun and Dark!Harry as one who has a purpose for doing them, no matter how selfish they are

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** Realignment might be something your are looking for. It is not from Harry's point of view but a young Tom Riddle (whom Harry goes back in time to deal with). Quite the brilliant story.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  There once was a tale of three brothers and the gifts bestowed upon them by Death. Such a tale is one of intrigue, of adventure, of tragedy. Such a tale is a lie. Or; a story of time travel, genocide, and a boy who just wants to live.
