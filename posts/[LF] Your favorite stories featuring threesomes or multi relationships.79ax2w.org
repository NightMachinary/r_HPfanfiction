**** Dunno if i can.. It's probably a gigantic bag of clich√©s,but when i found it, it was a neat story featuring Harry and a bunch of girls, which i was looking for at the time, with the added cool factor of featuring a small independant nation, aside from (Magical) UK.. which i have found very few examples of in my years reading FanFics.

**** Jesus. Note I tried it just to see what the fuss was. And. Well. I got to chapter like 5 and noped out. So. Ok. Here goes.

Do you like JRPGs? It's like that but instead of inventory management you manage a country and baby making factories. Get ready to level up your country, political skills and penis. Plus there's a baby making factory counter at the end of every chapter.

  In another universe, they were amongst the most feared renegade Time Lords: the would-be god Omega, and the amoral scientist known as the Rani. They have been reincarnated against all odds as Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. And when they regain their memories, these two genius minds are going to start a revolution in Magical Britain...

** linkao3(prodigal witch by MissFantastic) is a fave guilty pleasure read of mine. I also like linkffn(Brilliant Magic by ljsummers) and linkffn(Bespoke Witch by glitterally)

edit: apparently bespoke witch isn't on ffnet anymore. But it did link to the alternate version of it by another author which was also very interesting. I found the bespoke witch on its own site: [[https://glittergrrrl05.wordpress.com/the-bespoke-witch/]]

  Hermione Granger returned to England after years abroad. Of course things have changed back home, but so has she; though Hermione didn't know just how much she was still changing. No one ever said change was easy and in her case it was downright dangerous, but at least she wouldn't be alone. Not only do drastic changes affect Hermione's life and magic, but she will also end up bound for life to another person. The question is will she be able to choose her life partner or will it be out of her hands? I posted this story on Granger Enchanted back in 2014. Thank you so much to bunnyhops for all of her lovely beta work back in the day. She rocks!This is a Hermione/Multiple Wizard story, so if that isn't your cup of tea, feel free to skip this story. As a heads up, all the wizards are Slytherin!I like to create photo collages as I write to help create a visual for the scene or chapter. I've created a folder of photos for this story on my Flickr page (MissFantastic) in case you want to see what I envision. Of course, feel free to use your own imaginations as well!
