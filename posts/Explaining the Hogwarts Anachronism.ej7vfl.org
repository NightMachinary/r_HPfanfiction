Canonically, Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century, but castles didn't exist in Britain until after the Norman Conquest in the mid 11th, and even those were much smaller and more basic structures. How, then, is Hogwarts Castle built in a style 400+ years ahead of its time? Were wizards (or goblins or dwarves) once that far ahead of Muggles? Was Rowena Ravenclaw or someone else involved a seer or time-traveler?

My proposed explanation (and I'd love to see others' ideas) is as follows: When originally built on that site, Hogwarts wasn't a castle at all, but something called a "hill fort", which was basically a simple earthen and/or wooden rampart around a hilltop or other raised area which contained buildings, livestock pens, etc.. These were still in use in Scotland at the time, and could encompass large areas.

Salazar Slytherin's secret chamber was originally a set of natural caves accessed from a secret entrance under his home, and the Room of Requirement was a larger building enchanted to function as a multi-purpose classroom.

As the small school grew, it developed a population of dedicated support staff like a weaver, a seamstress, a potter (no Potters yet, obviously), and before long they had a budding village. These people eventually moved down the hill a bit, founding Hogsmeade, though they retained a standing invitation to shelter in the fort if needed.

Over the years, decades, and centuries that followed, the buildings on the site would be renovated and/or replaced numerous times, but the spells prudently laid down by the Founders made sure that the school's wards and enchantments always adapted to these changes. Of course, by the late Middle Ages or early Renaissance when Hogwarts more or less achieved its current form the changes had become so extensive that some of the enchantments had unexpected results, like computer code fed an unexpected input, thus things like the randomly-moving doors, rooms, stairs, etc., and when indoor plumbing was installed Slytherin's enchantments moved the Chamber's entrance once again.

For some reason, at some point, Wizarding Britain managed to forget this history. Perhaps it was deliberate - maybe people wanting to keep the castle as it was pushed the belief that it'd always been that way, or something like that.


** Why is so hard for people to imagine that the stronghold built in the 900's started small and was upgraded over time? Of course it wasn't a stone castle at first. I'm convinced that the Room of Requirement was not added until much later, and Salazar's crypt was just a nearby cave until the structure grew to connect to it.
