Seriously, I can understand some such things in a community, but there is so much of it that it's putting me off HP fanfics. I even see it in stories in situations that make no logical sense. Just why do so many of you enjoy such things, especially between underage children, or worse between Snape, and some female/male underage character? Why is such a thing so god damn popular? What sick f***s look at that, and go "oh my gawd, so hawt"?

Thanks,\\

** You know what's sick? Your moralizing tone. No, I don't like erotic stories about preteen people either. They disgust me. So i just don't click on those. Who am I to call other people I don't know and probably will never know sick fucks? Who are you to do that? Are you in any way superior to them, above them? People have fantasies, and they're allowed to have those.

*** What does it say about these people, that they enjoy writing, and reading these type of stories. I can honestly say i've never had such fantasies, and again have you thought of the real world consequences. Do you have anyone who's 12 in you family, or friends families. Now imagine them in such a situation. While the characters are fictional, that doesn't change the fact that there are people who enjoy such acts. If they can enjoy the act in a fictional way, then there's a chance that they may actually act out on such urges, and the only reason they know about it is, because of reading such a story. Also yes I believe i'm above the people who enjoy reading stories between 12y/o 100%.

**** Again you try to shame me into an opinion, by making me think incestuous thoughts no less, and I suggest you stop trying. It's insulting, and, more importantly, completely pointless. Now, onto your last point about the dangers of these fantasies. There's a very, very large border between fantasy and reality. We cannot control our thoughts, but we damn well can control our actions. I'm not going to make a specific example here, because I know how you think about fantasies already, and for that reason I don't want to talk with you about it anymore. I just hope you can reconsider your stance, because you'd be surprised at what kind of thoughts perfectly normal people have.

***** I understand perfectly well that people can have terrible horrible fantasies, i'm not worried about that. I'm worried about the people who enjoy such fantasies, and out of all of them i'm worried about the ones who'll act out on them. Out of all that do you really think it's fine having such stories around that could influence them. People who are willing to actually read such stories(not to mention write them), and enjoy them does not indicate a healthy mental fortitude. When people are willing to read/write such stories, it means that somewhere in their mind they enjoy it. As much as you want to be stuck in a fantasy, they're are real people out there who can, and very well may have acted out on such fantasies. Like I said, for the mentally fit we understand such a distinction, but they're are, at minimum, thousands who have the potential, and will to act out on such fantasies, and having so many stories who spout how fine, and happy you get does nothing to help stop such thoughts, and actually encourages such thoughts.

** You overlook that a significant amount of the fanfiction community (more than those who admit it, I bet) are themselves underage teenagers. Who, when they write pornography, write it about people in whose shoes they can picture themselves --- e.g. other teenagers their age. For that reason, while first- or second-year is pushing it, "underage" lemons in HP fanfiction don't gross me out more than pornography itself would in general.

*** Yes most are teens, not all. That doesn't change how disturbing, and disgusting it is. How would you feel about watching a 12y/o, and a 30y/o go at it. There are hundreds of stories that actually do that. Like I said I understand lemon's, but lemon's between two 16y/o is different from lemons between a 12y/o, and a 30y/o. 16, and above I can ignore, but the aforementioned relationship between two people of ages decades apart is something that just shouldn't exist.

With how many there are thousands read it(possibly more) stastically one percent at least(definetly more) actually use that as inspiration to fuel their own fantasies between real people, out of that let's say one percent of that will actually seriously consider try doing that. So for every thousand people that read this, one of them will actually try this(it could be higher or lower, but sadly it might be higher).

That's why I hate these stories, they say it's fine for a 30y/o to have sex with a 12y/o if they have feelings for each other(not even including the actually large amont of rape stories where they fall in love. WTF?!?), and some people who are either just sick enough, or just lonely, and crazy enough that they'll actually try something like this, because these stories explain how it's alright to do this, and why it's fine to do this.

first off the numbers probably lower but that doesnt matter since that number is definetly lower then the number of people who would of already been seriously consider to try doing that but had the ability to nut off to fiction instead of committing the act

*** Not new, actually been on this subreddit quite a lot, but it's just disgusting how many there are. There are so many stories with Harry/Snape that it makes up about 1/5 if you include the Hermione/Harry, and Ginny/Harry pairings. When it's a few, sure I could see it, but to make up a fifth of those pairings is ludicrous. I haven't even(and don't want to) seen how many in total have Snape(a teacher/terriost) paired with underaged children.

I'm honestly becoming more, and more disgusted by this community, especially with those defences "oh bad boy, oh tortured", Draco is a lot more understandable(as long as any "illicit activities" are done when they're over the age of 18), but with Snape, it's just disgusting. When anyone can read such stories with sex between 11-15 year olds, and either other 11-15 year olds, or 30+ year olds, and not only be ok with it, but get turned on by it shows how far that person has fallen, and I dare anyone who reads this to prove me wrong.

Did you just describe sex between adults as an "illicit activity"? That's... weird.

As to the rest of your post: oh boy. I'm not a fan of the Teacher/Student thing either, but this kind of outrage is IMHO misplaced.

******* Age of consent should not matter in literature. I mean, one of my High School novels had a 36-year-old woman seduce a 15-year-old boy and spend a summer with him. The teacher didn't even mention the age difference when discussing it. Even by our rather lax German standards regarding the age of consent, that was statutory rape.

So if an official, government-sanctioned lecture for children aged 14-15 doesn't care about underage sex in literature, why should the average Joe? The movie adaption was rated for six years and above for fuck's sake

********* It's pretty common in german schools that this book is on the course plan. But I think it's a bit strange that [[/u/Hellstrike]] says their teacher didn't mention the age difference. The 'uneven' relationship (and how it negatively affects the life and relationships of the protagonist) is a huge part of the narrative and certainly needs to be discussed. Now I'm not sure whether he has been sleeping in school or whether the education system has failed him.

To suggest that this book/narrative somehow 'normalizes' such relationship is patently absurd. The author is just cleverly not calling attention to it and makes the events speak for themselves.

The book is pretty sexually explicit though and I remember feeling a bit weird having to read it for school. So it's kinda good to bring it up in this discussion, because the author is certainly not disgusting to write such scenes as they serve a greater purpose (can't say that for most fanfic smut though ;)

I'm also not sure how well you can discuss that topic in class when pretty much all the boys, myself included at that time, think "hottt" and then proceed to imagine various fantasies of "MILFs" seducing them. Because lets be frank here, at least half of the class would have gone along with the relationship if they were put in the same position with no regrets.

For that reason I'd argue that 14 year olds are not the right target audience for such topics but compared to other dysfunctional relationships (domestic abuse for example), "consensual" statutory rape is light reading material. And to get back to fanfics here, I'd much rather read about Harry banging Gwenog Jones during his fifth year than read a story where Voldemort won and Lily became Snape's "prize", even of the latter isn't explicit.

Oh yea, I distinctly remember a lot of the boys being pretty happy with the early parts of the book: "Duude, it's basically porn!"

But I also distinctly remember loud debates in class because our teacher tried really hard to make us see the dysfunctional angle and how it wasn't healthy. We also had discussion how such a story would have been received if it were a 15 year old girl and an old Nazi man.

Judging by how popular Snape pairings are, quite well.

And my pride is quit intact. I mean, I got an A+ for referencing Prinz Friedrich von Homburg with Sabaton's "Hearts of Iron", so there wasn't much work involved to be honest.

On a more serious note however, I think that when it comes to discussing these topics, quite a few people forget that statutory rape CAN very well be a victimless crime. Even Reddit's infamous "broken arms" guy said that it was the best thing which happened to him (and the best sex he ever had). It is a tricky subject because some "victims" would gladly "suffer" again while others are scarred for life by it and you can't tell beforehand how it will go. And consensual sex in one country is rape in another. Which standard is right? It's a big ol' mess.

If you read what I wrote you'll notice that while i'd rather it between two 18y/o and higher 16, and higher is understandable(as long as the age gap isn't too large). It's when it's a 12/13y/o with a 30+y/o(or other 12/13y/o) when it's just disgusting. Also illicit means it's against a rule, or law. So it is an illicit activity in most countries. So when it's done between two 16y/o it is against the law(in most countries), and probably against your parents wishes(who by law are your guardian).

I'm quite confident that this is factually incorrect. Even the draconian US has states with "Romeo and Juliet" laws that legitimize sex between minors. In most countries that I can think of two 16 year olds (sometimes even younger) having sex is perfectly okay and no problem at all. Rowling was writing children's books and wanted to avoid such topics, but that there'd be a lot of sex at Hogwarts between students seems like a given.

#+begin_quote
  and probably against your parents wishes(who by law are your guardian)
#+end_quote

Well, parents don't own their child. There's at least some bodily autonomy for a child at a certain age and (for example) locking your child in your house so that they won't have sex is borderline abusive. But I'll grant that this is arguable... personally I find such behaviour a little bit disturbing. Not to mention that there's no law to follow your parents wishes and forbidding your child to have sex will probably accomplish nothing or worse the opposite of what you want (rebellious child is ignorant about sex and gets pregnant).

I always find it funny that the US allows children to drive cars (which can literally kill people), but having sex, yeah, that is too much responsibility.

I don't think there's really anyone here who truly enjoys that sort of thing and a while back there was a discussion about Reddit's rules regarding the posting of such materials. I don't think anything of what you're professing to be disgusted by has been recommended recently, although I don't read through all of the recommendation threads and I could easily be wrong.

When it comes down to it, people like reading and writing about sex. It's a natural part of life and not everyone is going to like the same things. I enjoy writing about sex between cognizant, consenting adults and if that offends you, then that's the way it is, but please, don't paint an entire group with a single brush.

******* Stories that show rape, and sex with children as fun time is different to a movie about superheroes. One is meant to be entertaining to a large amount of people, while the other can only be enjoyed if you are truly a disgusting human being. Fun movie for the family vs story that shows rape is fun, and enjoyable. I believe your argument has quite a few flaws in it as well, since only those that enjoy rape would read such stories, while a wide range of people can enjoy marvel.

******* Just to add to that: There might actually be real-life consequences, but they could be overwhelmingly positive. Rape is at an all time low in our culture and I'm giving widely available porn (among other things) a lot of the credit. And if there's stuff that gives people with more... disturbing... tendencies some kind of fictional outlet instead of acting on such impulses, then that's pretty good overall. It seems to me that repression and shaming of sexuality, as for example among the priests of the catholic church, seems like a much more dangerous recipe for disaster - if you're worried about real-life consequences

******** Repression is the absolute least healthy way to deal with just about anything. You can't suppress human nature and expect to be human. Part of being human is intrusive thoughts and urges. That's just how our brain works. Expressing them in a safe environment such as fiction is a tried and true method for therapy. If someone is so mentally unstable that this inspires them to commit the act in real life, then frankly they are already past the point where they need to be committed to a mental hospital. At this point it is not a question of IF they will do something unacceptable, but WHAT. Taking away these stories will not stop them, it will simply redirect them, quite possibly to something even worse.

This is not an issue you can solve by shame and repression. I hope you learn that some day.

********* I'm sorry, but i'm gonna have to disagree with that, if those regular urges are rape of a child, human nature does not excuse such things. It has also been shown that people lived normal lives until reading something like this, and it took root in his/her mind until stories weren't enough anymore. Could the person have always been like that, maybe, but it's also possible that if he/she never read the story nothing would have come of it. A better thing to do is instead of writing such stories, they actually do something that engages the mind away from these things. Writing about it could just make it worse, with the benefit of possibly affecting other people. It works both ways, but only one of them have the possibility of affecting more than one person(not including the people such actions could effect).

********** Pedophilia is well outside the baseline of a normal human mind. It is generally accepted that such people are mentally unwell and need therapy. That therapy will not cure that desire, but what it does do is show them how to deal with that urge in a safe and constructive manner, because that urge is intrusive and /will not go away/. Simply telling them to think about something else is not dealing with the problem, it is avoiding it. Like all problems, avoiding them does not make them go away.

If a person develops a rape obsession, they are mentally unwell and should seek therapy. However, the obsession itself is not a crime. /Acting/ on that obsession is a crime. If we start shaming people for what they think in the privacy of their own brain, well, thought police are a thing in dystopian novels for a reason. However, if the person is incapable of controlling their urges even with an outlet, they are a danger to others and need hospitalization.

Could we prevent certain people from developing these mental illnesses at all by removing these stories? Certainly. But such incidences of malbehavior are like freak accidents on a highway. The solution to this is not to ban all cars, but to encourage safe driving and car maintenance to minimize the chance of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Prohibition of vices, whatever they may be, have never worked. If they did, we would have seen solid evidence after however many thousands of years of history.

I find this an especially sad situation. A while back, I heard a story on NPR about a young adult man who was aware of his urges and absolutely did not want to act on them, but he was finding it very difficult to get support and therapy. I want to say that he'd started an online support group for others like him who were aware of their problem and wanted therapy so they would not act and harm a child, but it was very tough to get actual psychological support simply because none of them had committed a crime.

The sad fact is that our society is such that we fail to recognize those that are doing their best to live as normal a life as they can and get them the therapy they need while someone who /has/ hurt a child through their actions is afforded therapy as a hope that they won't act again.

Tens of thousands of people people are barely mentally unfit, but never find out, and all it takes is just the right thing to push them over the figurative edge. Having such stories that say it's alright to have sex with this underage girl/boy, or how it's fine to rape this girl/boy since everything will work out. While the mentally fit know different, many mentally unfit people will somehow think it makes sense. That's why I want these stories banned, and deleted. I don't care if it's "kinky", it's wrong.
