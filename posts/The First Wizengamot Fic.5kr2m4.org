Which Fic was the first of the hereditary seats, and the lords and ladies, and all the other parts of the Wizengamot that are commonly seen? I know that it is not Canon, but who made it up?


** I know there are elements of the current trope in linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin4) and the series that follows, but I believe most of that came into play in the second fic of the series, and possibly post-dates HBP.

The very first fics with the earliest versions of the trope would have appeared in the days immediately following OotP. Several major archives from that period are defunct, and more work has been lost due to the LJ Deletegate and FFN Purge. Any attempt to identify a singular work as trope namer would thus be nearly impossible.

That said, I was active in fandom at the time, and the Sirius rescuing Harry fics I like feature this quite heavily. While it may not be the modern form, Robin4's take has definitely influenced the type quite heavily and is recommended to those interested in its development.

Another early crucial fic, neutral's Clawtracks of a Star, now only exists in fragmentary form, and the posted chapters do not contain any examples of the trope. Brief references are made in the same author's Of Western Stars (epilogues), but are not cohesive enough to be defining without the missing material from Clawtracks.

Erm, sorry for the scholarly approach that devolved into. Unbroken Universe is good stuff, though.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** I doubt there's a definitive first fic but like a couple of things in the fandom it might have just slowly developed as a concept from what was mentioned in canon up until now where we have all these different ideas of what the wizengamot is and what powers it has, etc. Also from what I've seen many interpretations (like the one you describe) seem to be based on the House of Lords (UK upper parliamentary house) so maybe that is a possible inspiration for some writers.

That said, Tyrant is a relatively old fic which goes somewhat into depth? I'm sure there will be earlier ones though.
