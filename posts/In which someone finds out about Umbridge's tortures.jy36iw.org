During Harry's detentions with Umbridge in /OotP/, Umbridge forces Harry to magically carve the words "I must not tell lies" into the back of his hand with a Blood Quill. In the book, Harry suffers silently, not wanting to give Umbridge the satisfaction of seeing him complain and not wanting to talk to Dumbledore due to being angry at him for keeping Harry in the dark, and lets her continue her reign unchallenged.

...But what if he told a trusted adult about what Umbridge was doing, like Professor McGonagall and/or Dumbledore, and took one of them (or anybody else) with him under the Invisibility Cloak? Even with the jackass attitude the Ministry has in this book, surely they wouldn't be able to get away with mutilating children, right?

I should note that I've read something like this where [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10235255][it's Hermione who blows the whistle]], and I thought it was pretty in-character for Hermione, but I'm looking for something where Harry tells one of his professors about it.


** I forget the title, but there was one I read into where Harry did blow the whistle and it made things /so much worse/. Instead of punishing Umbridge for torturing children, the Ministry said that Harry did that to himself, which was simply more evidence of how disturbed and unhinged he was. Now that he was self-harming, he obviously needed to be committed to a secure, isolated cell in Saint Mungo's. It was more than a bit dark.

** While I would love that to be the case - someone finds out, ousts Umbridge and send her to Azkaban for being vile and horrible ... reality I fear is that nothing, absolutely nothing, would happen. Unless we consider some form of vigilante justice.

In British schools corporal punishments were banned in 1986. Very recently. Wizarding world seems always at least half a century behind. It is most likely that it was very much legal, but not practiced due to Dumbledore banning the practice.

Heck we even get a throw away comment how Arthur was hanged by his ankles and still has the scars. The Ministry officially through Education Degree over turned Dumbledore's ban. Remember how happy Mr. Filtch was being able to torture students again?

So, ministry being backward shithole, where human rights mean nothing, due process is practically non existing (Minister can execute people on sight without any trial or judicial process, Wizangemot actually going through with a hearing on underage magic, Sirius Black never having a day in court, ...)

So yeah, legally speaking, I fear there would be absolutely zero consequences. If not, a new Education Degree would have been issues immediately.
