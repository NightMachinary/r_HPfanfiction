:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to find the fic where harry doesn't go to hogwarts till fourth year when his name gets called from the goblet. Think the dursleys replied and said he couldn't go or something like that stopped him, I don't think he knows about magic? Maybe. He has to work for his keep with the dursleys and when he finally says he's leaving the carpenters (or something like that) he's working for give him a load of wood and the table he made. He also made mosaics that I think got sold in in the wizarding world and we're highly sought after. Any thanks would be great!


** Ooh, I know this one! It was pretty good. Gimme a mo', I think I can find it.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
