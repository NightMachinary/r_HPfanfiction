So lets say you had to do a Harry Potter fanfic in Harry's time where Voldemort isnt in any way shape of form an antagonist. Hes just gone hes not coming back. You can make up any reason why he cant maybe even though horcruxes prevent you from dying you can never live. Maybe he never made the horcruxes. Maybe he becomes Harry Potter but chooses to not be evil this time around idk. James and Lilly don't have to have died Harry doesn't have to be the boy who lived. In fact depending on how you want to do this story there doesn't even need to be a boy who lived. Its all up to you.

But what you do need is a extended plot in that world where Voldemort doesn't exist and never will again. What plot would you come up with? It doesn't have to be in Harry's 7 years it can also be earlier say in the time immmediately after he dissappeared. If he was never born or was born but never became Voldemort/the Dark Lord/near immortal supervillain that works too.

If you don't have your own idea but have a fic you've read that would more or less be your answer feel free to link it.

Edit: also no Grinderwald. Dark Wizards can still exist like the Death Eaters can and they can have this shared ideology. But its not like any individual one is immortal or anything. Or any individual one is the issue and once dealt with can never be replaced by another death eater.


** ** Gellert Grindelwald has entered the chat **

There's also Herpo the Foul and his horcruxes.

You mean without another Dark wizard?

Give him a dream; something he wants to accomplish and make that the plot. Quidditch player Harry, duelist Harry, potions/charms master Harry.

*** Sorta there can be dark wizards even powerful ones but not like Grindewald or Voldemort like this one unstoppable person. But more like the Death eaters as a group promoting toxic ideaology i should clarify that

** The Pureblood Pretense series by murkybluematter is based on the idea that Tom Riddle is still a terrible human being, but instead of becoming a violent, vicious mass murderer, he decided to apply himself and go into politics/government. So taken to its natural conclusion, Tom Riddle ends up as the highly charismatic leader of magical Britain's own pureblood supremacist political party.

The story itself follows the Harry Potter-esque character, and Riddle's machinations still seem to underlie all/most of the conflicts.

As a side note, this is one of my favorite fanfic series because of its ideas about what a political-savvy Tom Riddle would do to magical Britain. It also avoids rehashing canon events in favor of original conflicts, which is nice.

Spoiler-ish in relation to your main post: Riddle's diary is a thing, and the Riddle that comes out of the diary does call himself Voldemort just like canon. So "Voldemort" technically does exist in these stories, but isn't that prominent.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** Here's my idea for HP without Voldemort:

Tom Riddle wasn't a psychopath so he just became a normal ambitious student, maybe he's teaching Defense, maybe he's campaigning for the rights of muggle raised students like himself, maybe he's running a magical orphanage for orphans and muggleborns with abusive parents.

The Pureblood ideology still exists, they just don't have an insanely powerful leader so they mostly just try to gather political support, pass laws that discriminate against muggleborns, maybe kill some muggles when they think that they can get away with it but they don't wear masks and do terrorism.

So there'd be a lot of political division over the question of if muggleborns should be helped or rejected, there might be some extremists who go as far as trying to murder the opposition, but it wouldn't escalate into a civil war.

By the Marauder era there would be a lot of tension with Slytherins mostly supporting the anti-muggle side but there wouldn't be recruiting of soldiers straight out of Hogwarts, apart from that things still happen the same and James and Severus hate each other.

By the time Harry is born, there wouldn't be a Prophecy since there's no Dark Lord so they wouldn't be hiding and Harry would just grow up with his parents.

During the Hogwarts years there'd still be the Slytherin/Gryffindor rivalry with the same ideologies but there wouldn't be the annual adventures, and Harry would just be a normal kid.

** If you want a more lighthearted take you could always go the route of a Slice-of-Life, Coming of Age story about a young boy growing up in a literally magical society; and all the trials, tribulations, and hurdles one can expect from someone going through puberty in a co-ed boarding school.

** I hope this doesn't sound cringe, because depending on how someone went about making this it would definitely be cringe, but I would turn the whole thing into a "coming-of-age" story.

Instead of dealing with War, Death and Disaster, Harry has to deal with friends, girls (or boys, I don't judge) and growing up. The whole dynamic of the world could be so different, with things like the Golden Trio never existing and Draco not being a prick (though that would be a bit of a stretch).

But the thing I like a lot about this is that, if you're a good writer, you can make things the way /you/ want them and make them realistic. You're an avid Dramione Shipper? They're now the cutest couple in Hogwarts. You think Snape could take a liking to Luna? He's now giving her tutoring sessions during his spare time. You want to see some more student events? Hogwarts now does a dress-up for World Book Day. Obviously, you would need to go about it right, randomly changing things for plot convenience isn't very nice to read, but you could make gradual changes that lead to your vision.

To quote Thanos, /"Reality can be whatever I want"./

But hey, that's just me.

*** I mean yes true There are for example shipping dynamics i do like in concept and shipping dynamics i dont like it concept. But when i dislike a ship its usually both because the canon dynamic I don't like/ see potential in and I dont like the types of stories the fans of the ship tell. Some of my favorite ships in fic are ones I dislike in canon but I like the stories told with them in fanon.

But yes you have alot of possibilities here I just wanted to see what people would like to do. But yes personally I think Id like reading about slice of life in this fantasy world. In fact the books kinda have that appeal to them anyway especially the first 3.

*** No I mean I wouldn't be opposed to that story either. But he can exist its just hes going to dissappear at some point like he did in the books ( you can make this happen for different reasons if you want) . And after that will never come back again. Hes not in the diary or on the back of anyones head and doesnt ever get ressurected.

**** Ah gotcha. In that case I would imagine it would actually be a lot like canon. Voldemort is after all believed to be death by most people. There are a few followers that anticipate him returning if I recall correctly, but given their reaction in the graveyard people like Lucius Malfoy never actually thought he would resurrect. That being said people like Lucius Malfoy and Umbridge are prominent figures in magical society and still are very much anti muggleborn/creatures. So I'd think that a political fic around that would be a realistic non Voldemort thing.

Building on that idea that despite Voldemort being gone the ideology is still very prominent I can also see a pro Muggleborn Dark Lord rising up. Imagine a Lucius/Umbridge alliance rising to prominence in the ministry and introducing a ton of laws against werewolves, muggleborns, creatures, etc. Effectively politically legitimatising the Death Eater/Voldemort ideology. A muggleborn (either an OC or someone like Hermione, or even Harry as a muggle raised) is fed up with the mistreatment and launches a counter movement against the purebloods.

***** So like the situation we had in books 5 and 7 but started earlier and more politics and world building is required in the plot instead of horcrux hunting. And possibly things starting earlier than book 5 ?

****** Yes. I can even see Dumbledore stepping down from his political functions with the threat of Voldemort removed. Which could accelerate the rise to prominence of the pure blood faction. So by the time first year rolls around I'd imagine we are already seeing a lot of influences from that leadership.

But theoreticallly a flawed human weakened very vunerable and confused Riddle could exist. As long as he never became Voldemort or a voldemort equivalent thing
