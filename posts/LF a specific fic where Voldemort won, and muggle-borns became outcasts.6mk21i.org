James died but Lily lived, and I think she adopted Hermione, as she was taken away from her parents.

Edit: More info - From what I can remember, Snape was headmaster of Hogwarts, and Rosier was like the star Slytherin 7th year, who was chosen in the Triwizard Tournament. Harry, of course, was chosen out of the oblivion, but Voldemort wasn't the one entered him. Voldemort was around at some times, more particularly in the latter parts of the fic. And I'm pretty sure Ron was a bully, as the Weasleys aligned themselves with Voldemort during the war, and Ron believed all that pureblood nonsense.


** I recall a short fic where that more or less happened. It was a very well-written, gut-wrenching experience. On account of the haunting descent into Nazi-Germany vibes of Voldemort's reign.
