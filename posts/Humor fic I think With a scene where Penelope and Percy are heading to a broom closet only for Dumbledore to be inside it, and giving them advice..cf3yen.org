I remember Penelope asking Dumbledore why he was in the closet, only for him to begin to give advice. I can't remember the fic though.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13256350/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Scrambled-Sorting][Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting]] This is the fic that are you looking for. The scene is in the chapter 10.

**** I glad you like it! While the fic will get more serious as it goes on, I have resolved to keep the fic humourous.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
