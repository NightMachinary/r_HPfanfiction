  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

**** No, not at all. This Harry doesn't even have those types of thought yet, as he is still biologically 11. It's more like a secret society than anything else at the moment, with Hermione, Daphne, Ginny, and Luna.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** What's bothered me the most so far was that one particular contract that Harry bought late in the story.

***** The situation itself fits into the AU just fine. But Harry hasn't canceled the debt, and I really don't like what that says about his character.

******* True, and I guess reading other fics has gotten me used to memory meddling. But slavery (indentured servanthood?) seems to be on a whole different level to me. It's what I would expect from a death eater/dark aligned charecter, not a gray character. FWIW, house elves bother me too (even in canon), and so does this Harry's treatment of them.

And I agree that she's in a better position than she was, but I think that Harry could have put her in an even better one.

******** But I think the direction of movement really matters here. Bringing someone from freedom into indentured servitude seems like a Death Eater move, but what Harry does is in a whole other category. I agree with you that maybe he could do more to help her (but honestly, he could do a lot for a lot of people far worse off than her considering his abilities, political capital and money) - but I think the door is still left open for a possible rehabilitation. It may even be argued that a gradual acclimatization to 'normalcy' might be more healthy for a girl in her situation.
