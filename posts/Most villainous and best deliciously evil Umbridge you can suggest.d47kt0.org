An Umbridge that makes you hate her as much as Rowling has managed to make you hate her with her kittens and link obsession and everything coupled with her disgusting personality. No good umbridge by the end of the story, and no crack fanfiction.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/706473][Kitten Claws and Mudblood Wars]] linkao3(706473) created an incredibly disturbing backstory for Umbridge (it written in 2008, so isn't compliant with the later Pottermore content). Warnings for implied rape, animal cruelty, child abuse, and character death.
