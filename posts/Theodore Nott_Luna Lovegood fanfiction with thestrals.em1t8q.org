So in the vein of shipping heroes with (anti?)villains, I've become interested in exploring a Nott/Luna dynamic. Mainly because they've both witnessed death at a young age (hence the thestral connection) and are both self-confident loners who don't rely on others' validation.

Some of the fanfics I've read pairing them are a little disappointing. Theo sees her and instantly falls in love, she's his manic pixie dream girl who comforts him and doesn't angst at all herself. Thestrals barely factor in (even though it would make for a great initial/unlikely connection).

Has anyone found a fanfic that does my rarepair justice? ðŸ˜…

It's an old fic (and I haven't read it in a long time!), but it popped into my head when I read your post. I don't remember if thestrals have much presence, but they do feature.
