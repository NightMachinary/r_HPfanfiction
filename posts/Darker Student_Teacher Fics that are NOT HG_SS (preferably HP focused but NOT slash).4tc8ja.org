It seems like every time someone asks for teacher/student, especially darker writing, everyone pulls out HG/SS. I get there are a TON of that pairing, but I honestly have never liked it. If its not that, it seems to always be Slash HP/SS or GW/SS. Neither of which interest me.

So after seeing another thread yet again dissolve into HG/SS, I am honestly curious if there are any other ones, preferably Harry focused.

So... are there any decent darker Teacher/Student stories that are NOT HG/SS, and preferably have Harry as the student, but NOT slash? Like a HP/Aurora, or HP/OC, or even HP/MM?

  complete: To protect Harry Professor McGonagall relives her teenage years. What seemed like a good idea at first is swiftly becoming a bad one. This is a rather twisted romantic adventure that is sure to please. I think. Read Please:

*** I have no issue with Lemons, and in fact, welcome them if well done. I am someone who prefers mature fics that dont hold back because the author is afraid of offending, and as such, enjoy well done lemons or even some smut. But it still needs to have solid story around it.
