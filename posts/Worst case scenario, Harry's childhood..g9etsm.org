So i just read this. And am now wondering if there are more like it. Preferably something with Dumbledore's reaction.


** Worst case scenario? There's a fic on AO3 where Harry dies that night on the Dursleys' doorstep due to exposure.

Another would be that Petunia is ill that morning causing Vernon to be late for work. He rushes out the door without looking where he's stepping and /squelch/. Harry dies of blunt force trauma.

*** Do You have links? As great as the tagging system is on ao3, the stories still need to be properly tagged for it to be useful.

**** No, unfortunately, I couldn't find the one I'd read, but there's this one on FFN that I found while searching for it, that's similar (but not as good) which is part of an one-shot collection

** Not nearly as dark but here's an [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15271581/chapters/36999738][Obscurial Harry fic]] that's good. Emphasis on Dumbledore's reaction too.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

** I mean, the real worst case scenario would be where the Dursley's find out that Harry can't be killed for narrative convenience reasons, and go ham trying tom put the freakish monster in their midst down.
