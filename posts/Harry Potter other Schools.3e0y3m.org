As long as it doesn't include fem harry and it is complete or being continuously updated, please post.


** For loose definitions of "continuously updated," this fits the bill. It's fairly popular though so you might've already read it.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

  What if someone helped Harry before he went to Hogwarts? Would that make a difference? Well, I think so; so here is my impression of what MIGHT happen.
