I want to write a fanfiction accurately depicting Draco Malfoy's angst post war but I figured I'd ask you guys how to accurately write his character. The popular opinion among everyone about what his personality would be like is how I'll portray his character. Also, if you have the time to answer, how should I portray his relationship with the Golden Trio after the war?

Thank you!


** Draco is a guy who has been taught since he could walk how a "proper" pureblood of prestige should behave in wizarding society. He should be solemn with a quiet shame to him, but never openly and desperately repentant. Aloof and distant but never rude, especially to the trio. Making strides to become better, but always keeping the Malfoy pride and working to restore his name to good standing.

Draco is not someone who should have an epiphany of inner goodness sprouting out 2 weeks after the war, or come begging for redemption at the feet of the heroes. It's gotta be the work of a lifetime, bit by bit, and 99% of named characters shouldnt even bear witness to it.

*** Agree with this, should be angry/ashamed/resentful...as opposed to prewar when he was a bully just for the sake of it. I see him ignoring the golden trio and only speaking to them when he has to-but I guess that wouldn't be the most interesting story. I see him grudgingly respect Harry, ignore Hermione, and feel like Ron would be more likely to provoke him...he was always especially vicious to Ron.

**** Well yeah, I think post war Draco stories lend themselves to heavy introspection and soul searching style storytelling more so than interactions with a whole lot of people who probably don't want to be around him at all. At best such things could work with former death eater classmates/families and during the high society gatherings he would most certainly still attend.

** The only advice I can really give is to look up a few different videos of ex-KKK/Westboro Baptist people talking about their journey and think about how Draco (whatever personality you give him) would experience that.

** I know that the first rule for any author is NOT to read a story which is exactly like the one he wants to write, but “Exile by bennybear” linkffn(6432055) is so good it is worthy even destroying your story.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I think there are three general directions that Draco could develop. The first one is he, having been raised on stories of the 'glory days' under Voldemort, is utterly appalled at being a part of it first hand. Talking about 'putting the mudbloods in their place' is one thing, but actual torture and murder of people that you may have known for years just because of their birth is quite another. Then there is that fact that Voldemort and many of his followers like Bellatrix were sadistic and cruel even to the 'loyal', and the final straw was being forced to murder Dumbledore, a man he respected if not always agreed with, or have his entire family murdered. This is the most sympathetic version, when he goes through the war hating himself for all that he does, but having no choice in the matter. In your fic it could manifest as severe trauma and guilt from the get-go, and also being shunned by many of the former Death Eaters or sympathisers for being 'cowardly' or 'weak' during the war.

The second way is having him have an epiphany afterwards. With Voldemort's defeat, everyone who was singing his praises either changes their tune or goes quiet. Now out of the echo chamber of his parents' social circle and Slytherin house he begins to re-examine everything and does a lot of serious soul searching. In this you can describe the process of him changing his world view, and I like the idea in another comment of researching people recovering from real-life cults.

Finally there is the unrepentant Draco. He genuinely sees nothing wrong with Voldemort's ideology. Just because he was eventually killed didn't invalidate his worldview. In this you have Draco trying to fit in to a world that he doesn't understand, and he may or may not be plotting to resurrect the cause again.

** This is an interesting question to be sure.

At the heart of it, I think you should look at his actions in /Deathly Hallows./

He doesn't turn Harry, Ron and Hermione in, even though it's hardly a stretch to say that his attempt to deny who they are isn't convincing.

He knows who they are. His body language and hesitancy to confirm this is still as good as fingering them. But he still doesn't say "This is Harry Potter."

And then in the Battle of the Room of Requirement, Draco only tried to capture. He didn't shoot to kill. And Harry and Ron and Hermione saved his life from the fiendfyre.

You could pull the nightmare angle--have him be haunted by nightmares of fiendfyre and that night in Malfoy Manor. Draco be haunted by the idea that had things been just a little different, Harry would have died and Voldemort would rule.

** Not sure how helpful this will be, but these are some of the things I like to see when I read Draco (Drarry shipper):

His post-war angst should manifest in a completely different way than his other angsty demonstrations throughout the series, and should be written with this in mind. The things he drew confidence in as a child are completely ripped away from him, and with it, a significant loss in confidence. He still walks with a straight back, but speaks when spoken to, and never more than a few sentences, especially in those first few years following the war. He's very much driven by his emotions, but I think after the war he becomes more introspective. I think the key thing to nail with Draco is his relationship with himself, and how it evolves as he navigates this new world where he's at the bottom of barrel. Also lots of existential discussion of morality and nuture vs. nature with Draco-centric fics, and they tend to be so interesting to read!! Like Harry, he has a tendency to obsess, and I think giving him something to focus his post-war anxiety and confusion into is a must. Love a good down-and-out but driven Draco!!

As for his Golden Trio relationship, I think outwardly he's respectfully distant towards them, but is internally very embarrassed whenever he has to be around them. I feel as though neither side has the same level of aggression left towards the other, but this is a pretty boring and mature relationship to write lol so I guess their relationship depends on the direction you want to take the fic!

** I think at first he is still quite resentful towards the victors because it would be quite soul-crushing to see that after centuries of prestige, the name Malfoy would fall in complete disgrace at the hands of those he was taught to hate. On the other hand he'd have a resentment towards his parents, particularly his father, for destroying the family prestige, for forcing him in the position to become a Death Eater and for not making good on his promise that the Malfoys would be at the top in Voldemort's world. He would mostly keep it in him because he's too proud to acknowledge what a failure Voldemort's campaign was. He also needs his family for moral support when he is hated both by the society for being a former Death Eater and by his former peers for getting off lightly despite Lucius being one of Voldemort's top lieutenants for many years. Gradually this resentment would towards himself and gradually acknowledge that he deserves the ostracization of the society. He would probably have a brief battle with alcoholism or substance abuse. However I'd say he remain quite stoic outwards with occasional snide remarks when someone is particularly mean to him. Not because he is so powerful, but because he is too proud to reveal and even acknowledge to himself his internal conflicts.

** I think there are really two important post-canon points to note: first, that Draco remains affectionate towards his father while also realizing Lucius' faults (a delicate balance to depict in and of itself) and also the fact that he marries a pureblood girl whose family is a member of the Sacred 28, but who doesn't believe in the traditions of blood purity.

So he's a little reformed, but not. Not at the expense of sacrificing the relationships and status he's always had.

As for his relation with the Golden Trio... I don't think he has one, nor should he. He has money and connections that those three could never fathom, he has enough going on that he never has to speak to Harry, Ron, or Hermione until their children's lives overlap if he doesn't want to. And why would he want to?

** I would look at people who grew up in similar ways and how they transformed. Obviously, we don't have any direct corollaries, but you might consider looking at:

- Megan Phelps-Roper (grew up in Westboro Baptist Church and left as an adult)
- Prussian Blue: band name for twin sisters. It's agenda was promoting white nationalism and Neo-Nazism. Their mother created this group when they were just 11 years old and they became pretty well known (in the wrong circles). They stopped touring when they were 14 and renounced their childhood beliefs when they were 19.
- Three of the founders of Life After Hate were heavily involved in hate groups in their teens. Now, they work to keep others from falling down the same path of violence and hate.
- Daryl Davis is a Black man who goes to KKK rallies. He talks a lot about the kinds of people he meets there and the work he does to deradicalize them.

Obviously, you're writing fiction, but you can take inspiration from real life people who have made similar transformations.
