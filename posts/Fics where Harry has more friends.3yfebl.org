I'm looking for any fics where Harry has a broader friend group. I don't really care how that happens, it could be a Voldemort never existed AU so he's just a normal teenager or he was sorted elsewhere and just met more people or he is more cunning about needing to have more allies. Whatever it is, I just want Harry with more than two friends.


** Well, there's /The Butterfly Effect./

Due to circumstances unforeseen, Harry Potter is taken by Hagrid away from the Dursleys and to Sirius Black. With Black under arrest, Alastor Moody sees the writing on the wall, and asks a young Auror named Kingsley Shacklebolt to raise Harry and help him prepare for the war that is sure to come.

Harry makes friends with the old crowd of familiar faces, plus a couple of Original Characters. At the current point in story, his squad consists of /eight/ students. While not the best grammatically, this is still a surprisngly good fic with a Stronger Harry that actually makes sense.

****** Funny too. I usually dislike Sue Harry, where he's amazingly powerful for no good reason--though I love a well-written Peggy Sue story. But here, it makes sense for Harry to be so strong and stand-offish. Moody and Kingsley have raised him for war and Wizarding Uganda has a totally different mind-set about how to harness magic.

*** I was really enjoying it until the Imperius family oath thing. If people could make binding commitments while under Imperius, the HP universe would be entirely different.

**** That's true, but then again, /Butterfly Effect/ notes that the Ministry of Magic is terribly corrupt.

The fic is not my favorite by any means, but to my knowledge, it's the only one of it's kind in having Mad-Eye or Kingsley raise Harry. It's usually Weasleys or Sirius or Remus.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/][Hogwarts' Dawn]] is the first that comes to mind. It is incomplete (but hopefully still a WIP). It features a time abusing Harry who hires the Weasley twins as life coaches.

On the lighter side, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World]]. Humorous and complete, but may feel crackish at times. Involves quite a large cast of characters. It utilizes some tropes, but not in overtrod ways.
