:END:
I am looking for 2 separate fics.

Both Snarry

1)

Snape is a veela and Harry is his mate

Snupin in the back ground - they move next door to Snape's chambers

A lot of "submissive noises made"

There's a week part of second part of bond, Harry walks into other room and becomes desolate, then at the end of the week he is perched on Snape's lap and wearily looking at the floor

They meet Snape's parents, his mam adores Harry, and his dad prevents Snape fighting Sirius when he knocks Harry over in dog form

​

2)

Snape and Harry bonded

They have to live in the chamber of secrets together

Harry feels more for Snape than Snape does him, so the bond hurts him

I think Snape was assaulted so he is afraid of touch/love?

It takes a while for him to become aware of the extent to which Harry feels bond.

​

Can anyone help?
