So, I'm looking for good Bellatrix fics, in the sense meaning well written. I'd also prefer to have them make more to her character than crazy evil Bellatrix. I mean, I'm fine with her being a bad person if that's what you guys have to offer, but I don't want her to be a one dimensional bad guy. I want more from her reasons to be evil than "I heart the dark lord forever".

I'm also down with good or neutral Bellatrix, as long as the fic backs up the character change with reasons, and doesn't just go "Yeah, I know that outside of being toasted by an enraged mother, your last memory of Bellatrix largely involves torturing a main protagonist, but she's totes good now. People even call her Trixie, see how good she is? She might have tortured and murdered a couple of people, but she swore on her motes she wont do that anymore."


** Is alternate universe ok? In linkffn(9498559) Bellatrix was sorted into Hufflepuff and became best friends with Molly Prewett (later Weasley of course). She's still super loyal, focused, and a vicious fighter. I really enjoyed how fleshed our her character is in this one.

** It's pretty hard to make her character likeable because of all the things we know she's done and capable of. So most fics with her as an MC takes place supposedly before she went Death Eater. Like linkffn(passageways by jerryway69; Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence; Delenda Est)

Or completely AU like linkffn(Murder Most Horrid)

*** Thank you for the recs, I haven't read Stepping Back or Murder Most Horrid.

I was sort of hoping for a cool take on the Bellatrix we know, I think a well written bad Bellatrix would be really interesting. I just reject the common motive of being in love with Riddle. There has to be more to her than angsty one sided romance with a guy who devolves as he ages. I guess I just want to read someone else's interpretation on how her twisty mind works.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
