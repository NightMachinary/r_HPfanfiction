I know Dumbledore is probably the most tolerant person in the series, but write something funny, where Dumbledore is like a loved, but racist grandfather, as he was born in the 1880s when the world was different.

Bonus points if you have historical accuracy.


** It's heavily implied that pure-blood-ism completely replaced conventional racism. I mean, Pansy Parkinson, of all people, is implied to have been friends with (or at least on non-enemy speaking terms with) Parvati before she was sorted into Gryffindor.

Racism just looks silly when you can be prejudiced in favor of a group with literal superpowers, instead of imaginary ones.

  ‘Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway?' shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. ‘Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head?'

  Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly, ‘Spread out, then, and let's see what we can do ...'

I'd say their xenophobia exists at multiple levels. Seriously, when is it ever logical in the series? Plus, this prompt shouldn't be taken seriously. I just wanted funny responses.

I mean just imagine a Dumbledore that rants about those goblins. Pure comedic gold.
