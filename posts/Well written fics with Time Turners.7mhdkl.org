As the title states. Only condition is that they aren't use to go all back to the past from the beginning of Harry Potter. Want more fics that use time turners like Concentric Wavelength and make sure that the same events happen (intentional or not like in the fic) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths]]


** Ha!

I think your 2 requirements are mutually exclusive.

But good luck finding one.

** The fact of the matter is that using repeatable stable time loops in your story is one of the hardest things you can do. It can easily remove all sense of tension. Got ambushed? No problem, time turner your way out. Something went wrong? No problem, time turner back and fix it. Forgot your quill? Time turner. This is the problem Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality ran into, and the turners had to be removed to get the plot going again. Frankly, I can't think of a single way to make an interesting story using time travel without descending into House of Leaves level madness.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  Harry takes a chance in hope of saving Sirius from the Veil, assisted by Luna and some stolen Time Turners. Working with Luna comes with its own complications, though.

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

** Saw the title and immediately thought of concentric wavelenths (which I helped beta waybackwhen...), but apparently that's the story that made you make this thread. Other than that one, I can't think of any other stories that uses timeturners as a recurring plot element, and uses them well.

** Something like in this fic? linkao3(The Boy Who Died A Lot) Snape is given a time turner in Harry's first year after Harry dies in the forbidden forest. He has to keep going back and saving him from many ridiculous and not so ridiculous deaths as the universe attempts to kill Harry (although the end result is the canon timeline). Really hilarious and well written, although the end part of the fic has slash.
