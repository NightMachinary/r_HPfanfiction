** I think you could make this magically more interesting and less nationalistic and less pro-American empire

Have the magical government of America basically be the safe haven for all muggleborn, exiles and magical immigrants that the rest of the world saw as useless.

This would lead to a crazy amount of diferent magical traditions, abilities and cultural mishmash

Due to this however the American government is actually very aware of them, because the magical government of America can't really completely police their large territory completely

As such the magicals and the American government are in a sort of cold war, with the American government trying to either control or kill all magicals they can find. And they have their own brainwashed magicals to help them.

Due to this the ICW hates them. Because they technically broke the statue of secrecy.

It's only really the fact that the last time they tried putting sanctions on the magical government of America they got an undead horde, an ancient Chinese curse, a bunch or actual Zombies and an angry spirit God on the main premises of the ICW why they haven't actually done something about it

  If there's anything to say about the USA, they are very protective of both their guns and ancient spells which allow you to summon tornado!

Excuse you. You forgot the "summon bacon and oil" spell, as well as the "Bald Eagle singing Murica Fuck Yeah" one

** I like this a lot, it's wide open so it could totally be this way, I'm just commenting here because you got me thinking.

If native Americans had magic, and the colonizers didn't, I don't think they would have been nearly as successful as they were. So amongst the European murder-immigrants there had to have been a contingent of European wizards, who presumably did a lot of murdering and replacing like the historical muggle ones did, and then spread out across the country in a similar manner to the muggles. Their culture would diverge from there, but there's not really any reason they'd be able to leave the whole bloodedness thing behind without a lot of effort, unless maybe muggle culture infected them such that skin color was much more important?
