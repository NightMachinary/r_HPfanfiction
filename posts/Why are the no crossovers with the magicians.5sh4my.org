*** I tried reading the books by Lev Grossman. The TV series is leagues better. (I explained why I didn't really like Grossman's books in another reply further down in this thread.)

**** I completely agree. The same thing happened with Dexter. It may be that Grossman had something to add to the literary world, but the TV show definitely tells a better story, IMO.

** I have a few ideas for just such a fic, but I think it's a pretty challenging project. It's difficult to reconcile the vastly different tones of the series. In HP, magic is (generally) a wondrous, joyful thing, which is sometimes 'twisted' by the bad guys and their Dark Arts. In The Magicians, it's more of a cold, clinical, dangerous force - I think at one point they even call it a 'mistake' left behind in the universe. And then you get to the very different mechanics of magic between the two series.

I think any good fic like this would need to be a syncretism more than a crossover.

*** Do you remember the part where they mention wands and how it's kind of embarrassing to use them? I could totally see it as the Brakebills magicians sort of looking down on the British wizards for doing fun, wand magic instead of serious wandless magic. The tones would be difficult, so maybe a good way to do it would have one character enter the other world, so to speak, and sort of slowly come around to their way of thinking. Maybe Quentin, with all his sharp cynicism, being introduced to magic that's genuinely fun and wonderful and learning to let loose and actually enjoy it.

But also the Harry Potter books exist in the Magicians universe, which is a little awkward.

**** That sounds like a pretty cheerful direction to take it in.

The main problem I see is that magic in TM seems much harder to learn and perform (they had to spend months in silence in Antarctica to get the hang of all the Circumstances), and it's heavily implied that you have to be depressed/egocentric/sadistic/fucked up in some way to be a magician. This is really different from HP's magic, which makes it hard to consolidate the two. I guess you could do an 'X goes to an alternate dimension' fic, but I don't like that trope very much.

** TL;DR: in my case, because I hated the series.

Longer, less polite version: I suspect that in my case it may be because Quentin is a self-absorbed, craven shit and I think I would much prefer a root canal over trying to write about him. (I'm talking about the series of books by the way; I've never seen, nor care to see the television series.)

The thing about /The Magicians/ is that it's basically a "grownup" version of /Harry Potter/, except without any of the wonder or joy and with a double-dose of tiresome, adult angst replacing the eye-rolling (yet amusing) teenage angst. The latter, you suffer because you know that this is the crucible young adults go through in order to grow into the competent, well adjusted people they will become. The former, you just have broken people who never really grew up.

Yes, I get that writing unpleasant stories about broken people is what MLA courses the world over teach you are the vital elements of quality prose, and yes, this author is a literary critic by training, so he knows his tropes, but it just isn't fun. If I want to read this kind of stuff (and I do on occasion), I'll go grab a John Banville novel and be done with it. I won't look for it in my escapist fantasy literature.

***** Definitely check out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(Grossman_novel)][the books]]. Only the first one is superficially similar to HP (teenager gets accepted to a university of magic), but with a very different (darker, more mature) flavour.

**** On the contrary, having tried to read the books, I found Quentin to be pretty much insufferable in the books. I vastly preferred the TV series, because I feel that they were able to much better depict / communicate Grossman's work than Grossman himself was. Grossman's writing style also seemed very fanfic-y to me, like he wrote it as a Harry Potter / Chronicles of Narnia crossover fanfic before changing it to an original novel (i.e. like the "Fifty Shades" series), and didn't really "grab" me like J.K. Rowling's books did.

***** I mean, the book is Grossman's work. You can like show-Quentin better, but he's certainly not who Grossman was trying to depict in the books. Not all MC's need to be righteous, upstanding heroes.

I don't think any characters other than Elliot and Margot are portrayed accurately in the show. Which is fine - the show is a different beast - but I dislike literally all the changes they've made (e.g. Penny, no Josh, Kady). Coupled with the really weird plot choices and awful pacing, it just feels... poorly written. I will admit that it has a few redeeming qualities - Marina made quite an interesting original villain.

****** Yes! The show is completely different, and a terrible render of the books. Though it is decent enough if you ignore most of the source material.

I got my girlfriend to watch the show and then had her listen to the Bramhall audiobook narration. She was appalled at how watered down and warped the show was. The books make deeper, more profound examinations of character and adversity than the show has gotten anywhere near. And much of the magic seems to be warped in the show as well, with only the most superficial examples of the complexity shown in the books.

Josh was sort of cameo'd in the show, albeit only briefly as a student of the missing class.

****** In the case of Grossman's writing: Neither do MC's deliberately need to be portrayed as insufferable, whiny characters who talk too much about boobs / thinking about how hot a character [who later on is shown to be some decades older than Quentin] is.

(Seriously, having watched the show first, Quentin's sexual attraction to Jane Chatwin in the books kind of grossed me out. Sure, it's realistic that a guy might think that, not knowing who she was, but is it /really/ necessary to add something like that to the narrative? It serves no purpose. A lot of the narrative also read as fanfic-y rambling / character introspection to me.)

That being said, I vastly prefer the show's Quentin, for several reasons, but the main ones being that it makes Quentin A) more bearable, less insufferable; B) because you're not in Quentin's head for the narrative most of the time; and C) it better humanizes / makes Quentin sympathetic and relatable. I also think it better depicts Quentin and Alice's relationship development as a whole.

One thing that I like, especially with shows like /The Walking Dead/ and /The Magicians/, is that they're not afraid to "break free" from the source material. You don't have to strictly adhere to the books or the comics, and can take artistic license to adapt it. For example, the finale for /The Magicians/ show, I feel, was a much better ending / fantastic twist, and I enjoyed it more than what happened in the books.

******* Eh, I feel like show-Quentin isn't so much likeable as he is a watered-down palatable-for-daytime-tv version of book-Quentin.

Personally, I found Quentin in the books far more interesting. He's an unhappy person despite being gifted with phenomenal power. He's finds out that he's a /magician/, but still clings to childish escapist fantasies about other worlds. He's a flawed, but not awful person, and you can really see how he's changed by the course of events. The show totally misses any depth of character - they all seem... one dimensional.

Also, I realize it's a limitation of the medium and budget, but the magic depicted in the show is just too amateurish and uninspired compared to what we see in the books. It just has too many flaws for me to see it as a good adaptation of the source material.

******** I actually found that while Quentin's character was less fleshed out on the show, the other characters actually seemed more complex and interesting. I loved loved loved the books, but I found that the show actually did a really good job focussing on and expanding on the other main characters. While it makes sense that the characters in the books aren't especially developed, given that Quentin sees them as sort of props for his own story, the tv show's more balanced approach really makes the cast as a whole more complex and relatable. And certainly the female characters are much more interesting and engaging on the show.

I didn't really enjoy the first couple episodes of the show, and was really annoyed with what they did with a lot of the plot points of the books, but once I started getting more into the first season I actually found it really compelling. It works very well as a tv show, when taken separately from the books. They're sort of hard to compare, given how different they are.

** I agree, I feel as if a Crossover, or maybe taking some concepts from The Magicians and applying it to Hogwarts (Battle-Magic, Weather Based/Elemental Magic being elaborated upon, Psionics, and specializations). While Harry Potter had good magic and an amazing world, The Magicians had amazing magic and a good world.
