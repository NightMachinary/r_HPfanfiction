Please, please, please someone write this! Stupid plot bunny is about to drive me nuts. I think Hermione would be confused and deny the accusations of either group, while Harry would merely be glad that his fans are no longer stalking him like wolves after a juicy deer. Except for Colin Creevey, who can't decide whether he wants his hero to stay a hero, or go Dark and let Colin be his chief Dark Lieutenant of media relations. Fred and George, of course, take great pleasure in bowing and scraping before the duumvirate, as they did when Harry was accused of being Slytherin's Heir.
