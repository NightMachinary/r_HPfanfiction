Smutty or not smutty, hurt/comforting other character, etc. just something where Barty is one of the main characters. Could even be something from Goblet of Fire.


** There is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20182612][Just Like Him]] where he saves Harry from the Dursley's when he's a child (he wanted to kill him but then, well, he could relate with the child. And he quite quickly understood that he was a horcrux). So, anyway, it's a nice Harry raised by someone else. They get adopted by the Blacks, get Sirius out of Azkaban, and basically try to get the Horcruxes to revive the Dark Lord. And Harry is shaping into a real equal for Voldemort, so, there is that. The only « problem » will probably be the ship (even if, for now, it's totally tame since Harry is a kid anyway). But, mostly, the platonic relationships Barty & Sirius and Barty & Harry are everything. (Plus, Barty is just so tragic, really).

So, anyway, I just love Barty character so much, it's really interesting to read.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** In fics where he isn't captured in the end of GoF, he usually becomes a really scary enemy even after Voldemort's death. Linkffn(Annals of Arithmancy) here he even tries to restart the death eaters years later with himself at the top.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

** There's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/427653/chapters/719529][The Well Groomed Mind]] which is a... gen, slightly indy Harry? With a very negative portrayal of Dumbledore and a lot of alternative character interpretations. Also it's in first person, for whatever reason. But I kinda like it. Has my absolute favourite version of Barty, even if he isn't quite himself most of the time (since this takes place during GoF). linkao3(427653)

  On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs.

*** There's also a sequel, but unfortunately that's on hiatus at the moment. But seconded, I love it.

I'm also writing one, but it'll be some time before I'm ready to put it up.

  When let off from Azkaban on a second chance, Barty Crouch Jr becomes Xenophilius Lovegood's worst nightmare, back to haunt him and his daughter. In order to fulfill forgotten vows, an ex-murderer and a war heroine are brought together in unconventional circumstances, leading to an unexpected romance. NOT an arranged marriage fic. Warnings enclosed within. COMPLETE!

  Her heart beat furiously in her chest as he began to lean down, his face creeping close until it filled her vision. Warm breath touched her face. "I can smell your fear." His eyes traced her face as he spoke. Then suddenly his tongue was swiping the tears from her skin, "taste it too."
