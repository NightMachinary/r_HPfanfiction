** I'd read the fuck out of an AU fusion like this. You'd just need the right family... the canon Weasleys are too wholesome (at least where Arthur and Molly are concerned) but it's not impossible.

** I'd love to read such a story!

I don't know if it can interest you, but there is a crossover fic where fem!Harry is MoD and is suddenly appearing just before Peaky Blinders' season 1. It seems to be rather interesting for the moment, even if there is only a few chapters.

**** I'm still so bad at linking stuff on the app! Sorry, sorry. (Also, is the bot used here only for ffn.net or also AO3 ?)

I think it's a bit slow updating because of exams or something but it seems pretty interesting, it's one of these stories I'm excited about reading.

***** It's for both. You can use =linkffn= or =linkao3=.

You can also just call =ffnbot!directlinks= which will search your message for URLs and get the link that way.

Or, even better, I can do it for you.

#+begin_quote
  Cast back in time, Harry isn't quite certain what to make of this period, nor the hell hole she's landed in. The one thing she is certain of is the fact that those bloody Shelbys are trouble, and for once she'd like to be left out of it. But the Devil doesn't play fair and neither does she. And if they want trouble, she'll give them literal hell.
