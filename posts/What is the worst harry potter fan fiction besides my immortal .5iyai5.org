  "Tell me how to get to this heaven place!" Harry cried wistfully, clasping his hands together. Sometimes, the wisdom of little ones is really amazing. We think we grownups know it all; but then God speaks through the mouths of little ones; and shows us how we are all mortals struggling along the path of life. Humility.

  "All you have to do is be saved. Do you want to be saved?"

  "I do, I do!" Harry squealed, jumping up and down.

  "Then pray the sinner's prayer!"

  Aunt Petunia tried to stop him; but she was powerless against Harry's pure, innocent, holy energy. Soon, Harry had said the prayer. Hagrid beamed happily.

  "You're a Christian now, Harry!" Hagrid cried proudly.

  Harry smiled but then interrogated, "But how do I be a Christian? I don't know how!"

  Hagrid grinned widely. "There is only one place to learn that-Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles!"

** Almost all fanfiction is "the worst" until you pull up the next one. I think it's far more rare to find a good fanfic than it is a bad one. (And I have no idea what you're talking about, My Immortal was hilarious and I love it to pieces)

As far as specific examples go, I don't think I have any committed to memory. I typically hit the back button and remove that negative influence from my life, never to think on it again.

I would not qualify it as "the worst", it's just that it gets so pedant I feel like I am mocked by the author.

It's a very peculiar feeling when you feel like an author of a story try to one-up himself every sentence of the way and you are witness to that. Feels like a parody, or a mockery and you're not quite sure you want to go along for the ride.
