What is the best pairing for Harry that isn't Ginny or Hermione?

I personally feel that neither of them are suitable for Harry, but that is an another discussion.

So, what is the best partner for Harry? (excluding those two)

And please provide an explanation to your response.

Cheers!


** Harry/Fleur is my OTP - Hold that

Why - Fleur is at first hard and angry at Harry rather than Star struck and hero worshiping him, Harry's first meeting with Fleur was him handing her food and then staring at Cho, he literally doesn't care or realize she is part Veela. Their biggest problems with finding a mate that isn't entirely there to use them isn't something they have to worry about.

Fleur I feel is very passionate and fiery and stacked With Harry's Passion and Chivalry I think they make a powerful couple one that while having their arguments they would bend but not break. Fleur would most likely be the direction of the pair, leading Harry in how to do the most good. She would likely run a charity with the supposed Potter/Black Wealth setting up events and fundraisers, she would organize with other groups to do the most good and move the money in the needed ways. Harry would be the stoic hero running off to be a Auror when he definitely doesn't need to be. Harry would be able to have his own life while also doing the most good he can with Fleur's Help, Fleur would become more than a Trophy wife/house wife. They would become both nobodies to the general public while to those who know would be able to see the good they do. They end up being well rounded and impressive people and not figures.

** I mean I do like the canon pairings, but I can see I wouldn't get anywhere with that.

I can see Harry with a Quidditch girl - Katie, Angelina, Alicia, etc. He bonded with Cho over that, and he seemed to get along very well with the original Quidditch team. I can also see him with Tonks - he seems to find her funny and interesting, and they too bonded over broomsticks. She's just a tad too old for him, so it would have to be well after he left Hogwarts.

I can't see him with Luna because he just finds her too weird and I think he needs someone fairly grounded. I also don't think you can ever be with someone if you don't truly respect them, and he doesn't take any of her theories or conspiracies seriously. People always say they have something in common in both losing parents, but it was in entirely different circumstances and loss alone isn't enough to bond people imo. I also can't see him with any of the other Gryffindor girls as he seems to find them irritating.

** Someone who can have fun and help him loosen up. Perhaps a fellow Quidditch player like others have said.

This will sound weird considering I used to read a /lot/ of H/Hr, but I no longer think Hermione would be very good for him.

*** I guess it really depends which Hermione characterisation you pick. HBP and DH where she uses the idiot ball as an anal plug won't do you much good, but if you choose her 4th or 5th-year characterisation, that would work out just fine. Sadly, most authors never progress her beyond the initial "or worse, expelled" state where she is nothing but studying and abiding rules.

** I'm a big fan of Harry/OC or Harry/Minor character. Some of the stories I enjoy the most are ones where this hypothetical OC or minor character get fleshed out and characterized incredibly well. Its part of why I enjoy the idea of Harry/Daphne, Harry/Katie, and Harry/Susan. The sky is the limit with any of those characters because there is little to no substantive backstory to any of them, but they have plot hooks that have a lot of potential (Slytherin and the sister of Astoria for Daphne, teammate and relatively unexplored Gryffindor for Katie who is also older than Harry, and the Hufflepuff connection for Susan).

EDIT: To add to this, I also enjoy these sort of pairings because they seem to feature less character bashing (at least in my experience). I can enjoy a Harry/Hermione story for sure, but those stories have a tendency to go all out dragging Ginny and Ron through the mud (especially Ginny).

  and the Amelia Bones Hufflepuff connection for Susan
#+end_quote

Please don't write this, it takes so much away from a character if her most important trait is being a useful connection. Susan should be more than just a tool for Harry to get in touch with Amelia, yet I have never read a story where she was not exploited in that regard (outside of some plotless smut). I feel like writing a subversion where Susan does not get along with Amelia every time I come across one of those "Amelia Bones saves the day" type of stories.

**** Isn't her aunt the only reason author's chose her over say, Hannah? I mean I get that her character should be more than "my aunt is head auror, marry me" but it's the only trait that makes her stand out. The defining reason for choosing Susan was just this. It makes sense that if the author includes Susan he goes down the rabbit hole of Amelia Bones, professional deus ex machina.

Of course any character that appears more than once should be more than a plot devise, and her not being exploited could be interesting.

***** Well, she is a blank. You can write her in any way you want. If you need the DMLE connection, you can have her as a friend without Harry banging her because then you want to tell the story how the DMLE does something, not the character interactions between Harry and Susan.

Like I said above, I often feel like writing a story where Susan is fed up with Umbridge, her Aunt who always follows the rules to the letter and the Ministry as a whole and decides to seduce Harry in some half-cooked teenage rebellion scheme. Because clearly, the best way to stick it to the Ministry is to have their public enemy number one fondle her for a few minutes. Throw in some firewhiskey and the whole thing becomes a cracky, humorous and yet cleansing tale of +"How I met your mother"+ the continued resistance after the DA got disbanded.

**** That's a really fair point. I probably shouldn't have included the Amelia connection in my list. Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever read a good story where anyone runs off to Amelia to be honest.

** If we stick to canon, then Luna. But I would argue while she's very good for Harry, he is NOT GOOD for her:

- He never takes her imaginary creatures seriously. He is laughing at her, instead of with her. This is no basis for long term relationship unless he changes.
- He never considers Luna physically attractive. You just don't diss your potential romantic interest having “mad protuberant eyes” in your thoughts!
- He doesn't like girls who don't play Quidditch.

If we venture out in fanfics, then it all depends on the story and writing. I honestly don't care if he's paired with Andromeda, Astoria, Bellatrix, Cho, Daphne, Fleur, Katie, Lavender, Lily Evans, Muggle OC, Narcissa, Patil Twins, Susan, or Tonks.

On the other hand, I absolutely don't want to see that Ice Queen of Slytherin Daphne Greengrass, and pairing with Lily Evans requires some serious work. [[/u/autumnSouls][u/autumnSouls]]?

**** If someone has an idea how Harry would react to waking up next to Lily, both of them naked and with a massive hangover (Easter holidays in her 6th year, after the Astronomy Tower), I have a plot idea. I just can't figure out how Harry would react.

I mean, Lily is fairly easy, time traveller I banged claims to be my child? Whatever, the "I will be dead in 4 years" part is way more worrying. But how does one write a meeting with the mother you never knew because she died when you were one?

** From canon besides Hermione I think Katie might be an option. Close in age, fun, quidditch she ticks all those boxes.

From a fanfic perspective I like Fleur and Daphne. I'd also like more Gabrielle and Astoria fics since those are very rarely used, but have similar potential as Fleur and Daphne.

** Ron.

No, seriously, I think Ron's pretty much Harry's ideal love interest. They have more genuine chemistry with each other than with anyone else, including Hermione or Ginny. They tell each other things that they don't tell anyone else, Harry's miserable when Ron isn't there, Ron was picked as "the person Harry would miss the most" in the Triwizard Tournament...

If Harry and Ron had been gay, OR if one of them had been a girl, then that's the pairing I would have gone for. I was marginally disappointed that my favourite Fem!Ron fic series, Weasley Girl, ended up not being Harry/Ronnie... but in that fic, Ronnie is a lesbian anyway.

** For all that the HP series was written by a female author, it still seems to be aimed at the male audience. We don't see many well developed female characters at Hogwarts - it's basically Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. Some have recommended Katie, but isn't she with one of the twins? Just because I don't like the Harry/Ginny pairing doesn't mean I dislike the other canon pairings (Bill/Fleur, etc.). I don't mention any slash pairings mainly because there was no canon basis for him being slash.

I personally prefer for Harry to have a career, maybe take time off to travel and expand his horizons, and then meet some foreign witch to settle down with in his 30's or something.

** I can't remember any examples offhand, but I've read a handful of decent fics that paired Harry with other, unused/undeveloped characters within the HP canon, such as Tracey Davis.

I've occasionally considered writing such a story myself, but never could come up with a story that interested me enough to bother writing.
