****** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][Ice Princess]]: Building a romance from a fanon cliche turned on its head.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][The Grass is Always Greener]]: During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/1/Partners][Partners]]: Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5400129/1/The-Wrong-Choice][The Wrong Choice]]: Starts in the middle of DH - What if Hermione left the tent when Ron had asked her to come with him? How will Harry respond? What repercussions will her decision have on the Wizarding World? Will All be well? Who will Harry end up with? Ron bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7419421/1/Harry-Potter-Wizarding-Savior][Harry Potter, Wizarding Savior?]]: Harry in his anger at the Headmaster after the death of Sirius finally burns through the Memory Charm that the Headmaster cast on him just before third year and comes to some surprising revelations

** If you want to see James and Lily get absolutely raked over the coals for how they treated Harry, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] turns this up to 11.

***** I'm hoping he'll get it back together, but if not, it's still been a fun ride. He's got a LOT of plotlines and characters to juggle, and that's REALLY tough!

** I feel like all of my posts in this sub are about Saving Connor. What the hell, I'll make one more. It's by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]. 7 parts, very long, complete, written before Deathly Hallows came out.
