I would like a fic (AU, canon divergence, anything) where Snape has a meaningful relationship with anyone other than Lily that is his age group (i.e. *not* one of his students like Hermione Granger), where he doesn't pine for a dead woman for 20 years.

It's somewhere in the second half when Snape helps Narcissa to escape Lucius, and a bit later he's earning the 'benefits'.

  What happens when the Weasley boys try to interfere in Ginny and Harry's relationship? Will Harry succumb to their threats or will fate intervene? Will Ginny have any say or will she never even know? And OK cause I was asked to, characters are acting OOC.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
