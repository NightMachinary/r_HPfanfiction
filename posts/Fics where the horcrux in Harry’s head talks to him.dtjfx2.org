Something like Tozette's Hit The Ground Running, where the horcrux in Harry becomes aware and communicates with him. Any pairing/no pairing is fine. I prefer complete fics, but longer incomplete ones are fine too.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) is a good'un. It's complete with a sequel on hiatus.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** !linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation) sort of counts. The exact nature of what happens is a bit of a spoiler. Abandoned, but still very much worth a read.

All of the following fics will be some form of HP/TR

!linkffn(Devil Take the Hindmost) has Harry able to communicate with Tom from the moment the connection between their souls was made. He acts as her guide and is able to reincarnate himself much earlier with Harry's help. Abandoned, but at a low point in the story's action so it's not hindering to the story.

!linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) has Eleanor Lily Potter, a living God, frequently communicate with the scarcrux, whom she names Wizard Lenin. It's a very strange fic, and while I like it, it's not to everyone's taste. WIP

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary) is a fic of my own writing. The diary Horcrux merges with the scarcrux in the chamber and is currently guiding him while trying to contact Voldemort and make a body of her own. WIP

!linkffn(Horcrux by BlackenedQuill) is a fic inspired by my above fic and has a similar premise. Was supposed to be a threeshot, but appears to be abandoned.

!linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane) is a light and straightforward Harry/fem!Voldemort fic. Voldemort was returned to sanity after her discorporeation, and is trying to make amends.

  Trying to protect the Philosopher's Stone, Harry is kidnapped by Voldemort, who uses Legilimency on him and learns that he is a Horcrux. After that, Harry is forced to learn how to survive the violent and surreal reality of Voldemort's everyday life, and try his best to make it back to Hogwarts in one piece. Simultaneously, a war looms on the horizon. Grey!Harry Sane!Voldemort

  In the Mirror of Erised, Harry sees Tom Riddle. No one will tell him why he feels such a deep, unnerving connection to Lord Voldemort. Yet this one change has a butterfly effect, to alter the rest of Harry's life and perhaps the state of the wizarding world as a whole. Is he doomed to die with Voldemort, in order to save everyone, or can he redeem the man who has already done so many despicable things, saving both himself and the man that shares his soul?
