And I don't mean 1st or 3rd person, I mean like if you're a straight guy, and you're reading about a straight couple, do you prefer to read from the guy's pov, or the girl's? Or do you not care? And vice versa for girls.


** The perspective of the main character. Who that is, I don't care.

But then again, I may not be the right target audience, so to say. I rarely, if ever read romance or smut. 99% of the sex-scenes I read are part of another story.

*** No i think this is right on. I read pretty much everything and prefer romance and some smut (although only with good plot being the focus). And I agree that the perspective of the main character is the preference.

Now that said, as a guy I do think that I tend to like reading from a guys perspective more than a girls. Its not remotely important... but just an observation.

** It doesn't matter to me, but I will say that it drives me nuts when the PoV switches between both of them. I find it confusing and a bit disjointed in most cases. I've read smut from both the male and female perspectives (as well as reading Slash and FemSlash). Finding well written smut is actually fairly difficult, so perspective doesn't tend to matter very much lol.

*** When you say POV switches, do you mean like within a scene, or chapter to chapter, or both?

** Within the scene. I don't mind chapter to chapter. I don't even mind scene to scene within a chapter. But there should be a clear shift when the PoV switches and you can't do that in a smut scene without breaking the scene up.

*** Definitely agree that if you are reading something that has shifting perspectives, whomever the perspective is from for a scene or chapter, should be the perspective followed.

** Usually I prefer it from the main characters perspective. But anything is fine really, except for funny POV changes where you cant find out who is thinking what. I'm a guy.

** Third.

I've been musing about doing some second person erotica though.
