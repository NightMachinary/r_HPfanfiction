I like most anything but I'm not a particular fan of gay or fem harry atleast not in the context of these stories. Also not a particular fan of hinny. Sorry! I hope this isn't to inconvenient a request but I find it difficult to find something I'm seriously interested in. I wouldn't mind if it had dumbledore/Snape/selective weasly bashing. Im not particularly picky in that revoir. Honestly, anything would beg good..


** I've been looking for something like this too! Sorry I can't be any help though, I haven't found any yet! Good luck!

*** Oh cool! Sorry that you haven't been able to find any! If I get any recommendations I can let you know! There is a fanfic series on archive of our own called 'Hogwarts reads the books' it starts of hinny but then moves on to HarryxDaphne.. I'm not sure wether you'd like it or not but you might want to give it a try! [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118][Hogwarts reads the books]]

Thanks for the luck! Good luck to you too!

** There's the Reading the Books series by spirithorse16. I think it fits perfectly with what you want, mostly cannon personalities but not a Hinny fic, not a bashing fic either (yay) or I'd have been pissed because bashing is just stupid, AND I love Ginny. Though Snape does kinda what's coming for him. Overall nice reactions, although some can feel underwhelming but still enjoyable.

It's actually reached GoF, maybe halfway through if I remember correctly, and it's your lucky day because, lo and behold, the author just decided to end his hiatus today and is planning on uploading some new chapters this week!
