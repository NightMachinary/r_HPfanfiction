I wanna read fics where the final battle between Harry and Voldemort has surprisingly little action. Perhaps Voldy is overconfident, or Harry just goes 'fuck it' and lobs a killing curse at the dark tosser before he can shield or dodge and he just falls dead.


** What about when there is a dramatic face off between Voldemort and Harry int he Forbidden Forest, the tension is rising as their wands are drawn at their sides. A moment of silence passes between them before a brilliant beam of light strikes the side of the Dark Lords face.

The beam is then followed by the rest of the Ford Anglia which slams into the 71 year old man at 73.8 mph killing him instantly.

The car then proceeds to disappear into the forest, never to be seen by mortal eyes again. But some say you can still hear the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHju-wPilU8][horn of war]] blaring in the night.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8937860/1/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight][Hiding In Plain Sight]], Harry's victory is so anticlimactic that it doesn't even happen on-screen! Apparently, Voldie managed to Summon Harry's glasses and since he's blind-without-em, Harry's attempt to accio his glasses back actually latched onto the wall behind Voldie, flattening the Dark Lord under a pile of bricks. Harry, trying to find his glasses, subsequently accidentally stomps on Voldie's throat, killing him.

The main part of the story revolves around Harry having had Lasik to remove his glasses-induced-weakness and discovering an odd thing... without his glasses, pure-blood wizards (and those raised in the Magical World) can't recognize him! Cue shenanigans including Mad-Eye Moody enrolling as a First-year at Hogwarts...

** Linkffn(Light's Hope, Death's Hunters)

I really liked this fic but the ending is just... so disappointing.

Harry and Hermione leave Britain for a few years and become Bounty Hunters to help them prepare for facing Voldemort. When they finally return and actually fight him, they basically blow up his entire mansion with explosives then cut his head off with a Diffindo. No real battle, no Horcruxes (which I'm fine with but you should still make him hard to kill and provide an explaination as to why he's alive), not even using a deadly curse.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

** There was one where Snape did it. He put some poisonous gas vial below his knee. He took the barely acceptable (it stopped it from killing him, but he still had a load of side effects to deal with) went up to voldy, dropped to his knees (breaking the vials), and then dragged Voldy AND Pettigrew into the floo to the ministry. I think there was a bounty (and a pardon), Snape took this and GTFO'd the country.
