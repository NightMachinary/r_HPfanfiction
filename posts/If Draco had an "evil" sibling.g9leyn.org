Is there any fic where Draco has a sibling who makes his life miserable? So Draco isn't Slytherin prince, is a bit unhappy and gets along with more people (other houses). I mean like Draco and his sibling love each other, but the teasing and jokes make relationship unbearable.

I dream to find a drarry or something, but not necessarily. I will be ok as far as there's enough attention to Draco's sibling and how they deal with life. Thanks kindly for any suggestions!


** This is pretty siruis/harry centric with bits of draco and a brother. But this series goes more into draco and his brothers relationship in the later stories and is a pretty good read. Might be what you're looking for?

*** And by sirius/harry I dont mean it's a relationship between them... I just meant that those are the characters it concentrates on hahaha
