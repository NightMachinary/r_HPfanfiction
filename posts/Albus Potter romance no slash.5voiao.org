Hey guys, I'm looking for some Albus Potter romance stories. Please refrain from linking fics that pair Albus and Scorpius together because really would that pairing exists if one of their last names were changed? Also no slash in general.

  Scorpius and Rose's rivalry is infamous, across both the classroom and the Quidditch pitch. Until an ill-planned revenge plot lands them in a month's worth of detentions, forcing their co-operation. Or, is eight hours all it takes?

*** Um judging by the description I was more looking for fics where Albus is the main character, but I'll take a look no matter.

The comments were just about how few straight Albus pairing fics there are.

Edit: I don't know if you linked the wrong fic or what but you literally gave me what I specifically asked not to get.

From the fic

**** "Sad" might be the wrong word, but it's kinda funny that it's practically become "almost-canon," like notice-me-not charms, the term "wards" and Daphne Greengrass' aloof personality.

  Because he isn't confirmed gay in canon
#+end_quote

I'll spare you the usual /'it's called/ *fan*/fiction, of course the pairings aren't canon'/ spiel and say this: He isn't confirmed gay OR straight. In fact, I don't remember Albus having a romantic relationship with anyone in CC (and don't say he was pining after Delphi, she was in her twenties when he was barely a teen wasn't she? It seemed more like he looked up to her because she was the first person to really praise him for his magical abilities more than anything). There are a lot of Scorpius/Abus fanfictions because there is more subtext between them that Albus/Delphi or even Scorpius/Rose, despite Scorpius explicitly asking Rose to go out with him (to which she said no), which felt undeveloped and tacked on to the end for the sake of 'happily ever after'. I'm not really a fan of most gay ships in HP (I don't like Harry/Draco, or Sirius/Remus, or any others, really), but I do like Scorbus because I could easily see it being canon, and judging by the quantity of fics, a lot of people seem to agree. Hence, I disagree with OP when they say this:

#+end_quote

I haven't read Cursed Child since it came out so forgive me if I'm remembering bits a little wrong, but my point still stands. Calling a character "sad" because he is often perceived as gay is going a little too far, when it seems you just don't like the ship.

***** Well I never intended to go on a rant, but now that I've started I might as well respond:

What are you talking about canon pairings? My point is that Albus isn't paired with anyone, there is no canon to uphold in that regard. I understand what you mean when you say changes must be made in order to ship two characters, it's one of the reasons why I don't like Harry/Draco and other unlikely ships. Part of the original appeal of next-gen fics was that very little was set in stone - authors could pretty much ship anyone with anyone else they wanted. Now that CC is out, the author must take into account the 'new canon', but none of it really sets up any pairing except for the one sided Scorpius/Rose relationship which isn't even resolved at the end, so most pairings are equally viable (I've even seen some more esoteric pairings such as Scorpius/Hugo).

And yes, I'm sure they don't actually hate homosexual relationships and just worded it badly, but you also can't talk about 'mangling canon pairings' which don't even exist.
