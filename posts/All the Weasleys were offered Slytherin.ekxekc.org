i remember absolutely nothing about this fic other than this scene. it's revealed that the Sorting Hat tried to put every single Weasley sibling in Slytherin and all of them said no out of not wanting to disappoint the family; Ginny or Ron might have been a Slytherin, but idr.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
