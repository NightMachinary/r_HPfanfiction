** Is he doing something illegal? In Muggle society?Among Wizards? So much depends for me.

If I were having him float among Muggles, I would suggest Draco Malfoy. Especially if I knew he would be doing something illegal.

....or actually anyone on that Black tapestry---he had long enough to look at it. I bet a lot of people don't know about Regulus.

*** Yeah. I just posted the first chapter, and he robs the Malfoys Gringotts account in it.

#+begin_quote
  [[/spoiler]["High security family vault" the goblin said with a toothy smirk, noticing where he was looking. "Families with actual money have the extra protections added in. Only a goblin can open one of those. Anyone else who tries get sucked into the vault and is left to rot." the goblin snarked before rasping out a few chuckles.]]

  [[/spoiler][Harry knew that. The vault had a striking similarity to the one he had visited back in first year with Hagrid to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone.]]

  [[/spoiler][The familiar stylized M on the carved stone crest above the door stared at him, tempting. A plan was forming in his head, unbidden, one he was pretty sure would work . . .]]

  [[/spoiler][The Malfoys were death eaters, and were almost definitely bankrolling the Death Eater operations. Harry had decided that didn't want anything to do with the war for this summer, but that was no reason to not dick the Death Eaters over any chance he got.]]

  [[/spoiler][Harry asked himself the question that had made him start off on this strange aimless journey.]]

  [[/spoiler][What would Sirius do?]]

  [[/spoiler][It wasn't exactly hard to guess.]]

  [[/spoiler][Looking left and right along the long tunnel to check that nobody was around to see what he was about to do, Harry promptly picked up the Goblin by the scruff of its neck and slammed him head first right into the stone wall with all his strength.]]

  [[/spoiler]["Whaaa . . ." the goblin slurred, knocked out of his senses. Frowning at the fact that the goblin was still conscious, Harry bonked him into the wall one more time.]]

  [[/spoiler][And once more, just to be sure.]]

Tom Riddle. (How many people know, in-story, who that is, anyway?)\\
Jethro Q. Walrustitty.

In practice, a lot depends on which audience the alias is intended for. If it's mostly Muggles, cordeliamcgonagall's suggestion of "some random guy off the Black tapestry" is pretty much perfect; if it's mostly Wizards, some famous Muggle celebrity (John Lennon, Mikhail Gorbachev, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bart Simpson - realistically, someone British from the early 1990s, but I can't think of anyone from that category).
