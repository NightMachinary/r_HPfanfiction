I'm looking for just a scene like this, not a whole fic. Does anyone know one?


** "So they will attack a school? Don't these people-"

"No," Kingsley answered the Prime Minister. "Decency is not within their characters." He taps his foot in nervous rythm, always looking at the chimney, and the bit of powder in his hand. "Minister, I am short on time. He can attack at any moment, now. And we... we need all the help we can get."

The Minister sighed. "What would you want me to do? Bomb a random place somewhere in Scotland?" The grim smile on the Minister's face betrayed the supposed joke, but Kingsley didn't smile back. Kingsley remained quite emotionless, in fact.

"You can't be serious." the Minister whispered.

"I am. Soldiers, tanks - they won't do anything. But a strike from above? Something they can't see, hear and therefore won't shield against? It could mean the life of hundreds of children and it would even the odds."

"Again I," The Minister swiped over his face, feeling as sweat has formed on his forehead. This was even worse than Afghanistan. Bombing his own country? He could already see the polls dropping into nothing before his inner eye. "I can't."

"If you don't help us, I hope you are prepared to fight a war you cannot possibly win in the future." Shaklebolt's voice was shuddering with repressed anger.

"What do you mean?"

"We are the last bastion standing between /his/ forces and you." Kingsley made a point of staring deep into the Minister's eyes. "You'll be hunted for sport, enslaved... your cities will burn with demonic flames. Your history and legacy will be gone. And there is nothing you can do. Because if you cannot bomb an empty plot in Scotland, how could you ever bomb some Alley or Ministry, or hidden house in the middle of London? The only weapons effective against my kind are useless, because we are among you. You shield us from your own weapons."

The Minister fell back into his chair. It didn't feel comfortable. Instead it felt like the leather itself slapped him against the head. With slow moves of his hand he tipped in a number on his phone that he had hoped he would never have to use. He put the phone on speaker and waited through the ringing. He hoped he made the right decision. But he had come to trust Kingsley before, when he had been his assistant. The man wouldn't lie to him, and on the other side, he vividly remembered the bridge, the hurricane. Those had been acts of /terror/. That was what Voldemort had been capable of as someone under cover - an insurgent. Now the man was close to achieving full control over the magicals of the United Kingdom. The Minister felt a cold shiver run down his spine.

Small lamps on the phone indicated that everyone he intended to call was on the line. "Gentlemen," the Minister began. "I have called you in a matter of national security. Please make sure you are in a secure location before I continue."

There were some doors slapped shut, some cars starting their engines and some rafters closed. He heard the soft buzz of white noise speakers go off in some bureaus.

"We're listening." the Director General of MI5 said, speaking for all agencies he had just called. For now it was only his Intelligence and one Field Marshal, a Marshal and an Admiral of the Fleet who commanded their shock troops and quick response units. He dearly hoped that the other's would never have to be involved.

"Gentlemen, what I'm about to tell you will sound like I have lost my mind. But I implore you to listen." he took a deep breath, already seeing the headlines of "Minister gone barmy", floating around the newspapers. "Fifteen minutes ago I have been informed of a matter of national security concerning the... the... well... the /magical/ population of Britain."

Silence. A nervous cough. Some clearing of throats.

And one voice colder than he had ever heard it. "Go on." came the simple /command/ from the Chief of MI6.

"I... I have Kingsley Shaklebolt here with me. He is a... representative... of the Order of the Phoenix." the Minister gulped down the bile in his throat again. "He informed me of an all out attack on the School of magic, Hogwarts, by forces hell bent on subjugating and, or erradicating us - the non-magical population and he has asked for aid."

"Minister, I have no time for jokes like...." the Field Marshal started, but he was interrupted by the Chief of MI6 again.

"No jokes." the Chief gave back. "We had SN-1 on our monitors for a while now."

"SN-1?" the Minister asked.

"Supernatural 1. We started investigating about two years ago after our analysts came to the conclusion that this hurricane in Devon was simply impossible by all meterological simulations."

The Director General of Mi5 interjected. "We know of the phenomenon as... well... " you could hear the smirk in his voice. "The X-Files. Cases of catastrophy apperently only possible by supernatural causes. So what you're telling us, Minister, is that one of them is in your office?"

"Correct, Director." the Minister answered.

"What does he ask for?"

"An Aistrike."

"Where?"

"I don't know the coordinates. Only /they/ can even see the place."

"And you are positive the man is on our side?"

"I am," the Minister said. "He has been my assistant for over two years."

That got him another round of silence until finally, the Marshal of the Royal Air Force cut into it with his rough, deep voice. "So... what you're telling me is that... what? We're flying an exercise over Scotland?"

"GBU targeting practice." the Chief answered, his conspirative smile apparent in his tone.

"Mr. Shaklebolt?" the Marshal said. "Are you familiar with the purpose and use of target designation?"

"No, but I am a fast learner." Kingsley answered. His shoulders slumped the entire time the men spoke. They would get help.

"Good. Send us the coordinates and get some form of smoke, bright colored light or similar onto the target."

"Right away. We must hurry, gentlemen. The Dark Lord may attack at any time." Kingsley pressed. He wrote down the coordinates of Hogwarts - something he knew by heart as an Auror. "The Minister has the coordinates. I'll go now and organize the... uhm... targeting."

With a flash of green Kingsley was gone through the chimney. The Minister, alone now, turned back to the phone and asked in subdued voice. "You were awfully... eager?"

"Minister," The Chief of Mi6 answered. "If a benevolent demigod asks to help kill the malevolent demigods, you don't say no."

"Demigods?" the Minister scoffed. "They seem rather normal..."

"Don't let them fool you. Even their children are capable of ignoreing the laws of nature at their leisure." the Marshal of the Royal Air Force interrupted. He chuckled a little as everybody could hear the voice of a teenage girl in the background. "Papa? Are you coming? The cake isn't gonna cut itself."

He laughed as he answered the girl. "I'll be right there, Sally-Anne. Papa is just trying to right some wrongs in Britain, alright?" he turned back to the microphone of his telephone. "In any case, gentlemen. Usual protocols. I have an exercise to order. Marshal Perks, out."
