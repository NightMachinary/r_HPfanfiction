What if Harry traveled back in time on his eleventh birthday, and ended up going to Hogwarts with his parents in their first year.

How will this affect the prophesy? Harry will know about the time travel, but will he know about his significance? Will Harry be bullied by the Draco of that time, James Potter? (James did start as a bully, even if he grew out of it) Who will he befriend if not Ron and Hermione? Will he even have friends? How will the lack of fame affect his sorting, quidditch, and social status?


** Oh, this is a new take on it. I'd like to read this.
