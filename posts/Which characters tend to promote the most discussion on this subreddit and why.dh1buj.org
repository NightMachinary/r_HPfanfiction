There are certain characters that are almost universally well-liked. There are those that are almost universally hated. There are those who some just don't care enough about to discuss. Lastly, there are */those/* characters. Those characters who have threads that stretch for *hundreds and hundreds* of comments. The kind that have such a broad range of opinions. The kind that have such strong opinions on either side that if you were on this reddit long enough, you could identify the pro/anti-that character redditors almost immediately.

So I'm curious to the responses.

What characters tend to promote the most discussion?


** Snape. There's little consensus about this character.

** Hermione and Ron.

For example you have Books vs Movies, would they be good together (lots of long and shouty threads on this one), if they aren't together who would they be with (more shouty threads). If one of them is abusive in a relationship would it be Hermione or Ron. Ron and Hermione are perfect together because they are both horrible people, R/Hr wouldn't work because Ron/Hermione is a horrible person.

Was Hermione justified in book 6, why was she out of character in book 6, was she coddled by the narration in book 6, was she coddled by the narration in general, what was anyone thinking in book 6?

How smart is she? Is she top of her class or just in the upper echelons? Can she invent things or is she just good at finding existing things? Is she a mary sue? is she Rowling's self insert (kinda), she's too perfect in this fic, she's been dumbed down in this fic, how attractive is she? whats her hair like? what race is she? what are her parents like? what are her parents named? what was her relationship with her parents? Do you like Dan and Emma for her parents names? Do Dramione shippers use Tom and Emma?

Why is Ron such a bad friend? Why do people think Ron is a bad friend? Here's why Ron is a good friend. Here's why Ron is a bad friend. Here's how Ron was dumbed down in the movies, here is canon use of a love potion by Ron, here's how Ron suffered over the series, and so on and so forth.

  what race is she?

She is white, PoA is explicit about that.

"/Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree./"

No matter how afraid you are, a dark skin-type does not become white if the person is afraid.

(Though people should stop giving Rowling trouble on that one tweet, she says enough stupid stuff without us making things up. What Rowling said wasn't "Hermione is black and has always been black", but "Hermione's race isn't well defined, she can be anything you can imagine.")

I think that most people are familiar with their heritage. And if you are considering "race swapping" a character to a different ethnicity than your own, that's "cultural appropriation" and seen as evil as well.

Humans are lazy, so they will do the lazy option. Making a character not white is an easy option to increase diversity. These people like diversity. They dislike things that decrease diversity.

*********** If only different skin colour is what you are after, well that's not diversity. If you want diversity, you need to add depth beyond the pigments in someone's skin. If a character gains or loses value based on the shade of their skin, that's racism, plain and simple.

************ Hey, I'm not the one you need to convince, try yelling at tumblr. I was just trying to give you the reason they aren't hypocrites, that the race swapping itself wasn't what they disliked, they instead disliked what it symbolized. In some ways saying that someone with a different skin color needs to be different is just as racist. What THEY think is that THEY dislike how the "default" state of being in media is a white person.

***** People need to stop giving Rowling credit that she does not deserve. If she intended for a character to be a POC, she made it obvious. She told us outright that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were gay for each other, but the Fantastic Beasts series is barely even queerbait, and she defended it by asking us to look at the subtext as if this is still the 90s. Her Hermione that she wrote in her books was white. All she did was not shoot down other peoples' reimagining of her characters, and the people who "blame" her for "changing" the race of a character are basically giving her representation points she did nothing to earn.

***** There's that thing called tanning. A white person can become significantly darker if exposed to the sun a lot (for example, by spending a month at the beaches of France as Hermione did), but a scared person with dark skin won't become white when afraid. That's caused by a lack of blood, which removes the red/pink hue, not the pigments in your skin.

The South of France certainly is. Both, the Atlantic Coast and the Mediterranean one. They recorded 45.9 degrees in the South this summer. And temps above 35 aren't rare there.

**** Just means she's pale with fright or shock. It's a common expression, even for darker skinned people.

Consider this extract from /Gardens of the Moon/, by Steven Erikson. Nothing is removed or changed:

#+begin_quote
  Unease coiled around her insides. Behind her, Tattersail heard the crunch of armour and the rattle of iron, the sound arriving like a cold wind. She turned to see the four soldiers appear on the summit. *Three men, one woman, mud-smeared and crimson-streaked, their faces almost bone-white.* The sorceress found her eyes drawn to the woman, who hung back like an unwelcome afterthought as the three men approached.

  The girl was young, pretty as an icicle and looking as warm to the touch.

  Something wrong there. Careful.

  The man in the lead - a sergeant by the torque on his arm - came up to Tattersail. Set deep in a lined, exhausted face, his dark grey eyes searched hers dispassionately. “This one?” he asked, turning to *the tall, thin black-skinned man* who came up beside him.

  This man shook his head. “No, the one we want is over there,” he said.

  Though he spoke Malazan, his harsh accent was Seven Cities.

  *The third and last man, also black,* slipped past on the sergeant's left and for all his girth seemed to glide forward, his eyes on Hairlock.

**** Just a small side note, "Black" in the US doesn't actually mean dark skinned. That comes at least partially from history ("one-drop" standard for certain laws), but also because cultural groups don't necessarily follow genetic groups exactly.

** Dumbledore has to be up there. You have a basically unlimited amount of interpretations, from the "canon-compliant" crowd who turns him into the grandfather figure Rowling probably intended, up to the "DarkHarry" crowd which blame everything, including Voldemort, on him. And independent of that debate there is the debate on how much was his actual characterisation and how much was Rowling having the plot force things/actions (eg Dumbledore not doing anything about the Basilisk). Then you have the incompetence vs Malice debate and at least three debates about the Dursleys and Dumbledore's plot with them.

** Snape does some truly heroic things as well as some truly heinous things. As a result, he is by far the most divisive person both in the subreddit and fanfics in general. You have everything from second-in-command Evil with a capital E Snape who needs to rot in Hell for the rest of time, to tragic hero Snape who deserves nothing less than true happiness ASAP, either after surviving Nagini, a post-death redo or something similarly good.
