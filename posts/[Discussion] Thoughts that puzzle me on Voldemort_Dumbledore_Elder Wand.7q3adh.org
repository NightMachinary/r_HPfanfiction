So as we know from the books, Voldemort tracks down the wand to Gellert Grindelwald, who he visits, interrogates and kills in his cell, learning that Dumbledore has the wand he goes after it, takes it from his grave then kills Snape thinking he was the wand's master.

I find this a tad bit of a plot hole (If it wasn't for the excuse that Voldemort was a crazy cold-hearted psycho). Let me explain why.

Voldemort goes to Grindelwald and finds him alive. He is told Dumbledore was in possession of the wand. (I can not recall if Grindelwald tells him if Dumbledore was the master of it or simply in possession of it)--but this matters not because obviously Voldemort seems to acknowledge Dumbledore as the master of the wand (Hence why he killed Snape because he thought that Snape became the master after killing Dumbledore, where if Voldemort believed Dumbledore wasn't the master because he hadn't killed Grindelwald then all he'd have had to do is kill Grindelwald but he soon came to the conclusion that wasn't the case) So he admits Dumbledore to be the Master of the wand. But he saw Grindelwald alive. So therefore once he acknowledged Dumbledore as the master of said wand, and noticing Grindewald was alive he must have known therefore that you needn't kill, simply disarm, the owner of the wand to gain the allegiance of the wand.

So he simply had to disarm Snape. Now I know that we all know that rule, but so did Voldemort. So why did he kill Snape? He obviously could no longer believe that killing was the answer. And if he disarmed Snape he would have found that he wasn't the owner and could have simply asked for more details on the tower (And I do believe they must have given a complete recount to Voldemort, I can't see Riddle, who wanted to see Dumbledore dead so much, would not ask for every single detail) or go with what he knew.

Now my own fix to this is, if he had done so and found Draco, only to disarm him and still not be the wands owner, where did that leave him? Surely Draco and a few others knew how he was disarmed, but did Voldemort? Voldemort would have no idea what to do from then on (Draco knew occlumency and was good enough to shield his mind from not only Snape but Dumbledore as well so, therefore, I believe Voldemort wouldn't have been able to read his mind either). I believe Voldemort in a fit of rage, desperation, fear, and hopelessness would begin killing at random, most likely the followers he would have known to be close to Draco at the time (IE the ones at the manor most often) and quite possibly anyone else. Kill only cause of how angry he was. I think part of the issue was that Voldemort wanted so desperately to believe that the Elder wand was his--his entire LIFE depended on it basically and he was so scared of death, that the only option his mind would allow him to think of at this point was that it HAD to be this way. So he lied to himself instead of acknowledging the truth. Because acknowledging the truth would mean that it was already a lost cause.

The other option, which I have seen more of shown through fanfic, was that Voldemort was so deranged, crazed, dehumanized, out of his mind, desperate, afraid and what not, not only by the dark magic, his past, who he was but also the loss of the Horcruxes.

I do believe he was deranged, but a smart deranged. I do not believe the loss of the horcruxes had any impact on his mind. Let me explain, please. A horcrux is a piece of someone's soul, blah blah blah, immortality, a simple tie to life. Each time Riddle made a horcrux and tore out a piece of his soul he lost a bit of his humanity. (Humanity: the ability to feel compassion, love, understanding, sympathy, happiness, etc. I mean his mother using a love potion, his upbringing and then his horcruxes? All of that combined there was no way he could feel any of the emotions besides those of rage, hatred, etc). This is I think expanded on in the books (I may be mistaken), however, one can see the progression as Voldemort grows and the more horcruxes he's made. The more he splits his soul, leaving a small piece in his body, the eviler he gets. The less humane; the worst crimes he commits and the darker he is.

However, I do not think it impedes his mind because while it may affect his soul and humanity, Voldemort still has a cunning and effective, smart mind. Now I'm not saying how he used his mind was good or anything, but he achieved his ends in a very smart way. He was able to stay alive all those years before his rebirth, he made up his plan to get harry to the graveyard (Among his other two attempts at a rebirth, albeit failed but not because of lack of geniusity, he would have succeeded even as a nearly dead less than the lowest of creatures form against all of Dumbledores and many other wizards and witches protections against him (IE Sorcerer's stone, chamber of secrets) if only it wasn't for that Meddling kid and his phoenix), he succeeded in coming back, he was able to get people back into the ministry once more and influence the ministry, daily prophet, and nearly the entire wizarding world, to throw shade on Dumbledore and harry so he could work wihtout restraints to gain his forces back, which he did. He was already thinking on his feet. He launched an entire wizarding war, allied his forces, through a successful coup of the Ministry gaining complete power and control over it. And it didn't take him 10 years this time, it took him two (Granted he already had his ground work etc). He was also able to break people out of azkaban, as well.

This takes a lot of brains, power, planning. So for me, Voldemorts intellect was not in fact impacted all that much by the loss of horcruxes. Now I'm not saying he was not at all affected, I wouldn't be so foolish as to think there are no mental consequences to the loss of a horcrux, but I don't think it's as grand as it's been played up. I think, like alcohol but on a MUCH MUCH grander scale, it takes away a person's inhibitions. We tell ourselves no based on morals, our humanity, our social constraints, etc. None of which he had because of thoroughly splitting his soul. So it does affect your brain because you begin to think you can do whatever you want, and you have this sense of grandeur about you that nothing can harm you. But it wouldn't completely destroy the ability to think, or plan or be as brilliant as Voldemort was (if he only used his powers for good). And his desperateness to kill Snape, knowing he simply had to disarm him, showed fear- so even he wasn't so far gone to realize the real possibility. Plus he may have learned his lesson after underestimating Lily, a muggle-born. Which proves even further his ability for rational thought and reasoning.

So I stand by, if we are to provide a reason for Voldemort killing Snape for no reason, it'd have to simply be the first reason. He was afraid.

He was afraid of losing, he was afraid of the truth, he was afraid of dying, so much so that he let his own mind lie to him to protect him from the overwhelming sense of impending doom. Voldemort was not devoid of all emotion, he could feel emotion so long as it pertained to him (He could be angry, afraid for HIS life, etc, but not in regards to other people he could not be sad for others, or happy for them or sympathize with them, because he didn't care for anyone else but himself, he didn't love anyone else. He couldn't for all the things that had gone wrong in his life and for what he had done to himself. Voldemort was a lost cause the minute he made a horcrux).

And for that little lost boy named Tom Riddle, I will pay my respects because I do have pity for you. Something you could never understand.


** Isn't the easier option just to say he didn't care. Not to mention if you disarm someone like Snape then he might resent you. I dislike Snape but I would hate for him to be an enemy. Alternatively an option you fail to consider is that Voldemort knew Snape had questionable loyalties but used him to control the information the order received. The battle of Hogwarts would have been his final victory over the order and so Snape was no longer needed which makes him expendable.

** I find the whole wand lore/master thing to be very confusing and unnecessary. Dueling is introduced in CoS, so kids were already losing their wand's allegiance back in their second year. What's the point of that? You disarm your friend as a joke and now you've apparently fucked them for decent magic as long as they have that wand. It just seems silly.

*** I don't think the movies helped either. When Harry disarms Draco in the movie Ollivander said Draco's own wand was changing allegiance to Harry which is not how the elder wand works, draco's wand would never change it's allegiance. (I don't think in the books Draco's own wand does I may be wrong it's beeen years upon years since I've read deathly Hallows)

*** This was brought up on Tv tropes. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallowsWandDisarmament]]

As mentioned, for the elder wand at least, I think that the person who disarms the other has to really want the wand in order for it to change allegiance so say a practical joke for instance, won't be enough for it to change its master. Not to mention the kids were just practicing dueling (most of the time anyway) and hand the wands back to their original owner afterwards.

However taking a job that would involve a lot of dueling and large possibility of being disarmed, I'd say they did the right thing to snap the wand in the movie.

Voldemort presumably believed that there were multiple conditions that must be filled for the wand to transfer ownership. The allegiance of wands was a fickle and esoteric subject. It's possible that he believed killing transferred ownership in some situations but not others - and technically, he'd be entirely correct to believe that. His decision to not kill Snape initially, but to kill him after the wand failed to transfer ownership, was essentially correct. There was only a risk his situation would improve. Snape was a dubious asset at that point in time, and the failure of the wand to transfer could itself be seen as evidence of some sort of treachery.
