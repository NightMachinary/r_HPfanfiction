recently came to a tale by Lev Grossman (The magician) on Buckbeak (just google it and will show up ) and wondering if there're other pieces of fiction about HP by other famous writers?


** Well, there's the Draco Dormiens trilogy by Cassandra Clare, who went on to write The Mortal Instruments. A defining point of the fandom's characterisation of Draco, though it's quite a controversial piece...

** It's not Harry Potter, but a Study in Emerald is pretty good, it's a Sherlock Holmes "fanfic". I vaguely remember there being some Narnia "fanfic", according to google it's called The Problem of Susan, but I never got into Narnia so I can't say if it's good.

These are both by Neil Gaiman.

** What [[/u/kyella14]] mentioned. Eliezer Yudkowsky of the infamously divisive linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is also somewhat famous, though not as a fiction-writer (he /has/, nonetheless, published a few pieces of original fiction).

*** He's also famous for his rare ability to self promote. (At one time, he was listing his SAT scores on his Wikipedia page.)

**** Heh. That's fair. I personally think rather well of Yudkowsky overall (I definitely agree with a lot of stuff he's written), but there's no denying he has/had a /rather serious/ ego problem of the sort usually only rivaled by Indy!Harry main characters.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
