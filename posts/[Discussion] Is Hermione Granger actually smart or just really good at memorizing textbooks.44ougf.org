It's been nearly a decade since I read all of the original 7 Harry Potter novels and after stumbling across the fact that J.K. Rowling specifically mentioned that Harry achieved an Outstanding in the Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. while Hermione didn't, I was left wondering as to whether or not she's actually a genius with an insanely high IQ as seen in the majority of fanfic, or if she's just someone naturally gifted at memorizing facts.

Being good at memorizing facts is not the same as being a genius. A genius is to me, someone who, rather than restating facts, comes up with new ways to do things or invents something revolutionary. For example, an engineering student who studies bridges can recite thousands of facts and theory regarding bridges, but would you call him a genius? No. You'd call the person who first came up with those facts and theories a genius.

So in your opinion, is the canon Hermione a genius with an IQ of 200 or is that just the Hermione of fanfic?


** She is smart, but fanfiction exaggerates her abilities a hundredfold. If she can't even find the Bubble-Head Charm, despite scouring the library for spells that can help you breathe underwater, then she's not going to uncover any ancient Egyptian rituals like fanfiction has her do so often. She also has a very unintelligent tendency to dismiss certain magical matters as fables, /despite only learning several years prior that magic exists/.

*** IIRC, there wasn't much time between the solving of the clue and the actual Second Task. She may have found the Bubble-head charm, but it could have been beyond Harry's ability to master in what time there was.

*** Honestly, I find you judging her on the basis of not finding bubble-head charm rather unfair. I think that she would have undoubtedly found it was it not for the story requiring Barty Crouch Jr aiding Harry to win the competition. As for her tendency to dismiss magical matters, one must not forget that she was a muggleborn. And eleven years of living one lifestyle definitely has an impact on how one perceives things. If anything, she was realistic and often the voice of reason of the trio.

***** Interestingly, if you look at the main three, you'll notice something interesting. Across Harry, Ron and Hermione all the Hogwarts Houses are represented. Obviously there is Gryffindor where they were sorted. There is Slytherin, where the Hat would have put Harry. Hermione could have been a Ravenclaw. And Ron has the loyalty of a Hufflepuff. Their conflicts and challenges also relate to these secondary (as I think of it) house alignments they have. Harry struggles with various secrets (of Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, himself) and ambitions (Voldemort's). Hermione's are those of knowledge (house-elves, Half-Blood Prince's books, existence/importance of Hallows). And Ron's are of loyalty (4th year, leaving in /DH/ due to the locket's influence and his troubles in joining back up).

The story wouldn't work without Hermione there to balance out the Trio.

2.  Once again, loyalty to/with Harry led him to lead his brothers on an illegal, potentially International Statute of Secrecy violating rescue mission in an enchanted Muggle artifact of dubious legality
3.  Loyally followed Hagrid's words and went with Harry into a nest of giant, terrifying versions of his /worst/ fear.
4.  Loyalty to his family and friend led him to joining Harry in plunging the depth's of Slytherin's secret chamber with a malfunctioning wand.
5.  Standing up in defense of his best friend against someone he thought to be an insane criminal while on a broken leg. How isn't that loyalty?
6.  This is a conflict of loyalty, inspired by him believing his best friend to have betrayed/misled him. Because he was /14/, and like all teenagers (all teenagers, for all time) a hormone-driven nincompoop.
7.  Went with his friends into certain mortal danger (they thought /Voldemort/ was in the DoM, remember?) to rescue another friend. Loyalty.
8.  Guarded the school because his friend asked him to.
9.  Supported/protected his friend by being his double in a risky extraction plan.
10. His strong feeling of support to Harry led him to accompany Harry on a multiple-Horcrux hunt.
11. A cursed Horcrux locket overrode his loyalty to his friend momentarily, causing him to leave, and bad luck kept him from returning, not a lack of loyalty to said friend.
12. Love and loyalty to his friend's is what allowed the deluminator to take him to Harry's and Hermione's approximate location at least twice.
13. Loyalty led him to dive into the frozen-ass pond to save his friend, like a loyal dog rescuing its child owner from drowning.
14. Every. Damn. Thing. Else. In. The. Series.

And don't forget that the definition of loyalty according to Merriam-Webster is:

#+begin_quote
  a feeling of strong support for someone or something
#+end_quote

Which every item on that list is a result of, or in two cases a conflict in regards to.

EDIT: I feel like ranting. My whole damn point earlier is that even though they are Gryffindors, Harry, Ron and Hermione exhibit the traits of all the different Houses. Harry is strongly Slytherin, Hermione strongly Ravenclaw and Ron strongly Hufflepuff. Of course, Harry is also loyal to his friends like a Hufflepuff. Hermione can be extremely cunning (second year, Polyjuice Potion) and when it comes to something he is interested in, Ron can be very intelligent (chess, Quidditch [being a fan of a bad team isn't an intelligence thing, so don't even try arguing that]) and isn't intelligence a trait Ravenclaw admires? The lines between the Houses aren't absolute, and this is where the vast fucking majority of fanfictions go to utter fucking shit and make characters one-dimensional caricatures of what House they're sorted into. The Sorting Hat seems to put students into Houses based not just on the traits they have, but on the ones they hold important. Take Neville for example. Tons of fucking awful fics bring up the point that early on he seems to be more of a Hufflepuff than a Gryffindor, yet to him bravery and courage are things he admires and wishes to be.

*tl;dr* Adding Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin as adjectives to bravery, loyalty, intelligence and sneakiness/cunning respectively is Neanderthal non-subtle, childishly stupid and people should stop doing that.

Just because they are all Gryffindors does not mean they do not display behaviour that are consistent with that from other houses.

******** McGonagall's Chess Game -- his only ability. Chess and Quidditch. And he never take a part even in school-wide chess tournament.

Privet Drive + Flying Car -- no danger, just fun. If he really care about Harry, he need to ask his parents for help. Or older brothers - NOT Fred and George.

Aragog's Nest -- most stupid idea. Why they do not take brooms with them? Actually, any sane wizard will always carry broom with him.

Entering Chamber of Secrets, with a broken wand -- to find his own sister. And (good to him) doesn't face any real danger.

Shrieking Shack -- he doesn't enter it himself, he was dragged here.

First part of 4th year: A case of jealousy overriding his brain. They were 14. -- idiot.

Department of Mysteries -- idiots.

Guarding the school the night of Dumbledore's death -- no real danger. Or someone will be killed. Probably Hogward wards protect students, and will react to student murder. So Death Eaters do not really use letal spells. Or not target them.

Getting Harry out of Privet Drive for the last time - idiots. Polyjuse and taxi. Man Eve Moddy visits, transfigure Harry to weasel and take with him in his packet.

Going on the Horcrux Hunt -- and eating all food. Moreover, do nothing here.

It's funny, but people forget that when he left during the Horcrux Hunt, it was because of the Horcrux's influence, and he would have returned right away except for apparating into a group of Snatchers. Harry and Hermione had already left by the time Ron excaped the Snatchers. Leaving briefly = Ron's fault. Being gone for more than a few minutes = not Ron's fault. -- left (or run) in wartime - usually means desertion with appropriate punishment. May be, you remember film - but in book, they left not immediatelly, but at least few hours later.

Being able to use the deluminator to find Harry and Hermione's position, if not them directly -- do you understand, that Dumbledore really do not belive in Ron, so he need to give him specially crafted tracker for Harry? Because if deluminator can find anybody, Dumbledore must use it to find Voldemort ten years ago. So it is crafted to track Harry.

Diving into a frozen pond in winter, covered in his clothing, to save Harry - idiots. Both.

I do not see any loyality here. Bravery and Stupidity, nothing else.

Neville Longbottom is loyal - not Ron.

********* It seems like you are seriously confused about what the topic of the discussion is about here. It's about LOYALTY and how Ron was willing to risk his own life to help out his friends, not about whether those ideas are good or not, or maybe you do know what the topic is about but is just looking for whatever way you can to twist and distort the truth from the canon.

The point is he sacrificed himself so that his friends can go ahead and try to stop Snape from obtaining the Stone. If that's not loyalty then I don't know what it is. There might not be any chess tournaments? Remember it was the best game of chess played at Hogwarts over many years

We are talking about his loyalty, NOT whether what he did was a good idea. Yes, some of his actions were not very smart, but it's mostly because HARRY or someone else was making the decisions not himself, don't you get that? It is clear that those adventures are very dangerous and potentially life threatening. For example, the facts there are potentially Death Eaters involved in HBP and he will actually need to fight Death Eaters and you can say there are no real danger just because nobody died (Dumbledore?) with a straight face? Really? Under those circumstances, did Ron ever ran away in fear of his own life? No, he went ahead because he was loyal to his friends. You seem to be just trying to twist and distort everything he do and dismiss them with lies. Seriously hate him all you like but don't make up lies about him like he's not loyal.

Ron did nothing on the trip? Hmm, let's see what he did... 1) Discovering the Taboo and saving all their lives 2) Leading the Trio when Harry abandoned the quest 3) Supplied his friends with lots of information about the wider wizarding world which helped a lot with maintaining morale Yes he didn't return until the next morning that was because he was held by the Snatchers all the time beforehand and apparated to the wrong place. It does not mean that he did not intend to return immediately, thus you point has no relevancy whatsoever. Harry also goaded him into leaving which you didn't bother to mention. Remember even though the Weasleys were considered blood traitors, they were STILL allowed to go about their daily lives because they are pure-bloods so Voldemort does not impact them as much as Harry and Hermione. It makes Ron's decision to go on the mission even more heroic than the other 2 because he DID NOT HAVE TO. This is what loyalty means, risking your life to help out your friends even when you didn't have to.

Harry was being stupid by not considering that he might drown in the pond, Ron was being brave and loyal because he dived into the freezing pond to try to save his best mate even though he might be killed himself. Clear?

EDIT: I should probably add that stupidity and loyalty are not mutually exclusive as you seem to be implying, just because Ron might have done some stupid actions (and Ron is actually NOT stupid) doesn't mean he's not loyal.

** Its never said that she's a genius. Its often mentioned that she is an extraordinary student and gifted in her use of magic, but not that shes on a level of a Voldemort or Dumbledore and thanks to Rowling she never will because she became a fucking Ministry drone... /fuck the epilogue/.

Ahem... sry. Anyway, we do see her practical usage of her knowledge when she made the polyjuice, researched the basilisk, or made the DA-Coins. So we can get from that, that she is capable of applying theoretical knowledge, which is for the most part what differentiates an intelligent person from a stupid person. She gets many spells after Harry, but that could merely be her overthinking it. However, when it comes down to picking a concept apart, Hermione Granger is the one to go to.

Also, many people forget that there is no such thing as "total innovation". Even the greatest minds - Newton, Da Vinci, Einstein,..., took inspiration from others. Mankind invents by remixing. True genius are just able to take from very abstract places. It has been like this since the first human connected the dots between lighting and flint being smashed together.

** Hermione Granger is a skilled, intelligent student. For proof of that, just take a look at her OWL results (and 1st year Charms exam). She's also rather clever (see figuring out that Lupin was a werewolf). But is she a genius or prodigy? I would say no, especially if you compare her to Snape (potions prodigy and Dark Arts prodigy), James Potter (animagus by 15, part of creating an amazing magical artifact), Sirius (animagus by 15, part of creating an amazing magical artifact), Lupin (part of creating an amazing magical artifact and I assume helped with three attaining animagus forms by 15), Wormtail (while Lupin and Black both claimed that Peter wasn't magically gifted, we cannot truly trust their opinions due to personal biases. I would argue the same thing with what McGonagall said, because that would naturally have been in comparison with the other students of the time. Also an animagus by 15, part of creating an amazing magical artifact), Grindlewald, Dumbledore and Voldemort.

If there were any of the main three that could be considered a magical genius, I would honestly put forth Harry. Look at what he has done with magic, and what he understands of magic. The first example that comes to mind is the receiving of Gryffindor's sword (as stated in DH, actions can have incalculable magical power). Then there is the ever popular example of the Patronus Charm at 13, though I am less impressed by him casting it then with his explanation to Hermione (which she didn't understand). And virtually the entirety of /Deathly Hallows/ was Harry and his instinctual grasp of deeper, strange magic.

***** Just reread the scene... I'm not seeing it. Basically, Harry is pretty desperate at that point, dodging the basilisk's tail, praying for help:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    ‘Help me, help me,' Harry muttered wildly, ‘someone, anyone!'

    The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face. The Basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance. He rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the Basilisk's tail swung over him again.

    ‘Help me ... help me ...' Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the Hat. ‘Please help me!' There was no answering voice. Instead, the Hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.

    Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head, almost knocking him out.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

So what he does is put on the hat that lands in his hand and continues to do the same thing as he was doing a moment ago, but into the hat. If someone powerful, wise, and benevolent sends you a magic hat, yeah, you put it on. What else are you going to do?

we have very little information on how those school tests are conducted. It could be a case of her being good at memorizing information and the testing skewed heavily toward simple fact recollection - which is a relatively big deal in a world without computers and medieval indexed information storage.

If so, she wouldn't be considered anything special in context of many intelligence measuring tools we have today.

That said 'intelligence' is often like that - it is more of a measurement of how well a persons mind is adapted to a given set of circumstances and a genius in one setting can be seen as mediocre in another if their abilities don't fit the requirements.

We know the OWL tests contain one or both: 1. a written portion (Divination was not mentioned to have one) 2. They contain a practical portion (I don't believe that Ancient Runes and Arithmancy had a practical portion beyond the written concerning the natures of the courses)

For the tests/exams given by the Hogwarts professors, they all seem to be practical based. For potions, create a potion. For charms, cast a series of charms. Transfiguration was to transfigure something. Divination was using Divination. Remus Lupin's obstacle course. Lockhart's vanity survey does not count as an actual test. So we know that /at least/ Hogwarts professors focus on using/applying the spells and magic they have learned for a grade.

*** Personally, I'm not a fan on the canon Harry Potter due to him being infinitely worse in every aspect than either of his parents. I'm pretty sure that you'd be hard pressed to find anything that Harry does better than either James or Lily. I consider those two, along with the rest of the Marauders and Snape to be the geniuses of their generation. Creating such an intricate and immensely useful magical artifact while still in school, using magic and combining different spells in ways never even spoken about in the franchise, speaks magnitudes to their genius.

Of course, she's got to be fairly adept at dueling to be a part of the original Order of the Phoenix, but no evidence about her being a genius. Harry is very good at DADA, conjured a NEWT-level corporeal Patronus (that even some adults can't) at the age of 13. He's good at dueling, too, and I think he's got good enough instincts and reflexes when it comes to fighting. Not a genius by any means, but I don't think it's fair to call him 'infinitely worse' either.

Hermione: 100+% on a Charms exam, as someone part of the magical world for less than a year. Takes intelligence. And it's not just a fact regurgitation, but includes practical portion as well. Of her 11 OWL exams: 10 O and one E. And these tests are both theoretical (fact memorization) and practical (application/use). Takes intelligence. Not Einstein, Oppenheimer or Linus Pauling intelligence. But still real, above average intelligence. Kept her two best friends from figuring out for a whole year that she was attending classes at the exact same time. Figured out that Slytherin's Monster was a basilisk. Mastered the Protean charm (DA coins) in her 5th year. Brewed Polyjuice Potion as a second year, in a dingy, run-down bathroom.

Harry, is an interesting case. Excepting Defense against the Dark Arts, academically he would most likely be considered an average, or a bit above, student. However, when it comes to weird magic, he has an instinctual grasp that seems to be beyond anyone that we see in canon except Dumbledore and probably Grindlewald (I include Grindlewald because it is heavily implied that the only difference between Dumbledore and Grindlewald are of philosophy/character and Dumbledore being a hair more skillful). Knowing he could cast a Patronus because he saw future-Harry cast one in his past takes a... strange kind of instinctual intelligence about the nature of magic and time. Take a look back at the /Priori Incantatem/ during /GoF/. He *knew* that he had to push the bead where his magic and Voldemort's met towards Voldemort's wand, while Voldemort was confused, scared and shitting himself (figuratively). And remember, according to Dumbledore Voldemort was the most accomplished student Hogwarts has ever had. There is also Harry's instinctual recognition that the doe Patronus was friendly, while there was no evidence for it to be so. There is also, very shortly after the doe Patronus, that Harry knew that Ron had to destroy the locket because Harry understands the incalculable magic of certain acts, which is not something you would find in a textbook.

Honestly? Your OP (and especially the title) put forth a false dichotomy of "[x] is either a genius or not smart." Intelligence is a thing of degrees, different directions and there is no good way to accurately quantify intelligence (IQ is not a measurement of total intelligence, and its use as a measurement of a kind of intelligence is highly controversial).

She can memorize facts and apply them (skill at magic) while completely ignoring other parts of magic that don't match her worldview (outside of cases of abuse, house-elves don't want to be free. Discounts the possibility of the Deathly Hallows existing until Ollivander goes on his Elder Wand talk) and being socially stupid (1st year, 3rd year, 5th year, 6th year).

But yes, Hermione Granger is actually smart.

The OWL for Charms at least, had both a practical portion and a written portion. We actually see Harry start taking the written portion (wand motion and incantation of the spell that makes objects fly) and the practical is montaged (he overpowered/overdid his Cheering Charm). We know from /Snape's Worst Memories/ and Harry's own OWL that the Defense against the Dark Arts OWL had a written portion (the /SWM/ OWL had a question on werewolves) and a practical involved use of defense spells.

Of the Divination OWL, we know for sure about the testing of use on Crystal Balls and tea leaves. Ancient Runes involved translation. In Potions you had to make at least one potion.

As a note: the Defense OWL did not include use of the Patronus Charm. Professor Tofty had heard that Harry could cast a corporeal Patronus, and offered extra credit if Harry could do so.

It seems clear then, that OWLs test 1. Knowledge. Of both facts (incantations, werewolf distinguishing features) and most probably theory. 2. Skill/application (use of the knowledge)

**** Comparing Harry to his parents seems distinctly unfair. First, they were raised in seemingly loving and caring households. That type of upbringing gives you a leg up. Harry's confidence was utter trash, its not until later in the series that he starts to realize he has potential and acting on it.

Secondly, neither of his parents had to deal with a yearly adventure featuring one of the most dangerous dark wizards of all times. That type of thing is going to take up a lot of your time, and without very precise guidance(which Harry never had) it would probably hold you back.

Also, although James and Lily were clearly skilled with magic, we don't really have a clear idea of just how talented they were. James was obviously a generational talent at transfiguration, but Harry seems to at least match him with quidditch. And we don't know if James made the map or not, it may have all been Remus and Sirius. In all reality it was probably an accident the thing worked at all, or else they would have just made another when Filch confiscated it. Lily is 'talented'. That is all she is described as, and as she is a war hero and people are describing her to her orphaned son, it isn't unlikely they exaggerate just how wonderful she was.

I would love for Harry to have been better at magic in canon. I would have loved for canon magic to really have been fleshed out and described in detail. But I can understand why he wasn't, and thus why magic itself wasn't.

But she was consistently one of the first to understand magic in basically every topic under the sun.

She is able to APPLY that knowledge, which I think is the biggest indicator of intelligence. She figured out the monster was a basilisk before literally anyone else in the school.

She created the Cursed parchment and coins of the DA, which is implied to be very advanced.

Basically everyone who knows her says she is the brightest witch of her year.

I mean, what else do you want? She's not writing on the walls, spouting jargon about fundamental magical principles- Rowling very rarely mentions magical mechanics at all.

She's excellent at learning, at researching, in usage, and is able to apply all three of those talents to the problem at hand.

A good example we have of this is the Marauders. Remus was the 'academic' one but everyone agrees James and Sirius were very talented and smart as well, and we get the impression they all worked together on their big projects like the Map and the Animagus transformation. Perhaps not with the perfect cohesiveness of the Weasley Twins, but we get the idea they were a really effective team.

The Trio had a very different dynamic; Ron was uninterested, Harry distracted, leaving Hermione to be the mastermind behind everything from the Polyjuice Potion to the Defense Association. She even had time to start an organization pushing for the rights of House Elves, completely on her own, which her friends at most viewed with amusement, but didn't provide her any intellectual engagement on, let alone real support. And this is despite Harry having clear evidence that /some/ House Elves are abused, through his friendship with Dobby.

**** I am always under the impression that Hermione was supporting Harry along with Ron because Harry just had so many problems that he really needed his friends to be mostly there to support him unless someone else like Dumbledore was doing the job. As a result Hermione never got the chance to shine herself until the war is over.

If you take a closer a look at a lot of Harry's achievements especially those that require planning or research of any kind, it's usually Hermione doing all the background work like organising the DA, doing the Horcrux research in HBP and DH, organise the Horcrux hunt trip using that beaded bag she created, etc. Harry as the hero unfortunately only seems to be there at the end every time inspecting the results and reaping the fruits of her labour but didn't do much to help out in the actual process. However, when it comes to fighting evil directly, Harry is clearly better especially given Hermione's tendency to freeze up in really dangerous situations.

Harry seems to be rather disinterested in anything not directly concerning him as long as nobody is in physical danger because he does have the heroic “saving people thing” that Hermione mentioned. Otherwise he seems to be just looking for a fun and easy life at Hogwarts. Like what you said, Harry was just as uninterested in SPEW as Ron was, even though he was brought up in the Muggle world unlike Ron meaning he was supposed to have a more negative view of slavery than Ron. By the end of the series even Ron was more interested in the house elves' welfare in general than Harry was.

I also tend to agree what comparing smart people from different generations is quite difficult to say the least considering they are facing completely problems, working with completely different friends and having completely different backgrounds. Like what beetnemesis said, it's quite difficult to conclude definitively who is more impressive: the Marauders or Hermione.

** Until the introduction of the Deathstick, I thought it was canon that extraordinary magical ability only comes through intense study and rigorous practice. I'd imagine that Hermione has a wide vocabulary of spells, but doesn't have the time available in her busy study schedule to master every spell she comes across. This could give her the ability to cast a plethora of spells accurately at a rather intermediate level, but wouldn't give her the talent to expertly cast extraordinarily complicated spells without significant revision and failed prior attempts.

Ultimately, though, JKR had a character master - or fail to master - a specific spell only when it was vital to the narrative. It's true that there are notable gaps in her research abilities. Someone else has already mentioned that she failed to find the Bubble-Head Charm before the Second Task of the TWT. I think it's appropriate to mention her quote to some librarians regarding Madam Pince (another potential underutilised source of information):

#+begin_quote
  "I would like to apologise for you and any other librarians present here today and my get-out clause is always if they'd had a pleasant, helpful librarian, half my plots would be gone.

Is she a 'scientific genius' like Darwin, Newton or Turing? Nope, there really does not seem to be a physical or mathematical pattern in magic which these characters can unlock. I don't think Dumbledore or Voldemort have that type of brain power.

Is she a philosophical genius like Socrates? A political genius like Machiavelli? A culinary genius? A military genius? A comedic genius? A circus genius?

My point is there are many types, and if you're thinking of the autism-spectrum rain-man type that can count cards in the air and note the order in which they fell then, quite clearly, no.

Could she develop the skill to become a magical genius? I think her, Bill Weasley and Percy Weasley are the ones with all the qualifications we've seen (Mirroring Dumbledore and Voldemort's OWLs and NEWT performance, having teachers gush about their abilities).

I think he has potential to be a magical force, and possibly could have been if her Ravenclaw traits were more dominant.

** Well, the fact is she *isn't supposed to be a genius.* Canon Hermione is intelligent, but JKR, with all three characters, shows that they aren't extremely special, but still manage to accomplish all that they did. Holding Hermione to a regular standard, she's far beyond all others of her age, in magical theory and understanding, as well as well above average in casting (112%, case in point). Someone says she couldn't find the bubble-head charm, year 4, well, it wasn't her job to help Harry, she wasn't exempt from classes. She was still attending all her class and still maintaining her position at the top of class, researching in her free time. And even then, She is extremely logical, and if you'll refer to year 6, she didn't use the HBP's instructions because she didn't see *why* they work. Overall, she is intelligent, and accomplishled far more than most others at her age.

Those are two things that require more of a good reaction time than thinking slowly and keeping to a comfort zone which is what she does best. The fact that she's so against the idea of Deathly Hallows existing shows that she's too logical for her own good as well.

She's not that socially intelligent either. Goblet of Fire pretty much hammers this fact home, with the overwhelming amount of times that Harry is bothered by her reminding him that he has yet to figure out how to survive some of the deadliest stuff a student could go through. It's logical, but it's not how people work. It's also the main reason why Harry generally has more fun with Ron.

****** Yes, Harry was an above average student judged by his OWL results but not at the top of the year like Hermione and he didn't do anything extraordinary at school other than flying and DADA. Perhaps if he studied harder he could have done better at school. However, I think his shining moments generally came when he was in grave danger on those dangerous adventures which is the opposite to Hermione who worked the best when she was given time to plan and research (and it doesn't have to be very long, like that time in Umbridge's office she only needed minutes to come up with the plan to lure Umbridge into the forest)

**** I don't consider her picking up most magic very quickly to be proof of her being creative or inventive, just as being prepared for class and, yes, she is very gifted in Charms class. I'm not saying she's stupid or not talented, either - she would be a Mary Sue if she was gifted at /everything/, though, and she isn't, and that's a good thing.

I always gave Harry more credit for solving the abstract problems. She provided the research, and they often collaborated, but I felt like Harry was the one putting it together when it counted. This is just a matter of opinion, but I was never really impressed with the DA's security, to be honest, so I guess I unconsciously discount it - but fair enough, that was pretty inventive.

Just to be clear, I love Hermione, she's one of my favorite characters, so I wasn't trying to say she is stupid or worthless - I just also like to guard myself against turning her into a Sue, too, so I try not to exaggerate her good /or/ bad qualities. It can be hard to stay balanced and not go too far one way or the other.

*** I remember Hermione as being the intellectual of the group but I now realize that I based that assumption on her doing all her homework and doing well on her exams. Unlike our school system where tests are designed to test the ability to either solve a complicated math problem or persuading a reader to change their outlook in reading/writing class, the test questions in the Harry Potter universe deal with regurgitating facts from textbooks. None of the questions mentioned in the O.W.L. required any critical thinking whatsoever.

So why is she, in your eyes, intelligent?

**** There are different types of intelligence, and that's mostly why. She did well in school and she is very book smart - therefore, she is intelligent. The word 'intelligent' doesn't imply 'genius' or 'polymath', so I consider it a fair assessment. It doesn't mean she's good at everything - but it's very clear in canon that she is not /un/intelligent. A lot of smart people aren't good at critical thinking, simply because it's not where their natural intelligence lies. I don't think that makes them stupid.

Likewise, Harry and Ron are both intelligent - in completely different ways. Ron has a talent for strategy (chess), and while we have no proof that he's master level, we also don't /need/ proof of that, because not being an elite genius doesn't automatically make a person stupid. I don't care to split hairs or measure the characters' IQs, as it's enough to know that they're fairly smart people and what their strengths are. Since they're fictional, it's all academic anyway, so I don't feel very strongly about any of it - as long as authors don't start writing any of them as knuckle-dragging morons (or as omnipotent über-geniuses), I can accept just about any interpretation of their intelligence levels.

***** I totally agree with all your points, I guess what I was trying to say, but came out poorly, is why is Hermione classified as this absurd 9001 IQ monster who can solve literally any solution just because she's so smart in a good amount of fanfic?

Yes, I get that she does well on her exams but from my own personal experience, the friends I have who get hundreds on every exam are the ones who prepared heavily in advance while also cramming each and every index card of notes they made the day before. None of them will probably ever invent an entire new way of doing something like how Hermione can figure out a way to "shield electronics from magic," "figure out a way to kill the most powerful man alive with zero risk."

Again, not saying she isn't smart, sorry if it came off that way, but I'm saying she isn't "smart" like the way she is in fanfic.

** First of all, you need to be smart to be able to memorize textbooks. If you have someone who isn't smart, they're not going to be able to do that. Additionally, DADA seems to be a more practical subject than many others. While knowledge is an important factor, skill, bravery, luck, are all just as important. Hermione didn't get perfect on her third year DADA exam, not because she didn't know what to do, but because she couldn't overcome her fear. (Quick recap: As part of the exam, students faced a boggart, and that was where Hermione failed) We also don't know why Hermione didn't get an O on DADA, but I think it's safe to assume she lost points on the spell casting portion. If this is the case, it's possible that the lost points where due to something other than a lack of knowledge or genius.

I also don't think that, following your definition of genius, it is at all possible to classify Hermione as one or not. The engineering student who knows tons of facts about bridges might still be a genius. Before learning or discovering any new facts, you must first have an understanding of things that have been discovered before you. Stephen Hawking is a genius, but he also would have started out learning thousands of facts and theories about stars. Since we only see Hermione in this initial learning phase, it's hard to make a decision either way. Even in fanfiction though, it's rare that Hermione fits your definition of genius, unless it's a next-gen fanfic. Usually, she's just an extremely intelligent student who knows her stuff, and that's how she is displayed in canon.

** I asssume she is a genius, since that is how she is portrayed as. It's always tricky to deduce a character's abilities from the events in the books since the books, from volume 1 on, constantly make characters act dumber than they are so the plot works. Unless we all agree that Dumbledore is dumber than a rock for not figuring out the basilisk despite Hermione managing it, taking a broom to an emergency meeting and not the floo or apparate, making traps to keep away (or at least fool) a Dark Lord that did not stop three first years, failing to spot his old friend being replaced, etc. etc.

1. This, of course, assumes that Dumbledore wasn't utilizing Legilimency on Harry. If Dumbledore was,^{2} the issue becomes one not of Dumbledore's and Hermione's intelligence, but of manipulative Dumbledore.

** She reads a lot, when no one else does (at least amongst the small crosssection of people we see). That gives her some knowledge that wouldn't normally be picked up in class, but that's it really. She probably does it because she's been under the impression that as a muggleborn, she would be behind everyone else who has grown up with magic, but in trying to correct that assumption, she actually got herself ahead of the curve, since apparently there's no pureblood nerds at all (perhaps that's why Daphne is so popular?). But, being a nerd and being a genius aren't the same thing. It's a shame that she's frequently the worst written character in any given fanfic because the author is always too busy jerking off to how perfect and awesome she is and how Harry can't even take a piss without her help.

Also a reason why I brought this whole thread up is that I honestly feel that if Harry or Ron actually ENJOYED researching and studying, they'd be on the same level as Hermione was portrayed to be. No offense to those who believe that everyone is born equal, but Harry and Ron have a lot of advantages in the wizarding world when compared to Hermione.

Ron has a huge family from which to draw resources and advice.

Harry is the boy who lived, that title along with his bank vault, opens so many more doors that Hermione will never get through. It's like comparing Donald Trump with that nerdy girl in your class.

***** Yes I agree that if Harry and Ron studied harder at school and were less obsessed with Quidditch then they would have done much better at school although I am still not sure they will be at the same level as Hermione who has memorised all her textbooks before the school year even started. Considering how they didn't seem to be that studious students and still achieved quite good results in OWLs, I am amazed to keep hearing people who say they are stupid.

I agree with what you said about Harry and Ron having some advantages over Hermione. However I still think though Hermione had the most advantageous family background out of the Trio. Harry although he had a huge vault of gold and was famous, but he had to live in perpetual abuse with relatives who don't love him before he found out he was a wizard. Ron has a big and loving wizard family yes, but he was also overshadowed by all his brothers and his baby sister as well as being dirt-poor for almost all of his childhood meaning he had to get everything second-handed. It was constantly implied that his parents was hoping that he was a girl which did nothing to help with his self-esteem. Hermione on the other hand was a single child from a quite wealthy family. Yes, she might not be as wealthy as Harry but considering how her parents were always able to take her to overseas holidays her family must be pretty well off. Her only disadvantage is that she had to learn the magical world by herself which can be rectified much more easily compared with the emotional problems Harry and Ron experienced and the financial problems Ron had.

  It's been nearly a decade since I read all of the original 7 Harry Potter novels and after stumbling across the fact that J.K. Rowling specifically mentioned that Harry achieved an Outstanding in the Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. while Hermione didn't
#+end_quote

Bits and pieces of this have appeared in other posts here, but I thought I'd put them together here. A while ago, on a different forum, a bunch of posters and I tried to sort out precisely what they could have thrown at Hermione that led her to get an EE in DADA when Harry got an O. The passage in question is as follows:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    and then, on Thursday, Defence Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall.

    ‘Oh, bravo!' cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell. ‘Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter ... unless ...'

    He leaned forwards a little.

    ‘I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point ... ?'

    Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked.

    ‘Expecto patronum!'

    His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.

    ‘Excellent!' he said. ‘Very well, Potter, you may go!'
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I can't take credit for this, but the best hypothesis we had (IMO) was that:

1. They had to actually banish a boggart. That's less about magical talent and skill (since they learn it in 3rd year) and more about recognizing the boggart as such and thinking under pressure. The latter is something Harry is both naturally good and experienced at, whereas Hermione isn't. She may have lost points there.
2. Patronus Charm is not taught until NEWTs if at all (which makes sense, since unless one knows Dumbledore's messenger Patronus trick, it's completely useless to almost everyone), so can't be a standard part of the OWLs: only Harry got a shot at the bonus points, and the dialogue is consistent with that. Notice that Hermione could have demonstrated one as well, given the opportunity.

So sum it up, what made the difference was not magical skill but the non-magical combat-related aptitude. That, and favoritism.

She was smart enough to handle logistical details for the Horcrux hunt.

Not as smart as Dumbledore, Voldemort, or even Snape. She's in the same level of competence as Lily Evans, or Professor Lupin. Very good, but not Great.

** Canon Hermione is a typical "an excellent pupil". In Russian, where is a name for such girls: 'отличница'. Literally - someone who get only 'outstanding' marks. It's typically girl from good family, with parents able to spend some money and time on children, and motivated for studying. Get highest marks in all subjects, make perfect homework but rarely have talent in anything specific. Usually such girls can't apply even basic learned skills outside of classroom, so Hermione is one of the best.

She looks like genius in comparison to lazy idiots like Ron and Harry.

It's more or less clear from her Outstanding OWL on Wizarding History, and attempt to take Muggle Studies in third year.

Spending days to actually remember all historical facts is useless if you are not planning to become professional historian - it's much better to read some history books to get a common 'feeling' and learn facts up to Acceptable level, spending extra hours to get better in really useful subjects.

Muggle Studies is useless to muggle-raised, and if you are 'just curious' how wizards learn about muggles - just read the book and, may be, visit one or two lessons in spare time. No, it's clearly attempt to get one more O in OWL/NEWT exams.
