Like the title says i'm looking for fics where Lily or James (though not both) Survive and end up raising Harry.

If Lily survives no Snape/Lily please, Snape doesn't deserve her, at all.

If James survive i'd prefer no slash but If theirs one that is an absolute must read sure go ahead and link it.

Prefer no bashing of any kind.

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)

** My favourite Lily lives fic is actually a dystopian one-shot (albeit a long one). There is no boy who lived. James is around for some of it, but he's not in the picture because reasons.
