All spells described in the book are about how to sculpt and fire clay pottery through magic. There doesnt appear any useful spells in the book. Until harry comes to an entry about how to use fiendfyre to cook pottery...

** Wait until he gets to the section on Ritual Pottery.

No joke, ceramics and pottery have been parts of civilization for thousands of years. Wiccan, Shamanistic, Egyptian, African, Mayan, and a bunch of others used them ritualistically.

I saw a documentary once where this African tribe would decant specially made beer into this odd-looking pot, pass it around for drinks, and then someone would blow on one end to blow the dregs out and study the pattern. That's right, Divination.

***** There was one with these like almost Anime-style family magics. I honestly don't like that concept, as it justifies blood purity - and those fics never do anything to alleviate that, like give the muggleborn students a comparable advantage.

****** I think it makes sense(family magic, NOT anime style) depending on how you see magic working, generations upon generations of wizards expanding and adapting their magic and increasing their families', kind of like an /egregore/(don't know if there's such a term in English) which is basically an idea and/or personage that becomes more real with belief and faith. Think low-key American gods.

Maybe after some time their family totems became real and semi-sentient through this method.

Maybe they used blood magic to create one and tied it to their bloodlines or at least tied some other entity.

Maybe family magic has nothing to do with blood and is just secret magic only taught to family.

I don't see the problem with muggle-borns not having an equal advantage, canon is already too lenient with it.

I mean shouldn't kids from magical families learn magic as kids? And I fully agree most families would just block the trace in their homes if they could.

I always thought it would be much more interesting seeing a muggleborn succeeding /despite/ all the disadvantages than just lowering the purebloods to be incompetent and weak.

******* There is a simple way to give muggle borns an "edge", if you make it that purebloods have affinity to the types of magic that their family uses and need more effort to practice magic outside of that, then you give muggleborns a blank slate and then its left up to the muggleborn to create their own niche. You could even have some purebloods hating muggleborns because unlike their ancestors (who developed their family magic) all of the new muggleborns are being boring and general.

******** That could work, though I was talking more about different kinds of magic, not general ones, but you could have quirks for each family.

-Potters, good at transfiguration and fire(making clay pots), hero complex

-Blacks, good with blood magic and curses, bad temper and vulnerability to insanity, low mental stability

-Longbottoms, Good with plants, defensive magic, shy, don't like changes.

-Malfoys, Good with illusions, arrogance.

Could even expand that a bit with people having combinations, for example, a Harry descended from Potter and Black, could be good with fire, curses, and have a short temper AND hero complex.

I was also thinking of the Family Magic some people use where the magic is semi-sentient and has to judge if people are worthy of being Family Head, maybe one where there's even a totem.

Muggleborns could just be neutral magic and blank slates and say things like "Hey, maybe it is harder for me to cast a firestorm but at least my family dinner doesn't end in spellfire and screams"

****** I would argue that it is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as it remains consistent, or at least the caricature is entertaining.

Blood Purity in canon is a bad thing, because it is used to justify hate crimes, inbreeding and has no relation to facts. However, if one were to pursue the thread of thought starting with family talents, like Trelawney seers, Black Metamorphomagi, etc... It could be made to work, especially if those families only get special privilleges due to their long history of providing goods and services to the Wizarding Community as a whole.

Finally, I vehemently disagree with giving Muggleborn a leg up the competition for free. Giving them a small upgrade to mental parameters to express the critical thinking and common sense imparted on them in their youth - sure. That is something they can be expected to possess given their means and upbringing. Giving them magical advantages to match the estabilished wizardng clans - NO.

Like it or not, muggleborn are immigrants. Ones that are invited in, of course, but when looking at the start (new muggleborn just got a Hogwarts/Poppins letter) - they are unknown, they have no prior training, they contribute nothing.

In many works this is ignored, and we have great muggleborn revolution dragging the Wix World to 20th century... Except those usually fail to address both the problems with that endavour and the fact that as backwards as WW can sometimes seem, it's holding strong and has for centuries. Despite that, the would-be revolutionaries usually study neither the culture they wish to root out, nor the magic/technology progress - and why it is not so frantic as the muggle world's. Especially given the fact that muggle (our) growth is not sustainable.

TLDR: Blood clans are fine, but Noblesse Oblige. Super/Revolutionary Muggleborns are not, unless extreme amounts of worldbuilding are done to justify the phenomenon. I think Muggleborn should be able to gain recognition for merit - but since they (from a certain perspective) appear from nowhere, they would naturally lack resources that their more privilleged peers would possess. They would also be subject to less pressure.

******* Pretty good perspective.

It's like with clans in Naruto (another popular FF community) - they have some unique and strong hereditary abilities/ones that are taught only to them by clan, but anyone can get up there in terms of power if they're just good enough on their own merit.

The only problem here i think is the canon attitude and beliefs of pureblooded families - they don't feel superior and stay at it, they actively seek to genocide muggleborns - in that vein, that's why wizarding supremacy should be frowned upon. In order to make a fic where some sort of 'pureblood superiority' makes sense is to make an AU where they aren't a bunch of inbred genocidal maniacs, but simple magical aristocrats/intelligencia - a bit self centered and superior, but willing to accept some outsider if they show merit (and behave 'properly', because that's what such cliques of stuck up bastards usually care about anyway)

** In a dark corner, far from the treasures of gold, gems and various magical items, stood an ornate lecturn and upon that lecturn, sat a dusty tome from an age long past, surrounding it were shelfs carved from stone with rows of tiny statues hewn from a myriad of materials.

As Harry approached, a heavy feeling of dread and desire washed over him, looking past the book, upon a pedestal stood a sickly green jar, carved into in was a face twisted in deranged grin, seemingly anticpating his approach.

Gathering himself after the initial wave of this *wrongness shooting through his body, he did the sensibl thing and advanced towards the book to open it.

Harry clicked his tongue, he didn't know this language, he would have to bring it to Hermione and was debating on whether he would share his heritage with her, wondering if it was even fully his to give away. Before he made the decision however, the script changed into a style of English probably older that his great granfather, hardly a convenient read but still manageable.

The introduction contained the a retelling of the myths of Prometheus and the fashioning of humans from clay, the breath of life given to them through the gift of fire. The story of Pandora and her pithos.

"A pithos," Harry asked himself, "not a box?"

A cliffnote appeared as he said the question aloud, it described a pithos as a large Greek jar and a page number. Curious, Harry flipped to the page noted and on it was the same smiling green jar behind the lecturn. Pandora's** Pot** of** Greed**, it read, the details of which redundantly described how it look and a sentence stating that the pithos would grant two great blessings upon the one who opened it.

Harry wondered what kind of blessings they could be, he had had enough of the terrible luck that always seemed to plague him and maybe, if he opened this jar that bad luck would be reversed.

"SNAP OUT OF IT, YOU FOOLISH BOY!"

Twisting around to find out where the voice had come from, Harry stood at the ready, his wand in hand in a split second.

"Who's there?" he asked glancing around.

Suddenly one of the small statues on a shelf came to life and started to berate him.

"Can't you understand that it was tempting you? What oaf has our family born? IT IS FAMILY LAW NOT TO TOUCH THE JAR! MUCH LESS OPEN IT!

Harry had no response it his confusion and shock that such a tiny statue would be verbally assaulting him.

"THE JAR WILL GIVE YOU A BLESSING BUT WILL UNLEASH A BLIGHT UPON THE WORLD AS WELL, DID YOU NOT READ THE MYTH OF PANDORA AT ALL?

(anyway i could go further with this, but its 4 am and i thought that was enough, this was a combination of yugioh, greek myth, and pjo hopefully it will be somewhat legible when i wake up from my mini coma of 11 hours, goodnight, morning whatever)(as a side note, the mini statues were supposed to be shabti, with knowledge imbued into them by every Potter using the breath of life mentioned in the Prometheus myth, working somewhat like the portraits)

** I mean depending on how fast it would take to set the room/kiln to the temperature needed for a specific magical pot composition, it might be decent for creating an insta-trap. I mean you could make it to where a whole room is a kiln and thus it kills everyone who isn't wearing temperature protection amulets because it instantly sets the temperature to the one desired and its dragon fire level or higher in terms of heat. Maybe some of the fires spells could be used offensively and because they were originally used to start/extend the kiln burn times are considered necessary to make the pots themselves, thus they need a specific counter spell that no one but Harry has to undo the damage caused by them as like goblin forged blades you wouldn't want people fucking with it. I mean it would technically be considered dark magic, or just be literally considered dark magic depending on your interpretation of what dark magic is.
