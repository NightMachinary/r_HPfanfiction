** The Arithmancer series by White Squirrel is Hermione/George but it takes through the first fic to get there. It's also not a romance, it's more focused on Hermione's character development. The series is complete and covers year one through post Hogwarts.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.
