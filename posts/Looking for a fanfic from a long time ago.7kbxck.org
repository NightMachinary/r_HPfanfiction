A long time ago I remember reading a really long and at the time incomplete story about Harry being chosen by some goddess who at the time is in the body of a hot neighbor who Harry is working for by tending her garden I think, I'm pretty sure the beginning of the story starts off with Harry shirtless and describes him as tanned. After excepting the offer of this goddess (something like you have to have sex and bring people back to worshiping me so I'll gain power again) he goes on to move into a hidden house in the middle of a river I believe and messes about with quantum mechanics and builds pocket dimensions while having sex with nym Tonks and Fleur Delacour (who gets really hooked on playing video games). I have an idea that it's called something along to lines of black Phoenix or something like that but could be totally wrong. If anyone has the link to it or bows the real title please help me out! Thanks.


** Fleur playing video games? Well, I want this.

** I know this! Cant remember what it was called though. It wasnt on fanfiction.net thats for sure. It was basically a porn fic but with a generous helping of plot. Ill see if I can find it.

EDIT: Found it I think. [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=833]]
