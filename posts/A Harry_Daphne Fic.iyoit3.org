:END:
(Edit: Fic has been found, thank you ðŸ˜˜)

I'm looking for a fanfiction, and the important details that I remember were of the following: 1. It was a HP/DG fic, obviously. 2. I think Harry turned down a betrothal contract to her at some point. 3. Towards the end, during a school break Daphne's father forces her into a betrothal with some really old â€˜lord' from Romania or somewhere. 4. The old dude forces Daphne to wear a weird shackle thing that stops her from disobeying him. 5. Harry challenges old dude to an â€˜honor duel' in front of the Wizengamot (<---spelling?) and kills him. 6. There was an alternate ending bit that involved Harry slapping a portkey onto Daphne and escaping to a â€˜Black Family Island'. Thanks

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.
