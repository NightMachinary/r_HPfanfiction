Hello fellow strangers. Recently I was going through a somewhat odd authors collection. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. He only wrote four stories I could find, but once is a wonderful unfinished work called red. linkffn(9472509).

I was wondering if anyone knew any other fics in a similar vein with the brother sister angle played. I like the idea of Harry as a protective older brother to his sister, not brother to brother which I've read dozens of (Current favorite Prince of Slytherin). Perhaps its because I have a sister but can't imagine trying to protect her from anything without being paid. Hmm. Irrelevant. Anyway. Any rec's would be appreciated, and as always thank you for your time.


** linkffn(Too Young To Die) has him being /very/ concerned for his sister's wellbeing.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Thirteen years ago, the Dark Lord attacked Longbottom Manor and was defeated by the baby Neville Longbottom. Or so said Dumbledore. The Potters have a huge secret, known only by their greatest allies... and a certain Dark Lord.

  When Harry Potter finally arrives at Hogwarts, many are surprised at what they find. Maybe Dumbledore should have checked on his little pawn now and then. Because Harry has started to build a family of his own, and they will not let others break them apart. Gray!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, Eventual Slash
