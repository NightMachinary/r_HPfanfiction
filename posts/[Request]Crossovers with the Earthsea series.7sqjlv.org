***** wow so it seems like there isn't a very large fandom(as far as fanfiction writing goes, anyway) for Earthsea... 59 fics in the entirety of ffn(not even crossovers, just 59 fics for Earthsea)... this is even worse than my request for crossovers with the Bartimaeus trilogy.

******* Nope. Although there are 6 on ffn, none are complete and only one is over 10k words. They might be good, idk lol I didn't actually look at them.

Here's the page if you want to look at them to save you a few seconds lol
