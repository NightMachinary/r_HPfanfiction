** ... It's not very often that I get 'what the fuck did I just read'-itis from a summary.

That's some Turbo-evil Dumbles right there.

**** ...They do realize that diving suits weigh like, 700 pounds right? What kind of demigod is this Ron that he can not only walk around in almost half a ton of armor, but also do so /silently/?!
