So I just started reading Northumbrian's stuff since it is highly recommended here. I finished "Aurors and Schoolgirls" but it looks like it was never completed. Does anyone know if the author plans on completing or how much plot is lost between that story and the next in the chronological order?


** No idea if he'll get back to it. But there isn't any plot lost if you jump to his next fic.

*** I think he had a plot with the Wylde character and the Slytherin girl that never got resolved.

** Northumbrian from what I know just hasn't been writing as much this past year or so. But the unfinished stories are not necessarily abandoned. Just halted.
