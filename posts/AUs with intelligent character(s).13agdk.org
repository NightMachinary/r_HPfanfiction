I'm looking for interesting stories where Harry is studious and actually uses his brain from time to time. All the better if there are insights into magical theory peppered throughout the tale or even littering it. Preferably complete stories or consistently updating.

Examples:

*** Thanks a ton, a list like this is precisely what I was hoping to get. I've read a most of those already and agree with your assessment of them. You are probably familiar with it but I think you might like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]]

***** I really did enjoy it! I was a little dubious at first but I gave it a chance and I ended up wishing for more. Off to go read those additional chapters now, thank you!

*** Thanks but I have a hate/love relationship with hp:mor. On the one hand it was my first fanfic but on the other the writing ranges from preachy to pedantic at best. Not to mention a lack of believable characters while confusing convoluted schemes as plot. However, fans of it might like to know that someone out there has the free time and dedication to make a 'series' out of it via Sims 3. [[http://www.youtube.com/user/SamPotter041009][Link]]

** The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave (complete) The BEST fanfic I have ever read, Harry is very studious and it is overflowing with magical theory and such. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] (Beware: the whole series is about 6 times the length of the actual harry potter series)
