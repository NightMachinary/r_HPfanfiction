At first, it's just him, Ron, Hermione, and the Wesley Twins; people are reluctant to join because of Harry's Parseltongue abilities. When all 5 of them absolutely own their midterms (or whatever they are called in British educational nomenclature), a few more join them. By the time Ginny is taken to the Chamber, Harry and Ron are too fast for Lockhart; Harry stuns the ponce while Ron distracts him, and both boys are able to continue to the final confrontation.


** Midterms aren't a thing in Britain. Most years don't even have end of year exams in real schools.

However, the general idea sounds roughly like what happens in Nightmares of Future Past. If you have never read it, it's highly recommended. It's not dead yet, but updates are very infrequent.

**** It's a bit of a wild ride to try to find. The author had really serious medical issues for years, then came back out of nowhere with chapter 43, then the whole story was removed from ffn because of a fake copyright claim. His website says it's being re-edited and uploaded to royalroad chapter-by-chapter, but the original can be found up to chapter 38 [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/3365/][here]]. It's cut off partway through the last arc of year three, though. The original chapter 42 ended with the opening feast of GoF.

** What would they teach there though? By that time Harry only knew Flamenco and Expelliarmus. Oh and the tickling charm.

*** Initially, the Twins, who are 4th years ( and who are far more intelligent than their reputation would indicate), would provide the backbone. 2 years of magical education makes a major difference. Also, just picking up a copy of "Standard Book of Spells" and saying "Hey, this spell seems pretty useful. Why don't we try to learn it?". Additionally, once Harry really put the hammer down on training in 4th year in preparing for the final challenge, it only takes him a couple of months for him to be able to both survive the Maze (albeit with assistance from Crouch Jn) and to escape pursuing Death Eaters while Voldemort was distracted. I don't see why that wouldn't hold true in 2nd year on a smaller scale.
