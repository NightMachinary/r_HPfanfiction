So do you like...expect him to change for the better over the course of the fic? I write him how he's portrayed in canon - clever, manipulative, uses people, etc. and for the most part, he stays like that. If he's paired with someone, it's for his own plans. However, that seems to be an issue for some. Like, they want him to fall in love or whatever, I guess. I mean, I don't fault them and I'm gonna write him however I want...just curious on others' opinions.


** There is no sense in reading Tom falling in love, I mean (it's my opinion, I could (maybe) understand why some people want it) Tom Riddle is supposed to be uncapable of love. That's his biggest stregth and weakness. If your readers want Tom to fall in love, they are free to read another fic with an OC because it would be the same.

*** Right? There are plenty of other HP characters that aren't sociopaths. In fact, pretty much all of them besides Tom Riddle are capable of falling in love.

The closest he's gonna get to love in one of my fics is this sort of respect and appreciation for a girl he's in frequent contact with. I don't want to write him in love. I'm not romantic, and it's much more fun to write a sociopath, hah.

** It seems disingenuous to change his basic nature. Wanting to change Tom Riddle into someone who doesn't see other people as means to his own ends is straight up wish fulfillment and I think does a disservice to the character. He is a manipulative bastard and has been from day one and no amount of "but I can change him!" is going to work.

I can see a situation where he meets someone and starts to fall in love and begins to have an inkling of something greater outside of himself, but being very frightened by the idea and shrinking back into himself and his set pattern. I think that Tom/Voldemort in the end was ruled by a fear of rejection, so he decided to make himself so powerful that no one would be able to reject him because he would simply force the populace to accept him through force. So, Tom meets girl, Tom starts to feel for girl, Tom fears girl will ultimately reject him, Tom forces girl to stay with him through X, Y or Z and continues being a manipulative shit.

** I love reading fics about him because I love characters who don't rely on their emotions.

I find fics where he falls in love pretty terrible. people don't just suddenly become mushy, cuddly and loving because they're having sex with someone. I like reading fics featuring Riddle for the manipulation and manoeuvring.

It's a sort of morbid curiosity, like looking at the rise of revolutionaries or all powerful figures like Putin.

I don't mind fics where he changes for the better and I can also see him as someone who isn't a complete psychopath as long as he doesn't suddenly do a personality 180. He will remain arrogant, selfish and reserved.

** If Tom Riddle has already become Lord Voldemort and made horcruxes, there shouldn't be any full redemption. In my opinion 'Twelve Dark Moons' linkffn(3037156) does this well. Lord Voldemort is just as despicable and evil as he is in canon and that doesn't change, yet at the end he feels something for Luna. Respect? At most admiration but still nowhere near love.

However if Tom Riddle was still young (less than 14~16 years old), I believe that there is still a chance of redemption and keeping him on the right track. The change must be very slow though and even if he does, he should still keep his dark and manipulative side. A good example of this is probably 'Fire Born' linkffn(9081608).

** I know it's unrealistic to expect Tom Riddle's basic nature to change, but it's still fun to read a nice fix-it story where he does change a bit, whether that's through falling in love or other means, like a Dumbledore mentor-ship, reabsorbing some of his horcruxes, or whatnot.

A good writer can make all sorts of things plausible enough for me to suspend disbelief, and fix-its are one of the things I enjoy.

On the subject of him being a sociopath- actually, from what I've read doctors don't diagnose sociopathy anymore, they diagnose antisocial personality disorder. And- here's the kicker- they don't diagnose anyone under 18. This is because not-yet-adult personalities can still change.

Again, it's probably extremely unrealistic to expect a 16-year-old who's already killed someone to change, but there's at least a slim possibility. And it becomes greater the farther back you go- I've read fics where Harry goes back in time to the 1930's to adopt a pre-Hogwarts Tom Riddle who is simply a troubled little kid at that point, and succeeds in changing him quite a lot. That's more realistic to me.

There is a misconception floating around the fandom that someone conceived under a love potion can never love. JKR has said this is not true, and that if Tom's mother, Merope, had survived and raised him his whole life would have been different.

What you asked about specifically- for me, I don't like a lot of romance fics in general, it takes the absolute best writing and characterization to keep me interested in a pure romance with not much other plot, and I in general don't understand fandom's obsession with "the pairing" of any given story. But it's a given that this is what a great deal of fans read the stories for, and they're going to want that romance for any main character, whether it's Harry, Tom, or whoever. Because that's what they like.

As far as having Tom as a central character who doesn't change at all, for me as a reader you'd better have a very good plot to keep me entertained otherwise. If the main character isn't going to change or grow, and he's a criminal, just watching him make plans and do stuff can start to feel kind of stale and sordid after a while. A lot of Voldemort scenes kind of suffer from this, he's just hanging out in his headquarters torturing death eaters all day or whatever, showing off how evil he is. Which, ick, I don't want to read a whole fic of nothing but that. If he's the main character he needs challenges to overcome, maybe some setbacks so he doesn't feel overpowered, and a normal person learns from those, at least somewhat.

*** People can like whatever they want. There are many great ones like you described. I'm not knocking it by any means. I just don't want to write it or be expected to.

I use “sociopath” here not as a clinical term but as the type of person the general population associates with it.

My head canon (or maybe it's actual canon) is that growing up in an orphanage is the biggest contributing factor to why he “can't” love.

The scenario your last paragraph describes sounds very repetitive. I would hope that every character in a story would grow and face conflict, through romance or otherwise. If it's a realistic redemption, I'd read it.

** Riddle is at his best when he's manipulative, clever, and ultimately out for himself.

That said, I wouldn't rule out reading a fic where he has a true ally or even a romantic pairing ... but most of the latter have been of questionable quality and characterization. I don't really headcanon him as a psychopath, but more of a narcissist with attachment issues, so I have no issue with him having emotions. Though if I /did/ see him as a psycho, there is some research that suggests people of that sort have an empathy "switch," so again, not bothered by a divergent characterization.

It's the crappy writing that gets to me. Oh, and all the romanticized abuse fics that would make Christian Grey wince.

*** The biggest target to hit is making his target be /interesting/. Sociopaths love differently than normal humans, but they do still love. Their love tends to be selfish and more akin to a long term, constant interest in a single person. Where being with that person is more beneficial than not. Riddle would mold what he is to match whatever that person wants, but that person must tread carefully. If she/he falls in love with Riddle as well then issues may come up. Said person would be much easier for Riddle to push around to become even more beneficial. The other person would need to be a sociopath himself for Riddle to stay in character.

** I like both fics where he stays a loveless bastard and where he falls in love. JKR made a big point about the power of people's choices- see Pettigrew vs Snape. Because of that, I've always hated how she amended canon to include being conceived under a love potion meaning you are incapable of love. In my mind, TMR was an inherently selfish child with the tendency to lash out cruelly when hurt. His early experiences with ostracization, bullying, and fearing for his life during the London bombings helped worsen his cruel tendencies. So thanks to nature and nurture, he became the murderous dark lord we all enjoy reading about.

I don't think he was a sociopath though, because he could feel emotions, just not love. We see a lot of instances where he's angry and gleeful, so even if you're going by canon, there's no reason he can't feel empathy and respect. Those are not the same emotions as love, even if they are often associated with them. So I do enjoy fics where he can feel those “softer” emotions, even if he is incapable of saying “I love you” to anyone.

** I'm not someone with a specific preference for fics focusing on Tom, but I did read a few fics that did centre around him, and I will point out two things:

- One, reading about flawed characters is interesting if done right, and Tom very much is a flawed character.
- Two, Tom can change, it's just that writing about such a thing happening obviously requires skill.

Pairings don't matter to me; heck, I'm not reading for pairings in the first place. But reading about a flawed character stumbling through life and maybe or maybe not finding some kind of good place for themselves, sure, I'd like that. And /some/ authors manage that much.

If still in doubt, I point you towards “Last Chance” by Laume (linkffn(4457149)). It is a story about Tom Riddle, yes, but not about Lord Voldemort, just about a broken boy who is trying, sometimes failing and sometimes succeeding, to be and to grow up and to have a place for himself.

Even if Merope had loved him it would only be a possible chance, like a coin has a possible chance of falling on heads, or a possibility of tails. One is not guaranteed, possible only opens up the chance of it happening at all.

  I've always assumed that the whole being born due to a love potion robs him of the ability of actually being in love?
#+end_quote

The 'being born due to a love potion' was only ever SYMBOLIC of his life being completely devoid of love, not an actual magical effect. This doesn't mean he's not a complete psychopath, but that would be due to his genetics and/or the way he was raised, not how he was conceived. I do agree he was mimicking any warmth or compassion he showed, rather than actually feeling it himself.

  Ravleen: How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

  J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.

  J.K. Rowling: The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.
