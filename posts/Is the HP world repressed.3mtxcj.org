*** Thank you - exactly my reaction (but then again: I know pretty well that I was sheltered at school at first (private catholic school -.-) and I remember the culture shock of switching schools for a public one (damned: while pretty tame compared to what the OP talks about I was shocked...particularly sex was something that was discussed more openly etc. (it accelerated my breakaway from religion - I had serious doubts before though, but I was repressed!))

Still, he's not wrong - Hogwarts is tame (with the exception of bullying, as it involves potentially deadly/disfiguring spells!) compared to some schools (particularly hotspot schools with loads where social problems, lack of parental guidance etc. are a problem!)

ps: I am speaking as a German (so I can't speak about teen pregnancy for example, as it's rare in Germany, as sex-ed is mandatory (even for private catholic schools!))

** *In-universe answer:* It's easy and trivially wrong to think of human culture as something that is moving monolithically in one direction, from "repressed" to "not repressed." In fact cultures move at different speeds and in different directions, and always have.

Wizarding Britain seems, in a lot of ways, to have skipped a number of major Muggle cultural shifts, which is actually pretty realistic: The catalysts for those cultural shifts either didn't happen or were much less dramatic in their world.

Some examples:

1. Muggle society was dramatically reshaped by the emergence of fast, affordable transportation (of people and ideas) between cities. Wizarding society has had floo powder, brooms, and portkeys for hundreds of years, and still more closely resembles the pre-automobile part of /The Magnificent Ambersons/, possibly because the need to maintain secrecy necessarily limits the melding of different cultures.

2. Likewise, Muggle society was dramatically reshaped by the move from the country to the city---from a small, diffuse, and provincial population to an incredibly dense, growing one that rubbed a variety of cultures up against each other.

Wizarding Britain remains, so far as we can tell, small and spread out. It's not clear they've ever "industrialized," and industrial capitalism was a major catalyst in the development of mass popular culture, which aims at a broad audience and by doing so erases regional differences. People we meet still seem to be primarily craftsmen, aristocrats, and bureaucrats, not wage-earners.

Just those two examples, if they'd never happened in our own culture, would cause /enormous/ changes to the way we live. It would be unrealistic for a culture that doesn't seem to have the population density, the abject poverty, or the mass culture that the industrialized west does to behave the same way we do. There's also the wars, which clearly didn't happen in the same way, the emergence of artistic modernism, Marxism, etc.---basically it's not clear that most of the 20th century happened to wizards like it happened to Muggles, and when we think of "our culture" we're mostly thinking of the after-effects of the 20th century.

*Out-of-universe answer:* Like FloreatCastellum said, it's a children's book, which is not to say that your proposed revision describes objective reality any better than it does.

** What books are you reading? Most all this stuff is in there. I'll address your points in order, Sir or Madame

1.  Kids shagging- some maintain that you can see this in one of the movies- on the Marauder's Map there are two sets of footprints pretty much on top of each other.\\
2.  Magical drugs- who needs 'em when you've got the cheering charm? You can make yourself feel good any time.
3.  Potion abuse- we do see polyjuice being abused multiple times, it's demonstrated how the luck potion could be misused for sporting events and elections, and love potions are your roofies only worse. We see multiple characters abused through the use of love potions.
4.  Serious House Rivalry- Harry and Malfoy have tried to kill each other multiple times- Malfoy sets a deadly snake on Harry, breaks his nose and petrifies him and leaves him for dead on the train, Harry cuts the hell out of Malfoy, Malfoy would've died if Snape hadn't been there to save him.
5.  Learning illegal dark arts-Isn't this every Slytherin student? Malfoy knows how to cast unforgivables, hell, even Harry tries it once.
6.  sexual abuse- again, love potions.\\
7.  Prefects abusing their powers- Inquisition Squad under Umbridge- also Ron just taking contraband from younger students and keeping it for himself.
8.  Pregnancy- well now, be serious. They're magic, they've got spells that actually work 100 percent of the time to prevent it, I highly doubt a witch ever gets pregnant unless she wants to.
9.  Quidditch Hooliganism- what would you call that riot at the World Cup, then? Also remember the fight on the field in fifth year that got Harry, Fred, and George banned from playing?
10. Bullying- there's bullying in every single book- seriously, what books were you even reading?
11. Wild, out-of-control parties- The ones in Gryffindor Tower don't count? For real though, the teachers live right there in school with them, how can things get too out of hand? It'd be like trying to have an out of control party while your parents are home.
12. run-ins with Aurors- the aurors are like, in London, and Hogwarts is in the middle of nowhere, Scotland. It takes eight hours to get there by train. So where are they gonna meet Aurors during the school year?
13. Going out of school for adventure- forget all the times Harry goes into the forbidden forest and nearly gets killed by giant spiders and Quirrelmort? How about sneaking out down the secret passageways to go to town or chasing criminals into haunted houses at night?\\
14. Gambling and prostitution- okay, I'll echo another poster here to say what kind of high school did you go to? Those sure weren't a thing at mine. (Fred and George do some sports Gambling at the Quidditch World Cup, though.)

I question whether most high schools in the UK have any serious hooliganism going on at their little football matches... isn't that something that's mostly taking place at the professional level?

** Keep in mind; the narrator of the story, Harry himself, is so repressed that it is laughable. From the way he observes almost everything in the book, he is completely naive. He grew up in a household where the goal was to be completely normal. He was not really exposed to any kind of normal experiences through the process though. He had no friends before Hogwarts, and seems to only hang out with Ron and Hermione after the troll incident.

The originals have a few nods to the underground sex trade (selling nails in Knockturn Alley). Bullying is common at Hogwarts (see Luna, Ron before troll incident, Harry anytime the school hates him). Wild parties (quidditch parties where butterbeer appears) do happen in Gryffindor at least. Hagrid gambles at the Hogs Head to win the dragon egg. Harry seems to have little interest in the activities however, so we don't see much besides short references.

As far as sex goes, Hogwarts likely has wards or laces the food with something to prevent pregnancy, or has wards to prevent sex from happening period. Only justification for that one is that no one got pregnant, and Harry is demonstrated to be an observant narrator who would likely note if people disappeared for 9 months (barring Sally-Ann). Another explanation is that whenever a witch does get pregnant, they get put in a time chamber that turns a day into 9 months, birth the baby, and then are obliviated and the child is placed in the muggle world (read a fic where this happened once, was actually pretty interesting).

Illegal dark arts learning students wouldn't be seen by Harry. Someone taught Crabbe fiendfire, and it sure wasn't Draco. Plus, it's illegal, it would make sense that they wouldn't be seen.

While there are a lots of opportunities for money that aren't really explored in canon, that doesn't mean they don't happen. We get such a small snippet of the world that really, anything is possible.

*** How about this on the topic of pregnancy: magic can do stuff, so if they don't want to get pregnant they might simply not happen to get pregnant. Sorry but the whole “everyone cares about preventing underage pregnancies regardless of the fact that their whole world is stuck a few hundreds of years in the past” bit is a bit ... annoying, really; their level of sexual education is probably medieval, and in medieval times there were some really stupid preconceptions about sex and pregnancy (Prevention? What even is that?).

***** On the other hand, they do have fairly old-timey views on many things. So who is to say they don't have views on procreation that are also outdated by a few centuries?

And believe me, those few hundreds of years ago, people believed really weird crud about it. For example, there was the thing about how conception cannot happen if the woman did not orgasm, and that was thought to be impossible to happen if the woman did not want it; in other words, can't get pregnant from rape. And /that/ is the cornerstone of many things, because if pregnancies can't happen without the women wanting it, why should the men be concerned with prevention rather than push that on the women and then simply cast out any women who happened to be “sluts” and be done with it? And once you get onto that and take the part about “sluts” and the reputation it gives to any women who sleep around into consideration, you'll get pressure on women and no pressure on men, because it's not the problem men would have a reason to be concerned with since the one on whom it depends is, as far as they see it, always the woman.

Maybe there are things like contraception charms or potions, sure. But point is, the whole thing is very likely to be seen as the business of women, and just women, not men. So things like all the men caring about preventing contraception and everyone being on it and time chambers and releasing kids into the muggle world after obliviating the woman ... yeah, not going to happen.

******* This and that are two different things. I do agree that some things /might/ be different, but my point is that some people go too far into the direction of men actually caring about it when they think about it.

Because all in all, even if the men would care /some/, it's still something that would be seen as women's business, and as matters of sexuality went relatively unexplored for a long time, especially amongst the upper-class citizens (so people like Malfoy, basically), equality in terms of strength does not necessarily equal equality in terms of duties related to procreation.

I mean, if someone wrote a fan-fiction in which it was described as actually being the case (the equality) and the author managed to justify it well, I'd be cool with it. But by default, with nothing of that sort in canon (since the topic isn't explored at all), I am not going to make the assumption that this is the case because it could go both ways and the trends as far as wizarding culture as we saw it is concerned make it a tad likelier to go the other way.

In the same vein, when it's some woman's problem, it's likely just her problem, not every other woman's around her. Because unless their knowledge about sexuality is much higher than we should expect it to be, there's still the whole negative reputation and the social pressure and the “slut” thing.

And the same applies to the bit about Pomfrey in your story; for all we know with the information we have from canon, it might very well not actually be the case. But give me a story in which it is and is justified properly, and I'll have no issues with it. I'm just not going to make assumptions about it based on our world /right now/ where theirs is more similar to that which our was a long time in the past.

Or they have an abortion - which I assume might be illegal in the Wizarding world considering how outdated some of its values are (and considering abortion is illegal in a lot of countries and states still). (I'm from Australia, for context, in a state where it is illegal yet there are at least 4 medically sound abortion clinics).

**** Re: lacing food.

I'm sure some wizarding feminists (McGonagall? Hermione?) would be pretty pissed someone was messing with their fertility without their consent. And for eleven year olds? That would totally mess with their hormones. Plus what stops fertility for women and men is different.

It does seem super unlawful and unethical to do that - too far fetched, even for how meddling old Dumbledore could be.

**** Of course. Polyjuice potion. It uses any body substance such as hair, nails, and potentially dead skin strips (not canon, but in a decent inference based upon the other potentials). Selling nails makes no sense in the context of the Harry Potter universe as described in canon, unless it is a connection to polyjuice. Now if you can buy nails in a shady alley, with the intention of transforming yourself or someone else into a different person, it would make sense that they would make the next jump to polyjuicing sex workers into popular celebrities, or the most beautiful women and men they can find. While polyjuice is deemed a difficult potion in canon, it seems like any competent newt student should be capable of brewing it, making it available to anyone with a good education in potions, as well as those with the money to buy it. So supply for the underground shouldn't be a problem, if the trade is even underground. The potion itself is legal, it is just a question of what uses of it are illegal.

Polyjuicing sex workers has a lot of other shady implications as well. Pedophiles can polyjuice adults to look like children. The moral and ethical debates that can be had on that alone are intriguing. But the wizarding world has displayed apathy towards mental illness and children's mental health in general. They are unlikely to care about the moral questions that surround such a behavior, unless it is a muggleborn doing it, in which case it is obviously an issue that proves once again that purebloods are superior. The wizarding world with the tools presented is an intelligent criminal's perfect world, especially if the criminal is a pureblood. Brothels would be just the start. But at the same time, the only organized criminal groups mentioned in canon revolve around attempting to overthrow governments. Based on Harry's perspective, it is unlikely that there is a true organized criminal faction, regardless of the obvious money making potential such an organization has.

(As a thought experiment, suppose that Hermione just left the two of them alone --- no trying to get them to behave, and no helping in or out of class, just keeping to herself and/or bothering other people.

****** Someone tries to help you out. You respond by putting them down, calling them insufferable, and just being generally rude to them. The implication I got in the book is that the incident in Charms is not the first such incident, just that it was the important one. Harry had the impression of Hermione before that, and Ron most likely would have been responding to her attempts to help by being rude and mean. Just because someone tries to help and is socially incapable of doing so in a manner that is sensitive to more complex issues than most 11 year olds pick up on (Ron's inferiority complex), doesn't make it ok to be rude and mean to her (bully). Was it a systematic destruction of her in an intentional manner? No. But bullying doesn't have to be planned for it to happen.

To be fair, Hermione didn't think she was being a good friend imo. She was a know it all, rule abider. She never learned that there is value in holding back knowledge. She was scandalized at the idea of breaking rules. She was not nice. She was not socialized at all (no friends growing up makes one quite awkward). This makes her an easy target for bullying, as her attitude doesn't endear her to anyone that age. No one likes to see someone do something better than them, and the natural inclination for most children is to put them down in order to build yourself up. Hence Ron's comments, said to Harry, that led to her crying all day. She's alone in a castle where all her peers dislike her with no support from family. Ron has only one string of comments in the book, but I have no doubt that wasn't the first time he had made similar comments. Due to plot requirements, that time was the only important time.

Perhaps the prefects and teachers do reach out to kids and try to help them, but avoid Harry due to not wanting to seem to be giving him special treatment, therefore it is not mentioned as the story is from his point of view. Most likely though, the wizarding world is apathetic when it comes to mental health. They seem to have no form of counseling; any time a wizard is touched in the head they are just seen as eccentric. There seems to be a lot of wizards that have mental issues, from Moody's PTSD, to Dumbledore's senile moments (any headmaster that opened a school year by saying nitwit, blubber, oddment, tweak would at least be questioned by someone about it). The Lovegoods are another example of this (Luna's obvious trauma from her mother's death). Ginny being possessed by the diary for a year then just patted on the head and sent home.

And remember that during the three-headed dog incident (which was pre-troll), Hermione was pretty clear about how she felt about the boys:

#+begin_quote
  "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so ---"

  But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.

  "Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly.

  "That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we're going to be late."

  They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.

  "I'm coming with you," she said.

  "You are not."

  "D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up."

  "You've got some nerve ---" said Ron loudly.

  Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see what it was standing on?"

  "The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads."

  "No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something."

  She stood up, glaring at them.

  "I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."

We might have to agree to disagree on the bullying thing. I think intent matters.

******* [[/u/OwlPostAgain]] pretty much said what I think, but I want to add that I think that you're giving Ron too much credit as a master manipulator and Ron and Harry too little credit as human beings. Just look at the scene in question:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Oh, well done!' cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ‘Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!'

  Ron was in a very bad temper by the end of the class.

  ‘It's no wonder no one can stand her,' he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor. ‘She's a nightmare, honestly.'

  Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.

  ‘I think she heard you.'

  ‘So?' said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. ‘She must've noticed she's got no friends.'
#+end_quote

What I am seeing is Ron venting his frustrations to Harry, not intending for anyone, least of it Hermione, to overhear. Hermione overhears, and is doubly affected by his words /because Ron isn't trying to bully her/, but is rather just honestly antagonized by her when she was just trying to help. Ron regrets it when he realizes that he's hurt her, but his pride doesn't let him walk it back.

It's also why I don't think he'd insulted Hermione before.

I think that she was, at least after the Duel night. Also, when you look at her actual speech patterns (and later behavior), it's not the rules she's afraid of; it's the consequences. For her, getting expelled means losing the only source of magical knowledge available to her --- and that could well be something she views as a fate worse than death.

***** Well, as long as she does it responsibly - meaning using BC (the pill, condoms, contraceptive spell/potion or whatever) - I would not care (but then again: I am a European and our attitude to sex is different than the one in the US (much less "repressed" to quote the OP))...not that I would necessarily want that (but I'd not chase her and forbid it or anything (would make it much more likely she'd do it - the alure of the forbidden and all that!)...damned I hate spying parents, it breaks trust IMHO and should not happen!)

ps: That is if I wanted children at all - which, frankly, I don't!

****** Having sex at eleven years old is rape - there's a reason age of consent exists! But you're right - at age 13, 14, 15 sex between minors does happen, and so little witches and wizards need to know what consent is and what sex is. Ahhhh hypotheticals.

Yes, for protecting young people from being taken advantage of by older people.

******** Age of consent determines at what age you are judged to be to young to give meaningful consent. You don't suddenly gain the ability to give consent if the person you are having sex with also cannot give consent. They don't cancel each other out.

******* No there isn't - it's just a modern concept invented by society -.- (in days past marriage at that age wasn't uncommon particularly among the highter echelons of society!)

I am not saying that I am in full support, I am saying I wouldn't fight it (I am not a prude and as long as "The Talk" has been given and protection is used I am ok with it!) - you really can't (unless you lock children up in solitary -.-), so why bother? (As a non parent I thought being supportive was better than being a nag, a critic and a controller who snoops about in children's lives (sorry, but even children have a right to privacy IMHO!))

Do you want to become a grandparent way too early? 'Cause that's how it happens.

****** Yeah, we got sex-ed with a focus on contraception at 13 in high school, and although teen pregnancies are rare here, it wasn't early enough for one classmate of mine who gave birth at 14 and didn't know for sure who the father was (they tested two boys). Last I heard they raised the child as her little brother. I can't imagine how difficult that must be for her now and I wonder if he'll ever know.

** It's behind the time, not “repressed”. And many of the things you mentioned are seen in the books; you just didn't pay attention, presumably because you did not think of the fact that many things are not the same in a society that is many times less populous and much less technologically advanced than ours, not to mention isolated from ours.
