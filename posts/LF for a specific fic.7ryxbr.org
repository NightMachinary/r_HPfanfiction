There was a fic in which Harry is tortured at the graveyard..he runs away but the dark lord is able to sense where he is through the scar. Harry is then surrounded by all the death eaters, loses his eye and is then stabbed with his own wand by Lucius Malfoy upon which he bursts into fire killing the death eaters surrounding him, voldemort apparating at the last second

Edit: some more details

Harry is completely burnt but manages to survive and reaches hermione's home upon which he doesn't recognize her at first and almost strangles her.

He recovers at a muggle hospital. After removing the bandage on his lost eye he is able to see magic on a different level.


** Sounds like the end of linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path), except it's Macnair taking an eye with a knife. If it's a different story, I'd be intrigued to find out which.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

*** Nope. It's a different fic. The events i mention take place in the first chapter itself. He's not female. Some more details which I'll add in the og post too: Harry is completely burnt but manages to survive and reaches hermione's home. He recovers at a muggle hospital. After removing the bandage on his lost eye he is able to see magic on a different level.

*** Yes, this is the one I was searching for! Thanks a lot! The Story name is After the Second Rise btw. I don't know how to use the ff bot. If anyone could instruct me how to do so, I'd be grateful.
