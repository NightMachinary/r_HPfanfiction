I don't know if this is allowed on here or not so if it isn't sorry about that.

Would anyone be able/willing to beta read some of my writing for me? It's only 3,637 words and I'm struggling to judge it objectively seeing as I'm the one who wrote it.

Here's a summary:

When Harry Potter is three the Dursleys decide they can't keep him any longer. Vernon knows he can't just get rid of the freak, if he does the others will come and get him, so he comes up with a fool-proof plan: use a little magic to something stronger than them. Unfortunately he didn't plan on summoning this demon. xover with Gravity Falls Transcendence AU. May stay as a one shot.

No ships, rated T. No knowledge of Gravity Falls required.

Thank you for your time.

** You should share more if you want people jumping in. Like ships and short summary and if it is one shot or a chap of something bigger. Oh and rating. That at least

** Ffn (while an older website) as a beta-reader finder function. I'm sure some people are still active on there.

*** Do you know how that system works? There are twelve thousand betas for English Harry Potter fics, which is a kinda daunting amount.

** My knowledge of gravity falls is a bit rusty but the fic, despite being a bit cliché was pretty good. Also for the next time, there is a flair called "self-promotion" for promoting our own works.

*** Thanks. Yeah I know there's a self promotion thing but I wasn't really trying to do that.

Could you give me an example of what about it you thought was cliché?

**** The cliché bit was where some very evil guy has a soft spot for harry/kids and despises the durselys for their treatment. Though I actually happen to love those, it's still a cliché in many 'harry raised by a dark character' fics

***** Ah yeah, I forgot those were a cliché in HP fanfics. Thanks for reminding me. :)

To be fair, this isn't just pulled from nowhere and is actually completely in character for him.
