He should have told Lucius Malfoy to give the diary to a naive pureblood bloodtraitor girl *that isn't a ginger*


** From the inside of his diary, Tom Riddle smiled. After weeks of efforts, spent listening to the stupid babbling of an insecure child, and pretending to care to her mundane problems such as the color of her robe, the little blood traitor had finally poured enough of herself in the diary to open a link. With one last push, he would control her soul, and the great work of Salazar Slytherin would begin once again, the school cleaned of its mudbloods.

Tom took a moment to gather himself, jumped through the link . . . and found nothing. He was standing alone, a sea of void surrounding him with nothing in sight.

“You should not be there” said a flat voice in his back. Tom turned around, his was already in his hand, how could someone expect to sneak on him, he would teach them how stupid it was.

In front of him was a little girl, her face hidden by her flamboyant hairs. “Ginny?” he asked, adopting the mask of a friend and confident “What is this place? Where a we?”

“You should not be there” said the girl once again, her tone not betraying any emotion “Nobody should be there”.

Tom raised his wand; this unexpressive girl was too different from the image of an excited little girl he had built after weeks of writing. “Who are you?” he asked, “And what have you done with the girl”.

“It is me Tom, you friend”. The girl moved her head, and behind the hairs, Tom could discern 2 brown eyes, so empty of light they might as well be beads. The girl smiled, her mouth unnaturally large, “I am glad you came there Tom, I was so lonely”. She took a step toward him and Tom remembered a rumour he had heard while at the orphanage, he rumour that seemed so stupid he never paid it any mind.

He screamed.

​

Harry entered the common room when he saw Ron's little sister, Ginny, waving her wand at a black diary.

“What are you doing” he asked her, coming closer.

She looked at him, her eyes widening from recognition, and seemed ready to run away but stopped herself the last moment. “Oh; hello . . . Harry!” she said blushing. “I'm trying to repair my diary.”

“Is it broken?” Harry didn't know a diary could be broken, but he guessed that there was a lot of things he didn't know with magic.

“I don't know.” Said Ginny, “It used to answer to me when I wrote but . . . not anymore”.

“Can I try” asked Harry, he had seen a lot of books since he came to Hogwarts, but none of them had ever answered to him.

Ginny opened and close her mouth successively, she seemed to waver between letting a boy look at her diary and saying no to Harry Potter. Finally, she made up her mind and took a step back “Go ahead” she said, her face as red as her hair.

Harry took the diary, opened it at an empty page, taking care to not read Ginny' secrets. “/Hello/” he wrote, “/I am Harry Potter/”.

The words stayed still.

In modern times, no one /actually/ believes that people with red hair /don't have souls/. So when we're making a reference to it, you can safely assume we're referring to the meme.

Maybe the souls thing isn't true, but there's definitely still casual discrimination involved in the UK. It's extra jarring for me as an American because it's not something you would ever come across in the US.

******* That's kind of a crack theory iirc, the idea that it was based in prejudice against conquered Celts. People are weird about redheads all over the world; there's the typical sexualization and stereotyping, of course, but red hair was also considered a sign of being Jewish (and thus a target of discrimination) in a surprising number of places. I tend to think it's mostly because it's a rare color and it sticks out in a crowd, but who knows.

Don't know why people seem to doubt there is prejudice in this thread, it's very widely attested. Anyone looking to learn more can just look at the wikipedia page for red hair.

***** By that logic, how many souls have I stolen? I'm only half ginger (my hair goes reddish in summer when it gets sun-bleached, although I colour it now) so can even I steal souls? Does that mean dad hasn't stolen any since he's ginger, but has no freckles? I can answer the souls question, though, having gone to school with a total of ~9 gingers (that I can recall) and given my dad is one. The answer is, no. They don't have souls.
