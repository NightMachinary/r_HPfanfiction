I really want to find fics where someone helps Harry deal with trauma from the Dursley's, especially ones with Sirius. Not over the top with abuse (canon is bad enough) and not a super overpowered Harry. No bashing, unless written reasonably (nothing against it it's just not for me). Preferably no romance, but it's okay if there is.

(:


** Harry is adopted by the Grangers in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus). The abuse is worse than in canon - Vernon hits him with a belt once - but it's not cartoonish evil like some fics get.

I haven't read this but I see linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) recommended a lot. Sirius takes Harry from the Dursleys and raises him.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.
