Hey, I was wondering if there is a fic where Harry doesn't want to fight Voldemort or doesn't want to believe in the prophecy at all. A fic where he does not let Dumbledore guide him to fight or a story where he does not want to join the Order of the Phoenix.

If you know a fic where one or more of these points show up I would be glad if you could post them.


** Ths is like the 'Harry running away' theme:

*Escape*, linkffn(11916243): AU year 6, Voldemort forced Wizengamot to pass a marriage law with the goal to screw over Hermione and Harry, and AD sold Hermione out.

*Finding a Place to Call Home*, linkffn(9885609): one of the few, good Harry/Astoria fics, featuring them running away before Task 1 of TWT.

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463): Harry fought Voldemort for a while, but after being stabbed in the back one time too many, [[/spoiler][he made a deal with Voldemort and left Britain.]]

*Nobody's Hero*, linkffn(7806752): very fluffy Harry/Ginny runaway fic. First chapter required a little SOD, but otherwise quite nice.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): Harry and his girls definitely said go **** yourself, AD!

*What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix*, linkffn(5265558): Harry didn't wait for the hearing, but fled immediately after being warned by the Ministry.

** Try linkffn(For Love Of Magic). It doesn't really give much screen time to Voldemort at all but Harry is generally more interested in his own well-being than anything else.

Harry recognizes his special position in the Wizarding World fairly quickly and abuses the hell out of it. He pretty much does whatever he wants, he is a bit of a dick but still a relatable character.

All he really wants is experiment with magic and screw around, so that's what he does. He doesn't take shit from anyone and the fic plays around with some of the more common tropes to make it a little more interesting.

In the later chapters it's become a bit of a smut fest, just in case you don't like that, but it's still one of my favorite on-going fics at the moment.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Linkffn(desperate measures by vvc)

Harry believes Dumbledore is misinterpreting the prophecy and it's not about him, no matter how desperately Dumbledore wants to believe it is. (Dumbledore is definitely wrong here.) Not everyone's cup of tea (slash, Drarry, veela), but definitely fulfills the request.

Other interesting elements: an awesome Pansy, Hermione almost kills the friendship but redeems herself, interesting backstory for the Weasley/Malfoy feud that makes you switch to the Malfoy side.
