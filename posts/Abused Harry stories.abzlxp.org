So I recently read a few fic where snape 'Saved Harry from the dursleys or found out he was abused later and helped him through it. I'm curious if they're are any similar stories but with other characters like tonks or her family or Amelia bones instead of snape?

Or stories with Bellatrix as godmother instead of/or along with sirius?

(If I should make a separate post for that I'll edit this)


** In Mentordora Tonks by jlluh linkffn(12827481) Tonks treats Harry like her little brother and has a massive impact on his integration in the WW. This leads to him gaining a family and causes untold trouble for Dumbledore. It's really sweet.

â€‹

Another fic is A Heart So True by Andante825 linkao3(14456334) where Harry gets a pokemon familiar, the Dursleys can't handle it, and he's adopted by the Tonks family. It's lovely.

  Seeing as he's her closest living relative who isn't her mother, a Malfoy, or a prisoner of Azkaban, seventh-year student Nymphadora Tonks takes first-year student Harry Potter under her wing. Possible Harry/Tonks when Harry's older?

** Linkffn(the philosopher's stone retransmuted) This a very good, seven book long series. It starts with a young Tonks finding Harry. It follows canon up until the 5th book, but the 6th and 7th books have no relation to canon.

Got you covered. In "No Longer Alone" Harry gets adopted into the Tonks family after a slightly AU third year (story begins on the last day of that term). Mostly centered around family and friendship, it shows how Harry grows into a family without any "Just call me Mum" the minute he steps in someone's house.

The abuse itself is kept at canon levels since that would be more than enough to inflict lasting psychological damage. At the same time, I tried to capture the canon characterisation of Harry as someone who doesn't become a walking mess but adapts. One or two breakdowns for sure (chapters 3-4 and 13), but overall he is still "functioning".

Most of the bonding/healing happens in chapters 3-6, 8 and 13 while chapters 9-12, 14, and 15 focus more on the friendships.
