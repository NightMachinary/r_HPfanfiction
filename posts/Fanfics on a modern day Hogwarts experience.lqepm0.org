Looking for a fanfic on modern day hogwarts (new generation of students) with new characters. I'd love to see some original creations (inventions etc.), and I'd love to see how people explore parts of the wizarding world that aren't really touched upon in the books.


** I mean, I was writing something EXACTLY like this about an oc, but I haven't updated since, like, last June or something. It's "Heir of Slytherpuff" on Wattpad if you wanna go read the prologue and the first two and a half chapters, I think its written well, but noooowhere near finished. Maybe you can encourage me to write some more if you like the premise or something.

** I'm writing just this. But I'm nowhere near the end. I don't have much time working on it right now, but if you would be interested in beta reading I really could use one I guess. Hit me up if you want more details.

** There's arguably a fair bit of that in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). Investigating why (some) electronics don't work at Hogwarts. Introducing popular muggle culture (especially novels). Starting a magical space program.

Annals of Arithmancy also has elements of that, but is really just the capstone to a trilogy; you need to have read the previous (very long) books to really get it.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
