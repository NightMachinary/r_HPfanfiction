I must have read this at least ten years ago, but does anyone else remember a fic that had a child molester/serial killer at the orphanage? I think the killer was a teacher, but he may have been some type of volunteer or someone else connected with the orphanage, he was in a position of authority over the kids anyway, and there were rumors among them to avoid being alone with this guy.

He would keep boys after class and do...whatever (fic wasn't explicit) and then then later they would disappear? Due to his magic, Tom Riddle wasn't victimized even though I think the killer either said something to him or had him alone in a classroom at one point. But a boy who was Tom's only friend, or the closest thing he had to a friend anyway, was, and disappeared.

I think the kids were officially told their peers either ran away or got sick and died, or maybe were adopted? There was some kind of cover-up story anyway, for the disappearances, but Tom knew it wasn't true and later it came out that they had been buried secretly somewhere- a lot of bodies were found.

I also know that when Tom grew up, he either did kill this person or else he regretted not being able to kill them because reasons- either he died already or was in muggle jail, or Tom couldn't find him again. Either way there was something about adult Tom and killing the guy.

I'm not even sure if this was a whole fic by itself or just a flashback chapter or two in a larger fic, but if you know of it I'd appreciate a link.

Edit: More stuff I remembered: I think the author had notes that this was based on real life abuse at orphanages of that time period.
