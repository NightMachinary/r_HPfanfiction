Some guy self inserts as a Dumbledore from a Dumbledore bashing fic.

This isn't before he's done anything bad. This is after harry has been sorted into Gryffindorn't, he already knows Dumbledore is being bad, and the SI has to scramble to try to fix his mistakes on top of his responsibilities


** There was one where a Good Dumbledore that died had to fix his counterpart's complete cock up by stepping into his shoes.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
