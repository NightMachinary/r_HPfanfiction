I enjoy being a part of Harry Potter discord servers. Specifically ship discords. While some of the servers treat their respective ships religiously and shun other ships with scorn, I like seeing the non canon discussions. I don't bash non canon ships and I like to read fanfics that explore non canon territory.

I know of three ship discords: Haphne, HHR, Harry/Luna

But I want to know if there are others: Viktor/Hermione, Hermione/Charlie, Harry/OC

If there aren't any for these ships, I'm open to making them to compile good fanfics I come across. But I really want to expand and find more selection for fanfics.


** I don't know of any, but if you create them post links - I'd love to compare/compile fics with others.
