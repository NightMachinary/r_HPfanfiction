** “My brother's said you have to pass a GCSE level exam to get sorted, and if you fail you get sent back home...” Ron said as his voice trembled with obvious fear in his voice.

Harry thought back to his years in school, he was never a terrible student, but having to worry about Dudley and his gang's premeditated attacks had taken a toll on him over the years. Horrified, he imagined being told he had to go back to the Dursley's for not being intelligent enough.

Soon enough, the ageing and stern looking woman came back and Harry's stomach felt like it was doing backflips.

“All first years come with me, it's time for your sorting.”

As Harry looked around, he could see Ron wasn't taking any of this well either as his face screwed up in distress. He also noticed the bushy haired girl from the train looking at the floor while muttering something that sounded like, “The four forces of aerodynamics, lift, thrust, drag and weight...” and another boy he hadn't met before cowering behind her, his skin as pale as marble, he looked like he was about to throw up...

Nervously, the students all began following the woman, and a few minutes later they arrived inside a large room full of computers, Harry noticed Ron shot him a bewildered look,

“What's she going to make us do, see who can get the highest score on minesweeper or something?”

Harry and Ron went over to sit down next to each other as the sickly looking boy from earlier came next to him,

“Hey, I'm Neville Longbottom, what do you think we're in here for?”

“No idea mate, can't be too bad though, I've been using my older brother Percy's computer all summer, it's the only one we have in the house you see.”

Harry remained silent thinking about what they were about to do, maybe an online exam? The only times he had access to a computer was when the Dursley's went out, and even then he didn't know how to use it properly.

“Thank you, thank you.” A welcoming voice came from the front of the room and as Harry swiftly turned his head to see who it was, he realised it was the elder from the card set he opened on the train, Albus Dumbledore.

“Now, before you can carry on and meet the rest of your fellow pupils, we need to do a quick test!”

Instantly, Harry's fears sunk in, he had already admitted to himself that it was over, and he could see others around him did too.

“Please turn your monitors on and you should have the test waiting for you, just answer the questions honestly and we'll be able to put you in your houses!”

The noise of simultaneous button pressing filled the room as everyone turned their monitor on, dreading the questions they'd have, although Harry noticed the one girl he saw muttering to herself earlier seemed like she knew this was coming.

“You see, I read “Hogwarts: A History” this summer, it's mandatory that every student has to complete a Buzzfeed test to find out what house they're in, but I'm not too sure what type of questions they're going to ask, so I've been studying every subject I could since then!”

As Harry started to turn around to face his monitor, he heard Ron speak in a baffled tone, “My favourite pizza toppings? Is this a joke or something?” Surely enough, the first question to the test was, “Out of these six options, what are your favourite pizza toppings?”

“Gotta say mate, I do love a good chicken pizza” Ron said, Harry was sure he saw him licking his lips afterwards.
