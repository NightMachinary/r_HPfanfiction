yeah here's chapter one. this is what i got so far. xD feedback please, people who are a thousand times better at writing and stuff then i am? with your thousands of followers and millions of views and hundreds of reviews.

it's a "person gets transported from out world into harry potter world" story but i got a awesome twist going on! xD it's a /group/ of people! they gotta be a team in it. or not. depends. never seen it done before sooooo i wanted to try it out. kind of got the idea after i was rewatching that LOST show again a few days ago. bunch of people in a crazy place together, gotta work together to navigate it and all. except it's harry potter and not a killer island.

** Just skimmed through your fic and the most obvious turn off to me was that you didn't use capitalize the first word, names, etc nor did you format your fic properly. I believe that bad english and badly formatted fics are the biggest turn off to any reader. So it will be for the best if you rectify that.

Those lines at the end of the fic felt as if you didn't put any effort. It felt as if you were trying to convert a movie into a book without changing anything. You should try to put an average 'x' lines in a paragraph.

Can't comment for the actual content cuz I have little experience in writing fics.

Edit:- It's much better now.

** Formatting please. Just a skim tells me that.

Even if a fic is about something I really like reading about, if I open it to find ton of typos and bad grammar, I have to stop.

Just go for reviews, so you can iron out all the kinks. Maybe get a beta.

** I do think this is a very interesting idea. But yes it is just plain text and you do not have capitals or anything in it. Not even for the character names at least. :( Please fix this most of all and people will read it; but also try to not have so many single lines - make them into paragraph blocks of four to six sentences. :) Yes, that will make it so much better.
