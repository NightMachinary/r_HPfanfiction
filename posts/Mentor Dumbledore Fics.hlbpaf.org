Please link any and all good fanfics with Dumbledore in a mentor role to Harry or any character really. (Dumbledore mentoring Voldemort would be utterly fascinating)


** Albus and Harry's World Trip linkffn(13388022) Dumbledore Quits after Harry is expelled second year and becomes his private tutor

A Court of Flowers: Harry and Fleur story from Harry's first person point of view, It talks about dealing with your fame and getting past expectations that others have of you. I love the character moments between Harry and Fleur I also like the moments between Dumbledore and Harry, this Dumbledore doesn't just sit there and let Harry go into the tournement unprepared, he gives him his personal Journal that has every single spell he and Grindewald ever thought up including the cool blue fire dragon thing from fantastic beasts, they sit down for tea every so often and talk about the journal that Wulfric or Percival gave Harry, great interactions all around linkffn(13298565)

Magicks of the Arcane: linkffn(8303194) Has Dumbledore taking a more active role in Harry's education

Uncle Quentin's Spy: linkffn(11102515) a buffy crossover with a very helpful Dumbledore.

Neglentia linkffn(10639968) Has Harry think back on his relationship with Dumbledore.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent linkffn(13133746) Has a helpful Dumbledore as well.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  I could speak for hours about my rotten luck, about how many times I've been close to death. But luck is relative and some would say I am, in fact, extremely lucky. I would have disrespectfully disagreed. That was before I met fair Miss Delacour though; well even for a bit after I met her if I am honest. Follow me trough a year of adventure and discovery, in more than one way.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.
