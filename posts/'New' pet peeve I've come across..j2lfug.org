** That's...interesting.

The one motivation I can see for making this complaint that /isn't/ just disliking femslash is to do with how sometimes people don't think a girl doing something romantic/sexual with another girl while in a straight relationship is cheating. It's the shitty idea that girls kissing other girls doesn't "count." I don't think people have the same idea about guys kissing other guys, which is why there wouldn't be any similar complaints about slash pairings.

I doubt I'd ever look at a story and assume the author was being homophobic in such a roundabout way, though? It seems like an odd assumption to make about their motivations. Maybe if there was something about the way the relationship was talked about, if it was dismissed/invalidated in the text or something...

It's also possible that the people making the complaints hold that shitty idea themselves: that WLW relationships aren't really serious, so pairing the love interest with another girl is a copout for actually dealing with having a different ship.

Maybe. Idk. I'm trying really hard to understand it, and I just...don't.

** I haven't read any like these, mainly because I am extremely picky with pairings, but it sounds super annoying.

** There'll always be dumb reviews. Now, do I think that author putting the ones who can't be with Harry is a sign of poor writing? Yeah, but the reviews calling it insecurity are just dumb.
