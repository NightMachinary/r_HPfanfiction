So far, some of the only fics I've read with Harry utilizing his Parseltongue skill end in angsty and cliche dark Harry. Any good ones out there that don't fall into the pit that is Dark Lord Harry? Thanks!


** The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady. Harry not only is publicly known as a parselmouth but occasionally tries to promote it as a harmless and/or benevolent talent to the masses. It's essentially canon compliant with the exception that Harry acts more like an actual abused child would.

Also, the author writes back to you if you review, which is super cool if you have questions or want to talk about something in the story. Really I think that over the course of writing this series BrilliantLady has developed into one of the best authors in the community.

Here's the first installment linkffn(11591125). Obviously parseltongue isn't really much of a thing before year two in Perfectly Normal part 3: Parseltongue is Really Very Ordinary.

*** I have mixed feelings about the Perfectly Normal series. It has some interesting world building, I read through it and was following it for a bit, but I unfollowed because I found that it just wasn't grabbing me. I'd see that there was an update, and not feel excited to check it out. I think it needs more opposition and struggle.

**** That's fair, it isn't really a story about fighting, so if that's what you're looking for definitely look elsewhere.

I think the primary struggles in the story are all internal, and pretty much all related to Harry trying and usually failing to overcome the problems his upbringing have left him with. You know how people talk about the three kinds of conflict in literature, man against nature, man against man, and man against himself? This is the third one almost entirely.

It's a fun story with a lot of really great canon-compliant world building that leads to some seriously incredible emotional moments.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

*** This story can be summarized as :”The Dursley family and the teachers are all garbage human beings with no redeeming features.”

Each chapter was just a new flavor of abusive Petunia, Vernon, Dudley, and [insert teacher here].

After the fourth chapter all you have to do is read the first sentence of every other paragraph and remember that everyone but Harry is horrible and you'll be fine.

**** Obviously I completely disagree with everything you wrote.

I don't believe that anyone in this story is worse than they are in canon, /except/ for Harry, who is a weak-willed, manipulative liar that cringes away from conflict and caves to pressure from practically anyone. On top of that he's quite possibly the worst judge of character in all of fiction. How you got, "everyone but Harry is horrible," from this story would be a mystery if you hadn't said that you only read the first sentence of every second paragraph. I guess that explains it.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents) involves Harry putting his Parceltongue abilities to use. It's a smut/parody fic but it's well written, I found it hilarious, and the sex scenes actually have an impact on the story. It's also a H/Hr fic with pretty minimal bashing (Ginny gets hit the hardest, and I think Ron does as well to a lesser extent, but again it moves the plot along and the group more or less makes up. The only reason I'd even call it bashing is because some of it is OOC).

** I may be a bit bias since it is my own work. But I can also promise you that it will not contain dark lord Harry. It is the first story of the series and covers his first year at Hogwarts. It's nearly complete and will be finished in the next number of weeks. Uploads at least once a week, and though Parstltongue isn't the MAIN focus, it is definitely part of the story. Here's the link, hope you enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13057557/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Serpent-Chronicles-Book-1-The-Prince-of-Slytherin]]
