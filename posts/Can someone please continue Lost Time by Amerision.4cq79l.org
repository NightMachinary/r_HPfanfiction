*** Oh, please, it's fan fiction. There are certainly no legal problems with it, and if the author hasn't updated in like, 2 or 3 years, chances are they abandoned it. Why should the story go unfinished?

***** It's not like anyone's making money out of it. Someone likes a story that will never have an end, imagines an end for it, and shares it with the rest of the fanbase. Surely as a fan on fanfiction, you will understand, since it's not that different. Imagine JK rowling had suddenly disapeared off the map without ever publishing the seventh book. Are you telling me there wouldn't have spawned a million of fan endings? Hell, there /were/ fan endings anyway while she was writing it. Where was the common decency there?

****** Money doesn't really have anything to do with it.

There are several disanalogies with the JKR situation.

1. As was already stated by M-Cheese, JKR gave explicit permission for people to write fanfic of her works.

2. JKR's work, as canon, has a special authoritative status that separates it out as "above" any fanfic. No matter how many fanfics are written, there can be no doubt that JKR's version is the "real" version. There is no such division between two fanfics, which means any continuation of an incomplete fanfic has the ability to supplant the original's authoritative status as the "real" version of that story.

3. JKR, while she spawned the fanfic community, is not a part of it. Within the community there are certain standards of behaviour upon which the continued functioning of the community rests. Not taking other people's ideas is one of the biggies. If it was accepted common practice then people would just stop writing - why bother, when someone else is just going to write a derivation of your work and get the credit for your hard work?

******* It's not a perfect analogy by any means, but there's no analogy to be had considering how.... "Unique" (that's another word for weird) the conventon of fanfiction is.

It's true, though. I can simply state that lack of permission isn't an eplicit prohibition either, but's that's a flaky argument at best.

I'm gonna be honest, I wouldn't be adverse to writing something that has been abandoned for half a decade. Either continuing fromw where it stopped or drawing heavy inspiration from it. I don' see that as rude- If the person cared, provided nothing had happened to them- it would have either finished it, or explicity stated it would not permit fanfanfiction.

#+end_quote

I mean, this is flaw on itself considering how many fics spawn from the same idea. And it's not even the case we're discussing- What I'm defending is somehting that has been, for one reason or another, clearly abandoned (Say, over three years without the author saying anything, or even the author him/herself stating that it wouldn't go back to it) and someone picking it up where it left, clearly stating who'd been the original author. There isn't really any toes to be stepped if this happens.
