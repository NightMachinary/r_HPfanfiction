** What do you mean "Harry doesn't instantly abandon them"? I don't know any fic where Harry abandons his parents. Most of the time he stays close to them but doesn't reveal his real identity immediately...

*** There's a fic I've read (I want to say Stages of Hope) where he doesn't have that great of a relation with his parents (especially his dad).

*** I guess that's what I mean. I'm always on the lookout for a good fic where Harry is happy with his parents but I don't think I've ever found that fic

*** I meant more that Harry didn't change his name and became their kid and kept the family dynamic together

I think this was a decent dimension travel story where Harry stays around his parents, but it's been years since I've read it. Give it a shot and let me know if it was what you were looking for.
