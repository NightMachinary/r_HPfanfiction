  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

While the follow list might include ones that you're keeping an eye on because you've started and don't want to leave them unfinished, or you think they have potential but aren't really sure how they'll turn out once they're done, or you start one and get interrupted before you can really make a judgement but bookmark it just in case you want to come back to it.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** Team 8 is a really good fic to read if you know Naruto or if you're interested in the anime. It's around the premise that Naruto is assigned to a different team.

In canon, he ends up on Team 7 where he's taught by Kakashi who is very hands-off and rarely teaches anything. Where in Team 8, he ends up with Kurenai who instills basic disciplines and much more proactive in his development.

It's a rarely good look into the ninja world. Pretty writing, good reflection of the characters and not a rehash of canon.
