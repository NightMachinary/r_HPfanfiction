Any fics where Harry joins Voldemort for whatever reason but the Light side wins the war anyway?

Great story if a bit dark. Haven't read it in years though.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
