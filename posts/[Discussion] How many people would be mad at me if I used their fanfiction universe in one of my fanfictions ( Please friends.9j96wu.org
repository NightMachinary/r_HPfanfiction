Yes I am just asking okay? If LOTS of people are going to be mad then probably I won't! :(

** Most fanfic authors would probably be pretty happy with a recursive fanfiction. Here's a reply I got:

"Uh.. Sure, but really why don't you just make your own world." Mind you it was a Minecraft fanfiction so the argument was pretty valid. He basically had to create his own world from scratch.

Anyway I think asking for permission is best no matter the hypocrisy.

*** What's recursive fanfiction? I do just want to use other fanfic universes for fanfiction CROSSOVERS, like people who do harry potter/star wars crossovers, with harry going into star wars's universe sandbox to interact with the characters and alter the plots.

**** "Recursive fanfiction is fanfiction of fanfiction. Although related to fanon, a recursive fic is when a fanfic directly draws from another story that is in and of itself a fanfic rather than just using some of the same details or being influenced by another work."

***** Anyway it'll be fine if I decide against it! :) I think I do have enough potential universes of my own fanfics to crossover with each other on their own. But I was wondering anyway so thank you for all the helpful words! :)

****** I usually hate the idea if it's presented as a sequel like Para Bellum was. If it's just a separate thing you do without affecting the main universe then I suppose it will be great for fans of both fanfiction.

***** Oh okay, thanks. Do fanfic CROSSOVERS count as "recursive" though, because I'm not like REWRITING the story and presenting it straight as that. I just want to use a few as sandboxes for a crossover. :)

****** I understand what you want. Something like Cadbury!verse. And yeah, it's still recursive fanfiction. There isn't anything bad about that.

That's my opinion anyway

** I don't mind when folks wish to borrow my world building or adapt or extend stories I've written. Darth Marrs's /Unspeakable Things/, e.g., was adapted from one of my one shots.

I do get vexed at wholesale copying of stories without permission or attribution though.

*** Okay Pers! :) Yes if I do use any fanfic universes for my crossover I will put a DISCLAIMER like all fanfic authors put for playing in professional book universes. :)

*** In the end, if you really want to copy what we do to real authors, should just be putting a disclaimer on the top of every chapter and it should be enough.

*** Well I don't want to like use an entire unchanged story here, like in a meta "I'm just going to copy a story and write it all down" way. I mean I just would like to be able to have a few universes as sandboxes for a sort of fanfic crossover where some of my characters would cross out of their universes and into other ones made by other authors, and then get to meet THEIR characters. :)

But yes you are right! Nobody who writes Harry Potter/Star Wars crossovers ever calls up George Lucas and asks if they can use HIS universe, so I don't have to ask any FANFIC authors to use their universe for my crossover either.

** I think it depends what you mean. Do you want to do a fanfic of a fanfic? Then I think most would be honored, or at least not mind. If you mean that you want to 'borrow' elements of different fanfics and use in yours, even with credit, that's a lot more sticky.

*** No I do mean I want to write a crossover with other fanfics. :) Like where people do harry potter/star wars crossovers, with harry going into the star wars universe. Except it would be like some of my fanfic characters going into other fanfic universes. :)
