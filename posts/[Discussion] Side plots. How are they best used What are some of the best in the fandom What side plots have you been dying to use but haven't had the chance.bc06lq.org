Canon features plenty of side plots featuring side characters. Whether it's Tonks' and Remus' relationship drama, or Luna's ongoing struggles with bullying, Rowling brought a host of side characters to life by dipping Harry (and thus the reader) into their world from time to time.

In fanfiction, I often find side plots can be distracting or boring, but when done well, they can sometimes steal the show.

What are your thoughts on side plots?


** Sideplots are only as a good as the characters driving them.

If the characters are bland, annoying, poorly developed, or not developed at all, then the readers have no investment and will not be interested. Fanfic writers have trouble making the MC, Harry, into a likeable character and often bank on his abilities (boosted magical core, 9000 inheritances) to draw the readers, rather than giving him an actual personality. Naturally, the secondary or tertiary characters will be even less interesting.

To make them interesting: give them a concrete challenge, give them clear goals, and make them struggle to achieve them. That's how you invest a reader. The same rules apply to side characters /and/ main characters, though many authors struggle to do that for any character.

One of the most memorable side plots was Fiona the police officer, a muggle OC from Harry Potter and the Natural 20. The MC himself was an OC, but still an excellent character because he (and Fiona) were challenged, and were forced to figure out creative ways to solve their problems.

Yeah I think this is a key ingredient. The side characters involved should have their own agency.

Just goes to show that even in humor/crack fics, good writing goes a long way.

Came here to say this. The best side plot in the entire fandom, hands-down.

***** Fiona keeps encountering the Wizarding world and getting Obliviated, but she's keeping records the Obliviators don't find. As she keeps investigating, she gets drawn into the conflict with the Death Eaters.

**** I really liked the side plot in your /The Accidental Animagus/ where the Carrows go on a quest to bring back Voldemort. Not only did it fit perfectly with the rest of the story, but the characterization was really good, they were humanized in a way that made them more loathsome.

**** No, you don't need to know much about D&D to read it. If you do, you'd probably catch some more in jokes, but most of it gets explained in the story - everything you really need, at least.

For reference I read it before I ever played D&D and was going off general knowledge of RPGs

** I guess it depends on how the side plot ties into the general picture. If you just add some Ron/Hermione drama on the side and devote 25% of your story to that for the sake of doing so, that's not good writing. But if you keep throwing references to Grindelwald'sppath to darkness and he then shows up in the final battle and slaps the shit out of the Death Eaters with his dark spells you kept mentioning, that is a clever setup.

The decision whether a side plot had a sufficient payoff to justify its existence is up to the individual.

I'd argue there's a right way to do this, but I agree that this is the type of side plot that gets tiresome quickly. It's just such a vague notion.

Exactly, foreshadowing is key for side plots.

Well there's a rather worthless statement.

edit: Worthless in that it's always true that whether or not any scene or idea is up to the writer to decide if it's worth including. I agree with the sentiment.

** One of my favourite series Anguis has a sideplot that Slytherin Captain Urquheart was friendly with Ginny (presumably bonding over a love of Quidditch) and was initially keeping his head down but made the right choice in the end.

I loved it, added a little flavour to the story.

** As far as I understand it, the point of side-plots is to illuminate aspects of the main characters that we wouldn't otherwise get to see. From your two examples, Luna's struggles with bullying are used to reveal Harry's character growth in OotP, where at the beginning he finds her weird and is uncomfortable around her, but at the end of the book she is one of the only people he /is/ comfortable being around. Tonks & Remus' relationship drama is there so we can have the scene where Harry tells Remus off for not being responsible enough, which shows that Harry himself needs to be more responsible by searching for the Horcruxes instead of running off after the Hallows.

My guess is that the most engaging side plots are the ones that do a good job at this: telling us more about the main characters, while also being interesting stories in & of themselves. Sideplots are boring when thy are ultimately irrelevant and feature bland folks who we can't find a way to care about.

*** While I don't think side-plots HAVE to be about the main characters, I believe they have to be linked one way or another to the main story.\\
For example, I think movie Half Blood prince do an excellente job with Draco scenes. During all the movie we see him working on a closet, not understanding what it is (at least for the one who had not read the book) but seeing Draco apparence change as his deadline approach and he is more stressed. And in the end we finally see Draco smuggling Death Eaters into the castle and understand his mission, and his plan.\\
Another example (still in movie) would be Seamus Finnigan. He is not a main character, but during all the movie we see him blowing things up, until the last movie where his knowledge of explosives is used in the Battle.\\
I personnaly prefer when side plots are used to evolve side character (giving them new capacities, morals) rather than main cast. We see them enough already.
