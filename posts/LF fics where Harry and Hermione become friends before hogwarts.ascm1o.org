Bonus if they explore magic together before they know about hogwarts.

No slash for Harry please. Prefer longer fics, but shorter ones are fine if they are good (:


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)

Harry gets adopted by the Grangers after running away from the Dursleys, they get informed about Magic and prepare.

linkffn(The Perils of Innocence)

Harry and Hermione meet in an institute for children with psychological issues where they both are because of accidental magic. The doctors help them explore their abilities.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Hermione gets introduced a bit late in this one, basically Harry grows up with Sirius and meets Hermione later on in muggle primary school, both have no idea that the other one is magical and they always avoid the subject until they randomly find out.

linkffn(You're my Density)

I don't know if this one counts, it's time travel so they know about magic before the second time they go to Hogwarts.

Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][The Perils of Innocence]] This one is nowhere near complete, but is fantastic. Harry is raised from the age of 6 in a home for children with psychological problems. Hermione's parents send her there because they are afraid of the "events" that happen around her.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12948152/1/Elfish-Welfare][Elfish Welfare]] The Potter's house elves raise Harry. Harry and Hermione meet in primary school. Harry does know of magic though.

This one doesn't fit the letter of your request but might fit the spirit of it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] Harry is blinded by the killing curse as a baby and doesn't go to hogwarts, Hermione has the speech center of her brain horribly damaged in the troll attack and is pulled from hogwarts by her parents, they meet in a mundane school for the disabled. Harry and Hermione do lots of magical experimentation and self study.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] has Harry and Hermione meet in mundane primary school. Harry already knows of magic thought.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026760/1/Dahlia-Evans-the-Broken-Bridge][Dahlia Evans & the Broken Bridge]] has fem!Harry meeting Hermione before hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/Labyrinth][Labyrinth]] didn't really get anywhere before it was abandoned but also has this.

Harry is adopted by the grangers in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]]. it is complete its sequel +won't be+ +isn't+ Might not be

I'm only including [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]] for completeness. It is a Robst fic with all that entails. Has Lily Potter meeting Emma Granger as the reason Lily lives through halloween 1981.

Looking forward to what everyone else has.

  He has this amazing talent of coming up with good ideas and then ruining it through a combination of predictability and poor characterisation. H/Hr are never seriously challenged; the enemy is usually stupid or incompetent or both; and he writes Harry and Hermione as such sanctimonious, smug, little gits that I find myself wanting Voldemort to win.
