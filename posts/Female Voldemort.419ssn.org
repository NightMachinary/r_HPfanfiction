I'm looking for any story featuring a female Voldemort/TomRiddle. Preferably with a Harry pairing.


** linkffn(7274298)

This is a short oneshot that I personally enjoyed. You might not enjoy it if you don't like creepy stories, as it gets rather disturbing. But then again, you /are/ asking for a Harry/fem!Voldemort fic...

  Oneshot. A DLP-inspired exploration of a fem!TomRiddle. This is not for the squeamish. Admitted into the DLP library.

*** Lungs is such a peculiar writer.

I've had many conversations with Lungs on FFN. Very sharp. Just looks at the world very differently. I love it.

**** Do you recommend reading The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope OR Fractal?

Fractal says it's a rewrite, but with 100k less words and not updated in two years, and the other being complete I'm not sure where to start. I'm kind of assuming the rewrite won't allow me to simply switch chapters after reaching the end.

***** I do. Read Wizard first. It will slowly get away from Lungs then about two thirds through it just goes bizarre.

To give you an idea Harry is very much Sasuke and Hermione is Sakura.

But not in the way you think.

In retrospect Lungs predicted how Sasuke turned out well before Kishimoto let his own creation get away from him.

Fractal is cleaner but became one of the reasons now only read completed. To me its good. And Lungs realized Wizard got away so cleaned it up and changed a few things.

** Thunderstorm linkffn(7186430) :

The best fem!Voldemort fic I have read. I normally avoid fics that have Voldemort paired with Harry (slash or one character is fem) because the age gap between the characters makes anything of that sort creepy and unrealistic for me. That said, thunderstorm is written with Harry being paired with a fem!Tom that is as old as him.
