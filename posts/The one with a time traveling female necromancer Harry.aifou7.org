Harry (male) dies during the Ministry assault, I wanna say. The powers that be declare this unacceptable and send him back in time. When he gets "back" he goes to the goblins and realizes he should have been a girl.

Goes along with it goes to Hogwarts, recruits Snape, kills and resurrects Dumbledore, and starts dating Fleur, who was also sent back when she died in the old time line.

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.

***** I really liked it. There aren't very many good story's with femslash romance in them. So I appreciated that. The romance isn't really the main point of the story so far. It is more of a kind of generic Peggy sue story.
