Lord Voldemort held his wand, poised to cast the killing curse on the baby. His hand stilled as he contemplated the words of the prophesy.

/The dark lord will mark him as his equal./

Suddenly Voldemort was not confident of his actions. 'If I kill him, how will he be my equal?'

Voldemort stared at the baby, his red glowing eyes demanding an answer from the baby who was crying.

"Oh, Shut Up!" Voldemort cast a stinging hex at the baby. He underestimated the power behind the spell and spell burned in Harry Potter's forehead. Voldemort was surprised at this.

"Huh. I've now marked him as my equal?"

"What would an equal look like though?" Voldemort questioned as he causally paced around the room, stepping over Lily Potter's cooling corpse. "What would be your power?" Voldemort was intensely curious now. All Voldemort ever cared about was to find new sources of power. He had steeped into darkest of arts and wondered what power would this baby have to defeat him. He really wanted to know.

"I would like to see that." Voldemort decided. He paused and then nodded quickly, "I've decided. You shall have unfettered freedom to grow." With that, Voldemort undressed and set some minor fires around the house. He felt apparitions nearby and decided, it was time to leave.

Later, in when Dementors were stationed near Azkaban, Harry Potter would remember naked Voldemort and would never be able to overcome the fear to successfully cast a Patronus.

"Our battle shall be legendary!" Voldemort yelled excitedly as he deactivated Dark Mark.


** now I picturing voldemort showing up at hogwarts possing quirrel

not to steal the stone, but to see how his rivial is doing and making sure he has a solid start to his education.

this voldemort also sends harry encouraging letters like 'Its me lord voldemort, I killed your parents and will one day kill you, so you better study hard and I might spare you'

he also notices harry's friendship with ron and hermione and realises they will be his equals lieutenant's so voldemort of course makes sure they are also properly educated so that his own lieutenants have some thing fun to do when he is battling his equal.

***** Serverus reports to Albus and nearly has a coronary because the Dark Lord wants him to take Harry under his wing and that's counterintuitive. "But what does he want? I can not fathom his motives. He's planning something I can't see, I won't be able to protect the boy, and Lily's son will die. I have failed her, Albus!" Snape is so distraught his Yorkshire accent bleeds through the cultivated speech he spent years to perfect.

*** Also everyone would be stumped as to why suddenly a teacher lasts for more than a year.

Also, he could be a wonderful combination of all the canon teachers - he keeps quirell in the trunk to get polyjuice, is absolutely narcissistic, teaches really well about all manners of stuff, including dark curses, and does some moves into getting influence and good rapport with ministry, and ultimately cares for Harry for a really odd reason.

Like, 6 canon teachers/teacher plots in one!

#+end_quote

Voldemort had never felt the need to learn the Patronus charm. Dementors had always been his allies, and other shield charms were more effective for anything else. However, lately, he'd encountered some rogue dementors, wild ones perhaps, and never wished to repeat the experience. While many would imagine a wizard like Lord Voldemort to have many unpleasant memories for the dementors to feast on, the truth was quite different. When he was still human, Tom Riddle had feared death; having conquered that, Lord Voldemort feared only one thing, and the dementors brought the cursed image to the forefront of his mind: naked Harry Potter. Voldemort could not understand where that mental image had originated from, but he would never be able to overcome the fear to successfully cast a Patronus.

And that -- though Voldemort would never figure out -- was how he and Harry Potter were equals.

** One day Voldemort is checking up on him at the park and witnesses a session of 'Harry Hunting'.

"How is he to give me a good dual if he can't see to aim his wand with these nincompoops breaking his glasses?"

Voldemort then decides to put the fear of God into the bullies and kidnaps Harry, getting him new glasses, clothes that fit, and a proper education. The blood wards don't stop him because he's planning to care for the boy better than the Dursleys do. Which is how Voldemort becomes a helicopter mum.

Like another commenter wrote, he wants to keep a close eye on Harry's schooling and disguises himself to be the new DADA instructor combining 6/7 other instructors. (Bc I want to forget about Amycus) No one realizes its him like with M.E. Moody, not even the boy he's been raising for the past 5ish years.

But he also sends threatening letters from Lord Voldemort as another commenter suggested. I'm not decided if I like the thought Harry not knowing his new dad is also Lord V (which is how he signs his 'Hi it's me Lord Voldemort' letters) or if the Dark Lord has those same discussions each week over Sunday supper.

I'm leaning to the side of picturing Sunday supper DE meetings that include the DE families discussing world domination over fried chicken and greens. Despite playing with Draco Malfoy every Sunday afternoon, his spoiled attitude grates on Harry's nerves because Voldemort doesn't spoil him, his best friends still become Hermione and Ron. As another commenter said, Voldemort realizes these two will be Harry's lieutenants and has them trained as well.

I think this combined the ideas of the people with the most responses. Did I forget anything?

*** I like where you're going with this. Voldemort as a helicopter mum would be interesting. I am a bit partial to leaving Voldemort being evil. Instead of putting fear of God in bullies, I see him analyzing the behavior of Harry and exclaiming, "We are more alike that I previously thought."
