I've read a lot of HP fanfic and HPMOR just blows my mind! I am currently on chapter 60 and I absolutely love it. This author is a genius; and I love how he gives props to JK at the beginning of almost every chapter. I highly recommend HPMOR to anyone with an open mind and a good sense of humor :)

***** People also like Fifty Shades of Grey... And Twilight. That doesn't change the fact that those works, like MoR, are really bad.

bad is relative to each person.

Not all Twilight, and Grey fans are idiots if they like something.

******* Yes, that's an opinion.

Picture a restaurant. Two people sit down. One order a nice medium rare steak. The other orders a pile of shit. They may enjoy their meals equally, insist its the best thing ever, but the fact remains one of them is eating shit.

That's basically MoR, Twilight and Fifty Shades :p

So what about the ones who don't think too much about such things?

Grey /must/ have had some good smut or fans wouldn't have liked the sex scenes.

That's an oddly specific thing to love about a fanfic. Would be like if I praised a fic for having a disclaimer.

** I could not for the life of me get into that one.. It just seemed like most of the plot of the entire HP series was shoehorned into the first year.. But i rather liked the concept behind it..

** Just so you know HPMOR has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/][its own subreddit]].

HPMOR is one of the most intricately plotted fanfictions out there. There are foreshadows and references you won't learn the signficance of until much later on, which gives the story a lot of re-readability (you can learn something new everytime you read it).

It's not everyone's cup of tea. Harry's initial character is a turn-off to some (who may abandon the series before he actually starts growing as a person), the rationality rants may seem pedantic to others (fair), and it's not a creative writing darling (fine by me), but there are few other fanficitions which approach it in plotting, character conflict and growth, and introspection.

**** Haha, I suppose not. I don't know much about his character or personality, other than knowing that he held chapters hostage for donations (people can quibble, but that's what I understood from what I've read about it), which ranks him somewhere above puppy-kickers but below people who steal candy from babies, in my book.
