it's in the form of a special investigative article for the Daily Prophet. I only publish on ffnet but wouldn't mind exchanging files via email either, whatever your preference.

I'm at the stage now where I don't want to write myself into a corner (i.e. it'd be good to bounce around ideas for my plan, which will be included), and don't want to waste my time writing like crap if there is some sort of mistake I am repeating over and over again. So uh, if someone is willing to read my 3000 words so far, I'd be very appreciative. Especially in making it more "special feature in a newspaper/magazine" such as Esquire, old Playboy articles, etc.

So, if you like the idea of a HP character investigating Lockhart's misdeeds, give me a shout. Thanks!


** If you PM me all of what you have got already I'll critique it. General critique and line-by-line.
