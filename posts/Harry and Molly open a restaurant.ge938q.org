I read this in 2018 on ffn, it was unfinished. Ron was married to Luna, Harry was about to go on a date with Ginny last I read but there were some hints at eventual HHr as well.

Harry had to pretend to be into Daphne Greengrass for a while or they were going to get price gouged on auroch(?) meat. (The goal was magical hamburgers of some sort and the Greengrasses were the only breeders)
