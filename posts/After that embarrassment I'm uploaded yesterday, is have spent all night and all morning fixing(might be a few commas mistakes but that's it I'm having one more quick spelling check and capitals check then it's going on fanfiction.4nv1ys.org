** You still haven't posted anything?? People on this sub are willing to help you with your work, but I think you need to slow down a little and figure out what's going on first. Find a beta/editor and make sure your work is polished before you post it. With the greatest respect, I find it unlikely that you were able to catch all your mistakes. Next, make sure it is published on ff.net. before asking for feedback here. When it is published, link us to it using the bot (instructions on the side bar) or posting the link directly. When we give feedback, listen to it carefully and respectfully. This is not an environment where people will avoid being critical.
