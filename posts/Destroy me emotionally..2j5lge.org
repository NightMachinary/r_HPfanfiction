For reference [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/1/A-Promise-From-Her-Boy][this is one of my favourite fanfics]]. I want to become invested in a character or characters then I want something to happen to them that will make me sad.

I had forgotten that [[/s][Spoiler]]. and only remembered it just before it happened. So, it me even harder than it otherwise would have.

**** You know the saying, there's a fine line between love and hate, yeah I'm on that line. I don't know whether to hate you for giving me the worst case of the feels ( I'm not going to lie I shed a few man tears) or love you for re-igniting my love for Hedwig and showing me an extremely well written fic.

** I've posted this before, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3461008/1/Survivor][Survivor]]. It's the only piece of fiction that has ever brought me to tears and I say that with genuine honesty. It's not too terribly wrong, but it is incredibly effective, dealing with themes like loss of a loved one and acceptance of death. I actually think that it is one of my favorite stories ever, to be honest.

*** I am trying to think of a reply to properly quantify the levels of feels I have after reading this fic, but long horrible wailing does not properly convey itself to text. Sufficed to say, imagine the word "Ow" in size 1000 font, possibly on fire.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/The-Double-Agent][The Double Agent]] is good (real tear jerker, that one) and so is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]]. They are both one shots, though, if a bit longer then usual. If you have /a lot/ of time, I'll recommend you read this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment it began]] I'm sure I cried at some points even if it's been some time since I read it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] is also great. I just finished it a few days ago and it's still being updated.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=224105][Harry Potter and the Other Path]] fits your criteria to some degree. It starts off really upbeat and fun to read, gets a bit darker, and then some extraordinarily tragic things happen, albeit a couple of hundred thousand words in.
