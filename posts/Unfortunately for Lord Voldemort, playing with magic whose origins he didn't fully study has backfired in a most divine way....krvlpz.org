"I'm... not sure, Professor," Harry said slowly, looking strangely lost. To Dumbledore's surprise, Harry's grip on his bed-covers increased until his knuckles became bone white. "I mean, I was tied up; he was gloating, and he tried using the /imperius/, but..."

"But what, Harry?" Dumbledore's voice was calm and soothing, and betrayed none of the concern he was feeling.

"I felt... cold. But not cold like laying in a bath for hours, but the kind of... I guess nice cold you get from a cold wind on a hot summer's night?" He hesitated, as though he were unsure himself about his own recollections. "And then... I think it was me, but it /wasn't/... I said something to him, and he... Voldemort starting acting strange, I guess? Afraid?"

Dumbledore stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Can you remember exactly what it is you said?"

Harry hesitated, but then said in a low, guttering tone that was more bark than speech. *"Found you."*

Dumbledore didn't understand the words directly, though he vaguely recognized /where/ in the world it came from, but the intent behind them was as clear as day.

"I've also been having weird cravings for roast beef and beer," Harry said somewhat sheepishly. "But I've never drunk beer! Not even that expensive, imported stuff Uncle Vernon buys!"

Days later, as Dumbledore revealed the truth about poor Cedric's death and Tom's return to all three schools, he swore he caught sight of, just for a moment, the outline of a jackal's head in place of young Harry's during his memorial toast.

The sense of unease that had been lurking in the back of his mind for the last couple of days was becoming more and more prominent.

---

tl;dr: Herpo the Foul's horcrux creation ritual was from bastardized Ancient Egyptian magic, via Greece. Unfortunately for those who made horcuci, it put them on the personal shit-list of Anubis himself.

Harry is unknowing that Anubis' shade/influence is in him, but Dumbledore suspects something is amiss and is actually pretty goddamn worried: after all, you have a god with a very different sense of morals to us humans influencing Harry to send Voldemort to him and the his scales. /All/ of him.

And where Anubis goes, his stalkerish wife Anput is also said to be close behind -- not to mention their daughter, Kebechet!

So, yeah: there's an opportunity that one girl in Hogwarts starts feeling "influenced" to like him, while another wants his and this girl's approval in a paternal/maternal way.

...it'd be goddamn hilarious if Kebechet is influencing Rita Skeeter or Madam Rosmerta, while Anput is lurking around in, say, Katie Bell or a lesser-used character. Alternately, the vagueness of this could fit basically any pairing/characters, from the Harry/Ginny lovers, to the Harmonians, to those who like Harry/Daphne, et cetera. it's very open.

...Hah, Pansy Parkinson having Keberchet poking her brain would be /hilarious/.

...Probably shouldn't write prompts when I've been drinking a bottle of Smirnoff, haha.


** I honestly thought you were going the Master of Death route with this. I mean, you still could with what you've got, nobody knows what it means, after all. Could be you've just got to put up with Anubis making you eat raw gazelle meat and other embarrassing things until all of Riddle's horcruxes (pronounced horcrusees) are eliminated.

Nice idea, I may have to yoink it for later. :)

It could be Egyptian, Celtic, Roman, Greek -- heck, Harry becoming a Mayan or Aztec deities priest would be more unusual, as would the gods in Europe before they were appropriated by more organized religions (for example, Aphrodite was originally a form of Ishtar that changed as her cult "island hopped", while Artemis was originally a mountain spring goddess in Eastern Europe-bordering-Greece before becoming folded into being the Artemis we know of today, et cetera).

Regardless, except for a few daily rituals he has to do, not much has changed -- he goes to work, comes home to his wife and kids, et cetera. But he does have to do a few innocuous, daily rituals, like drink a cup of wine with breakfast or pour animal blood into a bowl as he's cooking lunch, et cetera.

One day, a desperate Draco Malfoy turns up at his door with a sickly-looking Astoria. He begs him to help his wife from the Curse afflicting her bloodline.

My headcanon is that studying Latin is actually detrimental.

Magic works via intent, you say "Expecto Patronum" and you intend to cast the spell, because all you know is that it's a spell. But once you learn Latin, and you understand the meaning of the words, you can no longer cast spells in Latin for the same reason you can't do it in English, now they're just words to you.

**** Latin is a really interesting language, rather than having a word order they modified the ends of the words to indicate what part of the sentence they are.

In English we would put the the subject of the sentence first followed by a verb then the object, so: Lucius (s) sees the woman (o)

If you write the sentence any other way the meaning changes: The woman (s) sees Lucius (o)

Words in Latin are made of 2 parts: • The stem or start or the word so: “Luci-“ “Femin-“ • And the endings eg: “-us” “-am”

In Latin this is indicated by the end of the word: Lucius (s) feminam (o) videt. Feminam (o) Lucius (s) videt.

Both sentences translate to “Lucius sees the woman” (Note if you wrote “videt feminam Lucius” again the meaning is the same, however Romans have a tendency so say the verb at the end of a sentence.)

Same with plurals:

Lucius sees the women = Lucius feminas videt (or feminas Lucius videt)

Or maybe for some strange reason you have like 6 of Lucius:

Lucii feminas videt = the Luciuses see the women Or

Lucii feminam videt = the Luciuses see the woman (My English plurals suuuuuck here I know)

So how does this tie back to the plural for horcrux?

All nouns are grouped into 5 declensions:

• First declension - a stems These are words that usually end in “-a” in the nominative singular (so as a singular subject of a sentence), and are mostly feminine.

Femina is a first declension noun

• Second declension - o stems This group is made up of mostly masculine or neuter nouns. In the nominative singular they end in “-us” masculine, and “-um” neuter

Lucius is a second declension noun

(In Classical Latin, the short o of the nominative and accusative singular became u)

• Third declension - i stems This is the biggest declension and what I personally refer to as the eff it declension. The nominative singular of these nouns can end in -a, -e, -ī, -ō, -y, -c, -l, -n, -r, -s, -t, or -x. It's almost as if the Romans went “it doesn't fit in the other declensions? Into the 3rd it goes!”

Horcrux would fit into the 3rd declension. To get the plural for horcrux let's use pax or peace.

Following the way pax is declined the nominative singular is “pax” and the the stem of the word is “pac-“. Therefore Horcrux would have the stem “horcruc-“ and be declined into horcruces in the plural (both in the nominative plural (subject) and accusative plural (object)).

The plural of Horcrux is Horcuces

Just in case you're interested:

• Fourth declension - u stems Similar to the second declension this group is mostly masculine words and includes a number of neuter nouns. Most of the words end in “-u” or “-us”. These words are easily confused with 2nd declension nouns.

• Fifth declension - e stems This is a small group of nouns that are 99% feminine. These nouns all end in “-es” or “-ies”
