I personally dislike Hermione Granger. She's everything that annoyed me about smart kids in school. :/


** Fred and George when the author tries too hard to make everything they say funny and makes them "switch who" "-is talking-" "-every few words-" "-every single time-" "-that they talk!"

*** If we're talking about canon, definitely. Draco is pathetic, selfish, bigoted, and cowardly - his most noble moment is being unable to commit murder.

That said, one of the things I love about fan-fiction is the ability to explore the 'what ifs'. I think that written convincingly, no character is beyond redemption. For example, I quite like the portrayal of Draco in linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them). It manages to avoid giving him a complete character transplant; he's still a little shit initially.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

Not because they are portrayed as likeable people, but because they are dynamic characters and it's fun to read about their interactions with Harry. On the other side of the spectrum, I dislike Ginny because I didn't see many characterizations in her that were appealing to me. She's kind of boring.

I sort of see Umbridge the same way I do the Dursleys. She's a horrible person, but as a character, she's one of the most interesting ones in the series. I'd even argue that she surpasses Voldemort in being an effective villain as far as literary execution goes.

** The Fanon Intepretations of Movie!Hermione and Snape for example. Movie!Hermione took some of Ron's best lines and got some of her imperfections erased for example. Snape became more aloof and more mysterious than his misanthropic counterpart in the books would have you believe.

Fred and George Weasely get way too free a pass in fanfics sometimes for being manipulative bullies that cross the line from pranks to hazing way too often, not to mention the experimentation they tried to do onto young schoolchildren in the fifth book. In fanfics, they become Those Two Guys, the loyal followers that didnt agree with Ron, Molly and Ginny when they worked with Evil!Dumbledore to Love Potion Harry and Hermione, with a side job of pranking a Slytherin who Deserved it, most often Malfoy and Snape.

Lupin can get a pass for basically abandoning Harry for the first 13 years of his life and then for not really being there afterwards, especially in fourth year. But then again, i guess Harry in the books was willing to accept and forgive people who did shower him with affection.

Not to mention, she doesn't develop or change throughout the series. She stays exactly the same, her entire purpose is to show Harry's character development as he accepts her. I never understand why people think she's this incredibly well rounded character when to me she seems quite flat.

****** I think you are right. It's just that I knew a girl very similar to Luna. I was 12 when I moved to another part of my city and changed schools. So in this new school there was a very strange girl. Now I think she wasn't mentally healthy but nothing too serious that would prevent her from studying with other kids. Other children were not exactly bullying her, but were certainly ignoring her and sometimes laughing behind her back. They were not kind at all. I was new and didn't care about these children so didn't care about their opinion. I decided to be friends with her, because I felt sorry for her. She was really strange, I can't remember all the details now, but I remember how uncomfortable I was around her. She couldn't understand my interests or my worries, we were not friends, we became 'friends' only because I was sorry for her. She started demanding more attention, which was natural, as she started to consider me as her friend. But I wasn't interested in spending all my time with her. I realised that was a great responsibility to show kindness and acceptance to someone who desperately needs them. I tried to continue our 'friendship' but nothing came of it, I found new friends, real friends, who shared my interests, who I understood and who could understand me. I always felt ashamed that I didn't have enough strength to continue supporting her. Back to Luna, it just doesn't feel right that often in fanfiction Harry helps her, supports her, calls her 'friend' and then goes on to do other things, and Luna doesn't show up in the story until it's convenient again. Well, friendship doesn't work like that. I guess I can't really put into words what I feel. English isn't my first language and I was always more intuitive than logical. But it can't be that easy, just to show some kindness to right all wrongs, it's much more complex. It's the same as Harry encouraging Neville a bit, and after that Neville overcomes all his insecurities.

As Neville came out of his shell he just slotted into place and nobody ever expected anything since he's always been there.

Fanfic authors never bother to try and develop the character, so you end up with a 40-year-old Luna who acts /exactly/ how she did at 14. Fanon never portrays her as weird or unstable, but instead, she's portrayed as having this profound wisdom that no one (aside from Harry and sometimes Neville) can understand and that just makes her even more of a beautiful cinnamon roll who is too pure for this world.

** I loathe Molly Weasley, although not to the extent of the Weasley bashing fics. It's just she's got the kind of smothering personality that I can not abide in real life. It's not endearing or sweet, it's obnoxious and patronizing.

I use the example of the time when she took it upon herself to withdraw money from Harry's bank account and buy his supplies without discussing it with him first. I do not mean to suggest that she stole from him, I highly doubt that she would do such a thing. My problem is boundaries. I wouldn't do that to my own /daughter/ that I raised for 18 years and who currently lives with me. It's her bank account, it's her money. If she needed anything and I was going to take care of it for her, I'd make sure to mention it to her first and ask if she actually wanted me to do such a thing. Because that's what respectful, courteous people do. I can't even imagine a situation where I'd do that with my kid's friends. I'd have to be insane. There's a difference between helping out a kid in need and overstepping boundaries, and she overstepped big time there.

That's only one example, but overall I found Molly to be overbearing and pushy.

I have this trivia board game about it so I re-read it till I basically had it memorized. If you haven't read this book in a while you will likely forget how insufferable Hermione is. From the moment she bursts into the cabin on the Hogwarts Express she is rude and demanding, so arrogant and rude she doesn't get friends until the troll incident forces the trio together. Through out the series she is still rude, presumptuous and painfully self-righteous. While she probably grows up as a person I'm rather judgemental and you know what they say about first impressions. I'm also quite private so her relentless questioning would have driven me up the wall.

Snape. Having a creepy obsession with another man's wife is not a redeeming feature, its creepy. I don't really know why anyone thinks that such a petty hateful man is suddenly good when he died. Regardless of how he treated Harry even if somehow you inexplicably give him a free pass to bully and abuse based off what James did to him you have no defense for what he did to Neville. This man bullied the boy so much he became his boggart, his worst fear, more that being dropped out of windows, more than BELLATRIX who tortured his parents. Think for a moment how bad he must have made Neville feel to be worse than the LeStranges. In my headcannon James can forgive Snape as Snape despite being a dick was looking out for his son but I despise the idea that loving, caring compassionate Lily would ever be okay with the man that Snape has become. Regardless of how brave he was he was a dick of the highest order. I despise the idea of Snape traveling back in time and getting Lily, denying her James, a man who died to buy her more time to escape, a man who she was happy with. Instead this hook nosed, greasy barstard gets rewarded for being scum scraped off the bottom of the barrel of humanity.

McGonagall in the things I have written almost always steps forwards and helps Harry. The whole speech she gives about a house being a family and all that. She knew Lily and James and would have been the perfect person for Harry to talk to about his parents but we never once see it. Harry was content to coast by, whether you blame Ron's lazyness or Hermione's pettyness its clear that Harry is performing worse than his parents academically. McGonagall would have been the perfect person to inspire him with tales of his parents and their brilliance, it wouldn't take much for her to fill a grandmother role in Harry's life. In cannon, other than when she swears that she will she Harry become an auror we barely see her stand behind him in any meaningful way.

Lupin. Where was he? Where did he go after Harry's third year? The man drowned in his self pity and wallowed in his misery. He didn't want to be happy, take a moment and think how different things would have been if he stepped up as James' last remaining 'brother' after they though Peter and James dead with Sirius imprisoned. The man who should have been an uncle, a permanent fixture in Harry's life took months to reveal this to Harry, so much for a Gryffindor.

I've said this before, but I'm almost certain it's because of the movies. Move Snape is a much, much more likable person (partly because of Rickman and partly because of how they wrote his character).

When I finished reading the books, I hated Snape and thought he was disgusting. Compare this to my dad who, after only watching the movies, sees Snape as a funny (but kind of a dick) teacher. In the movies he's funnier, less mean, and they don't ham up how much Snape loved Lily and was doing things only for Lily's memory.

You mentioned Darth Vader, who I think is the reverse of Snape. He was definitely a fan favorite after the original Trilogy, but Anakin's portrayal in the prequels didn't help him much.

I don't really see the appeal to Snape besides a hamfisted tragic backstory that doesn't address the biggest issue with his character - that he's a straight up dick.

If Snape hadn't been as mean (like movie Snape was), and his rational had been more "do the right thing" instead of "I love Lily Potter", his character probably would've resonated more with me. Like let's say Snape preemptively contacted Dumbledore when Voldemort pondered the prophecy, or that if he at least tried to teach, I would've respected him a lot more.

i'm not sure what you mean by 'address', but i think his history does contextualise his behaviour. he had an abusive father and a dysfunctional family, then he was relentlessly abused at school. his only 'positive' influence was lily, who was a peer and not an adult, and who he miscommunicated with pretty much for their entire friendship and then got together with his tormentor. then he was put in a teaching job he didn't want, none of his traumas are resolved etc.

as for his appeal- he's tragic, ambitious, skillful and, even if performatively, heroic. he has intense relationships with multiple characters

I don't find it hard to see the appeal that he has to people. Maybe he doesn't have many straight up redeeming qualities but he does have a lot of qualities that if not necessarily good, are not bad either. Not to mention that he is one of the more interesting and complex characters in the series.

He is intelligent and values knowledge, invented his own spells and improved standard potion's recipes. Managed to rise against his upbringing as a poor half blood in slytherin and bullying to become one of the most trusted people to the two most powerful wizards in Britain. Still does the right thing when needed (even if it's not for a noble reason, but that just makes his story more interesting) even when he absolutely hates Harry. Has some great dialogue, sarcastic dry humour and an attitude of not giving a fuck about anything. Even the way he insults people is quite amazing.

Also, dark, mysterious, spy antihero whos intentions we are never quite sure about, of course he is popular. Not the kind of person I would ever want to know in real life and he is definitely an asshole who bullies children because of his own emotional immaturity, but he is very interesting to read about. Although I do wish that authors would stop whitewashing his character so much.

Snape, I feel is more complicated. I thought he did redeem himself in the end, because of the Power of Love(TM), but well further reading the arguments has soured me on that angle. Still in the end, he gave his life to protect Harry and i guess suffering the ultimate consequences for someone is worthy in of itself and must count for something. I won't deny your reaction isnt valid if it comes from someone like Neville, but Harry seems to be a generally forgiving chap

Your criticism of McGonagall is certainly warranted and there are a couple of fics i have read in the past year that address this question (Power Of Love by Philosophize and the Cupboard Series by Stargon1) Usually, this results in McGonagall getting a good wake-up slap and being more supportive of Harry from there on

As for Lupin, well i can just chalk it up to him actually being supportive of Harry, listening to him, teaching him the Patronus before the reveal, I think at that point, Harry was willing to forgive him and accept what affection he could get right now. It's not really addressed in the books, but end of the day, Harry accepts Lupin

He was an absolutely terrible person. But, for the one good person he had in his life - Lily - that he messed up, Snape was willing to put everything he felt and believed in - and he most certainly believed the Death Eater creed before then - to protect her. When questioned he was even willing to protect Harry and James by proxy despite how revolting that was to him.

He was a revolting person in the end, but still a brave man as well.

On the other hand, I totally agree with you.

Bad guys may be dumb in the Books, but I think good (adult) guys are dumber. Unfortunately, that is the main cliche in (most?) YA fictions. If adults were really up to their games, how could teens possibly shine? JKR was not even that bad compared to other authors. I've been listening to Rick Riodan's audio books with my children, and I must admit he's worse than JKR in this regard.

--------------

If an author writes the same story with everyone up to their own games, we will get something like [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. The kids pretty much became cold-blooded, dangerous, intelligent, and ruthless killers. Although I loved that fic, some readers will definitely feel turned off. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5g183s/discussion_best_quotes_that_you_wish_people_would/daoqyow/][This conversation]] between Hermione and her boss from the SIS is actually kind chilling.

For example Harry finds out what Death Eaters are during the World Cup in book 4. It literally took him over 3 years to even learn the name of the people that have been trying to kill him all his life. Now this might seem very specific and not very relevant but i think it's a perfect example for Harry's lack of knowledge and willingness to learn.

If you learn that you're famous for defeating a Dark Lord wouldn't you at least do some research on him? Trying to figure out who your enemies are in this new society should be one of the first things you do, especially if you learn that the evil Dark Lord that desperately wants to end your life isn't actually dead, even an 11 should be able to figure that out; and yet, all Harry does is goof off and rely on luck to help him out of any and all life or death situation he inevitable finds himself in.

Yes, adults withhold information from him and people always complain that Dumbledore should have trained him personally, but Harry has never really shown himself to be a particularly mature person nor was he ever eager to learn or get extra training.

***** Harry learned the Patronus charm-a spell that is mentioned as being difficult for adult, fully trained wizards- when he was 13. The sorting hat even mentioned that he had a "good mind." Harry did remarkably well on his OWLs. He also learned quite a bit for the Triwizard Tournament (remember how hard he worked on getting better with Accio?) In his sixth year, he sucessfully cast Sectumsempra on his first try after simply reading the name of the spell. He didn't even know what the heck it was supposed to do, so you can't say it was a matter of 'intent.' In all of his classes up until that point, students were taught that spells took more than waving your wand and saying the right words, but he did just that and still pulled it off. The whole point of him teaching the DA was simply because he knew spells that no one else did (the same people who went to all of the same classes as him, and so should have been expected to know as much, if not more than him if he lacked the ability or drive to learn.)

He didn't ask about Death Eaters until the fourth book because no one mentioned them. It was "Voldemort and his followers" up until then. I can't really see how knowing what they called themselves would have helped him, honestly. Harry did ask questions about Voldemort after the events of the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore told him to not worry his little head over those things and sent him off to bed. Any time he /did/ show curiosity about anything, he was told to not worry about it.

I don't feel as if any of your examples show a lack of willingness to learn, he was told (by people he assumed he could trust) that he shouldn't worry himself over those things, and so he didn't.

I can't really get behind learning spells as evidence for intelligence. This extends to Hermione too btw.

Learning spells has just never come across as an intelligence based exercise. Unless of course we're defining intelligence differently.

It feels a lot more like learning an art than learning a science. (And the way I would typically define intelligence in general would be more science [logic] based than art).

I would never dispute the fact that Harry is good at magic, but I would certainly dispute that he's especially smart. He never does anything particularly smart to me.

******* It may be an argument that we have to agree to disagree with, because we seem to be interpreting the character in vastly different ways. I don't consider making poor choices a sign of lack of intelligence. Harry has poor decision making skills when left to his own devices, but like I said he got above average OWL scores (or I assumed they were above average based on the reactions other people had, JKR never really explained what was 'normal' with OWLs). Also, Harry was smart enough to not only know a bunch of spells that his classmates did not know (some of whom were older and had more schooling), but he was able to teach this bunch of rag-tag misfits. Being able to /do/ something is one thing, being able to explain and teach someone else how to do it implies a greater understanding of the skill.

I don't consider intelligence to be limited to learning science vs learning art. I think that overused quote "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” fits here. If you judge Harry's intelligence based on his weaknesses, then of course he comes up lacking. Harry blew grown wizards' minds when he told them that he was capable of a fully corporeal patronus. I assume that to mean that it wasn't something any old fool on the street could manage, much less at his age. I never bought into the fanon belief magical cores dictating what someone could do. I think it's about mental capacity and personal skill. Just like anyone with two working hands can "technically" perform brain surgery, but some people have a better mental capacity and innate skill, and those are the ones who end up as brain surgeons. Just because your brain surgeon can't also excel at nuclear physics as well does not make him unintelligent, it just means his skills lie elsewhere.

By that thinking, just because Harry isn't strong in one area doesn't mean he's not intelligent in others. Harry seems to understand defence in particular without even trying, and he's no slouch at transfiguration or charms, either. Hell, he's been shown to be just fine at potions if you simply give him decent instructions to follow and remove the dude who's constantly antagonising him. That to me translates as intelligence.

I think the thing that makes it difficult for me to agree with the general idea is the fact that learning spells is never explained as an exact science. People just kind of 'figure it out'. It's difficult for me to think of it as something that requires intelligence when we don't even know what learning a spell really entails and why some people would be bad at it.

As far as we see (and I can remember), learning spells is one part wandwork (which is just motor skills), and the other part is the incantation (and even that is later overruled by silent casting).

What is it that makes it impressive that he learns the Patronus? What does learning the Patronus even involve? When Harry learnt it, all Lupin did was tell him the incantation, and then tell him to visual a happy memory and focus on it really really hard.

That's all the lesson entailed. That means to be good at the Patronus, you have to be good at focusing on happy memories. Nothing about that really fits any normal definition of intelligence to me.

Ultimately I think it comes down to what being intelligent means. If we follow that quote you gave to the very letter then we could probably define almost every person as intelligent, because I'm sure there's /something/ in life that everyone will be well above average at doing. And at that point intelligence loses it's meaning.

If we're using the term generally, then what does it refer to? Booksmarts? Physical skills?

I don't know.

I found him a huge jerk who mistreats basically everyone else in the book. I mean, I know he's a teenager, and he's going through a lot, but as the books got progressively longer, I found myself getting more and more ticked off at him. The way he treats Cho after Cedric's death was terrible (and there's not a moment in which the story actually takes him to task for it), the way he treats Ginny is terrible in the sixth book (and, again, the story never actually challenges him about it), and so on and so forth. Actually, now that I think about it, more than I dislike Harry as a person, I dislike him as a character. If the series had actually tried to challenge/condemn Harry's bad attitude, maybe I would like him more, but as it is, it doesn't, and I don't.

(I've definitely read jerkier main characters than Harry, too, but I've found them much more sympathetic. This is probably more of a writing issue than anything else, though.)

** Voldemort. Most of my favorite fics are post-Voldemort's defeat, whether it's the canon Battle of Hogwarts or some other way. I just don't find that story very interesting.

** I would say more than anything I dislike the Marauders and Sirius Black in particular because of how they are justified in abusing Snape. The canon story does this to Sirius Black I find while fanfiction seems to vindicate the Marauders as a whole. I particularly hated how Rowling portrayed Harry as being bullied and then when he confronted Sirius about it I thought it was really brushed off as unimportant.

** Molly can be pretty overbearing, and I hate how presumptuous she is. Also I don't like Ron much, because he kept abandoning Harry over petty shit when he really needed help.

I absolutely loathe Snape. He took out his juvenile grudge against a dead man on his orphaned child. He even /saw/ Harry's abuse during the Occlumency lessons, and he thought it was /funny./ He's an absolute creep.

** Ron. And, frankly, Harry. He's just such a stupid jock in the books I never found him even remotely sympathetic.

** Lily Evans, Hermione Granger, and Dumbledore. There are so many Hermione fics and I keep on trying to read them, but I just can't get through them. She gets put on this ridiculous pedestal, same with Lily. Really I see them both as mean and judgmental. Snape was a jerk, but Lily was still a bad friend. My favorite Marauder fics are the ones where Lily is not included or she's replaced. And Dumbledore is just too meddling and manipulating.

*** What did Lily do to Snape to contribute to the fracture of their friendship? not indulge his desire to associate with and seek the approval of a group of students whose core beliefs were the oppression of Muggle-Borns like her? Forgive his use of a slur intended to denigrate her and remind her of her unequal position, and then tolerate his gradual slide into the Dark Arts for years more after that? Be willing to put out for him and indulge his obsession with him? If nothing else, Snape himself was clear that he bore primary fault for his deteriorating friendship with Lily when he gave Harry his memories, when he included a scene where Lily tried to warn Snape off some of his crueler friends.

***** I've seen it many places. I think authors just try their best to demean by referring to him by an innocuous name. I've always read it as being a bit juvenile, kind of like sticking one's tongue out. There are more intelligent ways to express dislike and disapproval.
