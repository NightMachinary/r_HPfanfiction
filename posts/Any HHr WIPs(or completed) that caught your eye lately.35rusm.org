I think I've read all the good, complete HHr fics that I could find on ffnet and I'm always on the lookout for incomplete ones. But since I've read through everything in my "keep in mind" folder I was hoping I missed some new stories or some hidden diamonds. Any recommendations will be appreciated. Bonus points for dark!harmony.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548714/1/Screams-Part-One][The Screams Series]] is technically unfinished as the most recent update is in progress. I hope cloneserpents chooses to finish it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap][Harry Potter And the Quantum Leap]] by seel'vor doesn't age all that well, but it's well worth a look if you like the H/Hr pairing.

I'd also humbly submit my own work in progress: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11104321/1/The-Magic-Words][The Magic Words]]. Shameless self-promotion FTW!

You mentioned that you had read most everything on ff.net so I was wondering if you'd also checked out [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=toplist][portkey]]. It has several excellent fics that I hope you enjoy reading.

*** Of course I am reading your fic! I think I got into from another of your "Shameless self-promotion"s so thank you for those. :D

I haven't really delved that much into portkey yet, ffnet seemed to be enough to feed my addiction - until now I guess, so maybe I should migrate. Thanks for the recommendations anyway!

** I'll stand behind a second rec for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11104321][The Magic Words]].

I recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655][Hogwarts Battle School]] as well. It doesn't exactly leap straight to a relationship, but that's because it's busy being awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10914042][Sympathetic Properties]] is in an interesting position. It has many risk factors for the standard manipulative Dumbledore storyline, but it keeps on being good anyway. The Granger family dynamic is a treat; be on the lookout for that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542][Patron]] is more than a little AU. It puts some distance between the cultures of Muggle Britain and the Wizarding world. Variations on the fourth-year tournament events.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718][The Hogwarts Strike Team]]. You might have been thinking this list wouldn't feature any time travel. Premise: Voldemort left a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch][dead man's switch]], time travel became necessary.

These are all relatively near the top of my alerts list, so they'll update before too long.

I know what you said about complete, but you might not have read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]. Or you might not think it has much H/Hr.

*** I just read A Little Child Shall Lead Them. I thought it was a rather enjoyable read too.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6780275/1/The-Last-Casualties][The Last Casualties]] by muggledad is a WIP, still about 31 long chapters for you to catch up on though
