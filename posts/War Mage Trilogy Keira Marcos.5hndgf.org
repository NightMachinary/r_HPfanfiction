I saw a rec for War Mage about a week ago. It took me to a webpage where I had to make an account. It said that It could take up to 48 hours to be approved, I still have not been approved and judging by some of the comments on the page it might never go through. I tried google for other archives, no luck. I had never heard of the story or writer before, and honestly I don't remember what page or group I saw the rec, is this story actually worth trying to gain access to it? I have been reading HP fanfiction for so long that it's rare for me to find a new story that isn't trash, it sounded interesting, so i'm a bit disappointed I can't read it.


** She got really pissed about the demanding and entitled attitudes of some people in the HP fandom, and announced she isn't writing any more HP for a while - though I did not hear that she was locking down her site to current membership.

But she's my fav author (it was probably my rec you saw) and I have all of her stuff as ebooks. I think it's well worth reading, even if there's only one book in the trilogy for now. It was still highly entertaining, and no cliffhanger.

*** I think it was you and someone else too, your comment in the purity thread was what sold me, even if i forgot exactly why I wanted to read the story after two days. I hate hearing stories like this where drama killed their drive to write.

**** Oh, she's writing, just not HP. SG:A, Sentinel, and NCIS to go by her recent challenge prompt stuff. She says she might go back to HP in 2018.

**** War Mage is, yes. Though there are only two explicit scenes.

**** I second this request. :) I've read a few of her stories before she locked down her website - I have an ebook copy of Tangled Destinies that I've read sooo many times, as well as a number of her SGA fics. But I haven't been able to get access to her site to read more fics :(

***** If you pm me with an email, I can send you any of her fics. Sorry, I didn't see your reply earlier.

** I signed up for an account and it took around 48 hours to come through, but it worked. I found her stories very easy to read, but some of the notes and comments written by her really put me off. Try using a different email address to create an account? My hotmail account didnt work, but my gmail one did.
