Hey guys! I am looking for Fanfics which are similar to "Unwanted Attractions" by "whitedwarf".

It can be similar in nature, a direct adaptation of there's any that the author authorized, or Fanfics that were inspired or whatever lol.

I came upon this fic last night and couldn't stop reading it as it was so good imo. Sadly, it seems to be abandoned and I got really into it and wanted to see if more fics like that exist.


** Since it is a pretty unknown fic, I think it would help if you describe what you are looking for. The "similar to" approach to a request only really works if you can assume that a lot of people on this sub know the fic you are talking about.

*** Sure! My bad lol.

Well, the fic is about Harry and an OC Female Slytherin who are rivals even worst than him and Malfoy are. One time, when they fight aboard the Hogwarts Express, they suddenly begin to feel an odd attraction to one another and pay attention to endearing things like eyes, face and etc.

They sent vehemently their growing attraction to one another especially as they are pushed together via school projects (Potions and such) until they can't handle it anymore.

They begin their relationship in secret while portraying the same hostile behavior to one another in public.

Harry basically forsake Ron and Hermione (who hate the OC very much and she them) for her, and after a certain event invites her to the Order HQ.

The OC (Female Slytherin) is from a Dark Pureblood House that didn't side with Voldemort despite their dark nature and tendencies. She is also the u disputable "Queen of Slytherin" as well.

The fanfic has a lot of depth and much more things that made it enjoyable but this is a rough summary of the important points. I don't know how helpful it'll be but I hope it is.

I also understand that many Harry x Daphne fanfics are like that but there's a certain appeal to it when it's an entirely new OC than a character whose only been mentioned once or twice in canon.

**** It would make very little difference if it was Harry/Daphne or Harry/OC. The OC in the fic is pretty much Daphne in Fanfiction community. If I take Elizabeth and replace with Daphne and take Edwards and replace it with Greengrass, it would literally make no difference in the story. I could not read this fic without thing of Daphne everytime Elizabeth is mentioned. The characterizations are the same.

Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to find Harry/OC where OC behaves like this fic, simply because most of those will fall under Harry/Daphne category.

Let me know if you find any such completed fics though. I would be interested even if I will probably be thinking of Daphne throughout. :D

***** You are right and I'll be a liar if I say I didn't think the same, but having Daphne jn that fic as a sort of Antagonist to Elizabeth and a threat to her place in Slytherin.

Let's be honest, in fics where it's Daphne in that place, Pansy and anyone else isn't a real threat to her standing in Slytherin.

I wouldn't mind if you recommend fics with Daphne instead of OC but that she'll keep the same charactistics that I described above.

**** Mhh, nothing much comes to mind if it has to be an OC, sorry. As you said, a lot of Daphne fics would roughly fit, but you seem to be aware of them already.

***** I'm aware of their existence, but if there are some that fit very nicely my description, I would love for you to recommend them.
