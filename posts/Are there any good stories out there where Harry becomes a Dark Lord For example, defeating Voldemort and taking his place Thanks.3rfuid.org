** I rather liked linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains]]), though his "darkness" is somewhat subjective. Pretty dark shade of gray, regardless.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

*** Thanks for the rec. I'll definitely check this one out. People whitewash Harry so much, it's refreshing to read stories where he acts more like an ordinary selfish asshole when he discovers power.

** linkffn(11131988) (Birth of A Nightmare Man) and linkffn(10182397) (The Nightmare Man) are both pretty good.

The first one starts out like your normal recovery from Azkaban fic with a side of bashing but gets way different. The second starts out as full-blown pants-on-head crazy murderous psycho. "Birth" is a bit of a prequel to "The." I'd recommend reading what's written of "Brith" first imo. It's pretty fun so far but it's not finished yet. "The" is finished though.

Edit: Also a good thing about the first one: George is a main character.

*** Great, thanks a lot for the recommendations. Some of the "dark" Harry fics I've read just have him stand up for himself. I want one where he seeks power for its own sake and wins. I enjoyed Too Young To Die, and I'm in the middle of The Dark's Rise (which I've heard mixed reviews of- my take so far is that it's a pretty cool story but the awful grammar is a big turnoff, but I really liked the unique element where [[/spoiler][Harry steals the Philosopher's Stone]] and the fact that the author made him 3 years older so that was a feasible accomplishment.

**** Another suggestion for some stories to read, the DLP forums have [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=14&daysprune=-1&order=desc&sort=views][a whole subforum]] devoted to Dark Harry fics.

Here's one of the highlights.

***** Thanks. I've read a few from that site but I was overwhelmed by how many there are so I figured I'd ask for more personal recommendations here.

** Warning: This fic is abandoned, not complete!

linkffn(4343191) doesn't quite fit the request, but it involves Harry travelling to a dimension where another version of Harry is the dark lord

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
