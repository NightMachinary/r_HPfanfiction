** I'll probably get it. Look at it this way you're not supporting her but the people who put so much time and energy into the game.

** I'm going to get it. Frankly, I think some of the stuff that she's said has been massively overblown. The place where she outlined her actual views in full (and not through a medium through which it is impossible to convey stuff) shows several things:

#+begin_quote
  I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman who's older than I am and wonderful. Although she's open about her past as a gay man, I've always found it hard to think of her as anything other than a woman, and I believe (and certainly hope) she's completely happy to have transitioned. Being older, though, she went through a long and rigorous process of evaluation, psychotherapy and staged transformation.

  I believe the majority of trans-identified people not only pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable for all the reasons I've outlined. Trans people need and deserve protection. Like women, they're most likely to be killed by sexual partners. Trans women who work in the sex industry, particularly trans women of colour, are at particular risk. Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know, I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who've been abused by men.

  because /of course/ trans rights are human rights and /of course/ trans lives matter
#+end_quote

She is not against trans people.

#+begin_quote
  A man who intends to have no surgery and take no hormones may now secure himself a Gender Recognition Certificate and be a woman in the sight of the law. Many people aren't aware of this.

  The fourth is where things start to get truly personal. I'm concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition and also about the increasing numbers who seem to be detransitioning (returning to their original sex), because they regret taking steps that have, in some cases, altered their bodies irrevocably, and taken away their fertility. Some say they decided to transition after realising they were same-sex attracted, and that transitioning was partly driven by homophobia, either in society or in their families.

  couldn't shut out those memories and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with womens and girls' safety.
#+end_quote

She is concerned with the possibility of predators, and the possibility that people are rushing into transitioning. She provides evidence to support her thoughts (the accuracy of which is questionable).

Let me be clear before someone considers me to be transphobic, that while I do agree with some of JKR's rationale and ideas and am sympathetic to her experience, */as a whole, I do not agree with her thinking and rationale. For example, she has clearly overblown the existence and risk of predators in female bathrooms/*. Do I understand why someone who has gone through sexual assault and domestic abuse might be swayed by unclear statistics on the manner? Yeah.

So JKR is coming from a place of good intentions. Her views have frankly been conveyed in a respectful manner on twitter and her website from what I've seen. Her latest book is a bit odd, but the trope of a cross-dressing killer (not even trans) is not exactly new and from what I hear, isn't even the killer (though I haven't read it).

So I am still going to get the game, because I'm unconvinced that JKR is a hateful person. And for those who won't, I'd like to point out a few things.

1. JKR is filthy rich.
2. JKR is (nominally at least) not directly involved with the game
3. Buying the game supports the developers far more than JKR

Disclaimers in advance: I have only read her tweets in a cursory manner, my only detailed reading of her beliefs have come from her website. If JKR has tweeted something that shows that she is against trans people, please share it with me.

** I mean I'm buying it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Edit: and people are gonna disagree with me here and that's fine but I don't think she said anything wrong and even if she was being derogatory or something, boycotting is dumb IMO. I'm gonna enjoy something regardless, doesn't matter if my views align with the person who wrote it or not

But that's just me

** I wanna see how this maybe controversial response gets. I believe everyone is entitled to their opinions and to share them. Depending on how someone has lived and in what they believe in people will react different to a 3rd party actions.

I won't buy it because I don't have the financial means to do so, If I had the money I would, just like I'm planning to re buy the books cause my old ones got damaged, and get my own personal set of dvds instead of the family ones, and I still dream to be able to visit the theme parks and so on...

And I do it because they represent something deep and personal for me and my childhood, they're special and the Harry Potter Universe for me is something that has grown beyond the author itself.

*** I agree that everyone should be able to express their opinions as well, but to an extent. JKR is actively spreading toxic and hateful speech, and as someone many people, especially children, look up to, she has a responsibility to use her platform for good. She has a responsibility to do good. I think some opinions, should not be expressed. JKR has definitely done good things, I will not deny it. But what she is doing is actively teaching the people that look up to her to be hateful towards an estimated 1.5 million people (in America alone) and especially right now, money is more powerful then words. I will stop supporting JK Rowling, because I cannot, in good conscience, support someone who tells people hateful things about people like my little sister.

** This has nothing to do with fanfiction. Did you mean to post in [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], or did you intentionally post in a less active sub just to get more attention?
