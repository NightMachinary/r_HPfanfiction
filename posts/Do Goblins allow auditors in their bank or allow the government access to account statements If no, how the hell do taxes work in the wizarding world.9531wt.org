*** I'm not one to argue with headcanons, but IIRC aren't taxes mentioned a few times? I can't recall specific instances but I seem to remember Arthur or Percy muttering about them at some point. Could just be fanfiction seeping into my brain, though.

**** I expect even if they aren't book-canon, if you asked Rowling she'd say there are taxes in the wizarding world. I don't remember the books enough to say myself, though, and all I can find is a movie-canon Gringotts advertisement which talks about a "Hexing Tax". Which looks from the advertisement to be basically a net worth tax, though I could be wrong.

*** They have a government whose employees are paid with money. That means they have some form of taxation.

Probably a large sales tax, something you would never even notice unless you owned or ran a business.

** It's entirely possible that Wizarding Britain doesn't have regular taxes the way we have them today, they're mostly a 19th century invention. There'll be customs and excise at the borders, duties payable on the sale of various goods and assorted transactions and a certain amount of government-owned assets that generate rents and similar incomes. The rest of it is done the old-fashioned way: you - as either the Minister or the governing cabal behind him - farm out the various licensing and enforcement offices to your cronies, and they squeeze the plebs for as much as they can get away with in fees and fines while giving you a suitable kickback.

There were bits of the English government still working that way as late as the Napoleonic Wars. A society that split off from us in the late 17th Century with no external pressure to evolve more efficient funding and governance, for Defence spending if nothing else? I could well see them keeping the old 'system' going, not least because it benefits rich, upper-class gobshites with generational wealth that lets them basically run the government as a part-time hobby - if you're rich, you can give your friends breaks on whatever they need, while soaking the commoners for all they're worth just to see the pitiful looks on their faces....

** Well, the wizards could be required to hand over statements from Gringotts themselves to document their wealth and income. Or the taxes are limited to value-added tax of sorts, or taxes on land and buildings. Alternatively, businesses could be paying for licenses instead of taxes - sort of like a poll tax for businesses. Which would also be a possible tax system for the wizards and witches- everyone pays the same amount, regardless of wealth or income.

** Why would a bank need to be involved with the taxes?

I expect the Revenue Authority would want Tax returns filed with proof of income; payslips and the like for individuals, and a record of sales for businesses for things like Value Added tax and financial statements for corporate tax.

The only thing the bank would possibly used for is to facilitate payments and refunds.

And a wizard/witch may not keep their gold at Gringotts. Not that it matters as discussed above

*** FYI, unless you're self-employed, you don't do a tax return in the UK. For employees, tax is collected at source by your employer on behalf of the Treasury. So you don't submit anything - not bank statements, not proof of income, etc.

Same in the UK, but for the vast majority of people it's pointless because they have nothing to claim. Pension contributions via salary sacrifice are already factored into the PAYE system and the NHS means no tax relief for medical insurance or anything like that. Occasionally you do randomly get a rebate cheque in the post that the Treasury has calculated for you though.

The reason I assumed Gringotts may be involved in the process is because things like this seem to be mostly on the honor system. We never see any of this in canon. You buy something? It's a cash transaction. You're being paid for something? Cash transaction. There's no paper trail.

With no paper trail, fraud becomes /extremely/ easy. You have absolutely no way to verify if a business is lying about how much they charge for goods (or, at the very least, how much they've made from selling those goods) nor how much they're paying their employees.

The only form of verification I could think of would be to directly audit or get account statements from the bank in which every Witch and Wizard seems to use - Gringotts.

** My headcanon is that the goblins are so insular, isolationist, and mistrustful of other races, especially the wizards, that they don't allow external auditors in to look at their books or their accounts. They have their own internal audit department that periodically tests controls over things like account balances and vault access. No one leaves the bank until their reconciliations balance to the knut and pity the goblin that allows a control to fail even once.
