** If it was a horcrux, there would be two dead students, not one.

*** Plus it was the overall usefulness of Nagini that made him consider a living horcrux. Making the basilisk into one just would have been out of character. Almost too sentimental. Lacks the grandeur of the objects, in a way. Basilisks can be made, but unique artifacts cannot be copied.

***** It wasn't about the sentiment of them being Founders objects, but that they were the only things he felt were special/grand enough to be worthy of holding his soul. Not sentiment, but arrogance.

******* I think the dairy was not a free choice but rather it just so happened that it was the most unique thing Tom had at the time when he made his first horcrux. The ring likewise: after ridding the world of his muggle father and his mother's family, was it not appropriate for him to take their most treasured and turn it into a horcrux? The first one might not have been purely out of arrogance, I agree, though I highly doubt /sentimentality/ of all things mattered at all; the latter one, well, I say that's purely arrogance.

** No. The count wouldn't work. Diary + Ring + Cup + Locket + Diadem + unknown planned object/Nagini + Voldemort himself = 7 part soul. Adding in the Basilisk would make an 8 part soul, which is less magically significant than either 7 or 3, and I assume 5 and 13. The way Voldemort behaves when he learns that he has lost horcruxes (as well as his appearance during the whole dead-Harry/Dumbledore conversation thing) leads me to assume that horcruxes cannot be replaced, that even when destroyed they still count as soul parts. Just dead ones.

Plus it is highly unlikely that he had a chance to turn the basilisk into a horcrux. Myrtle was used for the Diary, and it is unlikely that he ever had an opening to get back into the Chamber.

**** In Slughorn's memory he asks about a 7-part soul, so it is definitely about number of soul pieces (which is what a horcrux is).

***** Yeah, of course in canon that's what it means, but OP is asking if you could make it so he ment a 7 part soul as in 7 parts outside of the body, which doesn't seem like a farfetched premisse for a fic, does it?
