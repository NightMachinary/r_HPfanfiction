The premise is basically harry as a very in control individual. The chapters vary from umbridge's POV in one of the earlier chapters to Ron where he vows to follow harry. Every chapter is a different characters POV. It was quite good not completed. I left it when Dumbledore's POV against Grindelwald was just written. Please help me find it.


** Found it. It's called renegade by 1991kira. Unfortunately it has not been updated for quite a while now. It's still quite good.
