Just started reading Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse...oh dear goodness I have /never/ read a more pretentious character. Like he gets on the train and lectures Ron about how he doesn't care about sports because books and knowledge is more important than such trivial matters and anyway he can work out in his own time with his familiar so there's not even that benefit...I swear the author must have never even met a child...


** 95% of characterisations of Harry are shite

Although, as we learned last month, Rowling doesn't seem to know Harry that well anymore either.

**** It's because 45% of Fanfics feature Harry as a self insert character, which is what you see in harem fics, MoR and superHarry fics. The other 45% belongs to the "If Harry had done this" genre of fics, featuring a Harry with a very dry personality and a brain that belongs to someone 30 years older than him.

And then the other 5% belongs to people who simply can't write.

****** What's wrong with it is that it was written not by Madame Rowling but rather by someone else, some things shown in it (the time turner mechanics, for example) violate things Madame Rowling herself had said about how they work (meaning that, if she aspires to competence, those things cannot possibly be canon, and thus neither can the story), the characters from the original generation are in at least some cases flanderised to the point where it becomes just sad, and Madame Rowling declaring that it is canon (which, by now you should be aware, is either a sign of incompetence or a logic bomb, and I really wish for it to be the latter) is the cherry on top.

So, basically, it's a not-so-well written fanfic declared canon ... only the writer of the story supposedly isn't a fan which would take it further into being a “not-so-well written not-fan-fanfic declared canon”. As you can see that's just a headache waiting to happen.

Admittedly, I never really had a chance to see the play because of it being locked to a particular area, so if the play itself is enjoyable then I will not say that people cannot enjoy it. But as far as the structural integrity of the world created by Madame Rowling goes, this story is a foundation made of styrofoam and painted rocky grey.

** I've read plenty of stuff where Harry is Harry in name only, usually because the authors want to play with the worldbuilding more than they want to play with Harry the character. I don't mind because I'm more interested in the plot and Wizarding worldbuilding than in JKR's characterizations to begin with.

Harry's an Everyman character in a lot of ways so I can see how folks would get bored of him. A big theme of the canon is everyday heroism so it works for JKR but fanfic authors frequently focus on different themes and so an Everyman MC can be limiting to the story they want to tell.

*** The huge problem with people who complain about OOC is that they don't take into the time differences and the changes in the universe. I had two people complaining about Harry being OOC in both Darkness Ascendant and A Trek to the Stars.

In both stories, Harry's not canon!Harry. In DA, Harry's had a year of memories of 'himself' hurting others to get information, beating people, using magic to get his way(the dreams were of previous Wielders of the Darkness using it) and obviously this Harry is a slightly traumatized by more than the abuse of the Dursleys but he also has his grandfather's ghost, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, a couple original characters to help guide him in the year before be begins school at hogwarts. OF COURSE he's not canon!Harry. He has people who care about him instead of a distant 'grandfather/mentor' who has too much on his plate to actually mentor him.

And in A Trek to the Stars he's 386+ years old. He's spent three centuries trapped on a barren rock, reading, practicing his magic, studying the various philosophers Hermione always wanted him to read. He's basically a renaissance man by then. OF COURSE he's not Canon!Harry.

I hate whiny bitches who want Harry to always act like the seventeen year old Child Soldier that he was. The people that want that story? They need to go read Ender's Game but they shouldn't read Children of the Mind or Xenophobe or any of the rest of the Ender Series or the Shadow series because that Child Soldier grew up and became a priest essentially.

Authors can still be criticised for the choices they make about the story direction even if that direction is logical within the story universe. Because of course the author determined the parameters of that story universe and thus what is logical within it.

People complaining that Harry is OOC in your story are essentially complaining that you chose to set up a universe that made him OOC.

Honestly, the characterisation is /so/ shite! I even wonder why JKR agreed to using /that/ as canon material!

I paid around ₹800 ($7?) for that, and I hate myself for it. The sample didn't contain any Harry characterisation, but the moment the author indicated that Harry didn't know how to be a parent because he never had parents growing up had me throwing my phone in frustration...

That said, speaking about more traditional fan fiction, any lets-go-back-in-time-and-do-things-the-right-way-this-time-around all have bad characterisations of Harry. Especially the ones where they bash the Weasleys... Honestly, it's like they have /no/ idea how kids behave. Even if it were 14 y.o.'s writing the fictions, all they have to do is put themselves in the shoes of their character and just /imagine/...

I think it's more about inability to understand that just because someone says something does not automatically make it true.
