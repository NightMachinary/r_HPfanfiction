****** For what it's worth, I would imagine anyone who was familiar with Batman and The Joker to get what was meant by the pies in general.

As for the last line, one of the Joker's signature "tools" is a deadly joy-buzzer, rather like one of those gags you hold in your hand that give a little buzz to someone when shaking hands, only the Joker's version can incapacitate or even kill someone with a handshake.

The last line is a bait-and-switch. The Joker called to mind the joy buzzer deliberately, but instead of the handshake being a deadly prank, it was just some white paint.

  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.

** Linkao3(a dangerous alliance)

Link added as the bot seems to be down.

The general concept is Tom's diary decides to offer Harry a truce rather than fighting. The chapters are generally short and I'm working on developing the desired tone of the piece. There's a big focus on keeping character motivations hidden.
