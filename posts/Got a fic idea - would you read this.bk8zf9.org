** There are already many fics with very similar premise written.

In fact, I hate that in almost every Hermione time travel to 1930/40s, she ends up raising or shagging him. How about something more refreshing like her successfully KILLING Tom, but then Grindelwald winning too? I'm pretty sure this idea had NEVER been attempted before.

*** I've read a short fic in which she killed him, but it didn't explore the results. Edit: it was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9400342/1/Murder-Splits-the-Soul][this one]].

** Tom was never driven mad /because/ he created Horcruxes; it just altered his appearance. He was mad before then. Also, like [[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]] said, Hermione accidentally getting thrown back in time via a Time Turner has been done countless times. It's pretty much the go-to for Tom/Hermione authors. And why would a randomly-falling Time Turner send Hermione back to 1942? Why not 1900? 1858? 1774? 1635? There's no indication a falling Time Turner would send Hermione back specifically to a set year because Time Turners don't work like that.

To answer your question, though, I'd only read Tom/Hermione stories that involved a more original-type plot, as while I'm somewhat a fan of the pairing, it's not my favorite. However, you should write what you want to read. Others who like and read what you write is an added bonus.

** Definitely not my pairing, and would close-box it if I accidentally clicked on it. That said, do a good job writing the characters, and you can sell most things. You'll definitely have to give Riddle more redeeming character traits than "too brilliant to waste", and you'll need to actually deal with the legitimate issues inherent in Voldemort's character, namely that by that point he had already been researching dark magic, and had been able to focus his magic to torture people.

As for the immortality through alchemy thing, why the deadline of a year? Sure Riddle is well aware of his own mortality, having lived through the blitz, buy why is he on a timetable?

Furthermore, it seems like alchemy gives agelessness, whereas Horocruxes give the ability to effectively respawn. That's two different levels of protection. Why wouldn't Riddle say "why not both?" if offered a good chance of getting access to both.

These aren't to say the idea is bad, per se. I've loved fics with worse premises. You just have to address these, and other issues, in order to overcome them.

Edit: Other legitimate concern. You'll need to sell the shift to too brilliant to waste. Expect that you will face the opposition of "Voldemort is too brilliant and charismatic to trust with his lack of empathy."

** Personally not my cup of tea, which doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad idea. I do feel like I've encountered very similar plots before, so you definitely would have to be careful about what you do once Hermione gets sent back in time.

** Ideas . . . are just ideas.

If you write it well, that's what matters.
