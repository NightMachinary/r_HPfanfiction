** Could work as crack fic.

For a more serious take, I can imagine a situation developing where it becomes something of an "open secret" that most people know but don't talk much about, as modern surveilance technology and rising population leads to more and more Statute of Secrecy breaches that go uncovered.

It would be sort of like the later seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel, where there's no big "reveal", but everyone seems to basically know that magic is real, even if they don't talk about it much. Couple of examples:

In Buffy season seven, a vampire gets staked in the middle of a crowded bar. Afterward, a musician who was visiting from out of town can be heard casually saying that they hate playing vampire towns.

In Angel season five, there's a brief mention that the District Attorney in LA has been hiring mages to keep the series' big bad (a demonic law firm) from using magic to tamper with witnesses.

So yeah. No big reveal, no public declaration that Magic Is Real. Just something that most people don't like to talk openly about but which is increasingly impossible to ignore, with the savier Muggles quietly taking precautions to deal with it if they encounter it.

  From a tumblr post by accio-shitpost: "i wanna see a muggle who goes stealth among wizards purely by having a ridiculous aesthetic." Zinnia, a bisexual Australian nurse, moves into the home of late Great Aunt who lived near the Weasleys shortly after the events of the Battle of Hogwarts. Molly Weasley decides to be a good neighbour to the new "witch" in town. That's how it starts.
