I'm interested whether there are any stories where Riddle is the protagonist, but doesn't go down the same path as canon-Voldemort?

Where he maybe makes horcruxes, but doesn't become a psychopathic dark lord with the single ambition to commit genocide? A story where he shows how he fools the pureblood elite and slytherin politics to become a powerful individual, without risking everything by trying to kill half the population? Where he maybe just teaches DADA, annoyed by a meddling headmaster always looking over his shoulder, just because he can't see the advantages of grey or even dark magic?

Anything like that? (And preferably not only as backstory to justify him shagging Harry)


** The stories are sorted by their relevance and how strongly I recommend them.

1. /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]]/ (W: 183,000; abandoned) --- A (unfortunately abandoned) story with quality writing, complex and well-developed characters, and storyline that's based on nuanced and well thought out background;
2. /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]]/ (W: 409,057; WiP) --- This one, in general, is not as good as tWGM, but the character of T.M.R. fits your requested traits well enough to make me put it under â„–2. Some [[/s][trigger warnings]] apply;
3. /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/Rectifier][Rectifier]] (W: 76,878; Abandoned)/ --- a shorter read about a T.M.R. who gets Dorothy'ed into an AU and has to fight against his crazied alter;
4. /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][LV & the Intricate Plots]]/ (W: 110,202; abandoned) --- an experimental writing about a Voldemort who, himself, likes to experiment.

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/99/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HP & MoR]]/ --- if you consider it abandoned somewhere around chapter 50, it fits your request. Somewhat.
- Also /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]/ (W: 1,253,480; WiP), I think? Haven't read it myself, but many have recommended this story.

**** Not officially, no. It's just that --- for me, if a story doesn't get updated more than in a year, it's easier to consider it abandoned.

  [Apr 10, 2013] On Hiatus:Beginning April 28, this story will be on a 3-4 month hiatus. I love working on it and interacting with everyone here and pinky swear I'll return (with bells on). I'm self-employed and recently took on several major projects that will be consuming all of my work time, my free time, my walking the dog time, basically any spare minute I would've once devoted to things I enjoy but don't get paid to do. I hope ya'll have a wonderful summer. See you on the other
