They could be supporting characters alright, but the focus should be on Bill and Fleur's children, or other Weasley children, or Luna's sons, or any child that Neville and Hanna might have had. I like Bill and Fleur's household a lot so it would be nice if they are a large part of the story. Style preferably humorous and/or wholesome. No heavy angst and/or trauma. Thank you in advance for any recommendations.


** I'm a big fan of The Divide by Beedle. It's focused on a muggleborn and her non-magical twin sister, but there are some canon-characters' kids on the side. Definitely humorous and wholesome. Also an interesting exploration of the magical world.

** Inverarity, one of the best pure writers in the fandom, might be the master of this genre. *Hogwarts Houses Divided* is what you'll want to start with; it's set in 2009, during Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts, and revolves around him and his friends. It's very wholesome; there's a bit of a mystery plot to it, but it's very much kids being kids, reminiscent of PS. You might also like his *Alexandra Quick* series, but that doesn't have canon characters in it, is a little darker, and is set entirely in the States.

*Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake* is a hidden gem of the fandom that I can't recommend enough, set around 2005 or so and featuring a Muggleborn in Slytherin. Can't remember how much canon characters' children are involved, but the canon characters are there. Again, kids being kids, very English and well written.

*The Belmont Legacy* takes place during a similar time, between war and epilogue, and is very close to canon.

Try *The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins*, but it might be a bit dark for you. I wouldn't call it angsty but it's definitely not as lighthearted as the previous two. Starts out a bit rough but the end is great, and the six chapters of the sequel are some of the best fanfiction I've read.

I second the recommendation of *The Divide*, it's really a charming read. Like it a lot and hope it will keep updating.

*Nimbus Albacore and the Curse of Blood* features Argus Filch's nephew as the protagonist and is quite good. *Hide My Name With Fear* is similar. Both take place circa 2040 or 2050, quite a bit after mainstream next-gen stuff. Both are a bit darker, try them out though.
