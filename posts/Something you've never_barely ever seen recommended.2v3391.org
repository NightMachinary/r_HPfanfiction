I've read most of the recommended ones here, so something different would be nice! Preferably Harry-centric and relatively long!

** Seven Deadly Drabbles by kmfrank, in particular [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900724/2/Seven-Deadly-Drabbles][The Order of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] (chapter 2). This whole thing only has only 15 reviews, so it should qualify as less-known. Unfortunately, it's only a one-shot, but it's a good 14k words.

** Murder Most Horrid is a B/Hr AU fic of 50+ chapters but only involves Harry as a secondary character. On mobile so I can't link it atm, but I think I've seen it recommended once other than me.

** These two stories I usually don't not because they're not amazing, but because they're too damn old:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2219937/1/Take-My-Heart-Away][Take My Heart Away]] Hermione time travel story, all the way back to Riddle's Hogwarts years.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1646940/1/Learn-from-History][Learn from History]] Also its longer and more interesting sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2044600/1/Friend-or-Foe][Friend or Foe]]

** I'm on mobile, so I'm hard-pressed to link anything, but two fics come to mind that I don't see recommended often.

The first is Prince of the Dark Kingdom. Spelling errors aside, this world is actually pretty deep, and unique. Just brace yourself for the first few chapters, as you can tell that the author was just starting out writing. (It gets better as the story goes on.) It's a story about the world if Voldemort had won the war, and Harrys parents had never done any 'thrice defying'.

My second favorite obscure fic, is a little... strange, but actually pretty entertaining. It's called Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them. Harry Potter gets abandoned by the Dursleys at a park, and comes to the conclusion that he's some sort of magical creature.

** If we knew of such fics, we would have already recommended them. It's not like we're holding back a secret stash of amazing fics.

*** Alright, maybe I should rephrase. Something which isn't a 'classic' on this sub, basically :D yknow, like Alexandra Quick, HPMOR, etc.

** I've listed [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2rsham/the_50_hp_fanfics_challenge_of_2015/cniye5u][these]] before, some of them are commonly rec'ed, others I haven't seen on this subreddit. They're all long and complete, although not always Harry-centric.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3553046/1/Spellcaster][Spellcaster]] & [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker][Oathbreaker]] most definitely. They each have a number of favorites and about 800 reviews but I never see them here even though they include decently popular pairings (hgss and hpdm respectively).
