** Don't forget that Voldemort is evil and have it included in the fic. Too many people whitewash his personality and secondly, Harry should have finished schooling as the age-gap between the duo is substantial and I dislike reading teen romances. Don't whitewash the Death Eaters or justify their cause and you're good.
