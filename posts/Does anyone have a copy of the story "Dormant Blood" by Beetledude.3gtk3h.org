Does anyone have a copy of the recently deleted story, "Dormant Blood," by the author "Beetledude". I recently checked fanfiction.net and found it was deleted. It's was a decent Harry/Fleur story and I'm sad that is it now gone. Thank you all for your help! Here is some relevant info:

Dormant Blood by Beetledude. Some things are taken at face value; vampires feeding off of blood, werewolves turning at full moon and veela only being female. However, everything isn't set in stone, and people can turn out different than they're expected to.

Rated M for future content 2011-01-19 In-Progress - M - Romance/Adventure - Harry P., Fleur D. - 104,660 words - 6 chapters - 351 reviews - 1,328 favorites - 1,436 follows

In general, [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/][this]] has a ffnet fic converter along with an archive where you can find any stories as long as they have been converted once.

Credit goes to the maker of the site, and the user who suggested the use of the archive on the 'FFnet is down' thread.

  Hi, i tried to download the link but it says that the contents cannot be downloaded because the contents are missing or invalid. Could you perhaps paste a new link of the story? Perhaps a MS Word version?

**** I don't have a different version. Just tested the link myself, and it works fine. You could try a different browser if, for some reason it is still not working for you.

Alternatively, you could open my second link and search the fic yourself from the site's archive (second tab on top of the page).
