I have read a small amount of fanfics (less than ten) which have had a sad ending or one that has left the protagonist in a state of despondency. I have also read a few where nothing has gone right, Too Young to Die is a decent example.

I don't want to write a novel as the post, so I'll just see what people have to say. :)

I haven't really seen a thread like this before, so I thought I'd make one.


** I'd really just prefer a story with /an/ ending. But in any case, happy or sad are both fine as long as they fit the story.

**** Definitely agreed. It's best when an ending is appropriate for the story's theme. Still, I find it rather unrealistic when everybody has a perfect happy ending. Especially in HP, where there often is a war happening. Because of the overabundance of wish fulfillment stories/endings, I often find bittersweet or tragedies much more refreshing and enjoyable.

**** I also heavily favor happy endings over sad endings. I enjoy a sad one here or there, but I don't like being sad (surprise). So if a story is going to make me sad, it has to really win me over for me to want to stay around- and not yank the rug out from under me with the ending.

Edit: More important is of course tying up loose ends, my favorite endings just leave me with a sense of satisfaction rather than feeling happy for the way things turned out.

** I like endings that fit the themes of the story. If a fluffy romance fic suddenly pulls a downer ending, it's likely to turn off the readers. On the other hand, if the author is going full grimdark and at the end everyone enjoys sunshine, rainbows and cotton candy clouds, it makes for a jarring conclusion.

** Happy endings. I read fanfic to smile and have an escape from reality. If I want something realistic, surprising, or challenging, I'll read an actual novel. Yes, I realize this sells the creativity of a lot of fanfic authors short. But these days, when Kindle Direct Publishing is a thing, I wish a lot of really good fanfic authors would just self publish an original work. Back in 2000, when self publishing was hard, I felt differently; back then, fanfic was the only place to read original work that the mainstream wouldn't enjoy.

**** Oddly, even though it's escapism for me, I'm OK with authorial preaching, so long as it's up beat. Like, in one fic I read, the author let's one character spend two chapters explaining the author's political views. Most reviews hated it, but I was fine with it. It was interesting and well written, even if it contributed nothing to the plot. I would have been upset if it was a published book, but I'm OK with stuff like that in fanfic, even though I can't quite say why.

** I feel like truly happy endings both never happen in real life and are trite as fuck in novels. Coincidentally similarly, grimdark endings are generally the brainchild of edgelords who get on their soapbox and continuously preach about how realistic it is.

I'd say, as a writer, that the best ending is somewhere in between, not fully happy, but not fully sad either, because that's the way life actually is.

But, as a reader, I'd argue neither. Ultimately, whether a story has a happy or sad ending is tangential to me: I'd rather read a story with an ending that feels true to the characters, makes sense narratively, and is memorable, than one that ends perfectly or a full-blown tragedy.

** Sad endings are hard to do. Few author's are good enough to write 'angst' without it becoming exhausting, even JK largely confined it to book 5, to be replaced in book 6 by yearning and obsession.

So that leaves stories that nose dive somewhere around the 80% mark, whether they've earned it or not.

As a writer you should really look at Victory as a synonym for 'Surviving'. In cannon Harry won the war, sure, but it was bitter sweet. JK made sure you knew that people were dying and families were being torn apart. All victories have a cost, that's what gives them weight and meaning.

That said, catharsis is a hell of a drug, so if you want to write a story were the power he knows not is Harry gettin' it on with twenty odd girls, more power to you!

*** Hm, you've given me a fair amount to think about, actually. I know a lot disliked OotP because of the angst in it.

What about if you, as a writer, want your readers to properly experience the sadness of the ending of the book. I can see no better way to stop the hope of a future release by killing the main character.

#+end_quote

It's a limitation of the perspective of cannon. JK wrote in limited third person. While you're not getting a direct stream of Harry's thoughts, we only ever leave Harry for two chapters. If trying to stay true to the style, the book would end the moment Harry truly dies because the lens with which you view the world is gone.

From there you can go in two main directions, either jump ship to another character, which after so many chapters with Harry would be quite jarring or going on a metaphysically journey of transcendence à la "Enter The Void" by Gaspar Noé.

Either way the there is a rather radical change in style. GRR Martin gets around this by writing from multiple perspectives all the time.

My preferred method would be to copy the [[https://youtu.be/3difXqlpwVc?t=201][last episode of Six Feet Under.]] Harry shows up at the death of each of the people he cares about, to, dare I say it, great them as an old friend. You get to murder you entire cast, back to back, and show the world evolving and coping with Harry's death. Imagine a 150 year old Hermione, decorated with every award possible, the most beloved Minister of all time etc etc, lying on her death bed surrounded by family, the last of ministry six, still wondering if she had tried just a little bit harder or been just a fraction cleverer could she have saved Harry, only to see Harry, young and smiling, calling her over to the other side.

** Err on the side of happiness. As fan fiction goes, the Harry Potter series is not one whose tone or themes lend themselves to Grimdark or bad endings. Many fanfics stray so far from canon in trying for the "shocking!" or the "realistic" dark turns and endings that you wonder if it was frankly better off as a original story.

** Bittersweet endings are the best, imo, like the ending of LotR. The heroes succeed, but then the Elves (as well as some of the Hobbits) leave Middle-Earth forever, and those who stay are doomed to die (including Arwen). Or the ending of the Bartimaeus trilogy, where [[/spoiler][he dies in order to save the city]]. It feels more profound if victory has a cost, or is still a little flawed. 'Happily ever after' just doesn't satisfy me.

As most of my reading is extremely long stories, for those I prefer happy or neutral endings. The only real exceptions being the end of the war (which to me isn't a happy ending) or Halloween 1981.

But I /love/ a good and awful tragedy or angst ridden one shot or short story. Something that will make me /feel/. For those, sad or tragic endings are perfectly fine and encouraged.

I do not like happy endings where everything is ez once Harry has the elder wand, finds out he's Merlin's son, and has a 14 inch cock finely tuned for veela pleasure (looking at you Robst).\\
Or, sad endings where Harry is all angsty and woe-is-me throughout the story and finally sacrifices himself and everyone suddenly realises The Error Of Their Ways.

Fuck those.

There has to be true trial for a happy ending to be worth it, or a metric fuck ton of chaos, like Shezza's Resistance of Azkaban, .

** I like endings that are mostly happy, because I want to be reminded the world is not capricious and evil. (Even if it is). But they should also be at least a little bit discordant, or sad, or incomplete. It's very unfulfilling to have a totally perfect or completely tragic ending.

I think looking at a lot of great endings shows this. Even in some of the most tragic stories of all time, like Romeo and Juliet, there is still hope and healing and the promise of a better future. Similarly, really great happy endings come with loss or a cost.
