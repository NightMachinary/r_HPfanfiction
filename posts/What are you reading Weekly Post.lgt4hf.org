** I just finished A wand for Skitter. After the end of Worm (Parahumans), a very psycho version of the MC get isekai'd into the body of a 11 years old mudblood. And get sorted into Slytherin. She's not afraid to retaliate and escalation is guaranteed. Fantasy revenge of the highest quality.

Reading Worm is not necessary, all you need to know is that the MC control bugs and is a tactical genius. But you gonna get all plot points spoiled and Worm is too good and would be a waste to get it spoiled.

** I am reading *Hold the Line* Link: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347]]).

This is an AU about Minerva McGonagall and Tom Riddle from their days at Hogwarts to the end of the war. They are brilliant but they struggle with life. Their not-friendship is believable and done well. A beautiful bittersweet story with morally ambiguous characters, in dreamy prose. I really loved how they write 'magic' and make it a central part of the story. The Hogwarts Castle is a character in its own right in this one.

I actually read this fic while it was being posted last week. Now I am on reread stage because I really love it.

​

the dialogue reads strangely, like a fairy tale where the characters don't speak for themselves but rather speak as the story, directed to the reader in a strange style that invokes itself over and over. It, along with the way the story itself is written, gives a lilt to the experience which is bereft in most modern stories.

** This past couple of weeks I've been steadily working my way through the Pureblood Pretense series. Being (literally) one of the most recommended series on the subreddit, I doubt it needs introduction. linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter). Rating T.

I've seen the series recommended quite a bit, but I've always sort of overlooked it. "Oh, fem!harry pretends to be a boy. How fascinating... not." ... I don't know. It just didn't jump out at me as something I needed to check out. It didn't appeal at all. I finally picked it up when I went looking for specialist!harry's and heard about the potions obsession. I figured, why not.

Boy was I surprised.

The series is refreshingly AU, well written and absolutely compelling. I love the characters and I can't wait for the beginning of the next entry in the series. Especially after Futile Facade's ending!

*** I had the same first impression! Do you think it's because Harriett sounds like an ordinary name?

I was surprised by just how original the story is. It doesn't feel like an altered version of canon; it feels like it started as its own story, albeit in a somewhat similar world, and just (cleverly) incorporated a number of canon events.

But it still has a lot of what makes canon great. The Weasley Twins are superb, the classes really bring magic to life, the struggle against Tom Riddle is very real (and even though he's not a proper terrorist, it still regularly becomes life-threatening), and Harry has enough strengths to make her a genuinely interesting hero, IMO more so than the everyman canon Harry, while also struggling with flaws and mistakes that definitely keep her grounded.

She has loyal friends and a loving family, but she's lying to them (except Archie, who's in another country). She's magically powerful and talented, but that's drawing too much attention from people like Riddle who want to control or manipulate her or outright steal her magic. She impresses Professor Snape, but that means he knows "Rigel" well enough that he might be the one to see through the Ruse.

It's a great story.

**** Many - most, even - stories stick closely to canon. Even when they change a lot, they still loosely follow the same plotline, hit the same notes. Pureblood Pretense manages to incorporate some canon events, in a way, but largely follows its own plotline full of totally new events, character interactions and a lot of focus on characters that don't get nearly as much attention in canon. It's really a breath of fresh air in that regard, yeah.

The lies, different stories, and pieces of the puzzle she gives people in her life, except Archie, make for really fascinating interactions when different parts of her life bump together. Especially when people want to see her and Archie together in the same place! It always seems like they're one small slip from catastrophe.

It's also great that their ruse isn't the /only/ focus of the story. It's central to it, but so much else is going on and one thing after another demands her attention.

Adrian accidently turned Lutain into a Horcrux because Adalonda is a bitch. Adrian is also dying from a parasite. Meanwhile Sky took Horcrux Lutain and formed some sort of bond (I assume Horcruxy bond like the Locket) so he was able to see into Adrian's head and got to learn more about him so they still don't like eachother but they know their brother's and Sky is very sad about it. So now, there's going to be some big fight I think in Hogwarts where people are going to try kill Adalonda and Voldemort and everyone else and I don't know how it's going to end tbh but I'm excited!

** I just read the new chapter of The Labyrinth linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14827502/chapters/34314464]]) and I'm confused. I've been enjoying this whole series, with its fabulously intricate plot. All the characters have their own agendas, which sometimes put them in conflict with, and sometimes ally them with, every other character. Supposed good guys are working against each other as they vie for power. Even Sirius and Umbridge are working together at one point.

But this latest chapter makes me think I need to reread it to try to make sense of it. There's the mystery of what Peter's plotting, and it seems in this chapter like Harry is actually cooperating with Peter's scheme, although I hope there's a different explanation for Harry's behavior.

** Currently reading two ongoing fanfics:

linkffn(11574569) is a WBWL story that, if described, would probably sound like a fountain of cliches, but the author manages to make it work. It's pretty well written, and a lot of throught is put into the world's magical system. The MC is powerful, but also has some weaknesses, and does not always win. Pretty fun read overall.

linkffn(13721427) is a story where young Tom Riddle is accepted to Hogwarts as a teacher. It's geniunely well written and funny, but, for some reason, I find myself liking it less and less lately. Maybe it's because it feels like Tom almost never gets to achieve anything, which doesn't really fit my image of the character.

*** I'm reading Bad Education as well and enjoying it. The character of Tom Riddle reminds me a lot of the ( Harry Potter Horcrux) one in Seventh Horcrux, because Tom is easily bewildered by and manipulated by everyone around him, despite his best efforts to get some evil done. I love the teachers' attitudes to the students in this - like many of the teachers I know, they view the students as a hostile force to be managed and endured.

** The Life Unlived by sshg316 was a happy find this evening and definitely one I'd recommend. Hermione stays with Luna following Ron's request for a divorce and, to keep her mind off the grief, Luna asks her to help catalogue Snape's possessions for an upcoming war exhibition. She places a spell on a magical item to try to identify it and is thrust into a possible future where she falls in love with Snape 14 yrs after the war ends. When she awakes, she discovers she didn't spend a lifetime with him, it was an advanced charm that gives one insight into a possible future. Now she just needs to convince him that it's possible. The author nailed the characterisations and made a very poignant story that is incredibly rich considering it is only 48k long. Loved it. Unsure how to link it sorry, found on ffnet.

** Love and Other Historical Accidents

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21496525]]

I don't know what made me click it really, I'm not a Dramione shipper AT ALL. But I'm pretty glad I did. I read the first few chapters ages ago then lost track of the fic and couldn't remember the title. Just started reading again and I'm enjoying it just as much. The sarcasm and insults are dialled up to 11 and I'm loving it! Flirty sarcastic dialogue is absolutely my favourite thing to write, it's so fun when I find a story that has that same vibe. It's rated M so I can see where it's heading, but the build up is so much fun that I'm willing to hold on for the ride. One thing I really appreciate is that even though Hermione and Ron's relationship has come to an end, there's no bashing, not even from Draco really.

I'm part way through Chapter 5 right now.

That, and I think I'm going to reread linkffn(Eyes Wide Shut by greenphantomme) when I have the time. Rating: T

The 2nd is SUCH A GOOD FANFIC!! So well-written! I actually posted a recommendation if you want to read it. And I'm on the 32nd Chapter of October. It's very well-written, as are all of The Carnivorous Muffin's works.

Oh and also linkff(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) updated, as well as linkffn(When Harry Met Tom by The Carnivorous Muffin). The first is just so well-written and you'll never know where the story will take you! As for "When Harry Met Tom", that is a HILAROUS fic. If you want something funny, well-written, and a good storyline, then you should read it AND "Lily...".

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

** I've been reading linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11995576]]). It's not actually 750k words, rather a very big collection of oneshots. Bite sized mindless fluff, very well written, very entertaining. A bit smuttier than what I usually read, but I'm enjoying it a lot so far.

  Will they or won't they? Oh, they will. Fluff for when you need it. Romantic short stories, multiple pairings, mostly Dramione but some by request. Includes Bachelorette, Reunion, and The Real World: Hogwarts series.

** I finished /Lady Archimedes/ and Hermione's character has grown on me. I'm going to read the sequel. I almost gave up on reading the sequel after I finished /The Arithmancer/, but I'm glad I actually read it. It was pretty greata nd I liked how the author incorporated rituals.

*** Cloudflare's been funky recently. It's not you, it's just that FFnet is a bit of a moving target at the moment for all the programs out there. I personally use FanficFare, which seems to work like half the time, but it integrates really well with Calibre.

In the past ffdl's served me pretty well, so that might be worth looking into.

#+begin_quote
  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

**** They didn't answer but I'm reading New Blood too so I will: I love how it keeps you on your toes! I still can't decide whether the idea of ‘New Blood' is real or if Hermione totally made it up. Every time I think I've figured it out the author will drop a hint in the other direction. It's also not one of those “Hermione goes to Slytherin and they all love her” cliché unrealistic tropey fics, which is another point in its favour. Final good point goes to the Hermione Luna friendship. 5/5.
