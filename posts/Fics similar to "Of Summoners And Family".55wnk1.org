Basically I want a fic similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2408345/1/Of-Summoners-and-Family][this]] in the sense that he is a type of wizard that is different from normal wizards, but he also has to explore and learn his magic.

Over 70k+ words please!

those are all of the ones that I could think of at this time or find links to on my phone and favorites. Some of them are old and will not be finished any time that I am aware of but damn if they aren't some finely written stories. Others are ongoing with some odd sporadic updates. Hope to see more people add stories that I am not yet aware.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
