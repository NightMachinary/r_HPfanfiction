I'm looking for a story with a powerful Harry, (magically that is, not politically) who almost doesn't know he's powerful, as if its second nature, does this kind of story exist?


** linkffn(Harry potter and the summer of change by lorddwar) has Harry being very powerful but still learning to harness it. But I can paraphrase the story and say that he "was never told the limitations of magic and therefore breaks every law involved" it's also one of my favourite Honks fics, complete, and a good length.

** Hmm ... well, the 6th chapter of Lord Mendasuit's assorted drabbles (linkffn(9935990)) has that one ... sort of. It's not exactly what you are looking for, and it's only a one-shot, but it's the closest thing to what you want that I remember right now.

  One shots, drabbles, ficlets and mini series that range from fluffy waff to dark, bad ends. Might range from as few as a hundred words to as many as several thousand. Nothing other than 'self contained' is a rule here.

  "Basically, I realised that Harry doesn't know what is impossible. No one has ever told him that you can't just move through space and appear anywhere you want, so he just does it. The same thing with the attachment Portkey: he didn't know it couldn't be done, and we didn't tell him, so he just did it."
