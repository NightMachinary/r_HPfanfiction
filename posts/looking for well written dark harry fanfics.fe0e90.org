** These are all Voldemort/Harry

This is rather short but one of my absolute favorites in terms of Dark Harry (A dead mans tale) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6006037]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9375371]])

This is a pretty dark Harry fic. If this is the correct one Voldemort turns Harry into a proper horcrux and he goes a bit crazy Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14173404]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855]]) If you like the first fic read the second fic in the series too. Werewolf!Harry

  Voldemort has captured Harry and for his own twisted reasons has chosen not to kill him outright. Revenge in the Dark Lord's mind requires a fate worse than death and Harry is about to find out what that is.

  The Wizarding World has never seen a Human Horcrux before, and Lord Voldemort has every intention of using his newest weapon to its fullest effect. Abandoned by those he thought to be his friends shut out by Dumbledore and made the laughing stock of Britain, Harry Potter finds himself considering the offer of the Dark.

  “I will fix this, fix you. Fix your mind, make you happy, kiss you all day long, whatever you wish. I will do it, me. No one else but me.” The rendezvous at The Department of Mysteries spirals into a series of events which change the future of the wizarding world. As always, Harry is right at the middle of it all, yet in a situation he couldn't have ever fathomed and alongside the very person whom he was supposed to hate. It changes them both.

** I mean, it's not insane or like incredibly dark harry but there is a fanfiction that I know of that's really really funny and about voldy who, after making harry into an accidental Horcrux, takes him to keep the part of his soul safe, and raises him. It's not that dark but it is incredibly hilarious. This is it: [[https://my.w.tt/N9dE8y9EG4]] for if you want hilarious content this is it
