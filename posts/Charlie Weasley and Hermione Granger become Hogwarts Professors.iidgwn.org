A while ago, I read a story where Charlie Weasley was injured at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary and he, along with Hermione, became Hogwarts professors. I remember that at the beginning of the story, Mrs Weasley and Hermione had a discussion about Ron (I think they had broken up then) and for Hermione to move on from him. I can't recall what Charlie taught but I think Hermione was an apprentice for Madam Pomfrey. Charlie and Hermione had their own living quarters (where many of the professors lived within Hogwarts). The story was abandoned at 140K words, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was called. Does anyone know of this story?
