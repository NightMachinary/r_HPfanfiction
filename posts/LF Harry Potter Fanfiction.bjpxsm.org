**** Thanks for defining terrorist for me. Are you really this dense?

The point was, that the whole insane and irredeemably evil/sadistic theme they have wouldn't ever work in a modern first world country where they're on the same playing field as everyone else.

Do you think the IRA would have gotten halfway off the ground and manage to do anything even remotely sustained if they were insane masochists that went around torturing and raping? You think people would have given them shelter? And do you think a small group of absolutely insane people (like JKR portrays them) can survive whilst being hunted by all the modern technology and armed forces, with evening prior taken into account?

But no, clearly I'm just an idiot because /I don't know what terrorism is/. Ass.

***** Didn't you read what you asked? and don't say it sarcasm or something because it clearly isn't.

You asked this question and I replied with the definition of terrorist in the dictionary.

I try to explain to you why they are terrorist because it seems you didn't either didn't watch the movies and didn't read the books or completely forget about DE parts.

>They are a group who uses violent actions (killing and torturing mainly) against ministry and people who don't agree with their ideology and who they view as inferior with their radical pure-blood supremacy ideology.

I don't care what you wrote about the IRA because I didn't care in my first reply as I don't know about them enough to discuss them.

In the first war, they nearly won if Voldemort didn't become a ghost(?) and in the second they controlled the Ministry and Minister for Magic was under their control and they lost again because Voldemort and most of the DEs died.

#+end_quote

It doesn't matter they are insane, masochist, sadist, coward and other personalities they carrying, what it matters is their ideology and actions to achieve that.

Also, it doesn't matter but not all of them insane to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  can survive whilst being hunted by all the modern technology and armed forces, with evening prior taken into account?
#+end_quote

Why the heck you compare them to their survivability? It is completely irrelevant.

#+begin_quote
  You think people would have given them shelter?
#+end_quote

Why they need shelter when they have manors and magic to control people to give them shelters.

People who give (forcing them inc.) and who don't give shelter so this doesn't change ISIS is a terrorist group.

â€‹

Either you don't know the definition (from what you wrote I think this is more likely) or you didn't read the books (I watched the movies 1 time so I don't remember clearly they whitewash them) or you forgot what they try to achieve and what are they doing to achieve it.

Also, be more respectful.

****** Tl:Dr

And funny, you telling me to "be more respectful" when it was you that started off being disrespectful by assuming I didn't know the bloody definition of /terrorism/.

******* You asked and I replied what it terrorism is and go from there to know what DEs are terrorist as you know what they did and what for. I didn't assume anything in the first place but with your 2. reply I concluded you really didn't know the definition considering you started to bring personalities, their survivability and mentality to concluding a person, group, or organization is a terrorist when you know the definition.

I didn't call you any names or insult you, you did with calling me dense and ass.

******** I didn't ask anything of the sort.

My comment was skeptical about the idea of death eaters being terrorists in the modern world, to which you replied with a copy paste of what terrorism is.

But you don't think that's the least bit insulting.

Yes, I called you dense, because that was the message sent to me by your comment.

******** And, to make it even clearer for you - since you amazingly *still* don't get my point: I was skeptical of the feasibility and credibility of a group of insane sadists lasting long enough to present any sort of sustained threat without magic in the modern world. That's why their psychology, motives, and modus operandi mattered.

I was never saying that an insane man murdering for some crackpot political goal wouldn't technically be terrorism, or that what the death eaters do in canon wasn't terrorism.

Now do you get it? Jesus H Christ. And you and the other knee-jerk downvoting idiots don't want to be called dense.

**** Yes, no shit, and they're terrorists because (in cannon) they think magic is connected to bloodline.

This is a world without magic.

Also, a completely insane and sadistic group will never be able to get sympathy from the local townspeople, nor have the intelligence to survive like they do in a modern first world country.
