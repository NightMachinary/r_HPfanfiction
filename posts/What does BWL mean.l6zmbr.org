** In addition:

non-BWL stories have some other canon character (usually Neville) as the BWL.

WBWL stories are those where Harry has a sibling who's considered the BWL at the start of the story. Usually Harry is quite out of character in these; he may or not actually be the BWL.

Some people here also use BWL to refer to The Santi's story /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived,/ which is a classic you might want to check out if you're new to the fandom.

** Typically body weight loss but I believe in this context it means the Boy Who Lived.
