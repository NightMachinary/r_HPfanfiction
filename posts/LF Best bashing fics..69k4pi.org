  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion]])

This is a cult-classic for Ron bashing. Through a loop-hole Ron gets to take Harry's place in the tournament and he's eager to show everyone that it is finally the time to shine for Ron Weasley. Very funny.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections/]])

A lot of people are bashed in this fic. In particular a mirror-version of the Potters (the Pottashians), who are just horrible. Ginny is a vain attention seeking girl who wants to be adored by the press and Ron abandons his best friend for the opposite type of person. He's also pathetic in every way.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall]])

One of the better "Magical Society is horrible" fics that bashes almost everyone in charge of magical Britain.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3807777/15/Harry-Potter-and-The-Acts-of-Betrayal]])

Dumbledore, Weasleys, Tonks... actually the whole order is bashed in this fic. Very entertaining.

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny

Summary: They call him Blackmoor. They call him a dark lord. They have only themselves to blame for the man Harry Potter became. When the Light Movement strikes a personal blow in their efforts to control him, Harry will risk everything to take back the life stolen from him and show them all the true folly of provoking the Master of Death.

** Snarry linkffn(It All Started With A Visit To Gringotts)

Dumbledore's (very big) bashing is found out (though he is dead). James Potter's (though he is still dead) bashing. Molly and Ginny's bashing (but Ginny will change for better later). And the main antagonist is... (idk how to make a spoiler). MasterOfDeath!Harry. Powerful!Harry.

And Founders' portraits were found, so there are many interactions with them and their descendants. They are cool guys.

It is (almost Gen actually) a very interesting detective and action story. Really recommend it.
