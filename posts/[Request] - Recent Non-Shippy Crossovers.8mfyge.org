Any decent non-romance crossovers lately?

No preference for main characters or fandoms, but the weirder or rarer the better.

(And please, no shipping. Unobtrusive pairings are fine, though; I just want something with a plot that isn't entirely about romance.)


** Linkffn(child of the storm) is not that recent, but it's sequel linkffn(ghosts of the past) is still actively updating. There's no real ship for Harry yet, but he did kiss a girl in the most recent chapter of the sequel.

Also linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of The Rock) is a pretty decent Game of Thrones crossover with plenty of Harry being a badass. There is a ship later on but the relationship is not a very major plot point at all.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

** They are not really recent, but these are some of my favorite crossovers. (Sorry for the long post.)

- Definitely read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent if you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist.

Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story.

Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective. linkffn(12447494) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] by Books of Change. Since the story has Sherlock Holmes in the story, there are plenty of investigations. The author is really well rounded in writing mysteries. linkffn(7578572) Status: Complete

- This one is a crossover series with the MCU' verse where the story is centered around Luna Lovegood. The series is extremely underrated. I just needed to at least attempt to spread it considering I absolutely adore the writing. It's like looking at a painting except with words.

A really basic non spoiler(ish) summary: It starts off with a young, four year old Luna encounter with Loki. Afterwards tragedy strikes, and she ended up with some truly dreadful people. She then goes through the process to become the next â€˜Widow'. In a typical Luna fashion, she does not break. Then step by step she met others.

The Under the Moon series starts off with a chronological series of one shots or two shots that eventually turns into a multi chaptered fic. This series is written by MerciaLachesis or on Ao3, Mercia. Here are the links to both sites.

  Loki, de-aged and lost, wakes up in England. Well, he didn't know it was England, or maybe it was Scotland, he couldn't be sure since all he had to go on was a forest, a lake, a castle, a slightly cloudy sky and basically no knowledge of Midgard country names to go on but there was definitely something odd about the place. He could be imagining it in his slightly concussed and confused mind but somehow he didn't think owls carrying mail and children wearing robes were very common place not to mention the magic sticks.

*** Long posts are definitely welcome, and I'm not too picky about slightly older crossovers -- I mentioned "recent" ones above mostly so I could weed out the ones I've already read.

And you've given me some really interesting ones. There are a lot here that I haven't seen.

Thanks!

**** No problem!

And yeah, I usually try to dig into the obscure ones as well. Sometimes they are simply buried somewhere. Anyways, I have more recommendations as well if you like once you finish these. Just say the word.

** My own linkffn(Champions of the Two Worlds) is a HP/Warcraft crossover. There are pairings in the story, but the real importance is how much ass Harry and co can kick when given Warcraft powers and classes. Currently Harry is facing down the Scourge while Ron journeys to Ulduar (though neither plot line is going to play out as they did in Wrath).

*** I literally know nothing about /Warcraft/, but that's no barrier -- I got into /Naruto/ fanfics despite never having watched the anime or read the manga. A little googling, and I'm good to go.

Thanks!

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red) and its sequel... boy am I recommending that one a lot lately, but /it's good believe me/.

In other news, I am personally writingish three unusual crossovers: a Lemony Snicket one, a /Peter Pan/ one, and a /Wandering Inn/ one. Don't expect them before several months though.

*** Ooooooh, I haven't come across /Harry Potter and the Girl in Red/ till now, but it looks like it might be a tonal mix of Carnivorous Muffin's work and /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/.

Thanks for the rec!

And those sound like some cool fandoms for crossovers; I've actually started getting into web novels/serials lately and *Wandering Inn* is on my to-read list.

*** This is probably sacrilege to say this on Reddit, but I love /TBBT/ fanfics. Although I haven't watched the show for a few seasons now -- the recent stuff is kind of "meh" for me -- it's a comfy setting, it's somehow fantastic for a lot of different fic (especially AU and crossovers), and I have no clue why.

And I love your fic, too. Post-Hogwarts fem!Harrys are a definite go-to of mine. Really slipped into the story thanks to your writing, too.

Keep up the good work!
