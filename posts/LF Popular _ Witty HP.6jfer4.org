Looking for a Harry that interacts well with females. I like it when it starts in first year and most of the females think he is very cute. I enjoy seeing how Harry interacts when someone flirts with him and he'll say something witty back towards them. Prefer a Harry that takes control of his life I don't mind the cliches like him getting a Lordship when Hagrid takes him to Gringotts.


** Linkffn(darkness ascendant) will kind of fit this but he mostly avoids the average girl at hogwarts due to some sort of giggles curse they're all aflicted with that flares up when he tries to talk to them. In third year he'll realize WHY all the girls giggle nervously. I should be writing again soon.

****** No idea yet. She's close friend. Maybe a gf, maybe not. Aside from fleur and harry hatefucking in fourth year and potentially tonks taking harry's virginity, no relationship stuff is set. As they interact, i'll evaluate who harry eventually dates.
