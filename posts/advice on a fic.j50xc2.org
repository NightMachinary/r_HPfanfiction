*** Finally read it as had nothing better to do. While it has a lot of sterotype, but it was quite good and definitely worth a read

** In a lot of ways it plays into the stereotypes common in Haphne fics. That said, it is one of my favorites in a lot of ways too.

** I would say it's quite good, and you should give it a read. Anyway, if you don't enjoy it you can always back out.

*** Can you go in a little detail what the context is without going into spoilers. the summary was really odd

** My first long Haphne fic that I read :D So a lot of nostalgia for me. I definitely liked it, even if there may be more likeable versions of Daphne out there, but I liked the arguments and banter between Harry and Daphne. The people who don't like Haphne at all would say don't read it but I think give it a try if you think the summary is interesting. There are definitely worse fics out there and you can stop reading if you see it's not your cup of tea
