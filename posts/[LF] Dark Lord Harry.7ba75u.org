  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** Well, I guess it's more about the ascension to Dark-Lordship than the actual Dark-Lording, so maybe it won't be for you.

  In the depths of the Ministry, there is a cell for the world's most dangerous man... and he wants out. Read warnings. No slash.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1117301][Frozen to the Bones]]

Probably my favorite Dark Lord Potter fic.

It's a one shot. Nothing to do with the Bones family.

Do you expect that a Dark Lord Harry Potter would think highly of Dumbledore?

****** I don't even see how this is bashing.

Bashing is when the author writes a character in a way that takes any flaws they have and blows them waaay up. Usually while ignoring their strengths.

For Dumbledore, this is often by making him absurdly forgiving, making him "manipulative", making him obsessed with the "Greater Good".

All that happens in this fic is that one character insults and belittles another.

My all time favorite fic wherein Harry, instead of being killed at 1 years old, is raised as the Dark Lord's own. Its compelling character development and plot has earned multiple re-reads for me. Part of an already completed trilogy :)

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.
