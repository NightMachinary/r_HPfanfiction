As the title suggests, I feel I've lost my faith in Harry Potter FanFiction, and I want to get back into it. I don't know: I feel that all I'm finding lately are plots that fall flat, mediocre writing and characters that don't engage me. Help me find something I can stay up all night binge-reading!

I really enjoy fics featuring Tom Riddle or some other Riddle-esque character. If it features well-written pureblood politics, Death Eater politics/missions, dark magic or complex characters, I'm also in. I'm not one for straight romance, generally, but if the mood strikes me to watch some elationships unfold, I generally tune into the Gin n' Tonics, Dumbledore/Grindelwald or Snape/Lily. I don't mind AUs, genderbends or timetravel. That being said, I'll try just about anything, because you never know. I do mind, and will not read, fics that are nothing but plotless excuses for the characters to have sex.

So yeah: I'm curious what you come up with. Thanks in advance for the recommendations


** linkffn(Blackpool) is one of my all-time favorites, and it's fairly new. So if you haven't been read hp fanfic in a while, you probably haven't stumbled on it. It's a coming of age story about Regulus Black, and it has a ton of things you're looking for: creative plot, compelling mystery, complex characters, incredible writing, themes of dark magic and pureblood culture (though Regulus never really embraces either). No pairings.

Nothing else really measures up to it, imho.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** It's basically the opposite of a Riddle-esque character, but I was recently feeling similarly bummed out by fanfic, and the fic /What's Her Name In Hufflepuff/ helped bring me back. It's basically a self-insert story, but done very well, and it has a delightful sense of humour and does manage to capture a sense of magic of the world that you don't often see.

** Your interests in general seem to align more towards younger authors, so you're probably not going to find anything like a decent plot or well written stories. I'm not saying that to be mean, but I've been around HP fanfiction for over a decade, and none of the stories you're looking for can even really be considered average. If someone can suggest something like that, I'll eat my hat.

**** Better than the Jen Black series, it's good enough to be published in my opinion. I think one of the things I enjoy about it, is the fact that despite being magical, the characters are mostly realistic. Alex is still a pretty convincing 11 year old girl, and she grows up realistically...and the adults are also adults. Mostly.

And there's no casual acceptance of child molesters by main characters, either, which has that going for it.

** If you like Voldemort centric fics, here are some:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]], linkffn(13275002), is Diary Riddle vs Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210), has a genre savvy SI replacing Voldemort just before he was about to kill Lily. Well, he is still a totally evil SOB, but at least he is a lot smarter and has some humors.

Voldemort scores total victory in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853).

--------------

Other fics with Riddle like MCs:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU in both magical and muggle worlds. James and Lily survived Halloween 1981 and Harry never went to Hogwarts. But he's a far more cunning and ruthless person than in canon. Voldemort got his body back in 2005, changed his strategy completely. and is doing rather well as of 2023.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Another very popular fic on this sub. It's canon compliant until the end of DH, but then Harry had it enough, and magical Britain will eventually ruled by the dark Trio. Very heavy emphasis on dark magic in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out after Dumbledore's murder at the end of HBP. He vows to avenge his lover's murder and offers to help Harry. Together, they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe. Grindelwald's inner thoughts are very fun to read, especially when they involve Dumbledore.

Edit: I also really liked linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation) if you're looking for something with the same feeling as the books.

For something different, I found linkffn(promises unbroken) really interesting, as well as linkffn(hogwarts battle school).

All time favourite authors are taure and autumn souls, check out linkffn(iris potter and the goblet's surprise) or linkffn(the one he feared)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

** Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18720031/chapters/44400358]]

A story about Durmstrang that is about Nordic OC characters from Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Follows canon extremely closely and takes everything in consideration.

Many canon characters like Draco, Krum, Newt and Grindelwald appears.

Quite a dark and cynical fic. But I love writing it.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Grow Young With Me; Black Luminary; Renascentia Into The Fire) I've never tried to link multiple fics in a single comment before; not sure if I did that right. If not, I'll amend it in a mo'. Anyways, here are my pitches, in order:

Accidental Horcrux follows the development of a Harry who is raised by an awakened scarcrux to be Voldemort's apprentice. Harry tries very hard to be moral while also being unfailingly loyal to "Tom," as he calls the scarcrux and whom he sees as a separate person from "Voldemort Prime," which is tricky, since, y'know, Tom is an amoral mass murderer. I'm not giving this a great sell, but I can't recommend it highly enough.

Grow Young With Me is a het romance, so you might pass it up on those grounds, but you'd be missing out if you did. It follows a widowed Harry struggling to raise three children on his own several years after Ginny's death, which is complicated further when a muggle woman befriends him (which takes a while, since he's /very/ closed off). The romance itself is very slowly and believably developed, too: we're about 200K words in (if memory serves), and we're still at the "just friends, one of whom has a massive crush on the other" phase.

Black Luminary is the one I'm most dubious about recommending. It starts off not great, and it continues on for a while not great, and the author isn't a native English speaker, which shows in a lot of awkward phrasinges and purple prose, and also it's kind of, for lack of a better term, anime-y, but it's got some stuff going for it if you can get past all that. It's a massive AU where the war with Grindelwald had a much bigger impact on Britain, Voldemort never rose to power, and Harry became a pariah after being adopted into the Black family. If you can power through an underwhelming first year, you might enjoy the later stuff.

Renascentia is a somewhat hesitant recommendation, since I haven't finished it (I was planning to wait until the author finished it to read the whole thing at once, then I never actually went back to it. Oops.), but I recently reread the first chapter and enjoyed it, and I plan to finally finish it soon. Maybe. Hopefully. Anyways, it's about Regulus surviving the Cave Incident and traveling back to Britain to help stop Voldemort. My recollection is that he spends most of his time hiding from the Order at Grimmauld Place and bickering with Sirius, which doesn't sound super compelling, but I do remember enjoying it.

Edit because I'm a dumbass: I linked the Renascentia sequel rather than the original, but you can't find the original on the author's page, if you're interested.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Ink Stains Harry becomes trapped in Tom Riddles Diary and eventually turns up in the hands of Bruce Banner.

You might want to visit my faves on Fanfiction.com. My name is beloved of Naruto. I'm 22 I just haven't changed my name on there.

Search my name and you will find that I haven't published anything. I do however have an epically long fanfic list. I suggest selecting Harry Potter rather than manually looking through the whole thing.

I have 519 Harry Potter fanfics saved.

Avengers + Harry Potter crossovers, Time-travel, Harry surrenders to Voldemort, Harry/Voldemort, Founders heir Harry, bashing stories, master of death stories, well written(in my opinion) abuse stories, Adopted Harry (An adoption fic of note is Harry Crow, it is the only one I know about where Harry is adopted by the Goblins.) Harry Potter +Transformers crossover

I could list more but I feel this is becoming long.

The reason I did this instead of listing names is because there are a lot of ones I like.

I hope you will like at least a couple within my favorites section.
