I'm a huge fan of seer!Harry fanfics and would love some recommendations. I've read those were Harry is a seer at Hogwarts but isn't able to do magic with Voldemort winning the first war. They are both well written (in one his blood is the factor of getting visions) but I prefer for Harry to be able to cast magic, you know? I remember reading one where he travels back in time and claims to be a seer only to be turned into one by whoever sent him back, sadly the story was taken down. So, anyway, some recommendations would be nice, even though I probably have read most of them if they have a Hashtag with seer or if it's mentioned in the summary.


** I think Harry Potter and the Arcana fits the description pretty well. Harry is a seer, knows it and uses his abilities to a great degree. He can also cast "normal" magic too.

Be aware that Harry is pretty OOC in this story due to how different his life was with his seer gifts.

  Harry Potter's life as we know it is entrenched with destiny, sewn together like a tightly plotted book. But what if his bond with destiny was far more imminent? What if whatever card said that Harry Potter is rubbish at divination was turned upside down? Discontinued, for all intents and purposes.

** Try this one. I love this one. If you do not like slash that will be a bit sad, but the characterization on its own makes it worth. Very funny. Tom/Voldemort's inner monologuing is so believable, Dumbledore is very twinkly and acts oblivious. Death Eaters are amusing. This is alternate universe, where voldemort and Harry were in the same year and are now professors. Ron and Hermione are their students I belive (minor roles).

In which Tom is the DADA professor at Hogwarts, secretly recruiting followers for his future army, and Harry is the worst Divination professor ever, accidentally messing up Tom's plans.

  Voldemort has had a Seer in his ranks for years, but Harry plots to escape, to free himself from the Dark Lord's grasp.It's really too bad what happens next.

*** I remember reading it once, it's just so bizarre. And the image of him cutting out/ripping out his own eyes just to be killed or to escape his fate, it's a horrible imagination. It's a good story though.
