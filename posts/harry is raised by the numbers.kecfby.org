due to one reason or another, instead of being raised by the Dursleys harry is instead raised by the duel spirts of the number cards from yugioh. as introduced in yugioh Zexel the number cards are a group of special xyz monsters, aside from each having their own abilities number cards can also only be defeated by another number card regardless of what attack the other monster has. in this situation for one reason or another the number cards have also somehow gained the ability to manifest in physical form in the human world with their powers intact.
