Idk if it's just me, but i've been reading fics with generally the same plot lines and tropes and i'm highkey sick nd tired of it. I want you to suggest me the most high quality and unique stories you have that will excite me and not make me feel like i've read a story like it ten days ago. A hp fic where you can feel it's still hp. Harry centric pls and no slash. Crossovers are fine as long as it's well done.


** Linkffn(The Firebird's Son) has to be one of the most unique takes on an AU I've ever come across. It really takes gender politics to its logical extreme using the constraints of the AU while also having a pretty great story. Also, linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) is definitely the most unique NevilleBWL story I've read. It's still from the perspective of Harry, but it was his parents who are in St Mungo's.

** linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpoint; The Augurey by La-Matrona; Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm) are pretty good. linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is great but sadly abandoned. IMO it's worth to read what's there though. I've also enjoyed linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; The King's Indian Attack by Nectere). I know a couple other unique ones, but they aren't all Harry-centric. I can link them if you'd like though?

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** I've got a plot idea for one where a bunch of Ravenclaws build a magic calculator to help them with Arithmancy, then gradually over several years it turns into a somewhat useful computer but using a very different architecture compared to a muggle one (instead of binary on a disk it's microscopic writing on enchanted parchment) and they eventually create a silicon valley style tech startup.

** All of these still feel enough like the HP world to me, but YMMV. They are well known, but some people might have missed them depending on how narrowly they read fanfic. None of them are shippy; I prefer gen stories because too often pairings cause me to lose empathy with the characters. With gen stories it's easier to just observe without my personal reactions/judgments interfering.

linkffn(It's Always the Quiet Ones) is an interesting fusion with Lovecraftian mythology that focuses on Luna Lovegood's unworldly traits. This short story is one of my all time favorites.

linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) is another Lovecraftian horror story that is also on my list of favorite dark!Harry stories.

linkffn(That Which Holds the Image) is a Doctor Who crossover that has been recommended more than once on this reddit, but it's still one of my favorites and defies many tropes. The Angels freak me out, as well.

linkffn(Whelped) creeps me out like few other stories in this fandom.

** I found Worthy of Magic: linkffn(12800980) super unique and a great read. The last part struggles with vision for me and it hurts that it's been abandoned especially so close to the finish but it is still a fun ride.

Word of warning though. Harry is a psychopath. I typically am not a fan of Harry being dark/evil and killing people, but the insanity is written in a really interesting way that I was able to get past it.

What is most appealing about this fic is how Harry realizes his goal and puts it into effect! It's really worth your time

**** Aww I thought you might have read it but wanted to rec it just in case. Hmm I read linkffn(Ectomancer) years ago and remember it having an interesting take on magic but can't remember much in detail. I also see linkffn(Emperor) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) recommended a lot about being very different from typical fics but I haven't read them myself.

***** I can definitely recommend both emperor and wastelands as very unique. I actually legitimately had nightmares the first time I read wastelands, it's a crazy fic. Emperor is great, but it unfortunately ends right before the climactic bit, so it's kind of a let down for such a big investment in words.

***** It's such a shame Ectomancer got abandoned. It's a really fresh and original kind of plot and magic. It suffered a bit in pacing, had Harry reading through multiple books a day and learning necessary things ridiculously fast, but other than that it was really interesting
