First thing that comes to mind for me is when authors write "De Em Elay" or some other stupid phonetic variation of "DMLE" (Department of Magical Law Enforcement).

I don't see it /that/ often, but I've seen it a couple times, and every time I just want to bitch-slap the author, because even though it's such a small thing, I /hate/ it, /so much/.

** It has always been a pet peeve of mine when author changes the name of a character for no reason or because they gender swaped the character.

If you are swapping Harry's gender she can still be called Harry or even harriet! Why is she now called Samantha. Where did you get Samantha!? (Not really talking about a specific fic as there are so many of them like this and samantha is a random example)

*** I don't know, do you ever get the feeling that some names sound a bit... Ugly? Not just from an aesthetic phonetic perspective, but from what they almost imply as a result.

Like it's super weird, but when I think of a "Harriette", I don't think of an attractive woman, I think of... well, almost the opposite.

"Emily", "Claire", "Valerie", all sound pretty and somehow imply the same, while something like "Matilda" or "Agnes" doesn't.

There's really no logic behind it, and I'm sure that it's just somehow the result of being immersed in a certain language and culture; for example, I don't think someone Japanese or Indian would see an aesthetic difference in these names - or perhaps they'd just find different names more or less appealing.

Long story short, that's why I think some authors change some names, even on just a subconscious level :)

It still disturbs me to see an "unreasonable"(in my opinion) change though. It doesnt have to be Harriet just call her Harry. If there is ever any mention of a name change in fem fics I always drop it. It just turns me off the fic.

I suppose it doesnt bother you though which is a good thing. The less pet peves one has the more opportunities they have to read something interesting without the tiny things getting in the way.

So I'm on the opposite side of this specific thing, because I'd avoid any fic where "Harry" was a woman - just too strange.

I mean, gender-bent Harry is already rather strange for me, so I don't go looking for it, but this would be the proverbial icing on the cake.

*** See, my general opinion is it should follow the naming scheme. In most cases, I don't think prospective parents chose a name of one gender and then just say that if the baby is born the opposite sex they'll modify the name. If a character is named after a grandfather, I would probably look at their grandmother's name if I were sex-swapping them. And of course, *realistically* siblings ought to just have each others' names if you're sex-swapping them and have a brother and sister, but on a practical level that would be confusing. But sometimes just having their name start with the same letter can seem even more arbitrary.

** Hmm, most of the small things that bug me have to do with spelling, language, or anachronisms.

Misspellings of names bug me a lot.

"Pavarti." Come on now, it's Parvati! Par-va-ti!

"Delores" and variations that aren't Dolores.

Heavy accents on upper-year Hogwarts students. Being stuck around the same group of people over a long period of time generally has a homogenizing effect on people's language. Recent transfer OCs can be an exception, though.

Switching between US and British spelling conventions randomly within a story. Pick one and stick with it.

Finally, anachronisms. I don't want to hear about how characters are using their iPods if the whole story takes place in the 90s. In canon it really bothered me when the dates were laid out in DH because that meant that Dudley was using a Playstation when it hadn't even come out yet.
