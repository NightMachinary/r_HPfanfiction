Just wondering if there are any fics where the patronus actually is an incredibly difficult spell that most wizards/witches are never able to cast. Harry goes to teach a bunch of 15-16 year olds and, unsurprisingly, few to none of them are able to make any significant progress.

Has anyone seen this happen in a fic?


** Nothing comes to mind, but just pointing out that in OoTP itself only 5 members actually manage it in that book: Seamus (briefly), Ron, Hermione, Cho and someone else I can't recall. A lot of people seem to misremember it as everyone getting the charm down.

** In addition to the others pointing out that only a handful manage it, it should be remembered that Harry himself was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus in the absence of Dementors (Quidditch game vs Malfoy pretending to be a Dementor) /months/ before he managed the same feat in the presence of Dementors (rescuing Sirius). The latter is /significantly/ more difficult.

***** He does it successfully that exact same night.

If we know that he was consistently practicing from the quidditch game encounter to the one with Sirius, we might assume that he was steadily improving and therefore wouldn't have been capable of casting it near dementors back then. Though that requires that we also assume that continuously practicing it without nearby dementors translates into being more capable of it in presence of dementors.

Harry thinks he saw his father rescuing him, but then he realizes it has been himself all along. It's probably a mix of believing in himself and thinking about his father.

************ It would be an enormous advantage with any action to Know that you are capable of doing it. The confidence boost alone would exponentially increase your chances.

Especially in this, the Patronus charm is one that heavily depends upon you maintaining positive thoughts and your confidence that you can pull it off. Ergo, knowing that you Will succeed should aid you massively when it is time to do the charm.

I really can't urge you enough to at least get a vague familiarity with the source material before trying to discuss it.

It is well established that the correct mental state is the main obstacle in learning to cast the Patronus.

************* Yes, and the correct mental state is properly focusing on a happy memory or scenario. Harry already knew that.

Perhaps you should reread of the books. Seeing as you're clearly unfamiliar with the source material, I'll let you know that the patronus has nothing to do with thoughts of your father. In fact, when Harry teaches it to the DA he doesn't tell them even once to realize that it wasn't their dead father casting it. Neither does he require them to see their time traveling selves do so. Those aren't requirements.

Have you ever tried to do any kind of mental exercise? Knowing exactly what you are trying to accomplish is just a minor part in actually doing it. Knowing that the secret to Zen meditation is the empty mind doesn't make you a Zen master.

Clearly finding the way to the right mental state is different for each individual.

*************** So again, where's the inspiration that changed the way he thought about the spell?

I see how the confidence in himself would be a factor, and I could sort of see how thinking of his father would help, though I have a different issue with whether or not those could be said to have been critical, but neither of those are epiphanies about the nature of the spell.
