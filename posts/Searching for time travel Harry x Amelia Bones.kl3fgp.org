Hey guys it's my first post on reddit so please tell me if I'm doing something wrong. I'm searching for a story I've started to read on Archive of our Own: Harry travel into the time and he appear at the start of its first years. So he decide to impersonates James Potter to addopt his young himself and he fall in love for Amelia Bones. Thanks

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

  The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it.OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.
