** ...Well, now I have a mental image of Harry buggering the entire female population of Surrey, so that 11 years later or so (or should it be 12, given the time pregnancy takes?) a good half of the incoming first years look like Harry. Bonus points if they're all named after the father.

  Harry flees his home to avoid performing accidental magic again (thanks to Aunt Marge). But when number four, Privet Drive is attacked, he becomes the chief suspect and a fugitive from both the Muggle police and the Ministry. He has no idea that this will irrevocably alter the rest of his life. (H/OC, H/G, R/Hr, R/L, N/Hr)
