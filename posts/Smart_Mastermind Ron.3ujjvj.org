I read Linkffn(An Incomplete Potter Collection by Racke), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/5/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][this chapter]] has a short drabble where Ron comes up to Harry and tells him that Albus/Mrs. Weasley are trying to control Harry and have ordered Ron to befriend Harry. He suggests Harry breakaway from Dumbledore and has all of these intricate plans and it's all kind of cracky and lampshading tropes.

But I think the premise is cool. Any fics where Ron is the mastermind? i've read some fics where he's reasonably close to Harry skill-wise (like linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die)) but I want to read more with Ron as the mastermind or at least smarter than Harry.


** linkffn(forging the sword by myst shadow) has a very competent Ron.

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

  Here's where I put all the great ideas I get. I hope you like them. Monologuing is such a cool thing to do sometimes.
