The author was halfway through book four and I was checking my favorites list because they hadn't updated in a while and now the fanfic isn't there, I don't remember the author, and I can't find any of the fanfics about books 1-4 anywhere. I used fictionhunt or whatever it is called to find them and it is saying they were removed. I keep finding the username Voldything394 but according to the plagiarism page on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] they were removed back in like 2013.


** Yeah, they got banned because they violate copyright laws. Some still exist, they just have the reading offscreen so 90% of the text isn't just the normal books.

** Are you possibly mean [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13355774/19/Hogwarts-Reads-the-Books-Goblet-of-Fire][this]] one? With the hints of Harry/Daphne if I remember correctly?

**** Well, in that case. When the work was still up I looked through the comments and there was a plagiarism accusation. Long story short, I looked it up and it seems it was true. There's [[https://fictionhunt.com/users/61wn1e/shopaholic1369][Shopaholic1369]] on fictionhunt and they have almost identical stories (I think they're even more detailed). The last one posted is also [[https://fictionhunt.com/stories/8g62dv3/hogwarts-reads-goblet-of-fire][Hogwarts Reads GoF]] and it's abandoned, but if you want to re-read them...
