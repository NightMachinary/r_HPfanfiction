I always love reading long stories, but I have read so many I'm afraid I've exhausted my local hangouts. Any obscure and good ones?

*** I just started trying to read this a few days ago, but I put it down after an hour or so. The writing felt kind of bad to me. Well, not bad exactly, but it was pretty awkward to read and some of the word choices felt really jarring. Does it get better? Or do you just grow more used to it?

** Doubt these would count as obscure but I always recommend Blindness and The Changeling. Also Lady of the Lake. I've re-read The Changeling and Lady of the Lake a couple of times and always loved it. Blindness is a bit too heavy for me for a re-read but my god it's long!

*** Blindness is a great fic. It's one of very few I've read that manages to balance a tragic event with the appropriate type of character development. Most stories of the sort tend to turn Harry into either an angst-ridden child or an omnipotent deity in those sorts of situations, but this one handles it tastefully and somewhat uniquely.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linkao3(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity) on AO3 /or/\\
linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity) on FFN

It has four parts, soon to be five. It's a wizarding America much more interesting than JKR's 'copy of Britain' approach, with amazing worldbuilding and foreshadowing, and great writing in general.

I should note that if you aren't willing to read original characters and want just the canon characters, this story is /not/ for you. Alexandra Quick could almost stand alone from HP as a separate universe with some editing. So keep that in mind as you read.

PS: There's a subreddit, [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]].

** It's been some time since I've read these but I hope they're up to your standards:

​

linkffn(Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) currently has four incredibly long stories in the series. Some of the characters may feel unrealistic in their speech/actions but the story and world-building makes up for it.

linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19).

linkffn(Falling Through Time by Kait Hobbit) is a time travel story that's Hermione/Fred.

linkffn(Hogwarts House Divided by Inverarity) is a story about four characters in different houses post -hogwarts.

linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) another post-Hogwarts about the Potter family mainly from a Muggle's (OC) perspective. It shows the Potter family living in a small town full of muggles as their children grow up.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

" In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy to kill it once and for all. "

A fic I'm writing about Durmstrang that describes the school in the detail. Please check it out!

The reason I chose Durmstrang was so I could take the usual Potter formula in a new direction. It contains quite dark humor and I strived after making the characters so realistic as possible even if that makes them seem less heroical(or more so maybe).

Also, if you take a look at Durmstrang from how it is described in canon it makes zero sense and I wanted to use that to my advantage in the story as a way of adding more conflict and drama when characters of multiple nationalities and languages collide.

** They Shook Hands by Dethryl is fantastic. It takes the form of a series, with one "story" per year. It's also much more interesting than the actual canon series, and the work that he puts into writing it is astonishing, considering the length and mega-plot. It's essentially a retelling of the entire series based on one single event, AND it manages to humanise House Slytherin brilliantly. Strongly recommended. It doesn't get nearly enough attention.

***** 'Not popular' is a bit difficult to accurately describe it. I remember reading this way back in the day, like around 2000-2002ish, if even then. It was groundbreaking when everyone else was only beginning to explore what fanfiction could do in the Potterverse, and it WAS quite popular then.

Not sure what the reloaded is about, either minor touch ups, or the original got erased, perhaps. But the fic /is/ a product of it's time, and what pushed it back then was mainly the innovation and ideas used, which would explain why it was fairly successful despite some unclean writing.

Honestly, I don't expect it to have aged perfectly, either. It was basically a Michael Bay movie in that it /is/ fun if you're in the mood for action, but you could also pick it apart all day long if you felt in the mood to do /that/.

No, it's the wording that gets you downvoted. If you were to say "I haven't found one yet" then people would rush in to give you recommendations. "Don't think those exist" is a statement of a fact, you believe that there are no good fics (that's what people infer from what you said). That's an offense and insult towards all the author that pride themselves in their quality work and an insult to all the readers that consider their favorite fics good (you are insinuating that since there are no good fics, they must be wrong, their sence of quality is wrong). That's why you get downvoted.

****** It wasn't obvious to me (and, I assume, basically everyone else), there are people that are genuinely toxic. Use /s in the end of your post to indicate sarcasm if you aren't sure it's obvious.
