Awhile ago, I read an HP and Avengers crossover where Loki crashed nearby Hogwarts and somehow de-aged. The spell that Odin put on Loki to make him look Asgardian also broke, so his real Frost Giant heritage is revealed throughout the story. Thus he is blue. The Hogwart students then became curious of Loki.

I don't remember the fic name, but I can't find it. Can anyone help?

Edit:

I found it! It's called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4839833/chapters/11085752][Loki's Confused Adventure Through the Wizarding World]] by Skye1412

linkao3(4839833)

The story is actually good and the concept is so original I can't help but love it.

  Loki, de-aged and lost, wakes up in England. Well, he didn't know it was England, or maybe it was Scotland, he couldn't be sure since all he had to go on was a forest, a lake, a castle, a slightly cloudy sky and basically no knowledge of Midgard country names to go on but there was definitely something odd about the place. He could be imagining it in his slightly concussed and confused mind but somehow he didn't think owls carrying mail and children wearing robes were very common place not to mention the magic sticks.
