I've seen plenty where he joins the good, not one where he joins the bad. Either cause he's evil, the author writes the bad side as the good or he's been alive for so long (MoD) he wants to spice things up. I don't care. He's going to try to mess up the good side's day.

Bashing and slash are fine. Please no harems, genderbending, romance/smut-driven plot, pottercest or mpreg. Thank you!

If I remember correctly, Harry is trained by the Sith in this.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

**** Sorry you got downvoted, because my opinion is similar. The wording and sentence construct makes me cringe so hard I can't go further than the second chapter.

***** They are being downvoted because of how they worded it. They could have said something along the lines of "I respectfully disagree".

They were rude and disrespectful.

****** Not to create an echo chamber, but not only is that internet, it's reddit. People really need thick skin and to take everything with a pinch of salt. Sorry you felt he was disgraceful, but that's an opinion I can't disagree with, it really was awful.

******* First of all, I agree with what you are saying.

HOWEVER, not everyone on the internet has a thick skin, and your comment was rather disrespectful, which is against the sub's (mostly non-enforced) rules. If you'd framed your comment in a neutral way, then you wouldn't be getting down-voted.

Maybe next time...

/I stopped reading this fic because the sentence construction and the word choice makes it difficult and unattractive to read./

**** It is typical Darth Marrs nonsense (I.E. edge & bad), but some people just don't have the type of filter to sort that type of nonsense out, and somehow can be entertained regardless of how cringey something is. Basically, some people just aren't jaded yet.

***** Couldn't agree more. He's stories always start off pretty well, and then quickly turn south. Often it's as soon as the romance is introduced.

I mean, his other SW/HP crossover was pretty awesome, until it suddenly became trash.

**** Oh good, so I'm not the only one who found this terrible and couldn't get through the first few chapters. I like the premise, but the execution is completely botched.
