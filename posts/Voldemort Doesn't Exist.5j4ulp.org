** You might want to start by informing people here and in the description about the long introduction and set up with Harry's parents before he's ever mentioned. If you lead your reader's expectations to be one way, and have your content completely different, you'll put off a lot of people who'll never give it a proper chance.

  not that long... six chapters

Yeah... One chapter is not that long. Six chapters is extremely long.

***** One chapter is not that long (with exception of very lengthy ones, you know which ones I'm talking about). Six chapters no matter how short are definitely too long. Little warning would be welcomed.

****** You asked for feedback, they're giving it. You don't have to apply it if you don't agree with it. If all you're going to do is argue against someone's opinion then what's the point of even asking for feedback?

** Have Harry change his name to Voldemort.

Plot twists ftw.

*** Funnily enough I did have an idea of Harry nicknaming himself Voldemort among friends. I think I will make an allusion to this but it definitely won't stick.

*** Great, thanks! Even if you do only read the first chapter or two (which are extremely short. They don't get up to a normal size until 7) I'd love criticisms on them.

  What if Voldemort didn't exist? What if Harry Potter was the only title for Harry Potter? What if he had no scar? What if he had a sister? Are you tired of exciting books full of Harry going through dangerous tasks like fighting dragons, giant spiders, and the greatest dark wizard of all time numerous times? Of course you are! This is Harry Potter in the mundane!

** Who are the bad guys in your story, as far as you can tell?

What about those canon bad guys, such as Bellatrix, Lucy Malfoy, the Lestranges, Barty Jr, and Umbridge?

*** There aren't going to be any real "bad guys." Don't get me wrong, I have many plans for conflicts and things but my story's general purpose isn't person vs villain. Most conflicts will be person vs self. But there will be rivalries and things involving other students.

As for the death eaters, they don't really have a purpose. I do have plans for an allusion to Umbridge, but for the most part none of those guys play a role in the story.
