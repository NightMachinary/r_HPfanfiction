hello reddit, i'm hoping someone can help me find this fic i've been searching for for ages !

things i'm sure of:

• it's drarry pairing

• it was on ao3

• it was a longfic

• harry goes through a ton of sh!t and ends up super physically scarred. i think he was tortured in malfoy manor

• he creates this perfect alternate reality in his head - i think james and lily exist there, and remus and lupin are obviously happy and in love

• at some point voldemort is sitting on a throne in the hogwarts great hall

things i can't totally remember:

• harry goes blind ?

• harry might have been s3xually abu$ed

• draco possibly dies near the end, and exists in harry's mind world

• i think harry makes some of it come true ? like for sure draco re-joins reality, remus and lupin might also

i have literally poured through my extensive ao3 history and made 47 pointless google searches and would be super grateful for any help anyone could offer !!

sorry if the formatting is off i'm a noob
