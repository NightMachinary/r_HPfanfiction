  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED â™¡]

It's Drarry and explores magic in a very unique way (can be a little jarring if you hate Draco).

** I'm not Indian, so I don't know how good this is as an 'Indian!Harry' fic, but it's a fic I enjoyed with an Indian!Harry in it, so I'm giving it a rec. :)

Basically, post-war Harry gets cranky about living in Britain, so goes wandering across the world and finds out he really likes Architecture. Things spiral out from there. :D

  Harry Potter is 18 years old and he doesn't know who he is. Now that Lord Voldemort has been defeated, he's just a random guy who doesn't even know what he likes to do for fun. Or, the one where Harry Potter doesn't know what to do with himself after the war, so he becomes an architect, makes new friends, falls in love, and accidentally changes the world.
