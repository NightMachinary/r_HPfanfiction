heyo! I was wondering if there are any good y/n harry fanfics out here?

Also Hinny fanfics would be brilliant :)

I'm very new to the fanfic world so I know no fics ðŸ˜…


** I recommend downloading the fanfiction.net app on your phone and using scryer ([[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]) to filter your search. Its much more enjoyable to read off your phone than computer.

** I don't have any specific recommendations for y/n fanfic, but I think you should check out the Harry Potter/Reader tag on archiveofourown.org and sort by kudos, that should get you started! And for hinny, I recommend going to the harryandginny subreddit, very friendly community with tons of recs! There's also a harryandginny subreddit discord!

Good luck!
