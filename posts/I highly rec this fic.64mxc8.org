I highly recommend this story. While it does have many of the problems of the Wrong!BWL trope, and grammatical inaccuracies at times, the plot itself is amazing and had me laughing quite a bit throughout.

DISCLAIMER - This story is incomplete. Reading it to the end poses a risk of severe emotional trauma. You have been warned.


** Should definitely be noted that it's incomplete and drops off at a point when several plot points are about to climax.

** I have to ask: Is this slash? I skimmed over the author's profile page and his OTP seems to be Harry/Tom.

** How's the relationship with the parents and twin? Stuck on antagonistic? Gradually improving? Is the twin incompetent and or evil?

**** Mate, the story starts by employing pretty much every cliche of the trope. You need to give us a reason to soldier on.

***** 4 chapters in. It's hitting off cliche after cliche, trope after trope. I somewhat enjoy OP Harry though, so until I see something unforgivable, I shall forge on!
