Harry stepped into the unused classroom and froze. Hermione was sitting there, flipping through a book with a look of intense concentration, while a large, black, canine-headed man sat cross-legged next to her, eyes shut as though he were meditating on something.

After a few seconds of silence, Harry cleared his throat, "Erm, Hermione...?" he started awkwardly.

"Animagus transformation accident." Hermione answered without looking up. The dog-headed man nodded.

Harry's expression showed dawning recognition, "Oh, right. Are you feeling okay, Ron? Should I go get Madam Pomfrey?"

The half-canine Ron Weasley shook his head, "I'm fine." he muttered in a growling voice.

"Ah-ha!" Hermione suddenly announced, before pulling out her wand and pointing it at Ron, "This should reverse it: /Homorphus!/"

The only effect was a rude raspberry sound coming from the tip of Hermione's wand. Ron raised a hairy eyebrow.

Hermione shrugged, "Alright, let's go to the hospital wing."

Albus Dumbledore was enjoying a leisurely stroll through the halls of Hogwarts (or perhaps pacing in thought, one or the other), when he perked his ears.

/Hark, I do believe I hear Harry and Miss Granger coming this way./ he thought.

"I'm just saying, when Ron was complaining about his robes being too tight, I think he meant for you to enlarge them, not turn them into a dress, Hermione..."

"I know, Harry, it's just, I was looking at him and it was the first thing that came to mind..."

Then a third, unfamiliar growling voice, "To be honest, Harry, it's the first thing that came to my mind too."

Dumbledore's curiosity aroused, the aged headmaster turned the corner and froze; Harry and Hermione were following behind a black dog-headed humanoid in full Egyptian-pharaoh regalia.

He could do nothing but stop and stare as the strange procession walked past him and down the corridor, each of the three sparing a glance and a "Hello, Professor." "Good morning, headmaster." "Afternoon, maybe?" as they walked past.

As they turned into the next corridor, he could faintly hear from the dog-headed man, "Besides, I wore stuff like this all the time back when I was in Egypt..."

Dumbledore stood still and stared into space for over a minute, before he turned and rushed back to his office, /I never thought having the three Deathly Hallows in the same castle could cause THIS to happen!/


** When I was in college, I made some music on MySpace under another Ron anagram, I Was Lord Elbin Ausley. Wizard rock was the best.

*** Aren't Ronald Bilius Weasley anagrams fun? Right now I'm trying to think of a way to use 'Lo, a rabid willy ensues'. Maybe Romilda Vane mucked up a love potion again.

** And of course the twins are envious for weeks because the trio pranked Dumbledore.
