Hello everyone:)

​

Have you ever read a HP story, that seemed to be flawless/brilliant/perfect at first, but after a few (or more) chapters unfortunately turned out to be a disappointment and caused you to stop reading?

​

I'll name 2 examples: (SPOILER WARNING)

​

1. The Darkness Within by Kurinoone.

​

An unbelievably well-written, captivating, innovative, thrilling Story. Plot revolves around Powerful!Indenpendent!Smart!Harry, who has been raised by Voldemort, Bella and Lucius.

​

This story is really hyped up (almost 10k favs on ffnet) and not undeservedly, because it's unbelievably entertaining,fun to read and the Author really is talented.

​

BUT. The fic at first seems innovative and different-than-others, BECAUSE it shows us a human face of Voldemort, Bella and Lucius, shows how they really care about Harry and his well-being, how they provided him with the best level of education etc. When Harry is captured by James and learns the truth about his parentage, he is understandably upset, and when James, Lily and Dumbledore keep him against his will, claim their custody over him against his will and even force him to attend Hogwarts against his will, Harry (also understandably) wants to break free, return to his foster family and get his revenge on James. And here is the greatest disappointment of the story - a plot twist, which reveals that James was right all along to keep Harry imprisoned, because Voldemort had implemented some false memories about child abuse in Harry's mind to make Harry hate James.... Of course Harry turns against his foster family, goes out and starts... destroying Horcruxes 0_0

What was the whole point of making Voldemort, Bella and Lucius relatable, caring and human characters at first, if the Author's point was to turn them evil in the end, and make our Golden Ones (James, Lily, Dumbledore, the Weasleys) save the day?

I mean, this story was super-innovative and brilliant until the plot twist. After the plot twist, it became just like hundreds of thousands other stories, and it's really a shame :(

​

​

1. Twins. A Different Life by Jessikaa5.

​

Another unbelievably well-written, entertaining, innovative, fun to read story with almost 10k favs on ffnet.

​

This time Harry is raised by the Hogwarts' Founders, which is a brilliant idea itself. Because of his Parseltongue gift, he immedietaly becomes the favorite student of Salazar Slytherin. He goes to Hogwarts as an already ridiculously overpowered Wizard, who could easily take on the whole castle.

Also, in this story, Harry has a twin sister who is believed to be Girl -Who- Lived. Lily and James are alive and are members of the Hogwarts' faculty. The family is not the most supportive or compassionate towards the protagonist to put it mildly. Lily nad James additionally do not feel any guilt for having abandoned the baby Harry. The majority of the story's plot revolve around Harry's performance during his first year at Hogwarts and his revenge on his sister and Parents.

​

Well, and it's REALLY fun to read - for the first +/- 15 chapters (the story is 33 long). The pranks Harry pulls on his family and Dumbledore are really amusing and funny at first. Then, the fic quickly becomes repetetive. What is more, it is labelled sa dark!Harry, but there is literally no darkness there - pranks (like changing Harry's sister hair color) cannot be labeled as "dark", and they are the core of this story. Pranks, pranks, pranks. Funny, amusing, well-written - but repetetive, and definitely not DARK enough, having in mind that Harry has been Salazar Slytherin's protégé for 10 years.


** Darth Marrs often shoots himself into the foot with some ridiculous developments and mar his otherwise great premises. "Firebird Trilogy" and "The Stars Alone" are such examples. "The Bonds of Blood" has a great first half, and some very lousy second half plots.

"The Voyage of Starship Hedwig" has a very interesting premise and some great ideas, only to end up as a ridiculous and abandoned Star Wars crossover.

The last third of "A Cadmean Victory" is ridiculous.

Brennus rushed the conclusion of "Hail Odysseus" just when things got interesting.

"Here and There" is easily the best femslash I've read if not for the stupidly overpowered Greyback in the last few chapters.

"Lady Archimedes" could be a lot better if it deviates from canon more and has good guys fighting more effectively earlier.

The extremely promising "Innocent series" inexplicably starts rehashing canon plots. Very disappointed.

Similar, the great Ginny story "The Changeling" also sticks way too close to canon stations.

He somehow causes the Big Bang at the end of one story, or he gets cheated on or sent away from everything by his allies at the end of others. None of it really makes any sense. Of course, you have to get past the part where Harry is fucking teenagers first though.

**** Yep. The story would've been intact if they'd just aged the characters up, too, given how competent they are. There are already so many changes to canon that it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to make Hogwarts acceptance be at 16. Just handwave accidental magic as being weaker until adulthood.

That said, 16 is still absurdly young and still inappropriate but it's common enough in YA literature to imply that the characters will be intimate and then cut away, which is the treatment Firebird takes for the most part.

** I haven't read either of these two, but judging from your summaries, I am not surprised.

Unless it's a Bizzaro-world AU, Voldemort is still evil, and so are his followers. It doesn't matter how affable, affectionate, and supportive Voldemort happens to act towards the protagonist. Voldemort is still a violent psychopath who committed multiple murders to extend his own life and plans to commit genocide and establish a reign of terror; and Bellatrix and Lucius are there with him every step of the way. Why is it so surprising that Voldemort tried to brainwash Harry? In fact, Harry turning against Voldemort would be a story of redemption, and a happy ending.

As for the second one, it sounds like an unusually well-written Uber!Harry WBWL Potters/Dumbledore-bashing fic. It's the subgenre that distils the directionless and self-absorbed adolescent rage against authority into prose. What /did/ you expect?

On my end, Slytherin!Hermione fics tend to start strong and then disappoint. They tend to be ruined by pointlessly bashing Dumbledore and Gryffindors in general.

- There's /Mudsnake/, where you have a brilliant and powerful (whatever that means), yet profoundly messed up student showing up at Hogwarts out of the Muggle world and being sorted into Slytherin. Remind you of anyone? It would certainly remind Dumbledore of his second greatest failure.

  What would he do? Would he try to preemptively cripple this prodigy, to prevent another Tom Riddle? Would he try to instill in her the caution about imposing his will on others---that he himself has had to learn the hard way? Or, perhaps, teach her to fear of her own power, like he fears his own? Would he try to recruit her as an ally---perhaps an eventual successor, since Voldemort would be a common enemy? Or, would that be risking replacing one tyrant with another?

  What he actually does is stick lemon drops in his ears and dance around singing La-La-La. Because that's the kind of fic this is.

- Someone else has mentioned /Anti-Heroine/. Hermione is orphaned and grows up on the street, and is a scrappy badass by the time she gets her Hogwarts letter. She is sorted into Slytherin. Sounds like a recipe for interesting conflict and adversity, no? But Draco is suddenly friendly, and the worst enemy is IneptlyManipulative!Dumbledore; and Hermione is slavishly protective of Harry (also in Slytherin) for no clear reason. I am told that later on, the fic turns into porn in which Hermione is a sexual submissive to Diary!Tom.

- Less of a disappointment, but still a significant one, is /Mudblood Mistress/. It starts out well, doesn't get bogged down, and doesn't bash; but Hermione quickly becomes unrecognisable in personality---impulsive and not thoughtful at all---and in the latest volume, she becomes convinced that the Death Eaters will accept her if she tries to join them. She does so after deciding that the "good guys" aren't treating her as special as she deserves, even though Dumbledore himself has been giving her private lessons for /years/. However, at least it turns out that Death Eaters want to kill her after all, so it's better than nothing.

*** And adressing the stories You've mentioned, all three sound interesting.

1. The first one sounds most thrilling of the all, but Dumbledore is -sadly- often a person to figuratively sit and stick lemond drops into his ears instead of acting... :P
2. The beginning sounds lit. And it really seems like crush and burn later. Pity.
3. Hermione is clearly unfit to be a Death Eater, even fanfic with her accepted among their ranks wouldn't be much fun...

*** Errr.... no.

Not the "story of redemption and a happy ending", but an average, mediocre story. This story was so exceptional and extraordinary exactly because Voldemort, Bella and Lucius were shown in this light. Turning Harry against them and showing the so-called "good guys" as golden flawless heroes again robbed the fancic of its originality.

Besides... er...violent psychopath? Is it just me, or the storyline of HP is not exactly black/white (at least not since the Goblet of Fire timeline). Bella and Lucius are characters with flaws and virtues. So is Voldemort.

And the other one- yes, it's exctly that. Only I expected that it is going to develop into something more, while it didn't.

***** Well it is very black and white (and kinda childish) in the beginning , but later- I would say it gets rather grey.

Voldemort has virtues.

1. He doesn't act out of selfish motives. His goal is to revolutionize the Wizarding World.

2. He abolishes anti-creatures laws, like for example the Werewolves Acts enforced by Umbridge.

3. When somebody becomes his follower - he cares about them. I've once read a nice quote - Dumbledore and Voldemort both treat people like their tools, but Voldemort - unlike Dumbledore - takes a good care of his tools, to make sure they serve him better and longer.

4. Unlike Dumbledore, he is honest and transparent towards both his enemies and followers. He doesn't need to lie or manipulate. He is intimidating enough. Dumbledore grooms and manipulates people, to make them useful to him (Harry, Snape, Remus etc) which in my opinion is far more disgusting than what Voldemort does.

5. He is believed to be unable of feelings, but Bella and Delphi prove otherwise.

6. And let's not forget, that Voldemort has been abused and neglected, and left to rot in the Muggle orphanage for so many years.

   Really please don't hate me, but I really dislike labeling (good/evil, black/white). I like to notice flaws AND virtues in everybody.

Isn't his end goal to become the tyrannical, immortal ruler of the Wizarding world?

And isn't his revolution's purpose to purge muggleborns and muggle-lovers?

He cares about Peter so much he mocks him after Peter is in pain from self-amputating his hand to resurrect Voldemort.

He casts Crucio on his followers when they displease him.

The Malfoy's clearly aren't too happy about how Tom was treating Draco, either.

Wow, he really treated his tools well. So well that Narcissa betrayed him and allowed Harry's resurrection to go unnoticed. Really took care of his tools there lol. They sure served him well.

Isn't the whole 5th book Voldemort lying to Harry and manipulating him to get to the prophecy?

Isn't young Tom Riddle shown to have manipulated the entire school during his time there, even getting an innocent student (Hagrid) expelled?

Voldemort literally murders people. He murdered a young girl at Hogwarts.

Dumbledore didn't even murder Grindelwald, who was up until Voldemort came around the worst Dark wizard in Europe. I don't buy DD actions being worse than Voldemort's at all.

He also abused and bullied the other children at the orphanage.

I don't hate you, but I do think this take is really strange.

Though for someone who purports to see the good and bad in everyone I get the sense that you're not exactly giving Dumbledore a fair shake.

​

Yes, because inheriting Magic was based on science, genetics. Magic was inherited by genes just like the ability to roll your tongue or your eye color. Mating with Muggles / Muggleborns watered down the magical genes pool. Muggles outnumbered Wizards and Witches like a bilion times- and Voldemort was afraid of the Ability of performing Magic is going to go extinct. I won't go deep into genetic crosses etc but this is the entire foundation of the Blood Supermacy in HP. I've read this in multiple sources. I dunno if the scientific theory Voldemort believed it is credible/correct or not, but the fact is that he didn't get his ideas from nowhere.

​

Yes, I absolutely agree that he didn't always treat his fllowers fairly - but he couldnt have been a d-ck for them always, because he wouldn't have had any followers at all . We have examples of him caring for his followers, like releasing them out of jail, letting them stay at the Riddle Manor at first and at Malfoy Manor later. He also saved Barty from his imprisonment under the Imperius Curse. And he made a new arm for Peter :P

​

I know he did kill people. This is not my point. Look- when Voldemort kills somebody, he is a heartless monster. When a person like Molly Weasley kills a person without any trace of guilt, remorse, anything - she is a hero.

The same goes for deceptions, lies, manipulations. Dumbledore does that all the time throughout the 7 books and in the past, and not even once is called out on it (maybe once by Aberforth). DD did disgusting things, and he is still considered a flawless, golden hero. This is hurtful.

​

Yes, he bullied kids in the orphanage. Also, he's been through so much, that probably his feelings and perception are messed up. I've spent 5 years in a youth work camp in the western europe. I have anxiety and ptsd. It just works that way.

​

And here I agree 100%. I should start noticing virues also in Dumbledore. I'm probably biased and I'm sorry.

****** Here are rebuttals to your points.

1. By killing the impure, because of his childhood. Causing change for change's sake is not a virtue.
2. While also creating anti-Muggleborn laws, showing that he values the lives of muggleborns below that of werewolves. This is only virtuous if you judge his actions on the basis of virtue alone while ignoring that he liberated the werewolves for non-virtuous purposes.
3. Abandons Quirrel to burn to death at Harry's hands. Was going to eat Ginny's soul after essentially child-grooming her. Makes Pettigrew's hand strangle him once he shows mercy.
4. Didn't tell any of the Death Eaters that he was a half-blood therefore his entire platform was based on a lie. Puppeted the Ministry instead of outright declaring himself ruler of Wizarding Britain. Child-groomed Ginny.
5. You can have sex and a kid without loving the woman or the kid. For example, Tom Riddle Sr.
6. Harry Potter was abused and neglected and didn't turn into a mass-murdering psychopath.

In summary, I do not believe that your points align with the events of the books.

******* 1-2 about the science and genetics of blood in HP please read above... And I don't say the Blood Purity Science is correct, but this is where Voldemort took his ideas from.

1. Yes, this all is correct and I agree.

4.Yes, this is also 100% true. He did lie about his blood status.

1. Him loving Bella and Delphini is actually canon. It's on Wiki/Pottermore.

6.About this, also please look above.

​

In summary, my point is not to purify Voldemort of all bad things he's done. He is the villain of the series and I'm aware of it. However, I'd like to put it into some context and perspective. I only want to show, that the golden "good guys" - especially Dumbledore - are not so flawless either, but everybody seems to fail to notice it.

********* "Bellatrix Lestrange was among Voldemort's most loyal and trusted [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Eaters][Death Eaters]]. She was entrusted with [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff%27s_Cup][one of his Horcruxes]], even though she was kept unaware of what it really was, and stored it in her [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank][Gringotts]] [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Lestrange_Vault][vault]]. She was fanatically loyal to her master as, after his first defeat in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1981][1981]], she did not join many of her fellow Death Eaters in denying their association with him. Instead, she proudly declared that she remained his most loyal servant and that he would surely return. She considered Azkaban a place where she could wait for him, rather than a prison.

Her obsession extended to her being in love with and sexually attracted to him. On at least one occasion, during a meeting of his Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor, her face flushed and her eyes welled up with tears when he praised her.

He did seem to consider her of greater importance than most of his other servants. He may have had at least a superficial affection for her, as he would call her "Bella" like other members of her family would. He seemed to be flattered by her unfaltering devotion as he praised her, along with her [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rodolphus_Lestrange][husband]] and [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rabastan_Lestrange][brother-in-law]] during his rebirth and promised that she would be rewarded; Snape later mentions that despite this he was more impressed by Snape's many years of useful information than Bellatrix's devotion however. At the conclusion of the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries][Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], he grabbed her and Apparated away with her; she was the sole Death Eater who he bothered to help, though this may have been more due to her closer proximity rather than preferential treatment. When she was killed by [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Molly_Weasley][Molly Weasley]] during the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts][Battle of Hogwarts]], he was furious, and intended to avenge her death when Harry intervened.

Although Bellatrix was married to one of Voldemort's other loyal Death Eaters, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rodolphus_Lestrange][Rodolphus Lestrange]], the union seemed to be nothing more than a business-like partnership. It was Voldemort to whom she spoke in a romantic manner. She was outraged by anyone showing him the slightest disrespect. When [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter][Harry Potter]] called him by his name in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1996][1996]], she became enraged, due to feeling that he was unworthy of speaking the name.

Unknown to nearly all, it would be revealed years later after their death that Bellatrix and Voldemort had in fact engaged in a sexual relationship, resulting in the birth of their daughter [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Delphini][Delphini]] who, years later, threatened to upset the timeline to be with her father. As Voldemort believed that he could cheat death, through his Horcruxes, he probably did not feel a need to leave a child behind as an heir. It is highly likely that he used the relationship with Bellatrix as a way to reward her for her undying loyalty to him, and for her rather potent and notable successes as his most loyal lieutenant. However, a reward appears to be unlikely considering Bellatrix's failures at the Ministry. "

****** Wow we have extremely different interpretations of canon.

For example I see Voldemort as being 100% selfish, in that he didn't care about revolutionizing the wizarding world at all, he just wanted to rule it because he was an egomaniac and hated muggles because he grew up as a psychopath in a shitty orphanage. Plus I see him as having treated all his followers terribly, by torturing them for the slightest disappointment, and definitely not giving a shit about any of them as people. Where as I view Dumbledore as caring very deeply about all of his followers, and not particularly lying or being manipulative very often.

Note I'm not saying your interpretation is wrong by the way, just saying we interpreted things very differently.

I know some people don't like it because it gets long and wordy, but I thought it was AMAZING. Up until the way it ended basically on an cliff hanger with no resolution. With the amount of time and the length of it and creativity the author put in, he could have found a way to actually resolve the Harry vs Voldemort conflict, instead of just quitting. Given that the author spent many years writing this, it's not surprising he ran out of steam and energy for it. But at the same time, I was expecting some sort of resolution at the end and never got it.

** HPMOR I think counts.

After some consideration, my opinion on HPMOR is that it's not the gospel that its supporters think it is nor is it the garbage its detractors think it is, but simply just a mediocre fanfiction. The biggest reason I think it deserves mockery is because the author wanted it to win a Hugo, but on its own merits it's just a mediocre HP fanfiction after the first 30 chapters or so.

The first 30 chapters are pretty okay (if you ignore the scene where Draco talks about wanting to rape Luna), since they've got the cool premise of a scientifically minded Harry discovering new spells, but then spell creation all but vanishes for tedious rip-offs of Ender's Game and an Azkaban break in with no real consequences. The last 10 chapters are quite epic. Everything in between is meh, as the fic doesn't stick to the premise of discovery like at all and the author takes a bit too much joy in mocking Rowling's world.

I will say this, it probably counts as a Super!Harry story but one that still keeps him within realistic limits. If you look it as a self-insert Super!Harry, it's one of the better ones out there because Harry ends up with meaningful limitations.

That said, I can't say how much of my opinion has been colored by its unofficial sequel, Significant Digits, which is (IMO) better than HPMOR.

That said, I think it deserves points beyond "just mediocre fanfiction" on grounds that it does genuinely novel and interesting things that you don't see across the other... /checks ffn/... 800k fics. If you're going to do things better, you're going to have to do them differently, and if you're doing things differently, some things are going to go wrong because most changes aren't improvements because the status quo got to where it was by several generations iteration.

Reading it requires not taking it too seriously (along the lines of 80s actions movies, where you don't think about how, for example, the fancy sciency mumbo jumbo they throw out doesn't actually make cohesive sense it you look close enough at it) but I think calling it mediocre fanfiction does it a disservice. The author himself didnt do it any favors with his conduct and that has become somewhat inextricable from the work itself. (Even regardless of the very Author-Expy nature of the protagonist)

Apart from anything else, it manages to wrap up every single plotline from the entire series /in one year/. That is not the work of a mediocre fanfic.

  Apart from anything else, it manages to wrap up every single plotline from the entire series in one year. That is not the work of a mediocre fanfic.
#+end_quote

I think this really was just an artistic choice that will be viewed as good or bad depending on the reader's opinion of the fanfic. I *personally* think shoving an expy of Ender's Game, an Azkaban breakout, a Wizengamot trial, SP(H)EW, and the defeat of Voldemort into /one year/ strains credibility and is a convenient handwave to avoid character growth by claiming that all the events only happened in one year and therefore "Harry" had little time to mature. Put it this way: a technically correct rewording of your statement is that it took 800k words to get through 1 year, which if I recall correctly is about or more than the words it takes to get through all 7 of the canon books.

I don't want to start a fight, but I think if you had said that it manages to wrap up all its plotlines in 800k words, your statement would not seem as impressive.

****** I don't necessarily disagree. In terms of proper pacing of the story it's definitely rushed, with many things squished in, to the point of, as you pointed out, it streching the suspension of disbelief a bit (though that aspect of the fic is hardly the worst offender of that crime, and the bit to try and cover those sorts of holes [namely Dumbledore's final reveal] is I suppose effective in that, but it in and of itself causes issues precisely because of how convenient it is).

But IIRC, the author explicitly stated that their goal was to resolve every single plotline in one year. So my statement is not "it is a great achievement in smooth, well planned, and well paced writing" so much as it is "the author went out to try to fit an enormous amount of plots, conflicts and resolutions in a (relatively) very narrow window of time, and managed to do so while having a coherent and at least somewhat interesting overarching plot."

However, I think a few chapters after Ron got to Hogwarts I started thinking "hmm, this seems to be dragging a bit." So I checked the wordcount and it is 840k words. I went to the most recent published chapter and it appears the story has only gotten to second year.

As I remember, all of Harry's memories of abusive!lily and James and sirius and remus had literally and physically happened to harry, but lily james sirius and remus were lucius and other death eaters poly juiced, and the memories were only altered so as to fill in any gaps (like the environment and such.) Voldemort deliberately made his death eaters abuse Harry under false identities to create the memories needed to alienate him from his parents.

And that's not even touching on how drawn out the 'reveal' was. The only reason it takes that long to get there is because of the characters total inability to talk to each other.

Not to say that having a reveal drawn out is bad writing per se, but the method through with the author accomplishes it leaves a lot to be desired.

The first book is pretty good, but from the second one onward it's a trainwreck. I could discount the huge (1-2k words!) rambling paragraphs, the inconsistent characterization, stilted and awkward dialogue, unrealistic teenagers (and not in a good way), the way the plot warps to increase Harry's importance, the unnecessary long-winded descriptions... I could excuse any of those things in a vacuum. But the problem is, they all compound together, making the reading experience miserable. I caught myself actually becoming angry, as I really wanted to read this.

*** Aww, that's one of my favorite fics. Plot warping to increase Harry's importance usually bother me, but doesn't in this fic for some reason. Unrealistic teenagers doesn't really bother me much since I don't really want to read the conversations or thought processes of actual 11 year olds. I don't really recall the dialogue being that stilted and awkward though, certainly not compared to some other fics I've tried to read, and given up on as the dialogue was horrendous. I'm usually not really a fan of tons of slice of life stuff, so gonna have to disagree there too.

** The Saving Connor series. I really liked the depth that she used to write with, the fight scenes, the realisticness of what the war was like, not the watered down version of the books, the rituals, traditions and such. I know its the typical wrong boy who lived premise, with parents/Albus /Gryffindors abusing Harry, and Snape/Slytherins are of course the good guys in all of it.

ButI hated how she wrote Draco and Connor. Both are the same person, one is a Gryffindor and the other a Slytherin. Both selfish brats and both very unrealistic actions/feelings towards Harry. Connor is throwing away his only friend and brother on the say so of Ron, a boy he's know for less than 12 hours and Draco just acting moronic, acting as if Harry is his puppy. Several times I expected him to pat Harry's head and say "good boy" to him. I was able to get through 5 1/2 of the books, and would eventually like to finish, but...

*** I really liked the series when I first read it, mostly for the dark side - aside of the traditions and rituals, I loved how alien their mindsets seemed, when compared to regular people - there it is, a civilization that broke itself from nonmagicals, evolved differently, and whose people were absolutely different from the canon nonmagicals, and I could support the dark side since trying to push the two civilizations together again just made no sense.. Even Draco'd behavior and possessiveness worked into that, I just tossed it on the alien wayof thinking and went with that.

But then a few years later I tried to read it again, and...cringe. Though I thik it was mostly my way of thinking that changed after reading much more fanfiction, I just couldn't handle that much self-sacrifice as Harry had, again xD;

  Tied to a tombstone, being tortured by Voldemort. Harry wanted it to end. His mind, his soul cried for someone, anyone to help him. He hadn't expected for someone to actually answer. Now he will learn the truth about the Potter bloodline and prepare himself for the war that is at their doorstep. However, unlike what he had thought, he won't be facing what is coming on his own.

** A lot of these stories are based on not meeting expectations. I typically always go into a story expecting the worst tropes and zero originality---and therefore rarely get disappointed. Take the Darkness Within---I never expected a ‘good Voldemort' because it never occurred to me at the time that he could be good (I was still a new reader, just venturing into AU territory). As such, I considered the ‘plot twist' just a logical step which I could see coming from far away rather than a surprise that detracted from the originality.

--------------

I'm not sure how it is for everyone else but I sort of go through "cycles." By that I mean in some weeks I enjoy tragic stories, in others I won't read anything but fluff. Sometimes I only look for fem!Harry, other times I skip anything that isn't canon-compliant. I believe that my bookmarks contain almost 50 fics that I have never read. At the time, I wasn't in the right mood for it---and I knew it---so I didn't even try to read it. At the same time, I recognized it as a good story (probably) and so I kept it to read later. Many of the stories posted here have been on that list at some point. How is this relevant? Well, I think it determines what expectations you have. Some days, I just want a serious dark fic---and no matter how funny it is, a crack fic will not satisfy me. The same goes to most of these stories---they're a disappointment because you were hoping for something else, and didn't get it. To you it would be disappointing, but to others, that could be ‘the perfect fic' which they were looking for.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this topic is completely subjective (much more so than many other topics I've come across on this sub) and the fact that someone out there found such-and-such to be disappointing doesn't mean you will. If you came to this post looking for fics to avoid, I'd advise you to give them a try anyways. Chances are, you'll probably agree with them---but then again, you might find it to be the perfect fic. It all depends on what you expect the story to be.

I honestly don't see how this post will be helpful, except as a dumping site for arguments and personal frustrations.

(I don't know where I was going with this comment but since I wrote this much already, I might as well post it. Please don't downvote me into oblivion.)

*** Who would downvote you into oblivion...? The other way around, thank you for sharing your thoughts.

And You are right that this topic is subjective, and is absolutely NOT posted for finding fics to avoid :) Yes, I might find Darkness Within and Twins disappointing, while others might find it briliant.

The point of this topic is to write about our subjective disappointments. Everybody describes their experiences, so I think this post might be somehow helpful .

And, personal frustrations are welcomed too :)

BTW- your approach- not expecting much, is cool - it can really help avoiding disappointments. The worst you can do is expecting a golden mountain from a fic :)

** Everyone has already mentioned The Darkness Within, which I still enjoy but can acknowledge it's second half and sequels are pretty mediocre at best, but I'm gonna throw a dark horse out there.

I haven't seen a single person talk about the disappointment that is The Augurey linkffn(12310861). Such an amazing premise cut down at the knees by weak writing and bad characterization. It starts off pretty well enough, Harry finds out Delphini exists and adopts her as his daughter. But as time goes on, it becomes clear that the author cares infinitely more about a romantic plot between Harry and Hermione, and believes that Hermione is literally the greatest character to grace modern fiction. Harry is degraded into a man who literally has zero thought processes in his mind and literally attacks people for no reason, and Hermione is praised as a woman who's always right and can literally do no wrong. When I dropped it around chapter 26 or so, after Harry literally punched Draco in his own home for literally no reason at all, Delphini hadn't been featured for at least almost ten chapters, and the story had degraded to your typical HP/HG romance.
