Severina? Severette? Is this a thing that exists?


** Haven't seen any -- but I did plot out a potential "female Snape" story, which I didn't actually write, over at [[/r/harrypotter]].

The OP asked the question "What if Snape was a woman and the childhood friend of/in love with James instead of Lily?" and I sort of took that premise and went with it...

#+begin_quote
  I thought about it. Let's take two things as read:

  1: Severus Snape is a woman in this AU --- let's call her "Sevanna." 2: Sevanna Snape was a childhood friend of James, not Lily.

  Okay. At once that means that Sevanna's childhood is very different. If she and James are friends before Hogwarts, she can't grow up in the Muggle world because James is pure-blood; she has to grow up in the wizarding world. And this probably means she grows up without an abusive father. Okay, fathers can be abusive in the wizarding world too, but canon Snape's father was a Muggle and abusive towards his wife and son. I don't believe a Muggle who lived in the wizarding would would ever be allowed to take it that far, so the easiest solution then is that Tobias Snape died and Eileen decided to move back to wizarding society, ending up living close to the Potter family.

  So, Sevanna Snape would grow up different. Not the bitter, abused child with a temperamental father and a weak mother, an outsider in the Muggle world, but raised by a single mother in a wizarding world. Perhaps she would be neglected by the stressed Eileen... but in that case, I think Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, loving and indulgent parents as they were to James, would pretty much take her under their wing, and become like a spare set of parents for the girl.

  In that case, it would be a much different, much happier, more loved and certainly less bitter Sevanna Snape who first started Hogwarts along with James. Given James's prejudices against Slytherin (which he would express when they first met Sirius Black), Sevanna would absolutely refuse to be placed in Slytherin. The Sorting Hat might try to put her there, but she would beg: "Not Slytherin! Not Slytherin! James would hate me!" And so I think she would end up --- not in Gryffindor with her beloved James, but in Ravenclaw.

  Because if a Snape isn't a Slytherin, (s)he is a Ravenclaw.

  Would a Ravenclaw Sevanna Snape still end up with a bad crowd and become a Death Eater? Hard to say, but I think the Potters would have influenced her enough that she didn't. She might get a little jealous when James started hanging out so much with his three new friends, Sirius, Remus and Peter... maybe she'd even get curious where they sneaked off to every month too... but the Snape/Marauders feud would not exist. Instead, there might end up to be a feud between Sevanna and Lily. I think James would, like in canon, be interested in Lily pretty early, and that would REALLY awaken Sevanna's jealousy. It wouldn't help that she and Lily had a lot of things in common: Both really talented witches, both favoured by Slughorn, both great with potions... and as time went on, both would be really interested in James. I could see a bitter rivalry growing between them, one that would get worse when James finally chose Lily.

  What would Sevanna do then? Several possibilities. She might desperately try to throw herself at James. She might try to get Lily in trouble. She might just break all ties with them both and go off alone, heartbroken and embittered.

  But. One thing strikes me. I still don't think she would join the Death Eaters. And so, there is nobody to overhear the prophecy told to Dumbledore, at least no-one that will tell it to Voldemort. Since the prophecy actually hinges on Voldemort knowing the first two lines... in this universe Trelawney does not make the prophecy. And so she isn't hired as Divination teacher, the subject is discontinued at Hogwarts, and Voldemort does not fall.

  Voldemort never targets Lily and James, Sirius is never sent to Azkaban. Peter might still join the Death Eaters and act as a spy, but he doesn't get to frame Sirius for being the spy because he never gets such a perfect opportunity as the swapped Secret-Keepers. Instead he loses his nerve, fakes his death and high-tails it out of the country without anyone ever discovering his status as a double agent.

  When Fleamont and Euphemia die shortly before Harry is born, Sevanna (who viewed them as a second pair of parents) makes up with James. She still does not get along with Lily, but has made her peace with the Potter family.

  And so, Harry grows up with both his parents, but in a much darker wizarding world, knowing Sevanna Snape as "Dad's lady friend that Mum doesn't like." Voldemort still reigns, several people who lived in canon are killed in this universe. Hogwarts, still the only really safe place, becomes a bit of a refugee for Muggle-borns.

  And the plot becomes another one entirely!

Er, I think I missed something. Why would Trelawney not make the prophecy in the first place?

**** That's my reading of things....

Trelawney's prophecy only came true because Snape overheard it and told it to Voldemort. It's the classic "Greek Tragedy" setup, where Voldemort himself in trying to stop the prophecy from coming true made sure that it did.

If Snape isn't there to overhear, then there's no chance of Voldemort finding out and making the prophecy happen... hence the prophecy has no chance of happening.

In which case I don't think Trelawney would even make it, because even if not all prophecies have to come true, they need to at least have the POSSIBILITY to come true.

***** Well there is the chance that she says it, and Dumbledore, knowing the self-fulfilling nature of prophecies, somehow allows Riddle to learn about it, thus allowing the prophesy to be valid... he probably isn't that mean tho (to endanger the potters and Longbottoms) Also there is no evidence prophecies can't happen without them coming true, aside from the 2 we see coming true. Probably most of the ones in the hall of prophecy never came true

****** Also I'm pretty sure that Dumbledore doesn't really hold that much weight in prophecies, but since Voldemort does and has heard at least some of it, he has to take the first one at least somewhat seriously.

****** I can't find the scene now, but I think there is a part in the book where Dumbledore says that prophecies don't have to come true and that severall of the prophecies in the Hall didn't... so you're not wrong.

Problem with this particular prophecy is that the entire thing hinges on Voldemort knowing the first two lines, which won't happen without Snape eavesdropping. And it doesn't seem in character for Dumbledore to assure that it happens either, especially not with the "prophecies don't have to come true" speech....

I'm fairly sure that while prophecies don't HAVE to come true, there has to be at least a good CHANCE for them to come true. So I still say that the only reason Trelawney made that prophecy to begin with was because Snape overheard the first part of it.

That waid... I'll admit that I hate the prophecy and would very much like to have a world where it never happened, so I might be biased.

***** There is also the possibility that in a world where most of the initial Universe is still the same, the prophecy remains too, like a fixed point, and another person is here to overhear it. After all, Sevanna being in Ravenclaw must have an influence on Voldemort's Slytherin sympathizers, however small, which could lead to one of them finding themselves in the same situation as canon!Snape.

If the consequences of an alternate premise can be determined in terms of the effort it takes to shift events and circumstances from the initial setup (which is a big assumption, I know), I would say that having another person overhear the beginning of the Prophecy and then telling Voldemort is "easier" (less costly for a closer result to the initial outcome) than erasing the whole Prophecy altogether.

I've always been of the opinion that if you're going to do an AU anyway, then don't get lazy and just swap out one or two details; go full Butterfly Effect and really see how much you can change!

Hell it's probably something they already do to make sure that the first child is whatever sex they need their heir to be. I can guarantee that if sex change magic actually existed IRL that every monarchy in history would have coincidentally had a son as a first child.
