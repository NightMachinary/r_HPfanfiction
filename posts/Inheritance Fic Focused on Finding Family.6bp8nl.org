Like the title says, I'd love to read an inheritance fic in which Harry discovers he is the heir of some wealthy family but doesn't care about the /political power/ he gets. Instead, what he wants is to get to know a family, no matter if they're only his great grandfather's sister's family or something equally distant.


** linkffn(11674317) harry is the heir to the black family and doesn't care about anything he inheirits but wants all the members to act like a family and that includes Andromeda, Nyhmphedora, Narcissa, Draco and even Bellatrix. he also becomes really close to the Addams family who he finds out shares a internal magic similar to the blacks that affects the sanity of the members.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

**** If you've seen the series even just one episode, you'll understand it. It ends up being Addams family+ as things only hinted at in the series and movies actual are done.

Also note in the 90's movies Morticia and Gomez have another child, that is literally it
