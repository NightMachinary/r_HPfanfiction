So, kind of a trope subversion. Salazar Slytherin's portrait (when it appears) is generally some super God Ex Machina used to advance Harry's training by a frankly absurd amount.

But then it got me thinking: this is a portrait, so limited perception and almost no capabilities of interacting with the world; Salazar Slytherin lived about a thousand years previously to cannon, in this time much of his knowledge would become outdated as new spells, potions and discovers about magical theory are invented, to say nothing of the language barrier formed by such a great gap between generations and last but not least an entire millennium of isolation is bound to make someone go crazy.

Thus it would make much more sense for Slytherin to be a shit instructor rather than the almost godlike one he is often shown. Would love to read a story in which Harry goes into his secret lair to get taught by a legend only to then be given spells that cost an ungodly amount of power and have effects less powerful than the ones from modern spells by a complete nut-job that makes the joker seem like the paragon saint on sanity and rational thinking who can only scream instructions (frequently contradictory ones) and has no way of demonstrating spells whatsoever.


** What really happens when Harry finds the portrait:

Salazar: Hwa earun ðu?

Harry: What? I... don't understand.

Salazar: ðu ádela biedan m bieda gyrblōd hóran!

Harry: What?

***** It could be, but it appears to be a magically/genetically inherited language you're born knowing and never have to learn. Harry is able to understand what diary Riddle says to the thousand year old basilisk after all.

** Harry was not going back this summer! After last summer he refused to return to his Aunt and Uncle's house. He had called out to Hedwig trying to get a letter to Dobby when he had shown up on his own. He had promised some of his magic to Dobby if Dobby would help him out over the summer.

He had packed his trunk and made his way down to the train before skiving off and making his way up to the castle with his invisibility cloak. The way into the Chamber of Secrets was still there and he had made it down quick enough. He had shown Dobby what was down there last night and the House Elf had clearly been hard at work. The slide had been cleaned, the landing was well lit and clean as well. Walking into the chamber he was surprised to see the Basilisk gone already.

Dobby had said he would see it was taken care of and he had done an excellent job of doing so. He found the room was no longer flooded but had a great deal of work to be done to it still. None the less there was a bed there already and a desk to sit at. For the first day it was more than enough.

Dobby had promised he would make so 'The Great Harry Potter' could keep using magic down there without worry from the ministry.

They spent the first week cleaning the place up. Harry had told Dobby in no uncertain terms he wanted to help clean. After several minutes of wailing at how humble the 'Greatest Wizard Harry Potter' was Dobby had disappeared and returned shortly with a book on cleaning and restoring homes.

It had been the most fun outside of quidditch he had ever had. Just using magic for something practical and immediately useful. Years of living with the Dursley's had given him a rather practical mindset in someways. Turning a brick into a banana was interesting but not useful. Especially as you couldn't even eat the banana according to Gamp's laws. What the hell was the purpose of that spell exactly?

They had found a room sealed underwater at the end of the week. It was an ancient room filled with many thick tomes. He had looked at a few and couldn't even make sense of what the hell language they were written in. Maybe he would see about changing his elective to ancient runes so he could make sense of them.

What made him interested was the large portrait of Salazar Slytherin. The man was not a refined or elegant looking by any means. No he had rather angry look to him and he was actually far more muscled then he looked at first.

The portrait stirred as he got closer and he realized that it was a living portrait! This was incredible! The man began talking and Harry realized he had no fucking clue what the man was saying.

It might a good idea to switch his elective next semester to Ancient Runes after all.

The man stopped and seemed to have an idea. He looked off to the side and pulled a snake up to his hands that was hidden in the portrait.

/Until otherwise all speech between them will be in Parseltongue./

"Young man can you understand me now?"

Harry looked up in surprise and noticed the snake, of course, Parseltongue! He focused on the snake and then replied.

"Yes Mr. Slytherin sir, I can understand you now. Can you understand me as well?"

Salazar nodded and continued on.

"My portrait has been sleeping for a great deal of time it seems. What is the year and what is your name lad?"

"It is the Year 1993 and I am Harry Potter sir!"

Salazar frowned, he had slept in his portrait for nearly a thousand years! What the hell had happened? Also Potter? He knew a Petra family of Roman Lordship who were famous for their pottery. Perhaps the name had changed over the thousand years.

"Tell me, what is the state of Hogwart's School of Magic! Have we finally raised the armies and rule the isle?"

Harry knew it would be a long day at that statement and settled himself in for what would likely be a long conversation.

He was right, it had taken him almost a week to satisfy Salazar's thirst for knowledge but Harry hoped it would be worth it! He had a chance to learn from the portrait of one of the founders!

Salazar had decided to test the boy on his knowledge as a first year and it had been a rather mixed bag.

No longer was martial arms taught at all. Though from what the Potter boy had said to him it was not a surprise. The stories of these longbows was rather frightening, much less these alchemical weapons that fired solid metal projectiles at great speed, accuracy and rate with ease the mundanes had invented.

The sheer terror he had felt when he had learned of these nukes, weapons capable to destroying entire cities with millions of people in seconds dropped from the sky was beyond compare.

That said the boy had a talent for magic and spoke of many great and useful spells as common place things any child would learn!

Why you could turn a mouse into a teacup with only a simple flick of a wand! What joy that would have been to have while alive.

He knew some great battle magics but they took time to cast and great power as well. He had quizzed the boy one his potion knowledge and was once again finding himself having little to teach the boy.

For now though he was keeping it to the side and teaching him the old language so that the boy could at least read his journals and tomes.

Harry was disappointed to say the least. Salazar was an old racist fucker whose only redeeming qualities was he was rather equal minded on gender, Helga had been one hell of a battlemage it seemed, and that he was a rather good language teacher. Harry had quickly learned to hide his blood status.

Also he seemed to hate the 'Northern Barbarians', those 'French Bastards', the 'Filthy Moors', the 'Redhaired Devil Spawn', those 'Uselessly Ignorant Celts', and pretty much anyone who wasn't of Roman Blood.

Who would have guessed that Salazar had been a Roman War Mage before founding the school. Apparently he was tired of the Empire allowing the 'Dirty Fake Jews', who he also hated, to take control had been the last straw. He was well into his second century when Hogwarts had been founded. He had left with the installment of Charlemagne it seemed.

Honestly if the language lessons weren't so great he would have left the portrait in the dark. What really drew him in though was the offhand comment about the Petra family being roman potters of renown who had been on the Isle for some time already.

He had asked Dobby to find any books he could find on Petra and the Potter family history. After a few weeks of reading and finding new books, one a well written book on Petra by a muggle woman he found the connection. That alone endeared the useless portrait to him.

Honestly though he could really do without the constant racism on the whole damn world during his lessons.

Still he was learning at a great rate the languages Salazar was teaching him. It helped that even if he was a portrait he was still a genius. He understood the basics of what he was studying for next year easily enough and offered a useful bit of help sometimes.

Still, the goddamn racism was really fucking annoying. He figured he would be at least three times further along in his language studies if the man didn't keep breaking into rants in said language about some presumed inferiority of whatever race he was hating on at the moment.

Harry had almost set fire to the portrait after he made the mistake of mentioning goblins and Gringotts bank.

Dear lord had the man went off on a tangent for days after that. He hated the goblins more than he hated the jews, moors, or christians. Which honestly was a rather impressive feat all things considered. He had made Harry promise to remove all of his money from those 'filthy animals' as soon as he could.

Harry had no idea where else to put all his damn money and it's not like Voldemort didn't know how to get into the chamber. So he just nodded along and said he would once he got a chance.

While it had been great all summer being away from the Dursley's he was ready for school to start again. He was well over half done with his third year studies already simply due to the portraits constant prodding. He didn't change over to ancient runes and he had a much better teacher he figured.

Dobby had more than a few times helped him sneak out of he castle and stretch his legs in the forest. Which had been farmland in the days of Salazar it seemed. Shit changes over a thousand years, go figure.

Dobby had been an even greater help getting his letter before it was sent out and doing his school shopping for him. He planned to just mingle in with the crowd on the opening feast this year and skip the train ride altogether.

That had worked out well though he did have to say he had been especially tired after sleeping poorly the night before and had slept the whole train ride through. He had apologized that they couldn't find him but he had been dogged tired.

It had worked well enough, though he did keep finding himself from having to correct Hermione on her homework for ancient runes. She had an absolutely horrible accent, it sounded like a french dog throwing up after eating a barrel of rocks.

That was another thing, Salazar had rubbed off on him and he found himself having to check his words as he was constantly talking shit about everyone except for Romans.

Hermione had not taken to being called a 'dirty vampire cult loving christian she demon' well at all. Oh well, whatever.

** This. It makes me crazy the way some fics depict the teaching of thousand-year-old magic as so vastly superior to modern magic like somehow they started at the peak of magical knowledge and have declined slowly to the present-day level. That isn't how it works.

I'd love to see a fic where one of the founders shows up and is astonished at what modern wix can do!

*** I get where you're coming from, but that's exactly how it works in many settings.

Lost ancient knowledge and older is better and fading magic are very common tropes.

Canon doesn't really do it, but there's enough for the fandom to feed on. Merlin is sort of revered. Founders kinda are as well, to a lesser extent. The founders had legendary magical artifacts. The greatest alchemy achievement by far was done by really old people. Hogwarts is one of the greatest magical places in the world, built long ago. The deathly hallows are ancient.

**** Oh, I'm familiar enough with the trope in general. Idon't mind it when it's done well, but too often it's used to justify giving the lead character Amazing Cosmic Powers... oops, sorry, wrong story there.. fantastical magical abilities that could no way be justified otherwise. It's almost as bad as the trope where Harry takes a self defense classes over the summer and ends up with a martial arts black belt or three.

It's one thing to have a certain set of information lost - a potion or spell, or even a particular group or type of them. It is something else entirely to have everything from the prior age be superior unless there's been a dark age, or some other reason is given for the loss of knowledge, between then and the current age.

*** Can't remember the name, but there was a Harry reincarnated as Slytherin that did this. He spent his most of his Dursley years drinking in muggle advancements before saying 'screw this' and apparating to the Chamber of Secrets. He just kinda hung around the castle for the summer devouring the library and the status of modern magic. He was particularly impressed with a disillusionment charm. Once students arrived he recognized his old friend Godric (a 1st year Cedric), who pointed out modern brooms were VERY different from their ancient death traps.

  Salazar Slytherin did not have an easy life, and he finally died alone after an argument with his dearest friends. Then he was reborn. Somehow. But life as the Boy Who Lived might be too much even for him. At least he doesn't have to do it alone.
