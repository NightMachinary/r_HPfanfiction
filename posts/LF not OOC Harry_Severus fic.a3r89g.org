Previously I would block this tagged because there's so many badly written Snape and Gary Stus, and I find age gap relationships to be too morally conflicting for me and I would rather relax when I read fics, y'know? But 2 fics, World in Pieces and Swing by Seraphim were technically NOT a shipfic. But they handle H & SS relationship extremely well that it convinced me into becoming a fan. Any recs? Ofc I'm a slut for slow burn.


** Harry and Snape being together is OOC so good luck
