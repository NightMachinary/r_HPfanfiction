I'm looking for HP & Game of Thrones/ A Song of Ice and Fire featuring Ginny. I've already read linkffn(The Witch Queen of Essos) and linkffn(Legend of the Gryphon) and I'm looking for something similar if it is out there. Any suggestions?

She's tired of witnessing death, so when Gregor Cleange goes to eliminate Rheagar's legacy, she begins her demolition of the Lannisters and the legend of the Witch Queen. AU
