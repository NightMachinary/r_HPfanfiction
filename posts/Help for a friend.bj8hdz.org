My friend recently published a fic. It's only one chapter long, and is a crossover with the MCU. It would really appreciated if my friend got feedback, I told him it was good and he didnt believe me. Again its optional

  Nymphadora Tonks, longtime friend of Harry Potter knows he is alive. Alive somewhere, and when she visits Germany one day, well she gets caught up in a storm. As for Harry, he is cruising the Galaxy with his rag tag group of friends. AU! Different BWL! May be M later!

** This is the review i left.

​

It needs polish. It has many minor mistakes that accumulate into a general unpleasant feeling.

Typos: "I am" or "I'm" not I'am, "hear" and not "here", "Thought Nymphadora Tonks." the Thought with a lowercase t, "Ginkgo" not "Gingko" (the first time he is mentioned).

Missing words: ("After he said [that]", indicating [that] he got back from work).

Incorrect or unusual phrasing: "she said mockingly, making Harry grin." sounds better than "She said in a mock voice causing Harry to grin." (mock voice is not a phrase thats widely used, also the s from She should be lowercase), "yelled Lily, after repairing the broken bowl with a simple Reparo" or even "yelled Lily, having repaired the broken bowl with a simple Reparo" sounds better than "Yelled Lily, who had just repaired the broken bowl with a simple Reparo." (again with the Y being lowercase). Avoid using complex sentences to describe simple things.

In general, when you are explaining who said something right after the phrase they said, use a lowercase letter.

The problem here is the quantity of the mistakes, once or twice can be ignored. But this amount of errors will cause headaches to readers.

There are many more instances of the above-mentioned mistakes, too many to list here (i'm not his Beta after all) and that's just on the technical side.

​

Plot-wise there's also a lot of work to be done.

Tip: Don't try to explain in the Author Notes how you lost your pc/hard drive/files/whatever and now all the future chapters are gone; trust me on this, everyone has seen these types of excuses many, many times. Even if it actually happened, don't say it. Simply point out that there will be a delay and that you will try to rectify it.

Firstly: Slow down, no one is rushing you.

There is no need to out every single plot point in the first chapter. I completely understand how you feel, you have this amazing idea for a plot and you want to get it out now. But rushing it will only blast the reader with information, chasing them away. You have an Alternate Universe, there are a lot of things that you know but the reader doesn't. Start off with a prologue, explain who the main characters are, give a short summary of the events leading up to the start of the story. If you don't, then issues may arise. For example: Nymphadora Tonks in cannon is about 6 years older than Harry. Since you didn't mention ages at all i can safely assume that the age difference is the same here as in cannon. Nymphadora is pretty childish so i can easily imagine a 16 year old Nym tackling an 11 year old Harry (since, again, you have not mentioned their ages and you have changed the timeline [it's 2008] i assume Harry is 11 since that's a common fanfiction starting point [I only saw your little timeline later, you put it outside of the chapter title and inside the Author Note; since i ignore Author Notes in principle i didn't see it. The timeline belongs inside the story, preferably inside the summary i mention above]. Then you have Nym and Harry snog. At that point i imagined a 16 year old snogging an 11 year old right out of the blue. I think you can tell why that was a shock.

That one short chapter should've been 3 bigger ones. It just doesn't feel real if everything's so rushed.

​

Consider getting someone to Beta read your story, i believe it will help.
