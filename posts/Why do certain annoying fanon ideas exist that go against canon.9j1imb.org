There are some "plot holes" in canon that fanon writers try to plug with explanations (i.e. why no one noticed Harry's mistreatment) but there are some canon facts that people ignore without explaining why they needed to and honestly those facts were not relevant to their stories, so why change them? I give a few examples below but there are others. Some things, like having an evil Dumbles, are necessary for the story if for example you want a tragic or dark Harry, but other things don't have an impact yet they're added in or changed anyway.

1. Fanon says Harry is short as an adult but canon has him being his father's height which was tall.
2. Fanon uses Hogwarts tuition but JKR clearly states that Hogwarts is a public school and free to attend.
3. Fanon gives Harry metamorphmagus abilities when the only thing he's ever done is an incident as a child where he accidentally regrew his hair after a full night of worrying about it.


** The whole point of fanfiction is rewriting the stories existing franchises to one's own liking. They dont have to go with Canon if they don't want to. Plus, there are explanations for the three mistakes you pointed out.

1. They describe Harry as being short because Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who played Harry, is a shorter man. The movies and their depictions of characters are easier to remember than the books.

2. Hogwarts is a boarding school, a type of school that is typically private and has a tuition for the families of students to pay. For this one, they're just going off of trends from real life.

3. I don't really get this one since I've never actually seen this trope played out before, so I'm just gonna guess that fanfic writers just want to imagine Harry as an metamorphagus because it's a cool ability.

It's also the case that the bit about Hogwarts being maintained by the Ministry appears nowhere in the books. It's also implied by the scene in PS where Vernon angrily insists he's not going to pay for Harry to go to Hogwarts and Hagrid points out that Harry is also provided for /without mentioning that this is because Hogwarts is publicly funded/. The easiest inference - especially once we see the vault with mounds of gold - is that his parents paid his school fees in advance, a deal that some fee-paying schools do offer.

Hogwarts being a state school ('public school' means private fee-paying school in Britain, no it doesn't make sense, we don't care) funded by the Ministry comes from remarks JKR made, if I recall correctly, on twitter. I can kind of see fanon's point on this one.

**** To be honest, Arthur is the /head/ of a department in the Britain magical government. Perhaps a department which is looked down upon, but it's obviously a necessary one. It's always been my headcanon that the reason the Weasley family is poor is not because Arthur doesn't get paid well, but rather that he has to pay for seven children to go through school. Everything from supplies to tuition. Most families in canon, even amongst muggleborns, aren't typically depicted as having more than one or two children.

To be completely honest, political associations aside, I don't see how the Weasley family wouldn't become one of the most influential families in Wizarding Britain once all of their children mature and exit Hogwarts.

Charlie works with dangerous creatures, dragons specifically. Presumably this is a well paying occupation, given how hazardous and skilled the labor must be.

Bill works for what, as far as we know, appears to be the banking monopoly for Wizards as a curse breaker. Influential enough in his role to help a foreign witch, Fleur Delacour, to get a job there.

Percy immediately ascends high in the ministry.

Fred and George become business men and, from what we can tell, are VERY successful.

Ron and Ginny, as well as the rest of the Weasley family, are very closely tied to who would realistically be the most publicly influential person in /at least/ Britain, Harry Potter.

There's no fucking way the Weasleys don't become the most powerful family in the fucking nation.

***** Some of that isn't true at the start of the series, but I see your point - it's one of the plot holes I guess, JKR wanted a poor friend with a large gifted family so she forced one. I'm not sure why I never thought of Hogwarts as having tuition - I guess maybe because the Weasleys would sometimes grumble about the cost of supplies but never the tuition?

******** Agreed. I was speaking more to the time frame, than anything. In the first book there were 4 Weasley children still in Hogwarts and in the second there were 5. It took time for everyone to get out and get established in their careers, which just happens to coincide with "after the events of canon".

To be completely honest, the Weasleys likely would have risen to prominence even faster if Voldemort /hadn't/ come back. If anything everyone had to be involved with helping to rebuild the nation, Hogwarts, etc. I can't imagine the Weasley family wouldn't have also gained some influence given their skill sets in rebuilding, but I'm not sure what the trade off would have been. I'll leave that up to fanfiction writers to decide for themselves.

True, but in a lot of cases the departures are not intentional changes, but instead mistakes --- the author genuinely thought this was canon. I'll grant you Point 3, which does seem like a choice. But certainly, there are (or were, quite recently) many people who don't /know/ that Hogwarts isn't canonically a paying school, and will drop references to Hogwarts tuition off-handedly without /meaning/ to go AU.

** On point 2, JKR revealed that on a tweet, in 2015.

[[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/622118373061709824]]

It's an obscure tidbit. You can't really blame writers for not knowing that. Majority of fics are even written before that.

Also, people have different definitions of "canon". Some people are strictly book, some include the movies etc. Some fans don't consider things JKR says post-publication of DH canon so you have to consider that as well.

And point 3 is an intentional tweak to drive plot. Tweaks generally go against canon. But they're also basically the backbone of fanfiction. If you don't want little tweaks like that you're going to have a VERY limited pool of fics to read.

** As far as point 2 goes, I didn't know that JKR stated that Hogwarts is a public school. She didn't say it in the books.

I feel absolutely no compulsion to follow JKR and know everything she says outside of the books pertaining to the Harry Potter universe. I may come across something she said, and if I like it or don't mind it, I'll use it. But I shouldn't be pressured to follow her on twitter, watch the interviews with her, etc, to make sure that I'm being totally compliant with her words.

I'll be compliant with her books, but anything apart from that is fair game for interpretation.

** 1: Harry suffered through ten years of Dursley abuse (which included starvation if CoS is any indication, since it implies that withholding meals was a regular thing and the rations he gets there total 500 kcal/day) and was notoriously short in the first book, even compared to other kids. Given that this was never treated, it is only logical to assume that he would never be as tall as he could have been without the Dursleys.

As someone who actually writes Harry as shorter than average, I include it merely to add some consequences to the Dursleys since ignoring child abuse is bad writing IMO. Harry is functional, no doubt there, but he has the scars so to speak.

**** It can still knock a couple inches off. Stunting during development is pretty damaging in particular. I did a lil' bit of reading on studies of children who suffered from malnutrition who were around 36 months when they were taken away from the environment causing that and while some did get back on track with their genetics, a bunch also didn't.

I didn't fully read it and it seems kinda old but yeah. An interesting thing they observed was that girls had an easier time bouncing back than boys did too.

Of course, if the writer is making them tiny that's a bit much. But 5'6 maybe? That's the average height for men in England last time I checked. Edit: NVM it's 5'9. I'm 5'7 myself and I know plenty of men who are a little shorter than me.

*** Height doesn't really work that way. An individual's height is primarily determined by genetics. So if James is tall and Lily is presumably tall*, then Harry more likely would been tall as an adult. Diet possibly can influence height but not as significantly as one might think.

Most fics that describe Harry as short are basing this off of the movies.

*this is a reach but I'm assuming that Lily is tall only because Petunia is described as being tall.
