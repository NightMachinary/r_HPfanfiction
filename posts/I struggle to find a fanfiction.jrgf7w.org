:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok, hello I struggle to find a fanfiction, which pairing is Harry and Daphne. Summary ( what I remember) is that Harry already knows Daphne and are really close but they haven't seen each other in a while and then Daphne 'thinks' of Harry and Harry apperates to Daphne, because he feels she needs him, and it keeps happening. P.s Harry grows up with Sirius.


** I think the fic you are looking for is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11088456/1/No-Matter-What]] Harry has the ability to operate at a young age and is a harry daphne story
