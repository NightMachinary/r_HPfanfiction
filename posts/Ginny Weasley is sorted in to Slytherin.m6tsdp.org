Ginny Weasley is sorted in to Slytherin house in her first year. This creates distance from her brothers and other family members. They still love her, of course, she is their precious baby Ginny after all. But as the first Slytherin Weasley in centuries she's looked at with suspicion by others. How did a Weasley end up in Slytherin? Must be evil.

The other Slytherins are intrigued at first. A Weasley? A member of the Sacred 28 in their house? Could she be different from her blood traitor relatives?

Oh? She's not? Time to bully her relentlessly.

Turning out to be the Heir of Slytherin at the end of the year (even if it's only via possession) really, really didn't help her case either.

How do you think the rest of her life would go?


** I would suggest you read the Changeling and Armistice series by Annerb to find out :D
