Plenty of stories mention witch hunts and exorcism, but that's about all I've seen. Is real world religion in the context of HP too controversial? I'd love to read about a kid discovering magic after being raised by very religious muggles- anything from fundamentalist Christians to new age pagans to satanists. Or about muggle religious figures actually being wizards. Or a modern rogue wizard pretending to be a messiah. Any stories like that?


** Self promotion?

Linkffn(The Mind Arts)

Ancient Semitic views of the soul, Hindi gods as powerful elemental based wizards, etc.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** There's not much to go on, within canon. Howeverm the Statute of Secrecy significantly post-dates the Christianisation of Britain, and we see the characters celebrate Christmas and Halloween in largely modern fashion. So I think it's safe to say that British wizards are culturally Christian, albeit a rather secular version (not unlike Muggle Britain).

** Religion. both the Abrahamic and pagan varieties, is explored /heavily/ in linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). The irony of the whole thing is that Lord Voldemort in this fic is probably the most religiously devout character in any fic I have yet to read for HP.
