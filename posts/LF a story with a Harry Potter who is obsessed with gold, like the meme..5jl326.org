** Goddamn...

Now I want a OCD/kleptomanic Harry who just grabs money whenever he can get his hands on it. He has a Niffler familiar and his patronus is goddamn Smaug and his animagus a magpie. He's also hitting it off with the Goblins, they just understand him.

** There is an in progress story that has Harry being a dragon animagus, of a breed like Smaug. He transformed as accidental magic when he was 7ish, and took over a goblin gold mine/hord in Canada. The story starts with Dumbledore and McGonagall going to deliver his letter. But I don't remember the name, and can't immediately find a link to it.

  Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
