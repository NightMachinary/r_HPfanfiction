I'm curious as to how the story would have played out if this was the case. Prefer a good or anti-hero Harry. Slight romance is okay but it can't take over the main plot, but no slash. It's not my thing.

Prefer completed works first, recently updated (over 60K words) second, recently updated 3rd and last I guess I'm fine with abandoned.
