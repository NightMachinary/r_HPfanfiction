I can see two basic scenarios, Hermione being a "Beta" and wanting to cure all this utter nonsense occurring around her, or Hermione being an "Omega" and wanting to prevent herself from becoming this ultra submissive trophy.

Some notes. Wolves don't act in that way (so this probably wasn't introduced into the wizarding population by interbreeding with werewolves, likely a wizard did it for some reason), the studies that showed that behavior were done using wolves that had never met each other on a mistaken belief that packs were a temporary mating thing.

  In the past, the prevailing view on grey wolf packs was that they consisted of individuals vying with each other for dominance, with dominant grey wolves being referred to as the "alpha" male and female, and the subordinates as "beta" and "omega" wolves. This terminology was first used in 1947 by Rudolf Schenkel of the University of Basel, who based his findings on researching the behaviour of captive grey wolves. This view on gray wolf pack dynamics was later popularized by the researcher L. David Mech in his 1970 book The Wolf. He later found additional evidence that the concept of an Alpha male may have been an erroneous interpretation of incomplete data and formally disavowed this terminology in 1999. He explained that it was heavily based on the behavior of captive packs consisting of unrelated individuals, an error reflecting the once prevailing view that wild pack formation occurred in winter among independent grey wolves. Later research on wild gray wolves revealed that the pack is usually a family consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring of the previous 1--3 years. In the article, Mech wrote that the use of the term "alpha" to describe the breeding pair adds no additional information, and is "no more appropriate than referring to a human parent or a doe deer as an alpha." He further notes the terminology falsely implies a "force-based dominance hierarchy." In 13 years of summer observations of wild wolves, he witnessed no dominance contests between them.

** "Madam Pomfrey, I have been feeling weird," the unfortunately haired bookworm expressed hesitantly, "I have been feeling...a bit hot and bothered, been having the strangest urges. Yesterday the sight of Draco Malfoy made me want to... I feel sick just thinking of it..."

With a few quick flourishes of her wand Poppy Pomfrey confirmed her suspicions. "Nothing is wrong with you Miss Granger, you are just going into heat."

"What do you mean, that makes no sense! Nothing I have read on either a muggle's or witch's biology said anything about them going into heat!"

"It's pretty much an open secret ("if it's open why have I never heard of it" mumbled Hermione) in the wizarding world that there are three types of magical humans. Alphas, who tend to grow very large and have a commanding presence. Betas, who act in just about the same way as muggles do, and Omegas, who tend to be smaller than average than the average human and are naturally submissive. Omegas mate for life with the first Alpha that they have sex with. An alpha might have several Omegas at their call, Omegas are collected like trophies. It's all so romantic, I wish I was an Omega."

If Pomphrey was at all paying attention to the witch before her, she would have seen Hermione get more and more pale.

"The fact that you get this way around Mister Malfoy means he is probably your alpha, and you need to bond with him soon. I have a pamphlet that explains everything you need to know about the process."

As Hermione read though the pamphlet she alternated between being very pale and red with anger. It was then she knew what she had to do. She had to fix this, not just for her sake, but for all the witches and wizards suffering under this /vile/ curse.

*** An ending that I came up with. (feel free to make your own.)

It was after a week of pure agony that Hermione had finally made a cure. The so called heat just got worse the more she ignored it. A voice constantly whispered in her head "Malfoy looked so good didn't he? Just give in. Give IN. GIVE IN!"

Ronald was no help at all, being wizard raised, he thought this was perfectly normal and thought she was "completely balmy in the head" for trying to resist. His wish that he could be an alpha completely killed any interest she had in him, he was a good friend (most of the time) but this showed her that they would probably have different expectations for a relationship.

Harry, on the other hand, was a /godsend/. While she started research, he went to some muggle drugstores and "acquired" huge amounts of antidepressants. Hermione had once read a study on how they decreased libido, and though she was almost in a constant state of overdose, they did seem to work for the most part. Harry was tasked with keeping her on task with any means necessary. He locked the doors behind him, and had food delivered by Dobby. On a few occasions Hermione almost overpowered Harry trying to follow the voice in her head, it was at this stage that Harry hesitantly carried out part three of their plan.

Imperio.

When ever the urges got bad Harry would put her under his spell and /Force/ her to keep working, to keep going on, to allow her to fix herself of this horrible ailment and give herself the future that this was trying to take away.

A week of agony was what it took, but with the cure applied Hermione finally felt normal again, free to do what she wanted, free to be with WHO she wanted. Free to find someone she /wanted/ to be with. The rest of her life started right now, and as she launched herself at her best friend, she knew what direction she wanted it to go.

**** It's uplifting, but it lacks detail. What /did/ Hermione do to cure herself? I mean, it could be...

"So, in the end, how did you cure your... Omeganess?" Harry inquired, after the long hug.

"The Undetectable Castration Curse."

"Does that mean that you can't..."

"Not for myself. For the Alpha. Once Draco was 'fixed', my urges went away."

"Hermione, you can't go castrating every Alpha you run into!"

"Try me."

Was why I thought it would be fun to approach this from the perspective that this is not normal, that this is not a good thing, unlike how it is usually portrayed.

Yep, completely interbreedable. (Gives another reason for you wolfstar fanatics that are out there.) Though Dogs are a bit behaviorally different than wolves, domestication has made them better companions for us.

******* Same species. They produce fertile offspring when interbred.

Sub-species are a bit more complicated. By all accounts, it's way more subjective. For instance there's more of a difference between the different races of humans than between African and Asian lions. It's more a behavioral thing, so I suppose dogs might be considered such.

But dog breeding itself produced animals with tons of different traits from the same species.

I'm not a bio person either (I'm a computer scientist) but I used to be obsessed with animals in grade school.
