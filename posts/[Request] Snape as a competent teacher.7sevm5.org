Snape seems like a badass wizard: a master potioneer, a master duelist and a master occulemens. I wonder if there's any fic where he gets over his prejudice and starts actually using his skills to try and teach the kids how to survive the war (preferably without blowing his cover as a spy). Or really, any fic where we actually see him teach properly.


** The idea that Snape is an incompetent teacher is something of a fanon invention. His students seem to do well enough - Harry is possibly the worst treated student in his class, and he still got an E at O.W.L.

Snape is a bully, but that doesn't mean he can't successfully put knowledge in people's heads. Indeed for many centuries that was pretty much the standard teaching method.

That says more about the students' self-study that of his own capacity.

He may not be incompetent, but he's not winning any "best teacher of the year" awards.

He did his homework and no more, really.

Well, this might not be quite what you are looking for, but it does feature a sort of mentor Snape.

The fic is relatively AU so I am not sure if you will like it or not. I personally love the series.

Cannot really remember reading a fic where Snape is an actual good professor.

Edit: Oh wait, I think dredged up another fic that could possibly work.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7724057/1/Family-Bonds]])

I haven't read this in a very long time. I think he becomes a better teacher at some point in the story. I don't really think that this story was that good, and it is abandoned. So just be aware of that.

** Iinkao3(9821300)- Swung by Serafim fits.

Also, linkffn(3417954)- Harry Potter and the Enemy Within and its sequel linkffn(3490702)- Harry Potter and the Chained Souls have elements of this but they're "Snape mentors Harry" more than anything.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

He starts teaching potions then transitions to DADA in book 2 and 3. It's more prominent in Resonance but does continue in the rest of the series. It is a Snape-adopts-Harry story, just as an fyi.
