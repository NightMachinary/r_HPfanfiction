** I read on safari. It has a "Reading List" that works across platforms (I usually read on my iPhone). So that's how I keep track of what I'm going to read.

I usually have a few tabs open in safari with the stories in currently reading. Some have been open for ages when I get bored and move onto something else for a while. But I go back and try to finish everything that's open every few months.

I don't really keep track of what I have already read. If it's great and finished I favourite it. If it's great and updating I follow it. If it's great and abandoned I follow and sometimes favourite. Otherwise I just remember, and if start reading something I've already read I'll usually work it out right quick.

** I download everything and sort into folders on my comp. I have a "To Read" folder, and for the stuff I've read I have subfolders for different fandoms. Dowloading also ensures that if the fic is deleted before I get around to reading it, I still have a copy. If I can't read something in a single sitting then I'll convert and transfer to my ereader, so my page will be marked there for coming back to later. I rarely read WIPs, but I have a handful of WIPs that look interesting so I track them via whatever website they're on and will read them when they're finished/abandoned, although I still download every chapter as it's uploaded in case of deletion.

I also have a word file listing fics I've read and enjoyed. It has title, author, summary, pairings, and links, which makes it easy if I want to re-read something but it's been a while since I read it and I can't remember the title or something, and it means I can quickly and easily finds recs for giving people.

Fanfiction Reader- amazing can open recommendations from this sub into that app and download instantly or use a different method. My only gripe is the inability to sort by figcs that you completed

** If I've read a fic and liked it, it goes in my favorites on FFN. If the author doesn't have something in their bio against downloading, it also goes onto my kindle where I've got them sorted.

Things I see while browsing that I want to read eventually go into my mobile chrome bookmarks.

I'm still in the process of adding things I've enjoyed over the years to my favorites list, so I'll get that awful déjà vu every so often. But since most of what I read is 100k+, it's thankfully a smaller pool.

Edit: I also don't track my in-progress fics. I only read one at a time, and I'll keep the tab open on my mobile browser, or if I have to close it, it's in my recently closed tabs.

*** I use hatena bookmark with the the chrome extension. I bookmark all the stories I read on hatena, so when I access a page, I will see the "already bookmarked" icon if I've already tried reading it. Since I don't see anyone else doing the same on hatena, I leave notes with full spoilers about what happened so far on it too. It's extremely useful when a story updates after I forget what it was about. Even with hatena, I still end up reading the same story twice every once in a while, when the author cross-posts on ffn/ao3 and I forgot enough about it to not recognize it on the other site.
