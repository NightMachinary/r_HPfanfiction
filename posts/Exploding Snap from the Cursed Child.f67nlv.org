I am rather passionate hater of the Cursed Child (as [[/u/Philami]] mentioned in a review [[https://is.gd/f9VMaC][here on Reddit]]: “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, the people who watched [Harry Potter and the Cursed Child].”, and most of my fanfictions are based on the premise that Petunia lives), but there is one dialogue (and only one dialogue) which I like:

#+begin_quote
  GINNY: [...] You know, after I'd opened the Chamber of Secrets --- after Voldemort had bewitched me with that terrible diary and I'd almost destroyed everything

  HARRY: I remember.

  GINNY: After I came out of hospital --- everyone ignored me, shut me out --- other than, that is, the boy who had everything --- who came across the Gryffindor common room and challenged me to a game of Exploding Snap. People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are --- have always been --- heroic in really quiet ways. My point is --- after this is over, just remember if you could that sometimes people --- but particularly children --- just want someone to play Exploding Snap with.

  HARRY: You think that's what we're missing --- Exploding Snap?

I know about just few good stories of post-Chamber Ginny (linkffn(7460529) and its expanded version linkffn(7685065), and rather dramatically in linkffn(6782408) ... I don't care that much for the Severitus part, but the first half is excellent), but still I think I have never seen this scene written out.

  What happened between Ginny and her curse-breaker brother when the Weasleys visited Bill after CoS? Because I never bought the idea that after a mug of hot chocolate, "Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again."

  The Weasleys' trip to Egypt after CoS. No one will tell Bill anything, and Ginny isn't talking at all. And if navigating the relationships with his six siblings isn't enough, Bill has one more. But he and Amy Green are just friends, right?

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.
