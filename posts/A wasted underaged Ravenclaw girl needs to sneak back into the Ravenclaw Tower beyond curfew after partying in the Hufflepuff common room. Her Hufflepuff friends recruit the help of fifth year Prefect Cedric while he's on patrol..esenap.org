** I don't have anything specific in mind, but it should involve Cedric and Cho trying to solve the riddle to get in to the tower and failing hilariously. Cho, because she's wasted; and Cedric because he doesn't have any experience with those riddles, and he can't concentrate because of the wasted Cho.

***** Also who says Cedric or the others have to actually enter the Ravenclaw tower? The Ravenclaw could have one or more friends waiting in the common room who just don't realize that she needs help getting back, or maybe there's a prefect who was about to leave for a patrol when they finally get the door open (or who even opens it after they've been failing for a half hour) and decides to show leniency and just help her get into bed instead of punishing her.

*** It's certainly canon the prefects /tell/ the firsties this on their first night.

But whether it's true or not is another matter. I take the line it's complete BS, to keep the firsties on their toes and give them an idea just how much trouble they'd be in if they allowed somebody from another house into their common room.

Getting into Hufflepuff is so straightforward that, never mind 1000 years, the Weasley Twins would likely have known how it's done within their first month.

**** haha yeah, and it is safe to say the the Twins know where the entrance is since it's basically right next the the kitchens. however, how to get into it is a a different matter since I believe it's the only common room that doesn't show up on the marauders map. (which would probably make them want to get in even more since it would be something their ideals never did)

***** There are three places in Hogwarts that the Twins, as Gryffindors, are absolutely forbidden from ever going into, and which (at least according to prefects) no Gryffindor has been into in hundreds of years.

That challenge would be catnip for the Twins. No power on Earth could keep them from giving it a try.

** Cedric/Cho makes me so angry.

Thus begins the dark tale of how a 5th year pureblood elitest prefect took advantage of a underage foreign exchange student. Even after he meets his timely end she is still bound magically to his evil plans unable to still be with her true love soul mate harry potter.

*** Not sure if that's supposed to be satire but you do realize Cho is only one year below Cedric, just like Harry is a year younger than her. In fact considering Harry was one of the youngest in his year, Cedric and Cho are probably closer ages than Harry and Cho. Also, there's nothing at all to suggest Cho is a foreign exchange student, she's at Hogwarts for multiple years, in the books it says she was a fan of the Tutshill Tornadoes - a team in England - since she was six and if you're considering the films canon, she's clearly Scottish based on the accent.

**** No its not satire.

I could see a real story about it. Cho doesnt have a birth day, either does cedric so your age claims are a wild guess at best. I mean she didnt sound like she was from the british isles at all, doesnt even really matter did they talk about her origins at all in the book or other cannon places? My thought that shes a long term exchange student from china as a hidden princess or lady of the chang dynasty hidden away to be sold off or contracted out as her family decides is just as valid as shes from manchester because she said once she likes a quidditch team. She hardly has any backstory or hard cannon history.

At least not enough to warrent massive downvotes im getting for a off the wall idea.

***** Pretty sure that in the movies (and I consider that close enough to cannon myself) she has like a Scottish accent (was it Irish? It may have been Irish but I think I was Scottish - I'm not native English speaker so yeah).

Regardless, I dont remember any indications that she was an Exchange student, not even English at all. She could easily be second or third generation in the country, but that would still mean that she was British either way.

In regards of Cedric taking advantage of her, what are you on about? He's 17 and she is what, 15-16? This is not at all a great age difference, specially not considering teenage boys on average are less mentally developed than teenage girls are.

*** I'm sorry you have so many down votes, because I thought your comment was pretty hilarious. Even though you meant it seriously, I think it would be a really funny crack!fic, especially if Cho is secretly a princess.

I think the main reason you got downvoted is because assuming that an Asian girl is from China and/or is a dynastic princess, is just seen as cliche and racist.
