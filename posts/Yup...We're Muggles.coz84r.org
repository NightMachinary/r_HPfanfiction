** I would make it clear to your children that Harry Potter is fictional and not real, just like Grimm's Fairytales.

In fact, I remember back in early 2000s an old lady complaining about the series on talk radio, and the host asking her how different Harry Potter was from the Grimm's. He mentioned that Grimm's had witchcraft, supernatural forces, and some even darker elements including cannibalism. He asked her why it was ok to read Grimm's to children, but not Harry Potter. She had no answer for that.

*** It's important to tell your kids that most books/TV is fiction and not real. The amount of kids who think the shit they read/watch is real...
