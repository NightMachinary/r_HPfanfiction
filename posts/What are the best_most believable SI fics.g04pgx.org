Okay so we all know that as kid that we wanted nothing more to go to Hogwarts LOL. And because I haven't seen much SI fics, seeing them mentioned here has piqued my curiosity. So some well written SI fics would be what I'm looking for. The person can either be an OC or find themselves in the body of a character, with previous knowledge of the seven books. It can be dark, and the person trying to find a spell to get them home would be nice too.


** 'What's Her Name in Hufflepuff' is generally regarded as one of the best Harry Potter SI's, it's about (unsurprisingly) a woman who is dropped off in the HP universe in time to receive her Hogwarts letter.

'The Ghost of Privet Drive' is another great fic, where a guy is dropped off at the Dursley's as a ghost after dying and sets out to be the responsible, smart adult that never seemed to exist in Harry's life.

'Harry Potter and the Reluctant Rebirth' and it's sequel 'Harry Potter and- Oh God, Not this Guy' are SI's into Harry, rather entertaining in my opinion, now just waiting for the third year sequel to start.

'Granger Chronicles' is an SI into Hermione and has intrigued me so far, although the story is still pre-hogwarts.

'The Doll Gamer' is an OC SI gamer fic, in my opinion it's the best HP gamer fic that exists, especially given that it hasn't been abandoned.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

  When someone dies, they lose their memory and are reborn as someone else. That's how it should be."Should" is the key word.No one wants to be reborn as Harry Potter. No one wants to keep their memories while being reborn as Harry Potter. I repeat: NO ONE WANTS TO BE HARRY- Oh forget it, I'm going into Slytherin.

  One year down, six more to go. It should be smooth sailing from here on out now that Harry is learning magic! He has a strong circle of friends, a growing influence of those around him, and a basic plan for his life. All Harry has to do is keep his school years normal. Except, he forgot about Lockhart... and the basilisk... and- Oh hey! Luna! Well, the year can't be all that bad... right?

The obvious lack of other interests.Oh, wonderful.I had always thought her a very flat character, with no more use than being the personal library and research assistant of her friends, and what I had seen of her life ‘till now emphasized that conviction.Bloody. Hell. I was Hermione fucking Granger.

  I'm not a hero. I'm not even a functional human being. I'm just a living doll that does what it pleases without a care in the world. "Oh? Some more pots that need breaking. Is that a treasure chest? Mine now." OC SI. Gamer ability. Shameless. From the makers of Neville the Gamer is a new story of a sociopath stuck in the HP world with the gamer ability. Tada-da-daaa! Crash!

** I remember liking [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/reader/]] but it's been over over a year since I read it so I don't remember why.

I think Harry Potter self inserts are very hard to pull off when the main charachter has full knowledge of the seven years. A lot of the problems can be easily solved with foreknowledge.

  Interacting with Petunia Dursley is an exercise of patience. Without time served in the Eternal Void, Mari doubts she could manage it. Listening to Petunia describe her---their?---family still tests it.“What about our nephew?”Mari asks only when Petunia breaks for a breath after a long-winded personal essay about how her Duddykins hung the moon. Petunia's gaze shutters and her lips twist as if Mari has interrupted her.“The boy is,” Petunia raises her teacup to her lips, “disturbed.”Mari curls her own hands around her cooling teacup and imagines tossing the Earl Grey into Petunia's face at the blatant dishonesty.“Losing both of your parents would disturb anyone,” Mari comments and raises her teacup for a sip.  That's the tea.
