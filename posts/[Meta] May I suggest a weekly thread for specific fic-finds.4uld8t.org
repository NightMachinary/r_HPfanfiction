I've seen the subreddit cluttered with a lot of specific fic-finding posts such as:

"Looking for a specific Ravenclaw!Harry fic I read 5 year ago! HELP PLS!"

I propose having a weekly, stickied post such as the ones on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4ui138/moronic_monday_jul_25_2016_your_weekly_questions/][r/Android]] or other subreddits where people can post in the top-level comments what fic they are looking for with a description, and others can help them out.

This will declutter the subreddit allowing better access and visibility to both more substantive discussion threads and fic-find threads.

Thoughts? Tagging [[/u/denarii][u/denarii]] as well.


** I personally don't have a problem with people looking for fics, we are a fanfiction sub. There's maybe around 10 posts a day, I don't see discussion posts being lost in the other posts.

I don't think sticky thread would be a good solution, people looking for fics probably won't use it, how many people will keep going back to the same post to answer questions, more work for the mods to delete all the posts, etc. And, as evidenced by people often asking about "the best fics ever" very few people really look at the sidebar for links.

** I don't really want to dedicate a sticky thread to it, and we really don't get enough traffic that it's much of a problem.

** Tangentially related, but can we use [TOMT] for specific fic finds?

[LF] and [REQUEST] are both more general concepts, and I think it'd be nice to keep them that way while also having a flair for more targeted requests

**** as in [[/r/tipofmytongue]]

I guess in retrospect perhaps non-obvious, but I thought it was a good enough analogy to carry over here

*** What does [TOMT] stand for?

**** I know you did, but I think it's much, much harder to get a community to change the way it currently uses vocabulary than to introduce new words entirely. I think this is especially compounded by the facts that:

1. it's not immediately obvious what the difference between LF and request /should/ be, whereas tip-of-my-tongue vs request have (in my mind, at least) more obvious niches.
2. LF and REQUEST share a flare atm, which makes making meaningful distinctions between them even harder.

Your mileage may vary, of course. It just seemed to me that we should introduce a flair for specific fic searches, and that that flair should be neither LF nor REQUEST, as they already have meanings associated with them.

[TOMT] = "tip of my tongue" was the first thought I had, but I can understand why there might be pushback.

*** Yup.

I think we will have to unsticky one of the two threads and put the thread in the side-bar.

** I think it's unnecessary. This is a quiet sub.

Plus, it's a sad fact that posts in stickied/weekly threads get ignored, so users requesting help in them would be even less likely to receive help than they already are. Grouping these requests into one sticky will render them invisible to the search function, too.

I think these types of posts should just get their own flair.

*** Well, I don't see you doing anything except complaining. If you do take a look at the wiki, it is updating quite frequently, so you're whining and you're wrong. And off-topic.

Thanks for the comment./s
