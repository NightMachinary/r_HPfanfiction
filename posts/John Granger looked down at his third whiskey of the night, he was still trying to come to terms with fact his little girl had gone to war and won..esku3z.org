That his little girl had gone to war, And he hadn't been there To help her. Not because she didn't want his help but because she felt she had to protect him. His little girl , Hermione wasn't so little anymore was a Fierce young woman now . And she had Erased his memory of her And shipped him and his wife off to Australia “ to keep the safe” . Bloody Hell! He was her father , he was supposed to keep her safe, And yet his daughter , his brilliant, Studious, well read daughter had gone behind his back erased his memory and moved him to Australia so a mad man didn't murder them while she and her friends went hunting for the soul fragment of a resurrected wizard That didn't have a nose.

His little girl hadn't even bother to ask before she did it. John downed another whiskey, Hermione hadn't even bother to ask because she was his daughter, She was too damn much like him. She knew he wouldn't have agreed to go to Australia and hide while she fought a war , he would have Insisted on staying and fighting with her Anyway he could. They were too much alike, but too damn stubborn and too damn smart For their own good.

So Here John sat with his fifth whiskey in his hand, In the library of his oldest friend Charles Flinch-Fletchley. They had served together , gone to school together( The both of them old Etonians) , The both of them the fathers of magical children. Both the fathers of war heroes, both men on their fifth whiskey of the night. John because he had been 7000 miles away while his daughter stood her ground and Charles because he had fled to Italy with 30 other families Sheltered under some magic spell while his son fought with the rest of the DA.

Their children had gone from The school room to the battlefield in the Blink of an eye while they were Relegated to the sidelines. Powerless to defend them, Their children have become heroes, Without anyone consulting them. So they drank And came to terms with it. Their children were grown, battle-scared and standing on their own .

He and Charles drank to their own personal Victories The battles they had fought as young men and they drank to thank whatever higher power their was that their children had come out victorious in the end.

They drank and curses the fact their children Were their fathers sons and daughters. They didn't run from a fight, they cut the enemy down too stubborn to run and hide in the face of an Overwhelming Onslaught.

They drink and cursed themselves, They had raise their children to damn well. Pride gleaming in both of their eyes, They were too damn stubborn and too damn bright the next generation of their family lines. So Both men drank And raise their glasses high and drank to their children and their brilliant, stubborn minds. And both men tipped their glasses They knew their children would change the world one stone at a time.

Edit. Before you downvote me into oblivion , For the purposes of this Hermione's dad's name is John and Justin Flinch-Fletchley's dad's names is Charles. They are old friends . Getting together to drink and birch about their crazy brilliant kids.


** Eighteen year old men routinely went and died in The Second World War (and many other wars). It is not that crazy as it seems to be.

**** Be that as it may, I think the point of OP's post is that most fathers whose children go to war know that they are at war, whereas Mr. Granger was Obliviated and didn't even know what was happening. Hermione could have died, and he wouldn't have known it, because she'd Obliviated his memory of her. And that is a terribly sad thing. So the thought of that, I think, is why he's drinking.

It's a great little spontaneous fic.

*** True but the thing is these fathers didn't have to come to terms with that, they woke up one day to their kids pushing them to safety and then returning a year later scarred and tired but victorious. It was a war that happened in the shadows. Their children went from kids to adults on par with them over night

**** Well, it is as depressing as the fact that any wars exist at all. And when it comes down it, there is really not that much difference between your daughter being killed at 18 or at 26 (yes, there is a difference with true child soldiers, who went to the war against their will or without true understanding of what's going on). If we accept the fiction that people who are eighteen (or seventeen in the magical world, it really doesn't make that much difference) are responsible for their actions, and I know how much really I knew when I was eighteen, then that's it. Sad, but unfortunately that's the world we live in. Sin in the world is as real and mundane as potatoes, Chesterton wrote in his /Orthodoxy/.

***** Your comment seems to disagree with that mikekearn said, but then it seems to agree. OP is just trying to write a contemplative fic about war and about two men not even knowing their children went to war until it's over; it's emotional. But you seem to be saying, no reason to be sad, life sucks? and that John Granger shouldn't make a big deal about his 17-year-old going to war?

OP obviously already feels self-conscious, because they had to add that they changed a couple things about names *in a fanfic*. So please, let's be a little more considerate and encouraging to OP about their fic.

****** I see. That is certainly not what I've meant to say. Every parent absolutely has right to be worried, and I am sure that all parents of men fighting in the Second World War were beside themselves with worry.

What I wanted to say is that it is nothing morally or otherwise wrong for Hermione to go to war (yes, not open war, but clandestine sabotage project). I am just writing about the missing (and later AU) scene from DH (and in the linkffn(6494461) universe), where Hermione is bothered by her conscience after obliviating her parents, and goes to the church, where her pastor persuades her to return and talk openly with her parents.

Of course, they are worried, especially when they understand they have to run away themselves (I have even used my firm headcanon, that Hermione's grandparents were secular Jewish emigrants from the Czechoslovakia running away from Hitler, so they have family history of running away from genocidal regimes). However, now is their decision between what's easy and what's right: should they let their daughter to go into danger?
