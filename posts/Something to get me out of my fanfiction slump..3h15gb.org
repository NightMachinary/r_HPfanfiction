Do you ever get into those dry spells with fanfiction where it just seems like everything is bleh and you grow a bit disenchanted? And you just look through story summaries out of boredom, knowing you're probably not gonna find anything cause you don't even know what you're looking for? Yeah that's how I feel. I guess I just want something...different. Something that you've read that has stuck with you for some reason because of its charm or uniqueness. I prefer Harry-centric, non-slash stories, but other than that I'll try anything. I realize this is a really vague request, but like I said, I've grown quite disenchanted with fanfiction, so if you have anything in mind that will convince me otherwise, please do share. Thanks!


** How about [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]] by Toujours Padfoot? It's an ensemble story set in the "second-chance" afterlife as the war ends, starring characters who have died (from the Founders to the Marauders to Fred) living together in a village. There are mysterious annual races to cull the numbers. It's particularly competitive that year, and not all is as it seems.

** I like to read crossovers when i get bored with the run of the mill HP fanfiction. There have been a few crossover threads lately. Here's a list I made for one of them.

[[http://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/The_Case_of_the_Missing_Wizard/index/][The Case of the Missing Wizard by Ishtar]] is a HPxSherlock currently being released once a week. It's very good so far.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins by Jeconais]] a HPxAdamsFamily(and others) that is pretty fantastic. Stories up to the start of 4th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by kathryn518]], a HPxStarWars that's in progress with irregular, but lengthy and fairly frequent, updates.

Speaking of HPxStarWars: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh]]. Fantastic, although a long time since the last update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8750155/1/The-Girl-who-Imprinted][The Girl Who Imprinted by CCRevival]], a seemingly abandoned HPxTwilight that I'd recommend if you're into that sort of thing. One of the few good ones I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter]], a pretty hilarious HPxRanma1/2xSailorMoon with a sequel as well.

And what crossover list would be complete without: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon]]. A fantastic HPxFirefly story.

Should be something for everyone in here.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** linkffn(The Debt of Time)

Hopefully I've done that right. It's a Hermione-centered story with a time turner in the mix. I don't know if you like Hermione-centered stories or Hermione paired with anyone else besides Ron, but it's a beautifully written story, even though it's an epic (it has +150 chapters and it feels short)!

If you don't like it, Colubrina has done a series of drabbles with various pairings. There's just so many things that I'd like to recommend to you though!

Let me know if you enjoy anything or if you want different recommendations!

** linkffn(Champion)

This is an excellent story, about a Harry in a world where Voldemort won the First Wizarding War. It's slow to update, but I have enjoyed it immensely, and rarely see it rec'd here.

Edit: This isn't the one I meant. I meant this one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591005/1/Champion]]

*** The bigfan22 rec was actually really good as well. The first two chapters are tedious, but after that, it really comes into it's own with some interesting concepts for Smart!Harry and Super!Harry.

**** I'll take a look, but I am super awful at trudging through bad starts. Even if a lot of fics have bad starts, the story I'm working on I haven't posted but have re written the first 10 chapters 5 or 6 times. And they still suck, but suck less. Hahaha

** If you're okay with femslash, try linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds). It's a masterfully written Bellatrix/Hermione story that involves time travel, and while it does have a lot of angsty stuff, said angsty stuff is the best angsty stuff I've ever seen. It really is heart-wrenching at points.
