I'm looking for a fic where Harry takes his life in his own hands and does what he wants. Like in the beginning of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][Runic Animagi]] where Harry gets high, drunk and gets tattoos and has lots of meaningless sex. Sort of "if im gonna die, first i gotta live"


** [[http://seelvor.fanficauthors.net/Indifference_and_Neglect/Indifference_and_Neglect/]]

At first, he's more apathetic rather than in control, but the story gets there.

Don't read if you're allergic to bashing.

*** That very first one just feels so good to read.

EDIT: Some cringe-worthy wish fulfilment at the end.

Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]] (W: 616,225; Complete). It starts a bit slowly though and (spoilers) has an ending that you may find disappointing.

*** It's not bad, but the fic itself is a bit uninteresting and unnecessarily wordy IMO. Never made it to the ending, which is pretty weird for me.
