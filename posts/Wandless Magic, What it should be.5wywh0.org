I think wandless magic should be different from and magic, It is not bound by limitations, Much like accidental magic is, You want something enough and it just happens. Obviously you can use words to focus but wandless magic should not be used for something as mundane as just wandless stupefys and levitation. It should be used like this: Ok so harry is trapped in a corner, so he uses wandless magic to make the earth shake in front of him, and while everyone is unbalanced he uses wandless magic to make himself run faster and escapes. I think it was kind of like this in Accidental Animagus, [[/spoiler][where Edward Grayson sung a song and then walked across the lake at the speed of sound.]]


** I'm of two opinions. I like the idea of minor cantrips, like snapping your fingers to light a candle. I also like the idea of being able to accomplish a task that doesn't need a focus, without a wand. Like, the Animagus transformation. I don't see why holding onto a magical stick would be necessary at all for that.

What I don't like is the idea of progression that some people take in regards to spell power or progression. Hell, for all I know that sort of thing has been made canon already, idk. I'm talking about the idea that with enough practice, you can go from levitation spell with wand plus words, to levitation spell with wand but without words, and then to levitation spell without wand with words, and then to levitation spell without wand and without words. It's like you're leveling your magic skill from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, and it just feels a bit too mechanical. Authors will try and make Harry special by having him start at rank 3 already on his first day of Hogwarts, and that just doesn't make for good storytelling.

*** For the most part I agree with you here. Learning every "spell" wandlessly should probably be pointless because of the time investment, and they should be weaker when done wandlessly.

However, no seriously powerful witch/wizard should be entirely useless without their wand. Learning something like the summoning charm so that you could get your wand back in a pinch or block a spell with an object is quite obviously extremely worthwhile. It doesn't fit my headcanon of Voldemort or Dumbledore that they could be almost entirely crippled by the removal of their wands.

Summoning charm (or just general manipulation of objects such as summoning, banishing, levitation, etc.), animagus transformation, and apparition are most of the things I see as being necessarily wandless for any budding hero or villain.

**** I just don't think something like a wandless summoning charm is all that interesting. It makes for lazy story telling, just because it's a thing of convenience. For example, if it's so easy for any random witch or wizard with a modicum of skill to get their wand back with a summoning charm, why does the disarming charm even exist then? And where do we draw the line? Do you need a hand gesture for the wandless spell? Just an incantation? Just your eyes? Or just a thought? The line has to be drawn somewhere, and I rather the line be drawn so the question isn't just "why the hell do we even need wands to begin with?"

I find it more interesting to be proactive in preventing the disarming in the first place, rather than being reactive. I'd rather a wizard learn how to not be disarmed in the first place, rather than having to rely on a Convenient Plot Device. Fuck, I'd rather read about a cliche auror-standard enchanted self-returning dragonhide wrist wand holster than wandless magic, or even a potion of anti-disarmament or something.

***** I like this version: it takes two minutes or an hour to learn most spells with a wand. It takes two hundred hours to learn most spells wandlessly.

This means you can learn one or two wandless spells, and you might have an advantage because of that, but your opponent who uses that time to learn more general techniques has an advantage too. A dedicated combatant will have maybe three wandless combat spells, and most people won't have more than one wandless spell.

Wrist straps. Why do we never see someone stick a wrist strap to their wand. A bit of glue and some leather and you're secure against weak to mid-strength disarming charms. Sure, it's a couple seconds to retrieve the wand, but without it, you'd be scuppered.

I see wrist straps for all sorts of devices in real life, but I've never seen them in Harry Potter.

***** Because it takes concentration to get a wand back wandlessly. If you've just been disarmed, you're surprised and unable to focus like you would to get the wand back.

** To me, wandless magic is limited because of its difficulty - with wand magic you have a spell that does something (blood-boiling curse for example), whereas I don't think you can articulate such an intricate feeling with wandless magic.

In my mind it's closer to accidental magic in the respect that it is direct and basic, but different in that it is obviously not accidental. You could cast things like shield charms, summoning spells and basic spellwork, but I don't think that it should work as you describe without some extra integration with the body, rather than just making something happen by wanting it enough.

In canon, someone augmenting their physical abilities with magic is never described, and I personally think that wandless magic as it exists in the canon universe simply isn't versatile enough to allow what you've suggested by itself alone.

It's without doubt a useful skill to have for any powerful witch or wizard (things like summoning objects or your wand back to your hand when you've been disarmed are superbly useful), but I prefer to think of wandless magic as a more primal, inarticulate thing compared to wand magic. To me, the wand acts as a conduit for a magical person, and without it it's like trying to write a novel with a stone instead of a pen.

The real issue is that if you make wandless magic too powerful/versatile/all round useful, it will be difficult to work out how your characters wouldn't just end up using it all the time.

** This is a bit of an odd comparison, but since I've been dwelling on my internet connection for the past couple days, this popped into my head.

I see wandless magic as the magical WiFi to a wand's landline. Wandless is useful in a variety of situations and can be taken where wands can't, but it's unreliable and can't compare to the strength and stability of wanded magic.

Furthermore, wands are a focus and possibly an aide, providing an outlet and funneling magic through a more precise lens. I figure simple spells are kind of like doing algebra with a calculator. You give the input and the wand does the heavy thinking, but it's still possible without the wand; It just requires a lot more busywork. Complicated spells are like doing calculus or trigonometry in your head. You /really/ have to know your shit inside and out, or you have to be some kind of savant, in order to get anywhere at all.

Wandless magic could also be considered "Wild" magic. Because of the lack of focus, it has a lot more freedom to fuck around without your consent, and has a lot higher risk of rebound or wasted effort. The more complicated the spell, the more variations and problems you have to account for, and the more difficult it is to keep track of it all. This means your concentration slips and without the limitations imposed by your mind, it is free to escape.

EDIT: I think this is also why you stop doing accidental magic when you grow up. Children are able to subconsciously direct magic, but they can't limit it, leading to unpredictable results. As you grow older, you subconsciously learn how to limit it, but you have to relearn how to direct it.

** For me, wandless magic happens with minor stuff---summoning spells or light---or high emotions causing it accidentally but rarely as adults due to using a focus predominantly---destroying windows or rooms. For complex stuff, i like to use sacrifices or rituals for wandless. To follow the maxim that you get out what you put in. Want to find gold with a ritual? It's going to take a fairly expensive sacrifice to get the equivalent in gold.

** If wands are a focus then they can be compared to glasses. The wizarding world leans heavily on wands so consider them all crazy short-sighted. Its not that they can't do anything without wands but rather why bother going through the stumbling about when a wand clears everything up for you. Wandless magic is possible but its a crippling handicap so easily overcome that there is no point it bothering. Wandless magic shouldn't be refined, it shouldn't be spells so much as weak effects.

** Following the release of information on other wizarding schools, it appears that wandless magic is neither as rare nor as tricky as we used to believe, given that wizards taught far afield from Britain use it so casually.

Therefore, I'm inclined to believe that it's just not as effective as wand magic in many cases. The wand is a European invention and has been adopted only fairly recently in several regions, but European wizards, for the most part, neglect to hone their own wandless skills. So it could be that wands are near-invaluable to attain the finesse necessary for conventional Charms, Transfiguration and spell-oriented Dark Arts, but less so for other forms of Self-Transfiguration and the like.

Until we see an Uagadou student cast the Unlocking Charm - which originated /somewhere/ in Africa (really, Jo?) we'll never really know.
