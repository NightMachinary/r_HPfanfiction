** There's a few I can think of. Not always sad, per se, they just had very emotionally impactfull moments that stuck with me.

linkffn(Honour Thy Blood). The story of Harry's family in this one has a special place in my heart.

linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always) is just exactly what you asked for.

linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love) Is one I'd seen recommended a lot on here, and just the title made me feel it was one I had to take out some time for and really allow myself to pay attention to. It's very well done.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Shiro is a senior and captain of his school's football team. There's a girl that all the boys are harassing and in his attempt to stop it he befriends her (and possibly becomes something more). Keith is a sophomore in the shadows of his brother and is figuring out himself. Lance just wants his role model to appreciate him more.

****** It's an alternate universe where Katie,Angelina,and Alicia (in that order) die during the Second Wizarding War and Oliver Wood is sitting at a bar remembering them and at the end I think he toasts their memory.
