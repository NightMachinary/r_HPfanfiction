This happens after he reaches Grimmauld Place coz Harry is certain that they'd force him anyway if he protests, thinking back to how he'd been forced into the Triwizard tournament.

He questions why they didn't side-along apparate him instead of flying over the countryside. (Now the Doylist explanation is that side-along apparition was invented for the 6th book; not an acceptable excuse for fanfiction)

This Harry has read the Daily Prophet cover to cover out of sheer frustration because his friends aren't writing to him properly so he knows about the smear campaign. He realizes that he's been followed by the Order in secret but given no information (enforced isolation). He also realizes that with Mrs Figg being a squib, Dumbledore knew about the Dursleys' abuse and nothing was done.

Edit: Since it isn't clear to some people, assume everything that happens before Harry first reaches Grimmauld Place in OotP is the same as canon.

*** OOtP was such a weird movie, it was such a tonal difference from the others (though the book kinda was too) and outside of Umbridge it was average at best.

Didn't like what they did with Tonks either, the reduced role and the casting left a lot to be desired.

***** Definitely hoped she was more bubbly and she didn't really look remotely like what I imagined Tonks to be but mainly it's because she just overacts in everything she's in. That Mandalorian episode she was in basically summed up my issues with her acting, I just can't believe that there wasn't someone better for the role.

Obviously not from the UK but Mary Elizabeth Winstead would've been a much better Tonks.

Is it? I've never read a story with this particular accusation. Give us a link if you have an existing story.

90% of everything is usually trash. Bad writing doesn't invalidate the premise.

**** You're right, that super-specific accusation hasn't come up but the 'Harry gets mad at being bait or being left out of the loop' is something that pops up in every other fic.

I also wasn't saying the premise was bad just common and that like you said 90% of fics that try it are just filled with out of character writing, edginess and foreknowledge of the other books. I'd be interested in seeing someone actually pull it off.

#+begin_quote
  Apparition can be traced by Aurors and Unspeakables. Since Voldemort has infiltrated the ministry, we couldn't risk it. Additionally, magic is easier to detect in muggle environments. Casting magic, using portkeys or Apparating in non-magical areas causes detection charms to light up like a Christmas tree.
#+end_quote

*False.* Apparition can't be traced. We know Mundungus apparated from near Privet Drive multiple times, once /right in front of Harry/. Tonks cast multiple spells in the Dursleys' house, like /Lumos/, for packing Harry's trunk and the Disillusionment charm.

#+begin_quote
  “They'd burn the whole neighborhood and torture, rape and murder the muggles until we came out. Use your head, boy!”
#+end_quote

This is also silly. Death Eaters doing this in any neighbourhood will draw the Aurors to them like flies, let alone the Order. It's something the Order is built to fight against; their headquarters is hardly important in that scenario.

The "ranting Harry" is the worst part of the Indy!Harry trope and was something I was hoping to avoid. Cold anger is always more effective than a hot temper.
