I remember it being post war, Harry returns to Hogwarts. He and Neville are best friends that ruthlessly troll everyone. Dumbledore keeps trying to figure out how Harry defeated Voldemort, but Harry feeds him a bunch of cock and bull stories, one of them being that he hugged Voldemort to death.

I remember reading it years ago and was hoping to find it again.


** I have no idea what this fic is, but it sounds like a lot of fun. I'd be interested in knowing which one it is also so that I can read it.

Edit: There are two versions of this story apparently. The first one that I linked is the longer one. Not sure if the hug scene is in the redux.
