Curious as things change as we get older. I used to love super powerful Harry with his harem of chicks but now it's just so unrealistic and cringe to me.

I was also a fan on abused Draco/Harry/Hermione/whoever that just needs some love and to be saved by whatever love interest they have.

And I was a big fan of the secretly a pureblood Hermione fics back when I still liked her character haha. Now it's all about Luna or Ginny. Plus it's a bit problematic


** Forced marriage laws used to be fun but now the fact that the characters are losing their right to choose bothers me

*** See, I can handle marriage /contracts/ in fics, but the marriage "law" thing always felt so silly and ridiculous. Like, the idea that a government would actually invest the time and effort to force strangers to marry each other? Bizarre, and ridiculous, even in a world of magic and wizards.

I legitimately thought it was a crack-fic idea the first time i saw it; so weird that there a bunch of people that make stories out of the concept.

** Severitus. As I've gotten older, Snape's behaviour has become more and more of a problem for me. I used to have a major thing for any fics with Harry and Snape bonding, but now that I no longer see Snape through rose-colored glasses, I infinitely prefer reading fics without it. It's just impossible for me to imagine that he could miraculously grow a heart after watching him belittle poor Neville for years.

**** Snape stans don't seem to consider that that excuse doesn't fit because Snape could have easily sidestepped it by simply stating that he was trying to keep Dumbledore from suspecting his loyalty to the Headmaster. If Snape had truly been on Voldemort's side, it would have made more sense for him to treat Harry fairly, so he could gain Harry's trust and in the end betray him and give Harry to Voldemort upon his return from the dead.

** Time travel

I mean, technically, not completely. Sometimes I'm in the mood for Harry to travel back to Riddle's time and they eventually become friends (not lovers!) Or I want a good bashing story

I used to read a lot of do-over fics and what I found in many of them was that they would (usually) start at the same time (he wakes up in the cupboard on Dudley's birthday) and it's just a rehash of canon or close. Ive also noticed that in many, no manner how different Harry is supposed to be (like a little darker) he still manages to become best friends with Hermione

I used to find Weasley bashing interesting because it was different from canon and could change the story but now it's kinda overused. Also overpowered Harry who is "Lord Potter Black" and had Dumbledore (and sometimes the Weasleys) stealing from him or whatever.

Soulmates. (If they have to become lovers) It's just kinda icky that they have no choice in who they are going to be in a relationship with, particularly if the other is a racist and snobbish.

Harry being overly abused. I can see the Dursley hitting him if his accidental magic was too obvious but they would NEVER beat him black and blue or rape him.

**** It means Alpha/Beta/Omega. It's a kink trope wherein some or all people have defined biological roles based on a hierarchical system.

Alphas are at the top of the hierarchy. They are usually strong and dominate people in society, have hot tempers and run everything. Male Alphas usually impregnate the omega's and have a knot when aroused but females can impregnate omega's too.

Beta are the subordinate to Alphas and may or not may be able to impregnate omega's. They are the calm and collected ones who have to navigate between the Alphas and Omegas and usually act as the peacemaker. They often have normal human anatomy without any extras that the other two have.

Omega are usually the lowest in the hierarchy. They are often weak and sensitive. They are the ones who stay at home, take care of the children and are abused by the alpha in many stories. If the male is an Omega, he too can give birth.

Alphas and Omega often form a pair-bond that sometimes involve mating bites. Omega may go into heat and need to have sex. The Alpha equivalent is called a rut.

Some A/B/O works are straight-up porn, some explore social justice, some turn the trope upside down and the Alphas are the disenfranchised group.

** Slytherin politics.

Don't get me wrong I love slytherin!Harry (My favorite trope I'd say), but children having a social hierarchy /on a school/ is just too unrealistic and a bit cringe. I don't care if they were shoved politics since they were kids. I don't care if they were forced to mature early.

Normal. Children. Don't. Care. About. Politics.

(They are also mostly done wrong. What the heck is a Slytherin prince anyways?).

Edit: Oh I forgot. WBWL too. It's not the worst trope but its just too generic and uninteresting (What's the last time I read one without Dumbledore/Potters bashing, Dark/Grey!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, generally generic and bland writing, and just boring characters. Or all of them together).
