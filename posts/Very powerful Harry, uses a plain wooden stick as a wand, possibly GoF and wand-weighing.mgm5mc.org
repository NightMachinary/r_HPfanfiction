:END:
Don't remember much of this fic... I'm sure Harry is very powerful. Probably able to use wandless magic. Anyway, Harry uses a plain wooden stick - no core or anything - as a wand... just so it appears he got one for classwork.

In one scene someone - student or teacher - gets to hold his wand, and sees it's just a stick (think they sit on a bench in a corridor). I also think Snape takes the "wand" to preform prior incantatum on it after something has happened (CoS?), but returns it without comment (not divulging it's just a stick).

Possibly Harry takes Neville to get a wand, and Olivander comments he had expected to see Harry before 1st year. Harry saying he already got a wand.

Possibly GoF and Olivander checking the "wand" or Harry refusing to.

The wand plays just a little part, but it stuck out. Probably "Super Harry", possibly training/controlling his magic before Hogwarts.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

** Not the requested fic, but linkao3(25833736) has some of those wand plot points. Harry is a dragon and not the best at hiding it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr Ollivander, hesitantly handing over his 'wand'.

  Mr Ollivander frowned.

  "Mr Potter, surely you must be mistaken, this is a stick."

  Harry laughed loudly and obnoxiously, overplaying the act.

  "Oh, Mr Ollivander, you're funny. All wands are technically sticks."

  "No, no, you misunderstand Mr Potter, this is quite literally a stick."

  "Mr Ollivander," Harry said through gritted teeth. "May I have a word with you outside?"

#+begin_quote
  If newborn dragon hatchlings are abandoned for any particular reason (the mother could've been killed, certain species of dragons bury their eggs in the sand to fend for themselves once they hatch, etc), they will immediately adapt to the environment so that their chances of survival are guaranteed. This can mean burying themselves even further into the sand, becoming invisible, or even shapeshifting.Or alternatively:Harry is a dragon. No one knows. Shenanigans ensue.

** I vaguely remember one where he was using a pencil (graphite core) and i think he handed that to Ollivander. It was a "Harry didn't attend Hogwarts" story, which probably means "Dursleys didn't raise him" as well.

  Sirius Black has Moonlighted as an actual Grim for years. Then, that fateful Halloween, he calls in a favor from Death. In 1991 Harry fails to appear, One Hermione Granger makes a new Friend, and as the day of revelation approaches, the questions is: How will the wizarding world react to a Harry Potter raised by his Sirius Black and his favorite 'uncle': The grim reaper himself.

*** Just read it, and he has a two-core wand in this one. And a staff. And also excalibur because he's the king of magical britain, apparently. Good story for all the tropes though, I like a curb-stomping Harry tbh.
