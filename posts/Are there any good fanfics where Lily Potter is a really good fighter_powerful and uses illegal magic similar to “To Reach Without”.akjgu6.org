** Seems to be a running theme for that author to make Lily a badass, and I actually like the way they make their own world out of the existing content. Shame they abandoned their stories.

*** I liked most of the stories, but the one where Lily was cheating on James and seemed to feel little guilt over passing another child's off as his and she was still meant to be seen as in the "right" was.....gross. I don't mind affair stories even, but she cam across as entirely despicable and yet was kind of the "idol" for her daughter.

*I actually read a pretty good story ages ago, where James was missing for several months, presumed dead, and Lily and Sirius got drunk and slept together. She obliviated him the next day and it turned out Harry was actually Sirius's son, but it was done in a more emotionally complex way than "oh hey, whatever."
