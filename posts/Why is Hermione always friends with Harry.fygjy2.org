I really don't get this. 90% of every FF I've read has her at least as a friend. Another ~4% don't have her at all, so that's entirely different. But why? She has an extremely bad attitude, as 'bossy' doesn't qualify when talking about her.

When we meet her the very first time "/Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,' she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth. ‘We've already told him we haven't seen it,' said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. ‘Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.' She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. ‘Er -- all right.' He cleared his throat. ‘Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.' He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed grey and fast asleep. ‘Are you sure that's a real spell?' said the girl. ‘Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course"/ ignore Ron, by the way, he's not the subject, and then " /‘Harry Potter,' said Harry. ‘Are you really?' said Hermione. ‘I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. "/ Here's why I take and we all should take from this:

1) She did not even knock or act in any way deemed polite. Comes straight into the compartment, demands if they've seen a toad and then proceeds to critique Ron for using a spell that did not work because either he doesn't know or is just plain unskilled or stupid (that's the impression you get from that sentence) then immediately proceeds to brag about her succeeding in every spell she tried and (it's logic to assume Ron is from a magical family and she prides herself on that) begins to "show" her superiority as a member of a magic-less family over a member of a magic family. ONLY THEN does she introduce herself. This is way beyond merely impolite. This SCREAMS of Draco Malfoy behaviour. Until Hogwarts when Malfoy says there are better families and worse families, Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger are exactly the same (personality - wise). And even after that, they are 90% the same, apart from the "traps" Malfoy keeps organizing. Even after that moment, until Halloween she's kind of the same, until after that mellowing down a bit. And yet, Draco Malfoy is characterised as one of the secondary antagonists (Voldemort is the primary one, even from the first page/pages of the book) and the second we actually meet (I think Quirrel is first) while she is considered one of the good guys from the beginning. That does not make sense.

​

2) Are you really? Like he doesn't know who he is. I know all about you, read that and that, you're there and there......this is kind of like when a man goes to a woman, saying "I'm Adam and you have a big butt, can I touch it?" Extremely rude. This whole sequence means "I'm way smarter than you, you have to admit it and I MUST brag until I freaking die". No modesty.

​

3) She doesn't get rid of that attitude entirely, or at all, I think she's just hiding it. Can't remember now more moments or earlier than that, but the next time I remember is in 4th year. Oh wait, I remember now third year, when Sirius gifted him the Firebolt and she stole it to give it to McG without informing Harry. I get it, he knew it was expensive and was very unwilling to give it to her because he did not know for sure what would have happened. But she could and should have talked to him, really talked and told him what's what, persuaded him. Doing what she did just shows her absolute lack of trust and faith. She only realized what she did wrong after he got upset. But let's get back to the Goblet. First when she's been invited by Krum to the Yule Ball and even with Harry asking (who's been nothing but polite when asking her) who's her partner she flipped out. Another show of lack of trust in him. Then with Fleur complaining about the food and whatnot with, albeit not 100%, some justified cause she was again condescending, not that later she wasn't, event after Fleur proved she was actually very caring and kind hearted.

​

All in all, she paints herself in such a negative light that nobody should have made friends with her. But the books are the books, they've already been written. And they were very good, apart from this HG moment. They are not as good as...let's say Sherlock Holmes (that thing cracks me up), but they are very very good. Can't say the same about fanfiction. When I see a Hermione is a friend, I consider not reading it. If she's a lover, I outright abandon it.


** Just because you dislike her doesn't mean that others do - Hermione is one of the most popular characters in the books for a reason.

She's also one of Harry's best friends in canon, and people like that dynamic - you're arguing against that and wanting a change from it.

In comparison to Ron, Harry's other best friend, Hermione is significantly more driven and studious. A lot of fanfic writers want to write a more competent Harry - Hermione fits right in there, whereas Ron needs some changes to make work.

I'm not going to argue with you on why I disagree with how you view Hermione, since it's clearly a personal taste thing and I doubt it'd convince anyone. However, I'll just say that I completely disagree with you, and that your opinion is definitely a minority in the fandom - which is why most fics don't fit your ideas.

I'd recommend looking up fics bashing Hermione - those would probably fit your view of her.

*** Them being friends in the first place doesn't really make sense. Remember, Hermione Granger is as rude as Draco Malfoy when Harry met her. Harry Potter takes an immediate dislike to Draco Malfoy in the shop while on the train he doesn't react badly to her. Malfoy even introduced himself. Granted, it was a bit of a stuck up introduction, but he did do that. She did not, going so far as to have a full bragging exposition before that. And if she was a peasant (you know, the medieval general populace who could not afford education, barely afforded to live) then there would be no problem. They don't have the funds, time and effort to educate themselves. But Hermione prides herself in reading. So how come a well-read person not doing this basic thing? You can understand Malfoy being like that. He's spoiled, gets his every wish fulfilled. And very spoiled people tend to become like that. Dudley is another example of that. But what's her excuse? Her parents are dentists, which makes them able to take care of her, but not able to truly spoil her. So what's the reason?

​

Oh, and regarding the "risk her life". Harry risked his life before her, even though he could have gone to a teacher. A human person subconsciously does not want to risk anything important for a person who is rude etc.

​

Harry is not really incompetent, unlike Ron, he has psychological problems related to his upbringing. 10 years of misery with a family that bullies you at the very least will leave any child scarred. Unlike Tom Riddle who had a genetic predisposition (his forefathers where known for inbreeding, violence etc.) to violence, harm and had a worse situation than Harry, but did not have any scars on his mind that would affect that, he simply hated them. An aunt that heavily dislikes you at the very least or even hates you is worse than some children playing nasty pranks on you.

​

I should have put this in the first section, but never mind that. Ronald Weasley is a typical "I have six siblings who are all better than me and this creates jealousy in me". Granted, it's not angelic, but it is understandable. Again, Granger does not have any excuse. A common mentioned cause is the other children marginalizing her. In 90% of cases, this kind of environment cause that person to be shy, withdrawn, but not bossy and rude.

​

There are very few HG-bashing works that are good. Most are poorly written, with even worse grammar and containing 1001 cliches.

​

PS: In a fanfiction I don't remember the name of, she regrets behaving in a bad way with Harry who is sent to prison and portkeys to his home. When she is bounced by the wards she still swims to that island, endures shame and even possible death just to say sorry. That is good. I can wholeheartedly get behind that.

**** Look, you don't have to write up a wall of text - like I said, this is a subject that I can already tell that neither of us will be able to convince the other on. IMO, Hermione is not at all rude like Malfoy in that first introduction, and Harry & Ron /do/ react poorly to her tone and conduct in the train - but obviously you feel different, and take the least charitable view of Hermione in the situation as possible.

It's better not to waste our time trying to fruitlessly convince the other - what I was aiming to do was to explain that, although those are /your/ views and conclusions, those are not how everyone looks at her acts, situation, and personality, and that you're in the minority there. And that you're very unlikely to actually convince anyone, since she /is/ such a popular character and your view is completely different from the majority.

For Hermione bashing ones that are good, maybe ask for recommendations in a post then? I'm sure that'd help find those that are decent - or at least, decent enough. I'm not a fan of bashing in general, so I don't have any recommendations unfortunately.

**** He's eleven. The way he sees and perceives the world is completely different from an adult, furthermore he lacks knowledge of the world and is antisocial.

I'm not trying to bash Harry, merely point out that what he sees and perceives isn't necessarily the truth, there's much that he misses or completely misunderstands.

From the wiki link I provided:

#+begin_quote
  In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or *greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider their point of view and experience of the story.*
#+end_quote

Sounds familiar? Harry very clearly lead us to believe Snape was after the Stone, did he not? The books are filled with similar events.

***** What? Harry doesn't misrepresent or conceal information. He simply reaches conclusions based on the information available to him at the time. From what he knew, it was perfectly reasonable to think Snape was trying to steal the stone. A character like Dumbledore would presumably come to a different conclusion. This is just a consequence of the third person limited perspective. If we weren't limited by what Harry knew the philosophers stone wouldn't be much of a mystery novel.

An unreliable narrator twists the truth, whether deliberately or not. We are never led to believe that Harry isn't relaying an accurate depiction what he is aware of regarding the world he's in.

Either way, I don't get what you're saying regarding the quoted passage? That Harry is fabricating Hermione being annoying as a child?

****** Have you bothered to read my comment? Like.. at all?

An unreliable narrator is one that is... Surprise surprise! Unreliable!

Now since it seems a quote from Wikipedia is not good enough I'm gonna post an Oxford dictionary one.

#+begin_quote
  unreliable

  ​that cannot be trusted or depended on
#+end_quote

Now, onto Harry's opinions.

#+begin_quote
  She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth
#+end_quote

Is her voice really bossy? Or maybe that's just her accent or form of speech? We do not know, we only have Harry's opinion. Can we trust his opinion? No, because he's an eleven years old that hasn't ever gone outside his neighbourhood and isn't even allowed to watch the TV.

And what does Harry consider to be large teeth? An adult may think they are normal. Kids are cruel that way.

#+begin_quote
  ‘We've already told him we haven't seen it,' said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. ‘Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.'
#+end_quote

Is she really not listening, or just found something more interesting? She replied to his negation, so we could say she did listed.

As a rule of thumb, when the point of view is that of a kid or teenager his narration is to be considered unreliable unless proven otherwise. Now please go back and read my previous comment and the wiki. An unreliable narrator is more than what you seem to believe.

******* That is not what Harry thinks. That's what the narrator says. And the narrator is not Harry. The author is the narrator, as in all the books written from a third person perspective. Look up "The adventure of Sherlock Holmes", the first book. Right from the first page you realize THIS is where the narrator is a character, Dr. Watson himself. Therefore, there can be no "unreliable narrator thing here". She does indeed have a bossy voice. Also, I meant the way she acts and speaks, which is condescending, arrogant and so much more.

*** Look up "Susan Bones and the prisoner of Azkaban". Up until Hermione's mother attacks Harry and after he's returned from prison, that's how Hermione actually is. Throughout all six books prior to the finale, we see and get evidence of her actual character: first year, when she can't actually make friends due to her condescending and arrogant behaviour, up until Hallowen when she realizes this is no the muggle world and she HAS to hide how she truly is or she won't survive; when reading the first book, pay attention to the way she mentions: "they're acting like children" (or something similar) .... bitch please, you're 11, a child yourself, this is not them being children, this is you thinking you're an adult because of all the books you read making you think you're better than all of them; third year when she steals the broom showing the little trust and petty feelings she has for their relationship etc.; fourth year when without even trying to understand why Fleur is the way she is, she starts bashing her; 6 year when because of a simple book she gets ultra jealous and tries to make Harry feel bad because of a book, because she can't take not being the best one freaking time...and the spells don't even come into play until later.
