Due to having an extremely abusive childhood, Harry has an insanely high pain tolerance by the time he gets to hogwarts. As a result people are freaked out, when he simply brushes off injuries of nearly all kinds.

  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.

Well now you have to wonder if Voldemorts orphanage backstory was just something he invented to hide the embarrassing truth that he's actually the son of the Chudley Cannons seeker
