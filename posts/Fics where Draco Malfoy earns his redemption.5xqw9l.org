And I mean really earns it. Not one sentence where he donates some of his money to a random cause, or fics where pureblood supremacy is handwaved as actually not that bad, but a fic where he actually works at it.

Postcanon is okay, AU is even better. Self insert as Draco is welcome, as is any age appropriate pairing(or none). Slash is fine, as is r63.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** /Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of/ [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rule%2063][*/rule 63/*]] :

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Rule 63 is a rule of the internet that reads as follows: "For any given male character, there is a female version of that character." This rule's exceptions are only in the instance that A: the male character is already so androgynous that a female version would be basically the same, or B: the female version hasn't been drawn yet.

/Nintendu: Rule 63 dont apply to evrythin!/

/Me: Fine. Name one male character who you think couldn't be made female./

/Nintendu: zOMG, Link is so smexy! He's da manliest man evar!/

/Me: Boo! Here is a picture of Link with tits and a vagina! Muahaha!/

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

** Yes!

Check out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3634826/1/Volunteers][The Volunteers series]] by Anna Fugazzi. The premise is that single-dad Harry and single-dad Draco end up volunteering together for a Beltane event in Scotland. Draco has been living as a muggle for years because of his probation after the war. All of the repercussions for Draco's involvement in the war felt really realistic and were some of the most well done I have read. He definitely earns his redemption in this.

Also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164][Eclipse]] is a great redemption story of Draco that doesn't just skip over his transition from the dark side to the light. It's a classic too - written pre-OOTP I think. Linkffn(3634826), linkao3(327164)

  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.
