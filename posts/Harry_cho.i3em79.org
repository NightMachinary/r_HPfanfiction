Anyone got any good harry/cho fics? It seems most of the time she'll pop up at wife X in a harem fic without much screen time or a super submissive in heavy smut fics but rarely do I see a decent romance fic with her as the love interest

  After his 4th year, Harry learns about different ways of thinking, different ways of playing, and about some different magic. Warning, some graphic violence and adult situations. Touched up and reposting... finally...

** Yes, or she is the ultra-lewd opponent to Harmony.

Anyway, the only nice Harry/Cho story I know is linkao3(14031036) by [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]], but that's unfortunately just a one-shot.

*** That's not canon, Luna was being bullied by her dorm-mates never Cho. I mean I guess you can say she was complicit in her inaction but I don't pay attention to younger years while in school. It's not even really Fannon as I've only seen that in "Lord! Harry" fics.
