  "Harry!"

  Harry signed and set down the book he was reading out of boredom---he'd only been out of Hogwarts for a week and he was already bored---and he went to see what his aunt wanted. He'd learned after last year that it was best to be polite and generally out of the way unless he wanted to get locked in his room with little-to-no food again.

  The ladder leading to the attic was pulled down and Harry wondered what Aunt Petunia was doing up there. She wasn't a fan of all of the dust because it messed with her allergies. He climbed up it and stuck his head into the attic, which was cluttered with dusty boxes of stuff and the winter quilts.

  "Yes, Aunt Petunia?" Harry asked, spotting her further back on her knees and digging through a box.

  She pointed a manicured finger at a set of boxes without glancing at him. "Take those," she told him, "or I'm going to throw them away."

  Harry raised a brow at her and crawled all the way up into the attic. He tugged on one of the boxes and was surprised with how heavy it was. As he hauled the three boxes downstairs into his room, he wished that magic wasn't banned over the summers so he could use a Levitation no the heavy box. Ron had told him that he was able to do magic so long as his parents didn't see him because the Improper Use of Magic office was unable to tell if he'd done the magic or if his parents had done it. Harry thought that was stupid, and Hermione had gone a whole tirade at how the law was anti-Muggleborn since purebloods and half-bloods who lived in magical households could do magic over the summer while she and Harry could not.

  However, Harry was not about to risk another letter from the Improper Use of Magic department, despite having not done the magic last year that led to getting locked in his room (though that was a better alternative to his cupboard), and so he simply lugged them down one at a time. He was used to exertion, gardening for hours in the hot summer sun was oddly strenuous and Quidditch wasn't a walk in the park as it required the use of your ab muscles for balance, and so he didn't complain. Besides, he was interested in what was in these boxes and why Aunt Petunia just hadn't thrown them away.

  Perhaps the boxes were full of old clothes, Harry thought. He'd been growing a lot since going to Hogwarts---he felt that was due to all of the nutritious food he got to eat---and while his jeans were too big width-wise, his ankles were beginning to show. She was probably giving him the clothes so she didn't have to buy him any new ones.

  After hauling the last box into his room, he nudged his door shut and kneeled in front of the smallest box curiously. This box yielded nothing but a wicker basket, a blue blanket, and some baby clothes. Harry held the small blanket up curiously---it was small enough that he would have to hug his knees for it to completely cover him---and he thumbed some embroidery that was stitched on a corner. /H.J.P./ it said in emerald green thread. Harry felt like Dudley had punched him in the gut and he glanced at the baby clothes again.

  These were his baby clothes and his baby blanket, he realized. And Aunt Petunia had not only kept them, but she'd also given them to him.

  A golfball had lodged itself in his throat and he gently folded the baby blanket and set it upon the wicker basket. He'd think about the fact that his aunt, who he thought hated the very sight of him, had decided to give him his baby things later. He moved onto the other box. This one was full of old letters with curly script written on the front and some books. He pulled one out and realized by the front that it was a photo album. There was a picture on the cover and it was of a family---the man was tall and somewhat burly with a big grin, brown eyes, and dark auburn hair; the woman was a frail-looking thing with long blonde hair and bright green eyes; and then there were two children, an older girl with blonde hair and brown eyes and a younger one with fiery auburn hair and the same green eyes as the woman. As him.

  Harry reverently touched the image of his mother who looked about his age and realized that while he did look somewhat like his father, he had not only his mother's eyes but also her sharp chin and freckles. He gazed at his grandparents, his mother's and aunt's parents, and wished that he had gotten the chance to meet them. They looked very kind and he figured that if they'd been alive after his parents' death, that they wouldn't have thought twice about taking him in.

  He mourned the missed opportunity.

I figure this would be an AU set directly after the second book.

I've had some thoughts of playing around with Parseltongue and Ancient Runes and stuff. If you've read my other fic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28119780/chapters/68898909][Hbi Hr At]]) you'll know that I kind of love it when Harry gets super interested in curse-breaking, spell-crafting, warding, and other similar types of magic, so I think I might take this fic in a similar direction. Basically, I feel like a lot of the books Harry is given are Lily's old Hogwarts notes and stuff (no idear how Petunia got ahold of them, that'll be something I think of later or maybe not at all) and that one of her journals is for Ancient Runes and Potions and Charms and maybe she wrote some stuff on a history project she did about older magic or whatever. And because they're his mum's, he's obviously going to read them. Plus there's the boredom I mentioned, and so I figure that Harry will send McGonagall a letter asking to take Ancient Runes and Ancient Studies and that sort of thing.

I also feel that I can start some stuff about Harry and Ginny bonding over the fact that Voldemort terrorized them both and that Ginny can speak Parseltongue still?

What are your thoughts on this?

*** Thank you! I've put a lot of time into my writing and I'm currently happy with it, though I am working on it a bit.

Ancient history, folklore, mythology and the like is also one of my current interests, though I will have to do a lot of research if I want to go in-depth on all of the Ancient Runes and Ancient Studies stuff. Thankfully I'm already kind of doing that for my other fic, as well as the fact that I have downloaded a few witchcraft books for research, and it hopefully wouldn't be too horrible to google anything. If you have any online sources of those topics (rituals, British Folklore, and Ancient Egyptian history and their deities and rituals they did), then I would be very appreciative.

I'm also working on the fic on and off, though I am currently working on a few other projects so it will be on the backburner.

****** As it turns out, reading and research are much more interesting than chores. While I don't have access to them, the Oxford Handbook series has some really good primers on mythology and magic from a number of different times and cultures. Most ancient magic/ritual practices are inextricably bound up with religious practices, but as this is taking place in the Harry Potter setting, that can be of course altered/kept/discarded in whatever ways suit your story the best.

I'm not sure at what point you're currently at so I found a couple of things from all over.

If you are in the US, interlibrary loan systems are wonderful for acquiring almost any book in print. Scrolling through Wikipedia articles and if you see something interesting, you can click the source link to see where it came from for further reading (and also check whether the source is reputable or more general).

If there are any other specific topics you are looking into, feel free to send me a message and I am happy to help how I can. I'm most familiar with Classical history, but I'm currently looking into grad programs for prehistoric religious practices.

** Why just Lily's? We see that the house in Godric's Hollow was mostly just left as-is by the wizarding community, but it is presumably reasonable to assume that after their investigation, standard practice was to box up personal effects and valuables (so books, jewelry, some photographs etc.) and send them onto next of kin. As Harry is staying in a muggles neighborhood, anything explicitly magical like brooms was removed (knowing the magical world, probably stolen), but this still gives you quite a few things for him to find from both parents and possibly grandparents. It could also give Harry some contrasting views on the same topics.
