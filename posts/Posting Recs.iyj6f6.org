Best place to post oc fanfics?


** Archive of Our Own is the best fanfic website, since it has no ads and is easy to use. You can post any fanfic there, just tag it properly.

** I mean, you'll get at least one person wherever you post - just to clarify, you mean fics written with an original character, right?

**** Ah, okay. Well, yeah, then. There's not really a 'best place' to post OC fics specifically - I don't know of any specific sites for Harry Potter OC pairings - but at least the big ones (FFNet, Ao3, HarryPotterFanfiction, and maybe Wattpad) will get you a decent audience.
