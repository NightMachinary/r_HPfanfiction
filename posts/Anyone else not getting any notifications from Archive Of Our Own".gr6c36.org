I just noticed today that some stories I'm subscribed to on Ao3 updated and I didn't get a notification email for it. Same goes with reviews for my stories. They aren't in my spam folder, I checked that too.

Is this happening to anyone else?

** Is there a way to find out which of my subscriptions have updated recently? I'm not seeing any sorting options on that page.
