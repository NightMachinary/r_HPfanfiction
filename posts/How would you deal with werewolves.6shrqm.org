** Honestly, my main method of attack against werewolves would be propaganda, and efficient disease control methods, trying to counteract the beliefs and values that allow werewolf subcultures to form and reintegrate them back into the main community.

If I knew the general vicinity of where werewolf packs were located, I'd use air-dropped leaflets (from brooms, natch) to advertise to them, exposing whatever lies their leaders (e.g. Greyback) told, instructions of opportunities in the wizarding world, advice on where to seek treatment and counselling, the idea that a person with lycanthropy doesn't stop being a person, et-cetera.

To handle people with lycanthropy, I'd sponsor the development of extended branches from St. Mungos and/or other magical hospitals, featuring extensive outpatient services, and quarantine rooms where werewolves can transform without risk of spreading infections. If there are any fortified wizarding buildings available (forts, prisons before Azkaban, etc), they could be refurbished into comfortable and secure facilities for use during the full moon.

Ministry policy wise, I'd...I'm sorry, [[https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/d/da/DMT_clear.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20111226004639][/why/ does the Department of Magical Transportation emblem look like a biohazard symbol?]]

...Anyway, Ministry policy. I'd probably dissolve the Werewolf Registry and Werewolf Capture Unit; normal werewolves would have their infection in their medical records as usual and be managed by a Center for Infectious Magical Disease Control, which would also manage other contagious magical diseases, while violent werewolves (see; Greyback) would be handled by normal law enforcement or Aurors.

Remember Hermione's homework planner that spoke out loud to remind Harry and Ron about doing their homework? I'd promote some less-irritating 'pocket assistants' in the same vein to people with lycanthropy and/or other contagious diseases, so that they have forewarning about full moons and advice on where to find safe places to transform, or otherwise have access to information to help prevent the spread of their illness. Furthermore, I'd put a bit of financial aid aside, so that at minimum, all magicals with contagious diseases have access to transportation and secure facilities.

...Of course, all this does assume that the general public would be willing to go along with plans to integrate werewolves into the community. It's hard to denounce Greyback's anti-wizard propaganda if he's correct about hatred and violence and not-being-accepted.

*** Another thing to do might be to offer grants and prizes for research into improving Wolfsbane/curing lycanthropy. People don't have to love or care about werewolves, but a good research and development job with funding and support would attract talent and brains regardless, and in time the researchers would become invested.

**** Mm, I did come up with an idea a while back...I think I use that phrase a lot.

But yeah, I did come up with an idea that someone would argue for curing lycanthropy on the basis of 'even if we killed all the werewolves now, what's stopping a new strain of lycanthropy returning in the future?' Bonus points if they could present a sample or documented research of a second strain of lycanthropy that's more dangerous than normal.

I thought that maybe the biohazard symbol had some older context that indicated that the DMT was created to regulate domestic travel to deal with some outbreak, but it was developed in 1966 so that's not likely.

**** More than that, it's not that werewolves are people, it's that people /aren't/ werewolves.

That is to say, while a contagious, dangerous illness like lycanthropy should be subject to disease control tactics (as should other contagious dangerous magical diseases), it should never be allowed to change someone's personal identity, or who they are.

...That would be the gist of an anti-'Greyback Pack' campaign, anyway. I wonder if anyone's written a story where villainous werewolf packs are fought with ideology?

Precisely. A person is a person, no matter how small, no matter how hairy.

The idea that people should be catalogued by no virtue save their DNA [which given the nature of lycanthropy is our best descriptor] is obscene--and sadly has precedent. Even by the nations that fought the nations that did so.

Given that there's nearly 800,000 fanfics on Fanfiction.net, plus another 100,000 on A03, I'd say it's likely.

More important is whether or not it's been done well.

** Aside from using the Killing Curse, I'd most likely turn to some form of transfiguration and blasting spells. Wards that act like claymore mines, or even weaponized dog whistles if their hearing is so sensitive.

It really depends on what powers we're working against. If they're just normal wizards and witches that turn into super-wolves once a month, then I'd treat them the same as any ordinary wand-wielder.

You'll have to be a bit more specific as to their supernatural abilities (if any) and weaknesses.

Super senses don't mean anything if the target wants you to come to them, especially if you'll get funnelled into a kill zone.

Super strength doesn't mean much if you're dead before you reach the enemy.

Super speed doesn't mean anything against if you can't dodge.

Super regeneration doesn't mean much when you're lost 50% of your body mass and can be mopped post-slaughter.

Furthermore, passive traps and tricks that won't be bypassed too greatly by the supernatural weres.

If you encounter a werewolf on the street, they're transformed, and they want to eat you, don't be there. Go somewhere else. Apparate.

If they've raised an army and it's just outside your city walls and you can't evacuate, transformed werewolves aren't necessarily the brightest. A few people on brooms dangling beef puppets with some illusion charms on them and you should be able to lead them away.

Option 2: Avada Kedavra

Option 3: Throw or Banish a portkey keyed to some extremely remote location at werewolf. If desired, locate after transformation ends.

Option 4: Transfigure regular dust or sand or dirt into silver dust (low total mass and similar shape means easier Transfiguration), banish into face, they breathe it in, lungs burn, dead.

Option 5: Transfigure cloth into silver-threaded cloth, cast contact-activated Permanent Sticking Charm on it. banish at face. Repeat for hands and feet (to stop claws).

Option 6: Fiendfyre.

Option 7: Create small vacuum somehow. Transfigure or conjure some antimatter in center of vacuum. Somehow banish vacuum and antimatter at werewolf together, from a great distance away.

** Really depends on what type of fic i want to write and what kind of opposition your facing.

One on one in my basic fic ideas? Fist or weapon fight mono e mono. I like combat fics that have shonen anime levels of fights. Which means yes my version of Harry will be wearing full metal gauntlets and throw a hay-maker into a werewolves jaw.

Large group attacking Hogwarts? Magical chemical warfare. Potions can be very dangerous when mixed and handled incorrectly, string up a minefield of potion mixtures that create toxic gasses and see if mixing wolfs-bane could somehow make it more potent. Or Mandrake bombs.

Large group Canon only magic? Sectumsempra, Lockheart's failed healing spell, Dumbledore's fire wall from the inferni and Voldemort fights, and transfiguration for troops. Halt their progress with the fire and constructs as best you can, vanish their leg bones with the botched healing spell, and put them to an end with sectumsempra.

One on one canon only, blasting spells, sectumsempra, and AK's, no mercy.

** My general "fanon" overview of Werewolves is:

- supranaturally strong and resilient, to the extent that (up to a level) spells can be shrugged off, this applies to mental attacks against them too.

- virtually immune to other conditions and ailments (the Lycanthopy Curse being intensely aggresive in defending its host)

- on the full moon, they go wild. Wolfsbane effectively makes them comatose.

When I get around to writing 3rd year on my fic, Remus will be changed. Harry will be up close and personal with him and notice elements of Lycanthropy arise every now and then.

I believe that a sufficiently powerful wizard can deal with werewolves easily. That being said, the Wizarding world is very afraid of them; therefore, if you are an unskilled wizard a werewolf will destroy you.

Now for the skilled wizard's techniques:

1. transfiguring or conjuring material around their limbs to immobilise, harden or make the material near-unbreakable.

2. Anti-bubblehead charm. Deprive the werewolf of oxygen.

3. In the same vein as the above, trap the werewolf in water as Dumbledore did Voldemort in The Order of the Phoenix film (Ministry battle sequence)

That we're aware of the werewolf is fairly mindless, therefore should be easy to control, contain, or lure if you plan intelligently and make yourself as little a target as possible (so it doesn't go for you).
