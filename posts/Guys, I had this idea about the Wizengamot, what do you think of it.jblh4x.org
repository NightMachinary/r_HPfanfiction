So I was thinking that maybe the Wizengamot was created to keep powerful wizards and witches from going and overthrowing the government every day because they don't agree with the government's actions.

So I thought that maybe the more powerful you are, the more votes you get.

For example, if Lucius Malloy was deemed powerful enough to present a threat to the government should he disagree with something, he would be granted the title of Sorcerer, would be addressed as Sorcerer Malloy and have 10 votes.

If he isn't deemed powerful enough, however, he would be titled Warlock Malfoy and have say 2 votes like the Warlocks of the other Houses.

The idea came from Dumbledore's titles. He was Chief Warlock and Grand Sorcerer, so maybe that was the reflection of his power level.


** That would just make it far easier for powerful Wizards to overthrow the government, because you would just show them who were all the other powerful people and their power levels. And how would you balance it? How many could there be?

The Wizengamot is similar to the Parliament, IIRC some people pointed out some old UK institution had a similar name.

Chief Warlock is the equivalent of the Speaker of House, he would most likely preside over the sessions and keep order.

*** I was actually thinking the opposite.

All these other powerful people with differing opinions would act like a deterrent to all the others, showing them they can't take over the country on their own.

Now, a bunch of powerful people conspiring is the problem I can see now.

*** The only specific role mentioned in the books for the Wizengamot is as court of justice. The only aspects of legislative we see are Mr. Weasley's bill proposal and the ministerial decrees.

**** That's mostly right, though I would argue that the Ministerial decrees come off as more executive actions that legislative. Edicts issued directly by the Minister, not written, debated and voted on by a legislature.

Arthur and Umbridge apparently both had a role in writing legislation (Umbridge was behind anti-werewolf legislation that made it hard for Lupin to get a job). Whether that meant drafting legislation for the Minister's approval, or to be voted on by a legislature, is unclear.

** I don't really see how this system would work. I mean, who exactly is going to evaluate a wizard's "power", and on what basis? Magical skill, money, political clout, or something else entirely? Who sets the criteria in the first place?

Furthermore, what's stopping several powerful wizards with a dozen votes each from simply giving themselves more votes and preventing all others from having any say in how the government is run?

That said, if I had to suggest an alternative, I'd look into the idea of "vassal houses" - e.g., it's a somewhat common idea in fanfiction that the Crabbes and the Goyles are "sworn" to the Malfoys. So you could have it like this: every noble House gets one vote, but the Crabbes and the Goyles are always going to vote the same way the Malfoys do, effectively giving Lucius 3 votes instead of 1.

It's still a system based on "power" - since a powerful family is more likely to attract followers - but not directly so.

(Also, note that of Dumbledore's titles, only Chief Warlock is Wizengamot-related. Supreme Mugwump is the name of the head of ICW, and Grand Sorcerer is likely just a title for an extremely accomplished wizard - sort of a magical DSc)

** I do think it's interesting, but I think it'd need some polishing to be workable. I mean the magical world is pretty barmy, so I can believe that they would have a system like that.

It does also give credence to why purebloods would think muggleborns would be stealing magic, and a few other things
