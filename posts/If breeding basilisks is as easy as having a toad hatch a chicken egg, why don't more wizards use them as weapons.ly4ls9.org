I suppose that even if they are not parselmouths they can cast Imperius on them (GOF shows us it works on animals who don't understand your language as well).

Any theories?


** I would wager that it's because they can kill with one glance. Even under the Imperius curse, that would be insanely difficult to control. You would probably end up killing as many friends as enemies.

*** That would stop smart people from using them as weapons, but there are plenty of idiots in the world who wouldn't think it through. Where are all the free roaming basilisks from these failed attempts?

**** Those Basilisks are named "Darwin" and subsequently removes the idiots. Then they're probably taken somewhere where they can't harm anyone and left there

*** As I was mentioning to another user, there are canon spells to obscure their eyes. And to be honest, before JK actually said it in the books, my headcanon was that Voldemort had concealed the Basilisk and then presented it to his dad and his grandparents and that's why the trace never got activated.

*** As long as you cast the curse when they are babies that haven't opened their eyes I think it should work. Also there are ways to block someone's sight. Hermione uses a spell like that on Phineas Nigellus's portrait.

***** This.

There was a story about a wizard named [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Eldon_Elsrickle][Eldon Elsrickle]] who owned a Nundu as security for his home since it was a small cub while he snuck to steal from wizarding homes, keeping it sedated with the Stunning charm while he's at home.

Then, when the Anti-Alohamora spell was invented, he went home angry and forgot to reapply the Stun spell and got killed by the Nundu.

There's also the difficulty of casting the Imperious curse. Casting the curse on a spider is vastly different from casting on a very dangerous beast like the basilisk.

***** Yeah... there was the story about that guy who invented the Alohomora spell and had a nundu whom he would enchant to go to sleep every time he'd go home through the keyhole. When he forgot one time he was killed by it. So you'd probably have to be really careful.

** I think the process is not as easy as it seems. I think hatching a basilisk is like rocket science, you can have the basic ingridients, but in order to get the desired outcome there might be a lot of control process and knowledge involved.

The chicken egg and toad should match according to some obscure requirement that may people can't even comprehend let alone get a matching pair.

After obtaining the pair you might need to wait for perfect planet alignments and then you need to control the position and timing of toad and egg, even a small deviation would result in a disaster, of course you need to calculate the timing. You also might need to prepare difficuilt potions and rituals to achieve this control structure.

I think for Parslemouths this would be easier, as they somehow have an instinctive knowledge of these things.

** It's a lot of investment for not that much return and a lot of risk. No precaution is a hundred percent effective, and at the end of the day there are much easier ways to kill and scare people than a giant snake you have to feed, house, and handle, which could kill you in a dozen different ways if you do any of those things wrong.

** It was said that Ministry of Magic regulated and routinely inspected chicken coop in order to avoid Basilisk breeding. There might be not be any decent number of chicken produce in Britain or the ones that existed are kept under strict control.

For an individual wizard it might be because of the difficulty on handling and manage the creature. We don't know for certain how quick will Basilisk grow overtime. Considering that Norberta grow from mere hatchling to young baby dragon in under a year it might be possible that Basilisk is the same. When they grow big enough they will causing ruckus and be noticeable. Even with slow metabolism of snake. Apparently only parselmouth can control their metabolism.

Imperius might be used but it is uncertain if it will hold overtime besides it didn't take much for the handler to get killed or petrified easily.

There are probably Basilisk that may escaping to wilderness either because the handler is incapable or unavailable though considering crowing from rooster fatally injure them, then yeah not a big chance they live in wilderness. The one that grow big enough will be easily noticeable anyway.
