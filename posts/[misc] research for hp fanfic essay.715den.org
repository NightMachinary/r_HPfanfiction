Hello! I am currently a university student taking a class about literature in the digital age and we were just assigned our Unit One essay. I'm going to be writing about what fanfiction is (why people write read it, its function, analyzing dynamics within fan communities) and putting a sociological spin on it. I was hoping some members of this sub reddit, both authors and readers, would like to share some thoughts!

I am particularly interested in fan fiction as a sort of critique of the original work. Think black Hermione, mixed race Harry Potter, changing canon, disputing character arcs and relationships, writing fan fic because you disagree with what JKR wrote, etc. It'd be cool to hear about different fics you've read and why. Other topics I'm interested in hearing about is canon, audience, and legality of fanfic.

edit: if you're comfortable I'd also like to know your gender and sexual orientation because in my experience many fan fic readers and writers are women and/or lgbt. I would like to have a better view of who the fanfic community is comprised of.

Thank you so much!


** White heterosexual here.

I'm not comfortable reading stories where the races/genders of characters aren't canon. Otherwise I'm very open to different interpretations and changes to canon. People write fan-fiction(and myself included in this) for various reasons. They want to explore "what if" scenarios, points of divergence, or ideas about characters in the series. Harry Potter is excellent in the fact that, while it has a number of inconsistencies and plot holes, pretty much the entire story arc is open for different interpretation or development.

Every year there's a survey. Try digging this year's survey up. it's very enlightening as to the various positions and values of the community.

** I began to read fanfiction about a year ago. Due to personal issues I basically wanted to shut out the world. I had heard about fanfiction before, and because the new Harry Potter movie was coming up (Fantastic Beasts) I was reminded of the Harry Potter universe, that I really loved 8-12 years ago.

So I started reading, and I liked what I read. I began with stories that were mostly canon rehashes, with small changes that I liked. The stories weren't particularly good, but they had two important features that I loved:

- They brought me back to Hogwarts and Wizarding Britain, a familiar universe that I loved
- They were mostly somewhat fluffy. Sure, sometimes there was an evil!Dumbledore, or an Voldemort that did evil things, but there weren't that many unexpected situations, and somehow the good guys would win.

I basically didn't have to leave my comfort zone. I could go in a world that I could reliably love, where I couldn't fail (compared to games), with characters that I would like, doing the things I wanted to see.

With time that depressive phase faded, but I still loved fanfiction. There was just so much content in an universe I love. There were so many ideas on the same topic, so many different interpretations of the characters, so many possibilities!

Especially in the beginning fanfiction also was the thing that exposed me to the 'usual' critique of Rowling's story. How could Dumbledore be so inconsistent and incompetent? Was Snape good, evil or doesn't he fit in either category? Was Harry's behavior justified? How could no one notice the giant basilik? Is the forgiveness and redemption that the series focuses on so much morally (by Dumbledore, ...) okay and correct?

A lot of that I did with Peggy-Sue-Harrys. (Time-Travelling back to their old self, redoing canon) I generally loved the twists on the familiar materials. It is like Cursed Child, but /better/.

So I kinda stayed. I still read fanfiction, but not as much and never really stopped. My tastes changed, of course. I started to look for better writing, for more interesting plots. I started to want to see novel stories in the old universe. I think the first story that really opened my eyes to the possibilities of fanfiction was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][*A Long Journey Home* by]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/236698/Rakeesh][/rakeesh/]]. It was the first fic that completely left Britain for long periods of time that I really enjoyed.

I myself started to write some fanfictions with familiar tropes that I enjoyed, but I would do it /better/. So I started writing. And of course, I /sucked/. But it didn't matter, because the fanfiction-community is forgiving, and still gives you positive feedback. Of course, I noticed myself that I sucked after a while, and thus abandoned the fic. I have since deleted it.

But the thirst of writing was awoken, and since then I started maybe three more fics, seriously working on one. And I have made improvements in my writing. While it still isn't published and maybe never will, I wouldn't have the enjoyment of writing without fanfiction. There is something about working within a different world not belonging to me that still isn't the one I live in that I thoroughly enjoy.

So to summarize:

- It allows me to revisit a world and characters I love without getting overly bored
- If I want predictable plot with only a few twists I can have it.
- The fanfiction-community is largely supportive, compared to other hostile environments.
- I showed me the benefits of dreaming again, that I kinda forgot.

I'm a hetero, cis male.

** I'm well into my 40s before I became interested in the HP franchise, when I began reading the Books to my school age children. After consuming the original Books, Movies, audiobooks, and other online materials, Fanfictions seem the logical next step for a hardcore fan.

Initially, I was looking for canon compliant materials that fill in those 'missing moments' or alternate POVs. I soon found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), a Year 6 fic from Ginny's POV. It is very well written and has a strong feel like the original. From that point on, I have become an avid HP fanfiction reader.

I quickly branched out to AU (Alternate Universe) stories that still feature canon pairings. The first such story I read was the time travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I]], linkffn(4101650), and I was captivated. Although this fic has lost some of its shine since then, I would still recommend it to new fanfiction readers.

Another very popular time travel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), convinces me to stop focusing on particular pairings. This fic has Harry going back to 1975 and being forced to team up with Bellatrix. She is very well written, and the plot contains lots of suspense and humors.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] shows that a great HP fanfiction doesn't even need the element of magic. Great characters and plot make this story more enjoyable for me than even the original Series. It's truly remarkable how many great creative minds are hidden out there, and they are willing to write their stories for free!

--------------

The HP Series promotes many messages and values I greatly sympathize with: friendship, loyalty, love, CHOICE, tolerance, and rejection of elitism and racism. But I have issue with one message in particular:

The stake of the war against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy even worse than the Nazis or ISIS), and yet JKR wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle. For example, the Trio already knocked out Greyback after he mutilated Lavender. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again. Many readers, including me, don't like this attitude at all.

As a result, fanfictions tend to significantly modify Harry's character and often bash Dumbledore (and the Order). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&s=2][The most popular HP fics]] on FF.net (sorted by number of Favorites) clearly illustrates this phenomenon, since half of them on the first page of that filter result could be considered 'bash fics'.

--------------

IMO, Black Hermione adds NOTHING to the story. In the 90s, when this story took place, 93% of UK was white. Ethnic minorities were however already overrepresented in the Books, as 20% of the original DA (Angelina Johnson, Cho Chang, Dean Thomas, Lee Jordan, Patil twins) were people of color.

Wizards, unlike Muggles, didn't really care much about ethnicities. Kingsley Shacklebolt was black and a key member of the Order, and his family was part of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sacred_Twenty-Eight][the Sacred Twenty-Eight]] Pureblood families. Later he became the Minister and remained there for almost 20 years, indicating a highly successful tenure. Blaise Zabini, another black character, was knee deep in the Malfoy gang. Seraphina Picquery was President of MACUSA in the 1920s when Jim Crow was all the rage and the KKK was mainstream in Muggle US.

You can of course imagine Hermione as being black, but as the UK population of 1979 was 95+% white and 1% black, her likelihood of being one was fairly low. In JKR's own drawings from the late 90s, such as [[https://i.redd.it/k5mxtnez55ez.jpg][this one]] and [[https://i.redd.it/0e7svxhmo2mz.jpg][that one]], she was clearly imagined as white.

** Cis-male heterosexual (White).

I personally don't really see that a difference in the race of a charachter should really affect the story. But if an author were to make a compelling story, I might read it.

I quite enjoy stories where characters are different genders from canon. Hyaroo writes a really fun little meta fanfiction about this: linkffn(11511190).

Looking through some of my favorite stories, I tend to like ones that stray from canon and forge their own narrative. Examples include linkffn(Grow Young With Me) or linkffn(Realizations) or linkffn(A Long Journey Home), all of which cast the character into new situations. Other favorites of mine are those that expand on the magic system. Perhaps the most notable of this type is linkffn(The Arithmancer) and its sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes).

For me, the best thing about fanfiction is finding something new and intriguing despite having a familiar world and characters. I'd love to write one someday, but I'm terrible at plotting. I have the idea for divergences that I'd potentially like to exploit but have no idea where they go.

** Cis slightly bi woman in her 20s here.

I actually don't read that much fanfic because I'm so picky, but I write a lot. Whether I read or write I want it to be canon compliant, either filling in a missing moment or continuing the story. I want more of the world and I can't really immerse myself if I feel like things have been changed. I have a very clear picture in my head of how I think these vharacters "are" and "what happened". There are some fics popularly described as canon compliant that I don't enjoy because my interpretation of the characters and their behaviour doesn't match with mine. Northumbrian is a good example of this - he's a great writer but something about his characterisation rubs me up the wrong way. Canon is important to me, but that being said, I am a rarity in that I enjoyed cursed child and I quite like depictions of Hermione as black, especially in fanart. It's probably not something I would make a point of in my fanfic, but if I could draw I would definitely be drawing her mixed race as I have always imagined her fairly Mediterranean looking anyway. All in all I don't consider it worthy of the controversy and can accept that people view her, and the other characters, in all sorts of ways.

Fanfic is definitely a form of escape and stress relief for me. My most popular stories were written when my mum had breast cancer and I was in a crappy job. Once she became better and I moved into a more challenging role, my motivation and general quality of my work went down. Sadly my mum is seriously ill again, but this time I don't think writing will make me feel better (particularly as my last fic reached a level of popularity where reviews became rather stressful) so I'm more or less absent from the community. The community is mostly very supportive, especially here and on tumblr but sometimes critique, even when fair, is repeated so often that you just end up hating yourself. This is firmly a hobby for me, and I am quite strict with myself when it comes to reader expectations - I don't owe anyone anything.

Other point I have noticed which may or may not be interesting - there is a very marked difference, I have found, in British and American views on how canon should be changed. Americans tend to be a lot more ruthless and militaristic, and more likely to write/enjoy AU stories where Harry is aristocratic, overpowered and morally grey - in my experience anyway. That is conpletely anecdote not data though.

I have the same impression. American writers also seem to view Magical Britain far more negatively.
