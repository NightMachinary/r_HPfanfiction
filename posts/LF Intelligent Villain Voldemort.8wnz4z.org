Instead of "I R CRUCIO MY OWN FOLLOWERS" and the fact that none of them turned on him, when they could have easily just Avada'd him in his sleep, a Voldemort that's actively still Tom Riddle, the genius that manipulates his own followers into fulfilling his goals, and not torturing them, but actively making them work harder, loyalty rather than fear, being a much scarier and more intelligent villain. Who would you be scared of most? A villain who has the complete loyalty and respect of all of his followers, or one that has followers that only follow him because they're scared not to, and would jump ship if someone scarier came along?

The latter, actually. I'm not saying it makes for a more narratively compelling character. But I would be more scared of the latter. Because looking at the facts, Voldemort /wasn't/ losing followers (not a significant amount, anyway; Snape and Regulus would still have happened even if Voldemort had enticed them through charisma rather than fear). Which suggests that there /was/ no one scarier than him. This is a one-man army who's just goddamn powerful enough on his own that he can keep an entire army around and loyal purely based on how overwhelmingly /scary/ he is.

All this being said, I actually do have a recommendation for Intelligent Villain Voldemort. Kindly consider Professor Quirrelmort from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). The one in linkffn(Parselbrat) is less central to the story but pretty damn manipulative too.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  Harry discovers Parseltongue a little earlier. As magic goes, it's not very useful. It's enough to make a few friends though. And isn't that enough? (Fem!Harry)

*** I was thinking more Emily Price Voldemort vs Tom Riddle Voldemort. Emily Price is a much better character, and if she was your enemy, you'd be more scared.
