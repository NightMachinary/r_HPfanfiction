Firstly I am no political expert nor death eater sympathizer. The death eaters and wizarding supremacists are interesting when comparing them to real life political ideologies. The death eaters have many paralells to nazism like supremacism of one group over another. The difference lies in age of their respective ideologies wizarding supremacism is an centuries old ideology when nazism was a new and radical ideology when it rose to power in germany. In my mind death eaters wanted to return the status quo to sometime when purebloods had power, because it seems like the power of purebloods have diminished, for example the british aristocracy was very powerful at the beginning of the 1900s and by the end of the century their power had severly diminished. It was true that Voldemort's army contained many magical creatures and werewolves, but in the end it was only wizards who were allowed into the inner circle. It is hard to believe that a man like Lucius Malfoy would fight alongside werewolves and giants as equals. Hitler was opposed by monarchists and aristocrats, he was also against religion and tradition. In contrast Voldemort seemed to attract upper class wizards. Many families on the sacred twenty-eight supported Voldemort most notably the Lestranges, Blacks and Malfoys who are confirmed to be quite wealthy. These are the reasons I believe the death eaters to be more like reactionaries than fascists. What are your opinions on the matter? Sorry for my english I am not a good writer but I like to discuss.


** Nazism was new, but it evolved rather evidently out of previously existing phenomena present in Europe (Jew hatred, supremacist rhetoric and views, hatred and distrust of foreigners, aftermath of WW1, etc.), and that's shown to be the case for pureblood supremacists as well. Hell, pureblood supremacy goes back at least to Slytherin and it would be comical to suggest he originated the idea all on his own. Ideologies never come out of nowhere, their "newness" is rather more akin to reincarnation or maybe a sort of cultural version of evolution. Hitler wasn't just blanket "against religion and tradition", that's just a nonsense, nuance-free way to characterize him. The part you're missing is that those Lucius and co. would fight alongside and accept into the fold were half-bloods at a minimum and for those like Bellatrix purebloods only. It wasn't that Voldemort only attracted upper-class wizards (Greyback can hardly be called upper-class, nor could Snape). It was their mythic "common identity" that bound them together largely, explicitly against a select "other". As I said, this went back definitely as far as Slytherin, and surely before that. There's a reason he identifies so closely with his direct descendance from Slytherin (after all, being from a thousand years ago technically all of humanity (definitely Europeans) would be descended from Slytherin). It centers him as part of a line which has always stood against the so-called "problem" that other pureblood supremacists were angered about in the late 20th century. As with Hitler, he gave them someone to rally behind who had, in their minds, a coherent worldview, packed with a solution and geneology that made supporting him (Voldemort) the obvious answer to their society's ills.

It's pretty clear they're supposed to be magic Nazis. But then, fascists are quite obviously extremely reactionary so it's not really an either-or kind of thing.

** Pureblood as a movement is what... three centuries old by the time of the books? And it was borne out of circumstances surrounding the creation of Statute of Secrecy. There were radical waves earlier, but the current one stems from the political situation and the social changes in the twentieth century. Still for the majority of British history they weren't really in power. So mix of both I would say?

** I would hesitate to call Nazi-ism new necessarily. It was nationalism, jingoism, and racial supremacy taken to its extreme. The ideas that Hitler espoused(racial supremacy/lesser races) were held in some form by even the Allied countries - see Eugenics. It's just the idea of actively, violently, and methodically killing "lesser" races was wrong. Rowling attempted to make a similar comparison with Voldemort. I'm sure that in canon there are a number of families who believe in the sanctity of pureblood, but find the idea of actively killing Muggles abhorrent. Voldemort was an example of ideology taken to the extreme. This debate still exists today. It's the idea of integration vs keeping your own culture and the question of nativeness. Look at countries in the western world that still struggle with race relations - the US, UK, France, Germany, etc.

​

Now fascism is a term that gets thrown around, and is often misused. Technically, fascism is a form of government on the far left of the political spectrum, usually somewhere in between socialism and communism. It's the fact that Italy, Spain, and Germany were fascist governments results in a tying together of Germany's ideology and their style of government.

​

To finally answer your question, I think the Death Eater moment was a combination of reactionary panic and long term thinking. According to canonical history, Nobby Leech the first Muggleborn Minister of Magic, ascended to power sometime after Grindelwald's war and before the first Voldemort war. I assume that and other events served as a catalyst for the extremists who believed in all wizarding superiority, and those feelings boiled over. It's not even clear how much Voldemort himself truly believed in wizarding superiority - he definitely placed his own power and success over that of the movement. But that being said, the political setting, Voldemort's charisma and power, and the feelings of (usually wealthy) Purebloods spurred the movement.

That's not quite true. Fascism is generally considered a far right-wing ideology - on the opposite end of the spectrum from socialism and communism. It would only be considered near to communism if you subscribe to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory][horseshoe theory]] - i.e. the far-left and the far-right are closer to each other than to the middle.

Historically, the fascist movements you mentioned were all strongly right-wing and persecuted left-wing Marxists and anarchists.

Fascism presented itself as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Position][third position]], as opposed to international socialism and free-market capitalism - the two dominant ideologies of the time.

So to be fair, it doesn't really fit neatly into the left-right paradigm, because it combines far-left economics with far-right cultural views.

But any dictionary or encyclopedia will still classify fascism as a right-wing political ideology.

**** But it doesn't combine far-left economics. Hitler empowered and partnered with powerful members of industry and supported private ownership of business (so long as it wasn't necessary to the war economy anyway). State participation in the economy isn't a left-wing idea, right-wingers have always done the same thing despite their claims to the contrary. They just want (in practice) the government to be involved in different areas of the economy (war economy especially, but in general to do specifically business friendly economic policy)

***** That's a fair point about Hitler, but he doesn't personally embody fascism. There was disagreement early on even within the Nazi party about this, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasserism][Strasserism]]. But I should have said it /can/ combine far-left economics with far-right cultural views, rather than implying it always does.

****** *Strasserism*

Strasserism (German: Strasserismus or Straßerismus) is a strand of Nazism that calls for a more radical, mass-action and worker-based form of Nazism---hostile to Jews not from a racial, ethnic, cultural or religious perspective, but from an anti-capitalist basis---to achieve a national rebirth. It derives its name from Gregor and Otto Strasser, the two Nazi brothers initially associated with this position.

Opposed on strategic views to Adolf Hitler, Otto Strasser was expelled from the Nazi Party in 1930 and went into exile in Czechoslovakia while Gregor Strasser was murdered in Germany on 30 June 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives. Strasserism remains an active position within strands of neo-Nazism.

****** The problem is Strasserism didn't and doesn't represent the majority Nazi view, Hitler represented the party. And thus the economics were in no uncertain terms right wing and emphatically against the communists and socialists (that's why Hitler had them killed too).

*** Nazism as a political system most certainly was new. While it combined old ideas the combination was most certainly unique. There was btw far much more wrong with nazism than just hte killing of "lesser" races. Even when you ignore the obvious stupidity that was at the core of the system.

The comparison between nazism and the current debate on integration and the importance of culture can not and should not be made. It is ridiculous and does neither do justice to the history of nazism nor the current debate.

Nazism has nothing to do with socialism nor communism in any way shape or form. Neither in the way the goverment funcitoned. The way society was governed nor how the economy was run. The ridiculous notion that nazism was socialism is fueled by the american right praying on lack of education on the subject in schools there. The comparision makes zero sense.

I disagree. You're correct that Nazism extends beyond just its racist ideologies. But facism believed in the idea of conformity, you either join the party or support it.

Today's debate is still very much about conformity, though less severe than conformity in a fascist state. Is that not what's currently happening in Denmark with the "integration education" laws for Muslims.

Even if no government will ever actually function like the Nazis ran theirs, the ideologies behind the Nazi racial supremacy are still part of today's debate.

***** No. When one takes the edge off nazism one gets regular racism. The seed of nazism is racism but the seed of racism is not nazism.\\
Racism and Nazisms can not be equated.

That in no way represents a valid historical argument.

That is ridiculous, there's no argument for that. Nearly any exploration of the fascist ideology and policies put it on the extreme right-wing. A high emphasis on tradition - especially with respect to a mythic past and racial purity/supremacy -, high focus on wartime capitalism (pumping loads of money into the military with the purpose of conquering) and support for private ownership of the means of production, etc. The USSR was obviously the prototypical socialist economy and the state owned most industries and the one's it didn't own (agriculture, mainly) were owned by the collective farms.

You're basically saying an individualist ideology and a collectivist one are of the same kind, which is a contradiction.

** Well nazism doesn't really lend itself towards comparisons. Because of two main reasond

First Nazism let to the Holocaust. Not only is the Holocaust not comparable to any other genocide it was also in every way shape or form a useless endavour. It hindered Nazi Germany in every imaginable way. This requires such a specific mindset one can't really compare.

Second Nazism lacks a coherent ideology. Basically what hitler said went.

The easy comparison between the Nazi's and DE is actually there

The NSDAP had rich benefactors among it's supporters. as does the DE

The nazi's were reactionary in the way they wanted to go back to the glory days of the german first and second empire. As are the DE

The Nazi's believed in the superiorty of their people and culture due race tradition and blood. Same goes for DE

The Nazi's were military minded and didn't shun violance. Same goes for DE.

​

Actually the superficial comparision is very much there but with a deaper understanding of the mechanics of the third reich show a different story.

Both of those phenomena were present in HP. The Muggleborn trials and stripping Muggleborns of magic was a useless endeavour that lines up with the Holocaust. Considering HP was a children's series, JK's allegory was tamer and had Muggleborns stripped of their wands and jailed rather than killed in Death Camps.

The same can be said of Voldemort and the DE's. He was the supreme leader, and whatever he said went.

**** Regarding your first point: Ah but the jailling of other races and undesirable people is not inherent to nazism. That is actually not that uncommon in history. The Holocaust isn't unique in the killing of a people. The Holocaust is unique because of how they did it.

The difference of the stripping of muggleborns is only useless. As are all forms genocide. No the Holocaust differs due to the fact that he Nazi's really started commiting to the endavour when it was least opportune.

Comparing the treatment of muggleborns to a regular genocide is rather easy. Comparing it to the Nazi's not so much.

Regarding your second point: The way Voldemort is the surpreme leader is comparible but that was not what my point was about. What i meant is that because Nazism doesnt have a coherent ideology comparing Nazi ideology to other ideologies in this case the DE ideas does not work well.

*** Some from old families were opposed to Hitler because he was just a lowly corporal from an insignificant family. That is what I think is an difference Hitler didn't like the aristocracy and they didn't like him. Voldemort attracted mostly a small elite, the inner circle of death eaters who were purebloods when Hitler on the other hand attracted the common man. They are small superficial differences but interesting indeed. You could imagine if a secretive mysterious group appeared in the UK to restore the former privileges of the aristocracy.

Come to think of it the death eaters actually reminds me the most of the KKK because the KKK also had influence in politics and consisted partly of respectable members of society. It was also quite secretive.
