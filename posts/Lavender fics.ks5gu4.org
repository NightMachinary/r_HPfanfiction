Thanks babybat21. Now I want a fic about Lavender, OC or canon, well written. Lavender Brown POC or as a main character. I'm storing up good fics to read while I'm living alone for 2 months.

** I really like Lavender in post-War [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian stories]] (YES, LAVENDER LIVES!) starting with “Tales of the Battle”, “Hunters and Prey”, and then continuing in the stories of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][Muggle Interface Team]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123][The Lavender/Moon Tales]].
