I know this is an odd question, but I wonder. I've talked to a lot of people online who say they're really into HP fanfic mostly because they don't think the original series is very satisfactory and that some fanfic does quite a lot of things (such as characterization, theme, prose, pacing, worldbuilding, etc) far better. In fact some of them outright dislike the HP series but love fanfic.

Also I've read a lot of upvoted comments here which are pretty insulting or dismissive of the original series, and which receive a lot of support from other commenters. So I'm just kind of wondering what the demographics are here, so to speak, or what the general opinion is. It's just something I'm kind of curious about.


** I still love it; although I'm aware some of that is nostalgia now. I also still think it's a good start for people reading fantasy books or children's books, and for a series that starts out aimed at children; they are well-written with multiple plot threads, foreshadowing, and lots of hints that later prove important which really draw in readers from one book to the next.

I also think, for the time they came out, they were quite revolutionary in some ways - things like Hermione's devotion to logic and intelligence were actually for the time unusual traits to find in a female side character in a book (ostensibly) aimed at boys, as the series was initially marketed before 'Potter-mania'. Before Hermione, at least in Western kids books, smart female characters would generally be also artistic, dramatic, or passionate - in that way I think (obviously helped along by the series' huge popularity) Rowling trailblazed certain new character tropes into the mainstream.

It has also dated a lot though, even in 15-20 years. Fandom and the power of fandom is so important nowadays; and with the variety of fans the things that don't feature become glaring - all the main characters are (supposedly) white, and marriage and pairing up is still the big goal for all the female characters - and of course, fanon is a lot more angsty and gritty whereas Rowling tries to (by the end of the series) write both an adolescent school story for a broad audience, a mythic hero-journey, and a racially-motivated war (all with largely PG-13-rated violence, despite the /evilness/ of the characters in question) - so we as readers, especially adult readers going back to the books, are left with some jarring features and inconsistencies - all the 'good' characters in the war refusing to use lethal force, for example, which ultimately ends up in some of their own getting killed down the line. The movies also skew some people's view of the books I think - both now, and for future generations of fans who will probably consume both alongside or maybe watch the films first, which to me will mean (cheesy as it sounds) losing a bit of the magic of the books.

As an introduction to fantasy and the hero's journey they're great though; and even now I still feel like the characters are almost my friends, too.

** It's possible to be disappointed with a few elements of the original series and still love it overall. I'm in that camp.

Books 6 and 7 pulled a few elements out of nowhere (horcruxes, wand allegiance deus ex machina) and retconned them into the series. Horcruxes and Dumbledore's death basically made Harry's task impossible, meaning /Deathly Hallows/ was inevitably going to be a unsatisfying as a story.

** For me, it is the best example of children's literature, especially for the modern generation. Other loved classics, like the Hobbit and Narnia are fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the HP original series is well written, funny, inventive, full of morals that children can understand and also interesting, and it conveys a sense of depth in the universe that only LotR manages to best. It's not masterful like Eliot or Dickins, but the story and the characters are all believable and flawed in their own way. In fact, that is the books star feature. JK's characters are fantastic, and she manages to inspire hate beyond comprehension in a government worker doing her job, and similarly scaled adoration for an escaped convict, mostly by the way the characters interact with others.

As a eleven year old, first reading the books, they inspired an imagination far greater than any other books could, and were not boring and dull like some other books could be. Of course, upon rereading, they are not as amazing as my primary school self thought they were, but they are very readable.

When I have kids, I will read them Harry Potter. I will probably be the person in the room most enjoying them, even if my kids have bugged me to read it to them the twentieth time, and have every single square foot on their walls covered in Gryffindor.

** I liked it. I know it's a kid's story, and it has its share of inconsistencies (Pettigrew-Marauder's Map, TIME TURNERS, Felix Felicis, etc), but Harry Potter still is a fun, compelling story with its charms.

I think FanFiction is fun because it allows the user to reimagine and put his own stamp on the world. For example, I would prefer a much darker story with a harder magic system. Fanfiction has that.

Dumbledore's a good person and actually has a semblance of skill at what he does. Whenever Harry was doing something dangerous, Dumbledore was following close behind with the help of a Time Turner and invisibility cloak.

**** Didn't Slughorn say something in HBP like Felix Felicis can be poisonous if consumed over a long period of time? I haven't read the books in a long time though, so I might be wrong.

But yeah, the map thing I can definitely understand. Dumbledore with a time turner doesn't seem unbelievable but also doesn't seem likely.

** Yes. I like the original series. Granted, I grew up with the story, being exactly the right age bracket for Harry to be near near enough to my own age the entire way.

Looking back at it as an adult there's some horrendous fridge logic, but I have to admit that most of what bothers me, only bothers me because I care about the characters.

** Well, I learned to read English with the first couple Harry Potter books. I had Snape and Draco stickers on my first computer. I had a Harry Potter themed 7th birthday party. So, they'll always be special, but they were never my favourite, and I did go through a time (oddly also around the time I discovered anime, who woulda thought) where I disliked the Harry Potter series. Especially in the fifth book. I HATED the characterisation of Harry. When I discovered fanfiction, it was like a whole new world. Overall, I've settled into a place where, I think JK did a fantastic job pulling together myths from all over the place, world building, integrating symbolism from many different foreign traditions. But, her characterisation, her plot, her representations of people, and most especially her outcomes, feel very one-sided and unsatisfying. She made a fantastic world, but the story she told in it was full of plotholes and moral judgements, and could definitely be improved upon. And thus fanfiction comes in, brings together the best of both worlds, and everything is fantastic again :D

** I love HP, and have since the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. It took me a while to get into it, though, as I was exposed to another burgeoning phenomenon a little earlier.

A good litmus test is thus: did you discover Harry Potter before or after anime?

Pretty much any shonen manga/anime will do here. I was barely seven when I started reading manga, and it wasn't nearly as popular as it is now in the UK, but for those who read it, it did a lot to solidify those common tropes (like Beam Struggles, Power Levels etc).

Even reading Western fantasy novels might jade a person's opinion of the original books, since the Chosen One is typically a bottomless pit of power-ooze in a world where magic is finite and/or has cost.

Reading the HP series with that kind of preconception would likely inhibit one's enjoyment of the world and its plots, I'd reckon.

EDIT: Fanon seems to have a negative effect on many readers' impressions of wizarding society. Authors who feel the same way usually use Hermione as a mouthpiece and eventual battering ram against the imagined feudal system that wizards appear to still hold on to. That's okay if you're writing an AU, but canon? Really?

It can stand on it's own, that being said though, there is some really excellent fan fiction that is also as good as the series. I see those fics as complimentary to the books and enjoy reading them that way.

The rest is good and bad, hit or miss, but the universe... there's a reason there are like a million published meta-fictions set in Rowling's world. That's no coincidence.

** Ugh. I'll be attacked for admitting to this, I'm sure.

When I was a child I loved the Harry Potter books, because they were children's books. Then I read it a few years later and my teenage-fuelled cynicism took over and everywhere I saw shallow characterizations, deus ex machinas, poor writing, etc.

Now, I'm not saying the original series was bad. I liked it the first time I read it, and still now some of the nonsensical stuff--stuff I hate one one hand--is the stuff that gives the world its magical wonder.

I don't really want to get into a debate over this.

** I do love the series but I think at least part of that was the fact that I read it growing up. I think if I had just come across the series at this point in my life instead I don't think I'd have the same love for it, which I guess is in a way also due to fandom because in fandom you can find a version that has exactly what you're searching for which can make it seem like it does stuff much better.

The pure size of the fandom in this case is a bit of a double edged sword because no matter what you think of the actual series there is likely a fanfic that plays it much more to your interests.

** I love them for what they are, how they are written and what they represent. They are books for children and later on for teenagers. Its a series of books that encourages the reader to grow with them, touching very important themes for children and teenagers, especially book two and five. They are truly magical for that in my opinion.

The reason most people say they dislike them, and I used to share that idea, was for what they could have been. When we look back to the Harry Potter books we only focus on the fantasy part, and we are very disappointed with it. The fantasy in the Harry Potter books was badly plotted and developed and we wanted more. We want complicated magics, philosophical questions and answers, an adventure filled with mystery and delight, and these things Rowling did not deliver. And, like everything, we focus on the bad things rather than on the good things, and we project our desires for what we need now, rather than what the books themselves are about and for the needs they are trying to fulfill.

*** The issue I have is this:

This first book is wonderful on its own. But when you realize that it's part of a series and read the rest of them it becomes apparent she lost control and couldn't reign it in.

I'm paraphrasing something I read a bit back, but I agree.

It is the what could have been that leaves the foul taste in my mouth.

** I like them. Haven't read them in years, but loved them as a child. I think the most impressive thing is not her writing but the world she created. It fits so perfectly in our world that thousands of children hoped (against hope) to receive a Hogwarts letter around their 11th birthday.

** I always enjoyed the books, still do. They're one person's vision of a magical world and admittedly that vision has flaws and inconsistencies. That's bound to happen, I think, when one person writes seven books where the subject matter and storytelling is evolving to match an audience that's growing up alongside the main characters.

Part of what makes fan fiction awesome is that it allows creative, talented people to take that magical world and reimagine it in a way that suits their own personal tastes. Sometimes the results are amazing and sometimes they're Drapple. ;)

I guess what I'm saying is that it's not impossible to love the books and to love the fan fiction stories that strive to iron out the little things about them that drive some readers crazy.

** I loved books 1-5. I literally cried when DD died in book 6, but I really loved it the second time through.

Book 7 completely ruined the entire Harry Potter canon universe for me. I felt like the entire name Harry Potter was a farce, and Rowling was secretly creating a series about Severus Snape using the name Harry Potter as a facade to push her pro-Snape agenda... I felt like the Deathly Hallows were a Deus Ex machina, and the final battle was just cliche after cliche. I almost put the book down when Harry came back from the dead, but I managed to push through to the end. When I found out Harry named his son after Snape I almost vomited all over myself. The entire epilogue is a stain on the Harry Potter series, and that's coming from a H/G shipper.

I hated the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. HATED. I still do. I hated it so much and was so upset about it that I never even watched films 6, 7 or 8. I've have never to this day so much as watched a trailer for any of them.

That being said, I read book 7 within 24 hours of the book being released for sale, and have not picked up the book since. I realize that I am probably being unfair and emotional about it. I am sad it ended how it did.

** I still love it, and wish that every time I read it was the first over again. A lot of that love is nostalgia, but a lot of it is just for the familiar, for the lessons I learned and the characters who felt as close to me as my own friends and family. For the one liners that still make me laugh, and for the deaths I still mourn.

People say Harry Potter changed their lives.. For me, it shaped it. I grew with this series. I aged with these characters and I lived with them and they lived through me and the love I had (/have/) for them. I can re-read this series and look at parts of me and see where they come from, what lessons I learned and what I believe in written down on the pages before me. I can find characters who I see in my friends and know that, on some level, I recognised those characters in the people I surround myself with. I can close my eyes and see every spell cast, every battle won, every magical moment lodged within my mind and heart and know that it will always give me that feeling of wonder.. I can pull these books from their place on my shelf and feel the anticipation for the adventures I have lived so many times before that /they are a part of me/..

Harry Potter was never a technically perfect series. Honestly I don't think it would have captured so many hearts if it was.

But it was perfect to each of us, in its own way.
