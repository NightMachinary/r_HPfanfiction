I really like long fics and I was just wondering what the longest was.


** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6048][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]] is over 1,4 million words and is a single work, written over almost a decade. It was slow paced for the majority but the writing is good. It's canon-compatible through OotP and incorporates parts of HBP and DH.

Edit: cleared up wording

**** It's your preference, why should it make anyone angry?

Regarding the question: the first several books are slash- and sex-free (AFAIR). Harry and Malfoy become friends, and even start providing each other with emotional support, but that's mostly it.

Definitive start to all the romantic bullshit is given ... /*checks the file*/ ... somewhere around chapter ~50 of book â„–4. Unfortunately, unlike some other authors --- e.g. /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1485356/wordhammer][wordhammer]]/, who even went as far as trying to separate all sexual content from the regular one and putting it under another story title --- /Lightning/ doesn't bother with anything like that. After the romanctic subplot kicked in, I was just skipping large bits of text, and I wouldn't say the story's quality was suffering much from it.

So: you can try reading the first 3-4 books, and after that decide if it's worth to bother trying to sift through all the stuff you're not interested in for the sake of the material that still holds your interest.

** There are some really long fics out there. There is one that I have saved that I read most of that isn't complete that is over 1.3 million words. The firebird trilogy isn't really that long to me. A few long fics that are completed, I'll star ones I don't remember well enough to recommend. From what I found looking up some stuff about this, 1 million words is equivalent to 3,400 pages at the word to page ratio J.K. Rowling used. So 3 million words = 10,200 pages.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero]]

The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

Words: 338,022 - It is a 3 parter that totals 1,005,151 words. I've read the first two need to read the last one at some point.

AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

Words: 81,263 - Short word count for the first one, but this 7 part series totals a whopping 3,069,975 words. I read the first 3 and got halfway through the fourth, but it got very dark; too dark for my tastes. If you are dismissing it based on it being slash don't. I don't really like slash all that much but this is very well written from what I remember.

Words: 737,006 - If you are looking for length done wrong, here is a fic for you. I read most of this fic as it was updated, and it just went on and on and on. I read it like a train wreck. I just wanted to know what happened at the damn end, but it takes forever to get there. If you end up liking this fic you'll like all the author's fics.

AU, first in the main Dangerverse series, now complete. Lone wolf. Dream-seer. Bright child. Scarred child. Singer. Prisoner. Dancer child. Dragon child. Eight semi-ordinary people. One extraordinary family, and how they became one. Pre-Hogwarts story.

Words: 222,438 - Total words: 1,902,441. I really liked this series. I read it as it was updating, but stopped reading about halfway through the fourth or fifth book I think. I need to go back and re-read it again so I can finish it. The description doesn't really do it justice imo. Its a good set.

When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

Words: 251,462 - Second part is 343,956 words. A most likely abandoned trilogy, I can't help but link it. This is an amazing fic to me. The beginning is pretty slow, but the story really kicks magic up a notch. While the last part will most likely never be written (I seriously think the author died D: ), the first two parts are good enough to stand on their own.

**** "Over 1 million" is an understatement. It's nearly 3 million.

It's very well written, has some amazing world building, and pretty much every single character is well-fleshed out, even the ones that don't show up much. But it does deal with some heavy issues--mainly child abuse (psychological and emotional rather than physical)--and the portrayal of the war is a lot more realistic than the books. There's torture and murder, at least one rape scene, and the rather brutal death of an infant (which disturbed me a great deal, primarily because it was one of the few things the author didn't include a warning for).

If those issues don't put you off then I do recommend reading it, but personally it's not something I'll read a second time, partly for the length and partly for the seriousness. I did find the fifth and sixth "books" dragged a bit, but on the whole it's worth getting through.

**** I would agree with what the others have said. It's very well written, especially for fanfic, but also as novels in their own right. It took me several tries to read through the entire series. The first two books can be off-putting, just because Harry has such an abused child mentality. The 3rd book is where the series really hooked me in.

I enjoyed them. They're probably my favorite fanfic. :)

** Sunrise and Sunset over Britain have a total of 1,027,500 I believe. One of my favourite fics. Written/planned before HBP came out (actually HBP came out in the middle of their publication but they stuck to their own story). Really enjoyable, find on fanficauthors.net

*** Ugh, it's so ridiculous, though. It's full of the usual ridiculous cliches you'd expect in a powerful!Harry, manipulative!Dumbledore fic, and I mean... [[/spoiler][an insane Dumbledore gets killed by a crumple-horned snorkack]].

**** To be fair though, that was their intent. They tried to do powerful!Harry and have him hide it, and he still had to actually work and learn. Plus most of what they've written was before things had been written in to cliche

** The Alexandra Quick series is pretty darn long now. Each "book" is only about 200-300K, but it adds up, and it'll only get longer as the last 3 come out.

** I posted this in a reply but it deserves its own TLC. The [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net][DLP Scryer]] can sort by word count. Granted, it can't tell you what /series/ is the longest, as it can't add the individual files' wordcount, but it will get you close, at least for the fics on ffnet.

*** Thanks for the recommendation but I don't like HPMOR. I tried the first few chapters but it wasn't for me.
