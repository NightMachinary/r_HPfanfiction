IMO, Ginny has several skills that could've made their journey much more easy. In particular, I would love to see a scene wherein Ginny impersonates Bellatrix in order to break into Gringotts, for I always felt that Hermione was bit too, for the lack of a better word, law-abiding to impersonate Bellatrix, something that Ginny could've most likely aced.


** And the trace?

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** in the Arithmancer series, Harry doesn't even try breaking up with her. also Hermione comes up with a ritual to remove the Trace, therefore eliminating any concern of Ginny being a liability when they're on the run. George also goes with them.

*** She is fifteen coming on sixteen. Her seventeenth birthday is after the Battle of Hogwarts. So, Trace is an unresolvable problem, unless either you declare Trace as a horrible plot-crutch which is just forgotten and ignored (+1 from me), or you find some way how to get rid of it (e.g., Minister Scrimgeour makes its removal a favour to all six of them for fighting in DoM, or given the state of the impending civil war, removes Trace altogether).

**** I'm all for ignoring the Trace. I mean it just felt way too convenient to me, even while I was still reading the books. But getting someone else to remove the Trace for Ginny, might require a lot of forethought and planning, mainly because the fighting in the DoM takes place under Fudge's administration, as well as a good year before Dumbledore's death, and considering Scrimgeour's attitude towards the Trio (viz. searching the contents of Dumbledore's will before handing them over) makes it rather far-fetched.

***** 1. It was just two-minutes-thinking idea, so I am not putting my life down for it.

2. I could very well imagine, that exactly because the Battle of DoM happened under the Fudge's administration, Scrimgeour could make The Six into Our Big Heroes (and screw them up behind their backs anyway) and do Something Glamorous like naming them Special DMLE Agents or something (with great photo on the first page of the Daily Prophet).

3. Or another Glamorous Thing would be lifting the Trace altogether for “These Serious Times”
