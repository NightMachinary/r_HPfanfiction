I've been searching this, I like the Slytherin!Harry fics that have Harry's first interaction with Draco end up being more successful. His first friend is Draco instead of Ron. Generally(not always, I'll take anything) this is done when Harry goes with Hagrid for his school supplies since he DOES meet Draco but the interaction is short. The only thing I dislike in Slytherin!Harry fics is if he still ends up friends with the same people, despite being in a different House - and specially one that hates each other. I do NOT see Harry being friends with anyone besides perhaps Hermione because she was a social outcast and there is some merit in befriending her because of her smarts(and early on, she has no tag-alongs to cause problems). Ron is a no, I just don't see him WANTING to be friends with a Slytherin(honestly I feel like he'd be more betrayed that the Great Harry Potter was a slimy Slytherin instead of a brave Gryffindor), and if he does end up sort-of-friends it would be a long way off from 1st year.

Ships - just please no Harry/Ginny.

Bonus points if it's complete or being updated! If it's not complete and is abandoned but very good, warn me!

Also, Bonus points if Snape is involved!


** linkao3(261823)

Should be the right link, there's one in ff.net but it's incomplete. The whole story goes up to the sixth book before discontinuing halfway. It should be roughly what you want.

  Harry Potter has found out he's a wizard and is on his way Hogwarts. He is found by a boy on the train. Who knew one simple sentence and one simple gesture could change history? A Slytherin!Harry AUABANDONED DURING BOOK SIX (I know the post said it was the whole series. The post was wrong. Sorry)

** Well, there is /They shook hands/ - linkffn(7659033) - that sort of fits. The real point of divergence is that Draco is slightly nicer. Also, McGonagall and Ron sort of replace canon Snape and Draco. As for Hermione... well, Harry doesn't befriend her at all...

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

that's the fanon talking. in canon, harry was a lot more antagonizing towards slytherins than ron, in fact, ron was pretty neutral towards them.

*** I'm pretty sure on the train in /Philosopher's Stone/ Ron outright says any House would be better than Slytherin to Neville (or maybe it was after he was hit with a leg-locker, can't recall). Harry was antagonistic to Malfoy earlier, not to Slytherins as a house. So it's not really that fanon.

**** It was /Harry/ who said the remark about 'stinking Slytherin' to Neville, and that was just before the match against Hufflepuff in their first year.

Harry associated Slytherin with Voldemort pretty early on, and thought that the Slytherins didn't look all that friendly at the sorting feast.

Ron: "...imagine if they put me in Slytherin."

However, you were right about the other one. But the association with Voldemort came from Hagrid. I think JKR bungled this since we were expected to believe by the end that Slytherin was A-OK despite all mentioned ones being assholes at a minimum.

*** Perhaps, I still do not think that they would be friends for the simple fact one is in Slytherin and another in Gryffindor - if even because the majority of Ron's Housemates(and probably siblings) wouldn't approve.

Also, yes Harry was antagonizing a LOT - and kind of a jerk haha.

***** No, no one likes Slytherins but Slytherins it seems. Though, and I'm not sure if it's just because our main character was in Gryffindor but the Gryffindor/Slytherin rivalry seemed strongest.

I DO need to re-read the series though.
