Some fanfics read differently if you are new or old to fandom. Let's hear 'em


** Soul-Bond fics are a gateway drug. They seem like the logical conclusion of the canon pairings and how magic would "improve" a romance. Only when you don't take things at face value and look deeper you notice the flaws, which the narrative sells as advantages. Also, they were the thing that showed up when I googled "Harry Potter fanfiction" after being disappointed by Cursed Child and read a review claiming that there was better fanfic around.

As for bad-for-beginners, pretty much everything that pairs Harry with a background character like Katie Bell, Nymphadora Tonks or Susan Bones. Or perhaps even worse, the fanon favourite Daphne Greengrass. Also, unless you want to read about the actors shagging, slash is out of the question, as is any Snape pairing.

FTFY

He certainly was for me. HPMOR was my first fic, but robst was probably a majority of the first 20.

As for fics that are actively /bad/ for beginners, I think a good story is a good story, but fics about background characters like you said might be. Maybe fics like linkffn(Divided and Entwined) where it's /hard/ for the protagonists, and they can't just tear down the opposition by extolling the virtues of western democracy. Readers who are looking for wish fulfillment tend not to go for that.

The other category is a parody like linkffn(The Rise and Fall of Harry J Potter), which you can only appreciate after you've read a ton of bad fanfics.

Note that he wants nothing more than to stop teaching, but Dumbledore wants to keep him at Hogwarts like Trelawney. In this case the crux of it is that Snape is not a man with a lot of self-control or mental sability, and because of his antisocial disposition he despises having to interact with people less clever and knowledgeable than he; an anger which he can't stop himself from constantly taking out on everyone around him, regardless of age. Snape should never have been a Professor, in a Voldemort-less world, but he needs a therapist, not a judge.

#+end_quote

They don't? I have had the opposite impression. Many casual viewers absolutely adore Snape and Alan Rickman and tend to equate the two. He is often brought up in posts about best characters and best actors and people can not get enough of him. The final movie pretty much proved to most people that Snape was good all along and was doing everything for Lily. There is a reason why the "Always" phrase and image is so popular.

The movies also portray him mostly in a good light and play down his flaws so casual viewers wouldn't even know/remember the extent of his bullying and pettiness in the books. I didn't even know just what a bastard he was in the books before I started reading fanfiction.

Most of his iconic moments also paint him in good light. Trying to save Harry from Quirrel curse, shielding the trio behind him from a werewolf, saving Draco, Dumbledore begging Snape to kill him, crying over Lily's body, tragic death, etc. I can't even recall moments in the movies where he is actually portrayed as bad other than calling Lily a mudblood. He is super popular and I can see fanfiction with him as a main character being a good intro.

I know it was enough for me to get into HP fan fiction. I was a casual viewer of Harry Potter who barely remembered much about the plot, but I liked Snape and wanted to read something where he got a good ending.

Yes, but before that it was six years of petty abuse of power with a past as a member of the magical SS. And the bullshit manipulation he tried to pull with his "worst memory". First impressions are everything, and if six books establish someone as an asshole at best, not everyone will follow the narrative that he was a good guy all along.

And I was hoping that the magical Holocaust victims would get justice, or even better, bloody vengeance. Maybe because I am German and we get that kind of sensibility drilled into us from the first year of Middle School onwards, but I never found a shred of sympathy for any Death Eater because the Nazi parallels were obvious. Pretty much everyone I talked to IRL shared that view because we were school children and Snape was introduced as a petty, abusive teacher so he was stuck on our eternal shitlist from book 1 onwards. Maybe the current generation of fans has a different view because they didn't have years to reaffirm their hatred for Snape while waiting for the later books to be published.

Tl;dr: Don't make assumptions about everyone based on your own interpretation because everyone has their own experiences which factor into their interpretation. Call it confirmation bias, but the casual fans I knew (my classmates in middle- and highschool) were no Snape or Malfoy fans.

He didn't seem like much of an asshole in the movies to me when I first saw them. My first impression of him was from the first movie and I know many people's as well. I did read the first book before then, but I was young and did not really remember much from it until I saw the movie.

He just seemed like a strict teacher who was shown to be mysterious and dark. Also, the source of many great comedy and sarcastic moments that made me and everyone I watched the movies with laugh (Like the whole "obviously.." response to Umbridge). I do love sarcasm and that particular style of humour though.

Well good thing there is something written for everyone then since it looks like we care for completely different things in fiction. I personally can't stand fics that focus on bloody vengeance, it comes too close to character bashing to me which I hate. I prefer less hate and more adventure, sarcastic humour and focus on character development.

It's fiction, lots of people are into more villainy characters (like the popularity of Joker and Thanos at the moment, or even Bellatrix from people who hate Snape) and no one seems to have any problem with it unless it's Snape or Draco for some reason. I don't see why we need to compare liking fictionous grey characters to approving of real world events and making comparison to them. It's fiction, it's not the same.

It could be cultural differences too. I grew up in America when the later books and movies were released (high school, college) and everyone who I have talked with about Harry Potter was either neutral or liked Snape/Malfoy as characters. Or at least did not take them very seriously. Maybe you also should not make assumptions based on your views. Just because you think a character is horrible, doesn't mean you should imply that anyone who happens to enjoy reading about them is wrong.

How exatly does a vengeance-driven vigilante or a Nürnberg style trial turn into character bashing? Or even an October-Revolution style takeover. I mean, Batman is Batman because he is out for revenge, even if he uses non-lethal force without obvious bashing (besides incompetent police).

Bellatrix is a lot better suited for any kind of grey/positive depiction because we know nothing about her early years and that blank can be filled however an author wants since Azkaban can be used as a reasonable explanation for any character change. But we know too much about Snape or Malfoy to sell such changes in a believable fashion without a major AU. There's so much headcanon you can come up for the Black sisters without violating canon, but not that much for Snape, Malfoy, or even Ron.

************* Fine, you have a point about Batman. It's just vengeance fics make me think of over powered asshole Harry mad at the world going around killing death eaters with no mercy. The death eaters have no depth whatsoever and are only there for Harry to kill them violently. I can see him being that way in some AUs, but I much prefer ones where he is more canon like and doesn't like killing or violence. Like it or not, he does name his child after Snape despite everything and saves Draco in the room of requirement. I like that he has those qualties and attempts to see the best in people.

Bellatrix is more suited to grey depiction? She tortured the longbottoms to insanity (after Voldemort died!) and laughed about it! All before Azkaban.

The only way a grey Bellatrix can ever work is if her early backstory is that dark magic has made her insane and completely lose all empathy or something. There is no way to do it without her being extremely out of character.

Snape is already grey, you don't even need to redeem him to portray him that way. He shows signs of hating death eaters and what they do ("Only ones I couldn't save") and works for Dumbledores plans even after he kills him when he could have just stopped. He has selfish reasons to do the right thing, this is already the definition of being grey morally. He helps Harry get the sword and attempts to protect the students like Dumbledore asked. None of this is even slightly necessary so why does he do it.

Mocking children or insulting muggleborns may be bad, but it sure as hell better than torturing people to insanity or killing them. At least Malfoy had shown he didn't want to kill anyone and completely freaks out when he actually becomes a death eater. He also seems to be doing just fine in the epilogue and doesn't go around torturing anyone. An AU where he has a different childhood could completely change his character for the better.

Snape had a crappy abusive childhood and was shaped by his want for acceptance and power. Change his childhood and he also becomes easily redeemable.

Anyways, I am done with this. If you think that Bellatrix who is a complete psychopath is more redeemable than either Malfoy or Snape than there is just nothing I can say that will ever convince you.

**** First, only if you do not know the history regarding what happened at the time and what kurinoone did in the fandom. Go look up the plagarism thread regarding this.

Secondly, thats the point, its a sort of dark angsty, "what if Voldemort raised Harry" story that would draw a lot of new people who have never read any fanfiction or are even very well read (generally, not just fanfiction). The Darkness Within is not that bad, but the actions of many of its characters, and in particular Harry, are incredibly illogical within the context of the story.

There is not a believable reason why he would not just /say outright/ about his family abusing him, when he keeps hinting at it. Harry is supposed to be really talented and powerful and smart, but this is so ridiculous in character.

The author writes action in a heavy-handed unrealistic manner. When Damien comments about "Harry's warrior face" it reads like a eight year old boy writing.

She is not good at setting up situations, more often than not. The whole vampire thing? A way of making Harry protect the others so they try to be friends with him when he is still an angsty asshole. And of course vampires during the day exist that only Harry really knows how to fight, and of course Damien, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are far away from everyone else during the attack and only Harry knows about it.

This is terrible plot structure. Admittedly, kurinoone is hardly the worst writer out there, but she was and is far from the best. Its a good dark-but-not-really-dark-at-all fic to start out on, but its a 5/10 on a literary scale, maybe 6/10 if I was generous.

***** Exactly. You say Nightmares of Future's past would be an amazing first fan fic even if it is having its problems if you have read more stories, right?

I simply say an amazing "first fic" should be finished or regularily updated. Otherwise it will feel dissapointing, thus not making an amazing first fan fic.

****** Only if you have no understanding of fanfiction. In truth, the overwhelming majority of fanfics are never finished, by a wide margin. More often than not, first fics that are finished are ones that stick very close to canon and/or are mainly romance oriented.

NoFP is good because its a wide spanning time-travel fic that does not throw too much out there different (like Wastelands definitely does) from the norm for time travel fics. Its a "fix-it" fic, with Harry trying to make things better in canon, but its not trying to rock the boat and do anything super revolutionary. The story relies on making better friends and family. It bashes Snape and Malfoy, but is not too terrible about Dumbledore (just cautious). If you go straight into Dumbledore hatred, that has in point of fact turned some people out of the fandom.

NoFP is a good first fic because it does what a lot of people want initially when they read in canon, which is to see how things would be diffferent, without changing a huge amount. It doesn't push any buttons or poke any dark corners, but its different enough to keep you interested.

amazing first, terrible fic: linkffn(Oh God Not Again).

Guaranteed, i havent reread "oh god not again" since my first read back when i was new to fanfic. I just remember laughing at jokes - like harry pointing out that they don't have to fight the troll till halloween right before the sorting - and thinking that the jokes were so clever. Or like when they send everyone to their dorms on halloween book one, they are sending slytheryns to the dungeons where the troll is. Back then, I found jokes about the flaws and plot holes in canon funny. Now, I find jokes about the flaws and cliche tropes of fanon funny, and the canon one's tiring.

** I think HPMoR is a great first fanfic. It was my first and really opened my eyes to analyzing magic and considering interesting 'what if" questions.

It doesn't hold up to greater thought and analysis and I think loses it's appeal after you've read a few indy Harry stories.

There are also lots of trope-turnarounds like Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches and Prince of Slytherin whose clever bits would be lost on those who haven't seen all the tropes that are being subverted/ made interesting.

I also think the ridiculous and unpredictable nature of the Parselmouth of Gryffindor, Like a Red Headed Step Child, and others can only really be appreciated by those who are properly sick and tired of canon rehashes.

  A post HBP book seven substitute started well before DH. It is a HHr book. Ron and Ginny stay likable. I try to stay with the canon as much as possible and will eventually explain all actions and abilities. Please read the intro for more details.

**** Great as a first though, is quite didactic towards the various tropes that fanon has, shows up who Daphne is, explore the potential of parselmagic, and a whole other trope-y shananegans. Like I said, horrible fic, amazing first. Just don't read if you have read more than 20 fanfics. It will destroy your soul.

** Anything on the front page of FFN is something that can draw readers in. The stories aren't terrible, but you can find much better quality stories the deeper in you go. For example, Cauterize and Rogue's Bet are solid ones if you're a veteran of HP FF.

** I'm new to it, and have read precisely 3 fan-fics so far.

I think Alexandra Quick is a terrible first fanfic for someone looking for "HP fanfics"(there's no Harry Potter in it, quite literally the *only* connection with Rowling's plot is Voldemort's name, mentioned in passing like twice in four books), and yet perhaps better than Harry Potter the canon, let alone the fan literature out there.

Yes, high praise. I dare anyone tell me about a better fan fic - preferably one taking the length of multiple novels.

But I have huge misgivings with the canon. I was a big fan as a kid, now I think TOOTP is the only relatively good book of the whole series and the rest is either building up to it, or spectacularly failing to live up to it after the fact.

The Albus Potter series by Noah **** is making me gag at times, particularly when it over-references the canon in "cute" little remarks and observations. But this would probably suffice for some types. I'm fairly suspicious I would've liked it once, or perhaps even just before recently when I was unfortunately spoiled by Inverarity's prose and plot.

In any case, I don't think fanfic at it's best is about copy-cating out of your mind. Unless you're doing it perfectly, you will fail, and that failure will look that much more horrible because of your goal. Never try to copy the author's style, instead be as liberal minded with your divergent creativity as possible. Stray as far from the road as you can.

The greatness of Rowling lies in the magic, wizards, spells, magical creatures and instruments that are all unique to her universe. There's a whole lot to write about those. And yet I feel like 99% of fan literature focuses on the characters. What a complete waste. You're handed the most wonderful pen to write with, and all you do with it is try to copy the calligraphy and writings of the original owner. What for? It's already been written. Do something else with that ink.
