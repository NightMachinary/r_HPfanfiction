***** I'd like to respond to bits of that. Won't bother defending half of it or the point of it all lol but some parts stick out to me.

Edit: This ended up longer than I realized. I don't really care for any argument, because I don't disagree that Dumbledore did some fucked up things. Just pointing out some errors.

#+begin_quote
  Not obliviating Snape into a vegetable or killing him outright when he's discovered spying on the prophecy.
#+end_quote

Snape could have left too fast. The prophecy probably rocked Dumbledore's world a bit in the moment. And tbf if Dumbledore /had/ done that, the war wouldn't have ended. Voldemort might have won.

#+begin_quote
  Taking custody of Harry after his parents' death and then abandoning him in a known abusive and neglectful household, and not checking on him and correcting the issue.
#+end_quote

This was explained in the books. Dumbledore believed it was the safest place for Harry to be and that any other place would eventually be found by Voldemort. And he might've stayed away and not pushed in case Petunia just kicked Harry out.

#+begin_quote
  Testifying against Sirius (that he was the Potters' secret keeper) without even talking to him about his betrayal, even though he was an Order member and betrayal was out of character. Not calling for a trial, not visiting Sirius in Azkaban to question him.
#+end_quote

He didn't testify against Sirius. There was no trial. Sirius was found laughing and didn't bother defending himself. I agree Dumbledore should have at least visited Sirius to ask why he had turned to Voldemort, but I'd hardly blame him for believing Sirius had turned.

#+begin_quote
  Using Hogwarts as his personal fiefdom and testing ground rather than to benefit the students by hiring Snape, Lockhart, Lupin, Hagrid and Trelawney in teaching positions, and not firing Binns and Filch.
#+end_quote

Snape was important to the war effort. Lockhart was the only teacher who applied. Lupin /was/ good. Not sure why you're including him. Hagrid was fairly decent. And Trelawney was technically a seer.

#+begin_quote
  Allowing rampant bullying in Hogwarts in the second, fourth and fifth books. Allowing teachers like Snape and Umbridge to bully and torture students.
#+end_quote

What was he supposed to do with the bullying? Kids bully each other. Dumbledore can't be there to protect every single student in the entire castle at all times. It's not as if it was considered okay by the teachers. But it's a big castle and there are a lot of students and a few teachers. Agreed about Snape tho. But Umbridge was out of his hands.

#+begin_quote
  Possibly using Harry as bait in the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet to test his hypothesis about the blood protection.
#+end_quote

While I get that, if it finished Voldemort for good, it'd probably be worth it. I know you hate utilitarianism, but better risking Harry's life than the whole world's. You can disagree of course, I just don't think this adds to a point of Dumbledore being evil.

#+begin_quote
  Not accompanying Fawkes to the Chamber of Secrets, and leaving the basilisk to Harry. (Don't tell me Fawkes believed the Sorting Hat was a better option than Dumbledore himself).
#+end_quote

I always figured Fawkes helped Harry of his own accord and not with the permission of Dumbledore. Maybe he didn't want to risk Dumbledore's life.

#+begin_quote
  Giving a Time Turner to a student for attending /extra/ classes. Not accompanying Harry & Hermione when they went back in time to save Sirius.
#+end_quote

Attending extra classes is exactly the thing a Time Turner would be used for tho, given how dangerous they are if used for more important things. Not sure why Dumbledore didn't accompany Harry and Hermione tho.

#+begin_quote
  Allowing an underage Harry to be shanghaied into the Triwizard tournament, which Dumbledore was responsible for preventing. Not helping him in any manner throughout the year.
#+end_quote

It was a magical contract. And he was forbidden from helping Harry, wasn't he? Professors weren't meant to help.

#+begin_quote
  Not telling Harry the truth about Voldemort and the prophecy even after Voldemort's resurrection.
#+end_quote

Which was probably a good idea since Voldemort and Harry could see into each other's minds.

#+begin_quote
  Scheming and planning his suicide with Snape like some glorified cult leader. Trusting Snape above all other Order members. (Honestly, who trusts a spy /this/ much?)

Maybe Snape got away and killing him next time he saw him wouldn't save the world, but that's a big "what if" that ignores the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape unconditionally based entirely on Snape's need for revenge. That's insane at best.

The blood wards may or may not have been the safest thing to begin with. That's still a horribly abusive home, and Voldemort still uses Harry's blood (and demonstrates that Lily's protection no longer works!) in book 4. Dumbledore is either oblivious to these facts somehow, or decided that a potentially broken martyr is all he needs.

The Sirius mess is a mess all around, from all points. But even if Dumbledore did believe Sirius had honestly turned, pushing for a trial and/or questioning him in Azkaban is STILL the obvious response. If Sirius was working for Voldemort, who knows what information he might have had? That's a huge oversight no matter what Dumbledore believed of his innocence.

#+begin_quote
  Snape was important to the war effort. Lockhart was the only teacher who applied. Lupin /was/ good. Not sure why you're including him. Hagrid was fairly decent. And Trelawney was technically a seer.
#+end_quote

Snape actively abused students, find a different place for him if he's so important to the war effort instead of actively crippling your society's ability to gain healers and aurors (both careers that require NEWT level potions). Lockhart being the only applicant is both suspicious and a strong indicator of deeper problems, but other than that, your point here stands. Lupin, while a good teacher and a good man, is still a werewolf. That's a huge potential risk to take around kids, one that nearly cost Snape his life as a student. Trelawny may have been a true seer, but she was also a complete hack. Her seer status is demonstrably irrelevant to her functional knowledge and capacity to teach.

#+begin_quote

What was he supposed to do about bullying? REALLY? Maybe some indication of attempts at quelling public shaming via the "Potter Stinks" badges people were proudly wearing about the school? There's no reason to expect bullying to miraculously not exist, but it should merit a reaction at least.

Fawkes opting to help Harry of his own volition still doesn't actually counter the "don't tell me Fawkes believed the hat would be more helpful than Dumbledore" bit. And I find it hard to believe that Dumbledore would be overly threatened by a basilisk if he was aware of it. Considering a 2nd year student (however clever she may be) figured it out, Dumbledore should also have been able to figure it out.

Dumbledore does help Harry through the tournament via ''Moody'' if we're being honest. No way he just sat around waiting to see if a 4th year that he needed to save the world, no matter how you define his motives. The fact that it took him so long to figure out Crouch wasn't the real Moody is the only questionable thing there. Although, I'm also kinda sketchy on the magically binding contract that can be activated by slipping a torn off assignment or a forgery into a cup...

#+begin_quote
  I mean, it worked really well?
#+end_quote

As for the suicide via Snape working. Hindsight is not a good means of justifying bad decisions. Although, to be fair, Dumbledore was already dying by that point. So while I don't agree with your defense of the action (or trusting Snape, but that's a separate point) I do agree that this is probably not a sign of incompetence or evil on Dumbledore's part.

#+begin_quote
  Yes?
#+end_quote

Immediate counterpoint: If Harry needs a killing curse to the head to get rid of the horcrux why just hope that Voldemort will do it (and not... I dunno... expect him to be a paranoid evil bastard?). If Dumbledore is so sure of what needs to happen, why not have Snape use the curse on Harry in an otherwise secure location instead of leaving it to chance and faith that Voldemort will try to use the curse that failed once before again? Ultimately, I'm not arguing Dumbledore's goal here, rather his methods of achieving that goal.

​

A few other things to be pointed out. All these points are debated from the perspective of a modern person who's not part of the story. Dumbledore is over 100 years old as of the books (that places him as being born before 1900!). Child abuse was both less understood and less clearly defined even 50 years ago, and that's before you take into account that the wizarding world is apparently even further behind in a lot of ways. It's really difficult to look at these issues from a modern perspective and expect it to make any sort of rational sense.

Even if their perspective is old, I'd still expect the actions to make somewhat rational sense to us if not moral sense. But they're neither rational nor moral. And Dumbledore has been exposed to children for decades in a school. If he's so out of touch, he shouldn't be there.

Even in a narrative sense, JKR should've focused on Harry and Dumbledore drawing apart because of all this but she instead had disaster strike when Harry didn't follow Dumbledore's insane breadcrumb trail leading to Hermione's torture and Dobby's death and then a traumatized Harry blindly following the dead man to his own suicide. Not to mention the atrocity that is /Albus Severus/ Potter.

I think you're giving Dumbledore too much credit here. He didn't know the monster was a basilisk, so it could have gotten the jump on him. Hermione only figured it out because she knew Harry, a Parselmouth, was hearing a murderous voice in empty hallways correlated with the timing of the attacks. Harry didn't share that critical information about the voice with Dumbledore, so he was unlikely to figure it out. Given how easy it is for the basilisk to kill, even a wizard like Dumbledore might accidentally catch the killer gaze before realizing what is going on.

We don't know how much Fawkes knew going in either. Perhaps the Sorting Hat, alone in Dumbledore's office with Fawkes, was the one to suggest the plan. The Hat contained the Sword, so maybe it was also enchanted to detect when a student/Gryffindor /needed/ the sword. Fawkes and the Hat may well have gone to Harry's aid without knowing the exact nature of the threat; once they were in the Chamber, there wasn't any time to waste fetching Dumbledore. Fawkes had to stay to blind the basilisk, and then stick around to heal Harry after the fight.

******** Possible, but Dumbledore also knew that the monster had been released before by Tom Riddle. Dumbledore was one of the teachers then and certainly knows that Tom is a Parselmouth and that Slytherin was a Parselmouth. There's also the leading clues of a dead victim from fifty years ago, the chickens being killed, a petrified ghost, and even whatever clues he accumulated back when Hagrid was framed the first time.

He's missing one, maybe two clues that Hermione has. He's potentially got several clues to compensate. I still find it unreasonable that he doesn't have a solid guess at the basilisk.

Myrtle was the only student actually killed by the basilisk; the odds that all the other victims would catch an indirect view of the monster are quite slim. A more plausible explanation of the known events would be there was a monster that could Petrify people - a Gorgon, perhaps - and that Myrtle was murdered by Riddle using AK.

It's definitely obvious in hindsight, particularly with Riddle/Slytherin being Parseltongues. But if Dumbledore didn't know basilisks can Petrify people, it's easy to see how he could dismiss them as a possibility.

Dumbledore, Voldemort, Hermione, all are implied to be literally morons if your interpretation is true. So therefore, it makes far more sense that there's another interpretation.

That's my whole problem with these things. People complain about these things as if there's not another explanation. Their own explanations imply that practically every wizard in Voldemort's side and Dumbledore's side has the intelligence of a frog.

********** Well, I'm on my phone at this point, so quotes aren't happening. The prophecy only being important because Voldemort thinks it is would be a fair point, except that Dumbledore's plans all revolve around it. Dumbledore telling Harry that could just as easily be the truth as it could be a lie to help Harry fulfill his part.

The wards are charged by Harry considering the place home? The place where he was abused and locked in a cupboard under the stairs?

Harry may have considered the place his only option, but that was never a home. It was a prison at best. If you'd said they're charged by Harry living there, you'd have a much stronger point. It's clear by the end of the first book that Harry considers Hogwarts home far more than his relatives' house.

And you're inferring a great deal about the nature of the magic and that spell in particular. The exact details of the wards on the Dursley house are never laid out that well.

Voldemort knew where Privet Drive was, certainly. Which is the problem. Why didn't he make any attempts? The dementors got to Harry easily enough. Are we just going to assume that the wards block anyone tied to Voldemort from entering all of Surrey? That the wards will know that some muggle mugger or assassin was sent by him and just.... make them not a threat somehow?

The correct interpretation is that JKR didn't think of any of these things. Which yes, causes characters we're constantly told are geniuses to effectively be morons as soon as you think about events in the series critically.

But honestly, what's wrong with how they were hidden?

Hell, one was even in Bellatrix's safe deposit box which is incredibly close to an evil overlord list item. And breaking into gringott's was unprecedented till quirrelmort did it, Harry wouldn't have been able to without goblinfacehead's help, and Voldemort had no way of predicting Harry or anyone else would find Gryffindor's sword nor that goblinfacehead would want it. (Especially considering Rowling's classification that the exposition given on goblin culture is a big fat lie.)

One was given to Lucius Malfoy, which would have been similarly difficult to retrieve if Malfoy hadn't put the thing in Ginny's cauldron instead of protecting it like he was told to. So Voldemort's primary mistake here was trusting Malfoy to be sufficiently afraid of him.

And that's the thing, these are shards of his soul. He's not just gonna drop them in random places and forget about them, he wants them being actively protected, lest some random shmoe eventually happen upon one and just happen to have a vial of basilisk venom handy. Unlikely? Yes, but he was planning to be around forever.

He also believed that he would feel it when they were destroyed because he didn't realize how dissociated his soul had become until almost all of them were gone, that isn't really something he could've predicted either since no one had ever made seven horcruxes before. So he probably thought that if someone did manage to destroy one he could immediately apparate to it, crucio/imperio them into telling him how they found out where it was, and then Avada Kedavra them, probably using their murder to remake the horcrux.

I do think that basically the first thing he should have done upon resurrection was taking stock of how many were destroyed, and remaking any destroyed ones. Doing something to correct Malfoy's insubordination beyond just crucioing the shit out of him...

Probably should've just AK'd Harry while he was chained up instead of challenging him to a duel, too, but that would've led to some wand bullcrap, I'm sure.

I didn't say 'throw them in a ditch.' I said he shouldn't have hidden them in places directly associated to himself (his mother's family home, near his orphanage, or the school he attended).

Then you say he wants them actively protected, but turn around and follow that with explaining how he plans to react to one being destroyed. What? If he wants them protected he should places wards and alarms to tell him when someone enters the place he hid them. That way he has a chance to get there and stop them before his horcrux is destroyed at all. So his belief in being able to feel their destruction is irrelevant and relying on that (even if he'd been correct) is just failing at basic security.

And that's before we're forced to acknowledge he hid one somewhere he knows he can't apparate to at all.

It makes me think you're confusing Canon with fanon. You see all the time in fanficland where Hogwarts telepathically alerts Dumbledore whenever someone gets hurt. There's no Canon indication that this happens or is even remotely possible, and I'd say the same is true even for a d&d style first level alarm spell.

I will, of course, concede this point if you can suggest a Canon ward spell that would have protected Voldemort's horcruxes better than they already were. Aside from the fidelius, I'm pretty sure you have to feel trust to cast it, which it's stated Voldemort doesn't.

I feel like it's hinted that you have to actually be able to trust someone other than yourself to cast the Fidelius, much like you have to want to torture someone just for the sake of making them suffer, or you need a happy memory to cast the Patronus. Voldemort doesn't really trust people. He trusts their fear of him, but that's not the same as actually trusting them.

But if Voldemort could cast the Fidelius and chose not to, then yeah, that would make him monumentally stupid, and I do find it problematic that he's not shown to have at least made the attempt, or researched the spell and dismissed it due to what it's based on. Or maybe a few extra lines slipped in Harry and Dumbledores conversations in book 6.

  Maybe Snape got away and killing him next time he saw him wouldn't save the world, but that's a big "what if" that ignores the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape unconditionally based entirely on Snape's need for revenge. That's insane at best.
#+end_quote

It's Snape's guilt that Dumbledore relies on, not his need for revenge. Snape is also a master Occlumens, master potioner, and very discrete, so the perfect spy.

#+begin_quote
  The blood wards may or may not have been the safest thing to begin with. That's still a horribly abusive home, and Voldemort still uses Harry's blood (and demonstrates that Lily's protection no longer works!) in book 4. Dumbledore is either oblivious to these facts somehow, or decided that a potentially broken martyr is all he needs.
#+end_quote

What's important is that Dumbledore believes it, not whether it was objectively the safest option. Dumbledore needed Harry in the Muggle world, because no one would expect to find him there, and a he needed a blood relative to maintain the wards. These were the only concerns Dumbledore had. If Harry was raised in a magical household, the rampant gossiping would have outed him, even with someone like Andromeda Tonks/Black, and someone not closely related to Harry would have meant he wouldn't be protected as well from any "former" Death Eaters still at large.

#+begin_quote
  Trelawny may have been a true seer, but she was also a complete hack. Her seer status is demonstrably irrelevant to her functional knowledge and capacity to teach.

Divination is a pretty hacky art form to begin with, and she teaches a non-core subject, so I don't see any issue with having a Seer in your employ for the off-chance that a real prophecy comes forth if a few volunteer students don't quite get the best use out of the subject.

#+begin_quote
  Risking a child's life to save the world may be a statistically favorable choice, but the lesser of two evils is still evil by definition.
#+end_quote

It's just Dumbledore's character. Like it or not, he goes for the elaborate. He engineers the situation in a way that appears like the board is a chess-set, but it's really a game that only Dumbledore fully understands the rules. Dumbledore has a lot of tools to ensure Harry's safety, it's just that we don't really see them always come into play except in the most dire of circumstances (Chamber of Secrets, for example).

#+begin_quote
  Not gonna argue the time turners, time travel is just a mess no matter what and attending extra classes is about as close to a safe use as I can come up with too.
#+end_quote

Agreed, but if we consider that Time Turners eliminate the possibility of non-closed time-loops, giving them to students isn't a huge risk, and Dumbledore may have his own time-turner, preventing him from actually going back in time to help (or he may have done so off-screen, distracting people at various points to allow Harry + Hermione to do their thing).

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore does help Harry through the tournament via ''Moody'' if we're being honest. No way he just sat around waiting to see if a 4th year that he needed to save the world, no matter how you define his motives. The fact that it took him so long to figure out Crouch wasn't the real Moody is the only questionable thing there. Although, I'm also kinda sketchy on the magically binding contract that can be activated by slipping a torn off assignment or a forgery into a cup...
#+end_quote

True enough. Dumbledore trusted Moody, also, and Moody's reputation for being so incredibly paranoid plays into Crouch's favor. I think it's a rule of magic that Harry is involved in the most dramatic thing happening at Hogwarts at any given time.

#+begin_quote
  Immediate counterpoint: If Harry needs a killing curse to the head to get rid of the horcrux why just hope that Voldemort will do it (and not... I dunno... expect him to be a paranoid evil bastard?). If Dumbledore is so sure of what needs to happen, why not have Snape use the curse on Harry in an otherwise secure location instead of leaving it to chance and faith that Voldemort will try to use the curse that failed once before again? Ultimately, I'm not arguing Dumbledore's goal here, rather his methods of achieving that goal.
#+end_quote

I think because 1) Dumbledore may have been searching for alternatives that we just don't see "on screen" while trying to maintain the secret from Harry (and therefore Voldemort), and 2) it eliminates a powerful element of surprise in a tricky situation where, if everything goes completely tits-up (which it does), there's still one last gambit that can work. Dumbledore knows how fond Voldemort is of the Killing Curse, and it's not an unreasonable guess that if anyone is to try it against Harry, it's going to be the Dark Lord. His followers are mostly forbidden from killing Harry, merely to capture him, and because Dumbledore himself has secured Harry as Voldemort's greatest enemy (through all the manipulating and foiling from books 1-6, and via careful control of information like the Prophecy), Voldemort is almost assuredly to be obsessed with proving he has the ability to kill Harry via his favorite spell.

It's worth noting that Harry notices Dumbledore's brief expression of "Triumph" when he's recalling the events at the graveyard. The series of events completely seals the deal for Dumbledore that Harry must fulfill the prophecy and "die" at Voldemort's hand in order to be successful.

#+begin_quote
  It's really difficult to look at these issues from a modern perspective and expect it to make any sort of rational sense.
#+end_quote

True. Dumbledore is a product of his time and completely insane, but I don't think he's really EVIL. He's just so powerful and the game is so easy to rig that it's almost always the clear path. He doesn't do the "easy" thing, he plays 4D chess with all the players and events such that things eventually work out, but it's completely nonsensical if you're a rational being.

Really? So he was the only one bound by the rules then? Is he just honorably stuck up and rule abiding or just plain stupid?

#+begin_quote

You should really read about the dichotomy of control. Outcomes are never in anyone's control, only actions are. So when judging morality, always look to a person's actions themselves not the resultant outcome. And anyone who blindly follows another has left morality behind.

So presumably Voldemort made his body indestructible? /That's/ your argument? That is hilariously stupid but not altogether unexpected.

My argument is that Dumbledore unilaterally made the decision to sacrifice a child. He should've asked for help long before manipulating someone into committing suicide. Harry was given no *practical* option except walking to his death in the end. He's the sort of person who would do that anyway if /no other way/ could be found. That would be his own informed choice. Dumbledore may be clever but he's not omnsicient, he's just another man playing God with the lives of others.

So why on earth would he risk letting three /teenagers/ handle this /alone/, who would be much less skilled than most adults. Narratively, we know it's because those three are our protagonists but even that is very weak. But I haven't seen a good enough in-universe explanation.

You know, I'd like to see a story where Dumbledore grudgingly shares information with Harry and Harry brings in Ron and Hermione because he needs the support of his friends and Dumbledore or Harry selects maybe three other Order members to mentor them and take the lead in the hunt. A story where the trio finally has the full support of the adults and realize that it makes a great deal of difference.

************ Ah, okay. My apologies for the misinterpretation.

Personally, I prefer the guilt-ridden guy in way over his head interpretation of canon. He's just a teacher (and an 'idiot Gryff') who defeated his old crush/friend in a fight once and got massive political power out of it. He still feels guilt from his family history and Grindelwald getting out of hand with a dash of 'all these students look too damn young' responsibility-feelings, so he tries, but he's just a magically powerful and well-studied transfiguration teacher, not Machiavelli or the 'second coming of Merlin' that his Legend has been built up to display him as. Kind of like a nicer version of Ciaphas Cain from Warhammer 40K, if you know that reference. I really like the idea that he's picked up hiding his emotions and being enigmatic from being in politics for so long, but inside he's basically winging it and hoping nobody notices because he sees the things he's doing as too important to trust to anyone but the people who he knows definitely aren't with Voldemort (Himself, Snape, and possibly Hagrid and McG).

It might not fit every aspect of canon but, considering Rowling just mutates and bends whatever she needs to fit her plot, consistency of implementation isn't exactly a staple of Harry Potter. :)

******** Your willingness to sacrifice children rather than get off your butt and /fight/ a war, like Dumbledore did in HP, aside... I'm pretty sure it's canon that Dumbledore was a leading figure in the government after he imprisoned Grindlewald((sp?) though this is apparently not common knowledge based on the disbelief too Rita's book) . Yet from what little i understand, it wasn't even treated like a war until it was already too late. Even his Order didn't seem to be able to fight back. While the ordering people not to kill thing is probably fanon, Dumbles belief in redemeeming his enemies is,most likely, canon. Thus he wasn't likely to fight fire with fire so to speak. This is what made sacrificing a child's life /necessary./ Tom was around along time before the prophecy was made after all.

​

On another point, there was another solution to Harry's childhood if Dumbledore actually wanted him to have a somewhat decent life, rather than grow up... safe... from, wizards(I'm pretty sure the wards around #4 Privet Drive didn't exist at say his school, so its not like they worked all time) but still emotionally abused at the very least. Now while the following idea is somewhat morally ambiguous, if your willing to sacrifice a child on the off chance that he can beat someone with what... 40, maybe 50 years on him in knowledge and power growth, then it should be an acceptable sacrifice as well...

​

Since the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, a drought of living death down Petunias throat and a room with a Fidelius wherever he put Harry and there you go. Find decent caretakers put Petunia's comatose body in the fidelius room. Make sure she stays alive(if the potion doesn't do that already) and bobs your uncle, Harry gets a decent childhood and blood wards.

But that would have taken effort. Better to dump him on his magic hating Aunts doorstep in the middle of the night with a letter(which most likely contained some form of threats to get her to actually keep him) and forget about it for 10 years.

As for the wards, i have one question. McG sat there all day November 1st. Dumbles didn't get there until that night. He took Harry from a just arrived Hagrid put him on the doorstep and left... when did he put up the wards?

That is just a guess on your part. She obviously doesn't want him, and when she and Vernon where going to kick Harry out in OotP they get that "remember my last" message which changes her mind. Based on what personality we see of her the best bet is she was either threatened, or coerced(likely through vague threats against her family and promises that going along would allow "protection").

/IF/ you are right about needing her consent, then those same means could get her to agree to take him while she is at the location of the wards, activating them, and then you dose her and stuff her in the room. But based on GoF magic doesn't need consent to do these things.

Anyways based on GoF magical consent is different, and/or changeable by Magic. Harry was entered into a "magical contract" against his will while underage by someone confounding an artifact and putting his name in(i don't think the "ripped off a homework assignment" thing is canon.

Maybe hindsight is 20/20, but he should have rightly seen Harry's entering into the TWT coming a mile away and taken steps - such as an enchantment on the cup or the room that erases the name "Harry Potter" from any slip of parchment that crosses the Age Line, or having someone stand guard at the goblet (which he most likely did, actually - he just chose Moody), or collecting the parchments in a faux-goblet, then examining them and only bringing out the real goblet once it's made sure that no underage student is present in the faux-goblet.

******* I agree, but tbf he might've done all those things. But Crouch Jr was a very powerful wizard and might've gotten past them. Also, even if Harry did get entered, Dumbledore probably figured the cup would obviously pick a more talented wizard.

And honestly the whole plot was ludicrous. I mean, if it worked out perfectly, it would've been great for Voldemort. But there's no way Dumbledore would have expected such a ridiculous scheme or reason for Harry to be entered.

But I get what you're saying. It is odd that no one wondered about these things happening to Harry on Halloween year after year.

  I still don't understand why people are so against non-canon dumbledore. He's either incompetent, senile, or the most dangerous Dark Lord the world has ever seen.
#+end_quote

Didn't you just answer your own question? Because it would be non-canon Dumbledore?

We /do/ see cleverness from Dumbledore in canon. With the Mirror of Erised, with suggesting the Time-Turner, with finding out the Horcruxes, with his whole plan with the prophecy in book 5, his placement of Snape at Hogwarts during Voldemort's rule, using Harry's death to save everyone else from Voldemort, etc.

So he's not /completely/ incompetent, and obviously not senile. And I think we can rule out evil too. He fucked up. I think the only useful info he didn't give Harry was about destroying Horcruxes, and he had books on that anyway that were easily accessed by Hermione. It's not like Harry wouldn't have found a way to destroy them in the end anyway.

Or Rowling fucked up. Last 2 books honestly had a lot of problems.

Yes, that's called good world building and is one of the marks of a good fantasy story. You shouldn't introduce new elements if doing so retroactively introduces plot holes into your story. It is evident that JKR had a decent idea of the entire plot right at the start but she made very little effort in regards to the world building.

****** The Doylist approach is just boring to me. I'll throw it out there because I know someone on this sub inevitably will, so I just save myself a reply.

What bothers me is that so many of the criticisms I see on this sub feel poorly thought out. Or outright wrong. Can't tell you how many times I've seen users complain about plot holes that are really just unexplained things that could be filled with two seconds of thought.

Like I saw a comment a week ago on here that implied Dumbledore was evil or literally retarded because he didn't use the fidelius charm with the unbreakable vow to protect Harry. Actually, it would imply practically /all/ wizards were complete morons if not a single one thought to bring the idea up.

So instead of reasoning that all wizards are insanely stupid - even Hermione - we can take an extra 2 seconds of thought and reason that a spell based on trust (fidelius) and a spell that /forces/ trust (unbreakable vow) /prooobably/ won't work together.

But nope, Dumbledore's just evil.

And for that example, we know that JKR did think of apparition since dumbledore pops up out of nowhere in the first book. And also that Dumbledore was never said to fly /by broom/ to the Ministry. Just simply /flew./ This was in a thread a week or so ago and I saw that a broom isn't actually specifically mentioned.

The Fidelius Charm had literally just failed James and Lily tho. Like literally that very night. And I'm pretty sure you can't use yourself as a secret keeper for a property you own.

So he'd have to do it with someone else's property or make someone else the secret keeper. And if Sirius Black had been a Death Eater, Dumbledore wouldn't trust anyone else.

And even if we ignore all that, he'd still need someone to raise Harry. Who would that be? He and McGonagall would be too busy. Snape would rather slit his wrists. Hagrid would accidentally feed Harry to a monster. Anyone else he probably doesn't trust, because, again, if Sirius Black, the best friend of Harry's dad, was a Death Eater, then who else?

And there may be other ways to get past a fidelius too. Dumbledore himself says that Voldemort would get past anything but the blood wards.

Same with the other suggestions.

I mean, the real answer is probably just that JKR didn't bother thinking shit through.

From what I remember from the books, the durability of an Horcrux doesn't come from its nature, it's the wizard who has first to create an adequate receptacle for his soul before creating it (without any protection, a simple fire could have destroyed the diary, and with enough ressources, it may have been protected against other danger like the basilisk venom). So, in this particular case, since we can assume Tom Riddle enchanted his diary before splitting his soul, the Horcrux is probably very knowledgable about what can destroy it, and what can't.

- And finally, have you /any idea/ how many snake based monsters exist in mythology? My own country has enough to fill a book! Let alone all of Europe, Africa, Asia combined....if Slytherin hadn't created a brand new one like the genius Archsorceror he was, that is. (Which he practically did, since the Serpent of Slytherin is nothing like a "normal" Basilisk, being practically immortal and tame).

The only way anyone could guess (In Universe) is if Harry either told them [didn't happen for DD] or they were Seers [ WTH, Trelawney?!]

Any questions?

** I seriously wonder if magic makes people stupid. I mean it's simple trying for immortality backfires every single time. Plus, it's easier to become a dictator if you use honey. Look at Dumbledore, he's a benevolent dictator. He doesn't become minister, but has influenced several generations of witches and wizards. He also is chief Warlock; basically head of the legislative branch. Finally, he heads the magical equivalent of the U.N. All three give him a ton of political clout and generally influence things; it's extremely ironic. He's almost never questioned and pretty revered among the masses even when slandered. You can say I've been reading to much fanfic but I'm only referencing the books. (I do not advocate dictatorship/tyranny/totalitarian ideals I'm just comparing.)
