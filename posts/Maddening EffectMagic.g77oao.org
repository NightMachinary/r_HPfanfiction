By being surrounded in it for long periods of time, wizards and witches succumb to the maddening (almost Eldritch) effect magic has on those who use it. It exists as a force to alter the way of the world; the ability to create miracles or dole out misfortune, such a sinister side effect should not be unexpected.

This effects everyone and everything that is involved with it, though individuals can resist or be effected differently. It can be so little as a lack of tact or decorum, to as much as a complete dissociation with reality. Not at all helped by the fact that use of magic further compounds the condition, as well as simply possessing magic (should one be born powerful that it effects them).

It deprives users of "common sense" in exchange for intrinsic knowledge of the force itself. A slowly developing sixth sense, if you will: allowing a user to better understand magic at a basic level, their own and others.

The ONLY work around is Occulmency, as the side- effect/prerequisite of the art is the clearing and organisation of the mind. By using magic to counteract the effects of magic, users are able to think more clearly and operate with more "common sense".

Individuals like Dumbledore REQUIRE Occulmency in order to think and operate in a day-to-day fashion. People like Voldemort, who lack in that area, succumb to their magics maddening influence and descend into madness and psychopathy.


** So the Dursleys hatred would become less and less rational living with a powerhouse like Harry, but the Granger's would become less and less rational in their acceptance, "Oh, you and your school friends killed the defense teacher? Well you certainly learned your stuff, didn't you. We're so proud of you!"

*** Definitely the second one, though I do wonder about the first.

I've always liked the theory that the Dursleys mistreatment of Harry was at least partially influenced by them living with a Horcrux for over a decade. Maybe by "less rational" they start blaming even more minute things on him? Or they jump to even weirder conclusions? I'm not sure how to frame it as less rational tbh

*** If his magic is strong enough to affect the Dursley's (little contact with him, and not magical) them what would be the effects in Harry? and what about the soul-fragment? I mean, it must have some magic for the diary to be able to do so much and it is shown as being capable of affecting directly Harry's mind, s√≥ at least some kind of link. Wouldn't it make Harry go to Hogwarts without an once of sanity (no oclumency training plus both the Horcrux and his mother's protection's magic plus his own magic power), but a veritable genius in magic.

**** I agree, he'd probably end up almost feral at Hogwarts, needing Occulmency training immediately, but not really being able to learn it as he's nearly too far gone.

Could be the framework for an eventual Badass!Harry if he has to spend a few years regaining control of his mind, as he'll eventually have the same degree of natural skill with magic that Tom had, but far more control over his mind.

**** Hm, good point. Maybe wizards have a natural resistance that muggles lack? Plus, it would be a stretch to call Harry /completely/ sane. Or maybe his mother's protection blocks the influence of the horcrux for him and those who honestly want to protect him.

***** The resistance part not working on muggles would mean that lots more of the muggleborn's parents would go insane, even more than we see in cannon. Yeah, he is not totally sane, but he is also not much different than an average eleven-years-old mentality-wise. The protection argument could work if we are willing to consider occlumens as a way of diminishing Magic's influence in the mind tough, would even work with the Horcrux incapacity of possessing him by itself like the diary tried with Ginny.

** How about all magic has this quality to a minor degree, and that explains why wizards are often so dotty and lacking in common sense?

*** That's what I'm going for. It has the effect even if you aren't using it, but are around it (e.g. in places like Diagon Alley). And then using it exposes you to the effect, and if you are super powerful like Harry, Dumbledore or Tom it's a constant, passive effect they have to deal with.

**** Ahh I get you, I had misread the post. I thought you were talking about specific kinds of powerful magic. Honestly a really interesting idea, would definitely read a fic that used it.
