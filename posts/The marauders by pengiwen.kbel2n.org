I've seen a lot of recommendations on here and on other platforms for the marauders fanfic “all the young dudes” and I just thought I'd put my two pence in and get another well deserved story some love!!

The marauders series is written on Wattpad by pengiwen and is the most incredible thing I have read since- well since Harry Potter It is a series of books , one for each year (and the later years are split into two parts) and now the order of the pheonix series is being released which follows the marauders after hogwarts

I consider it 100% canon and it is so incredible The books are told from multiple perspectives, like the marauders, lily, snape, and regulus

I adore this series completely and I urge anyone who has read all the young dudes, and anyone else who is interested in an extremely canon , full length fan fic to read it. Also there is wolfstar!!
