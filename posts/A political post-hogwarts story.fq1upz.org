I'd like some post-Hogwarts focused on rebuilding the magical britain. It would be perfect if it later on focused on getting a family and building the house up. Harry doesn't have to be the MC but I think most stories like this will have him as the MC for obvious reasons.

There are many like this but few done well and fewer which wasn't dropped early on. I like a long story :)

Preferably not Hinny as I can't see Ginny ever getting serious..

** linkffn(12373273) ... it is Harmony, but it really doesn't matter that much, because Harry is mostly in the background (and most of the time in America). Sequel of linkffn(11916243).

  After growing concerned about some of his political decisions, Hermione decides to confront Minister for Magic Harry Potter, fifteen years after Voldemort's defeat. All she can hope is that she's overreacting, and that her worries are unfounded. Oneshot.

** There is some Hinny in this but it's really background as the main character is Hermione and she's paired with George. Linkffn(Annals of Arithmancy). it's the third instalment of the Arithmancer series by White Squirrel, the first being Hermione's first to fourth year and the second fifth to seventh year and the premise is that Hermione is a maths genius instead of the traditional bookworm and because of her innate talent sharpened by years of practice she can start Arithmancy in first year instead of third year because its centred around mathematics. I highly recommend it.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.
