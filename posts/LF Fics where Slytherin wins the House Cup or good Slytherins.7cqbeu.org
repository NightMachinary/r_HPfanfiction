Looking for any fics that feature good Slytherins (just not Draco, Crabbe, Goyle etc) or where Slytherins wins the House Cup for the year (unlikely but bonus points if the other houses don't hate then even more for it)

Also wondering if there were focs where Slytherins help fight during the Battle of Hogwarts instead of getting kicked out and/or sent to the dungeons.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): despite a cheating Dumbledore, Harrymort managed to help them win the cup in Year 3. The final battle was a little underwhelming, but Slytherins all fought against Voldemort.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** I think the four 'Alexandra Sutton' stories will be up your alley. They were (mostly) written before DH, but because they focus on an OC Slytherin student we mostly just see the events of the canon through a different lens. They are clever and well written, although the last one is sadly incomplete... Here they are on the SQ site:

*** Erk.... I'm the author of the above.. Thanks for making my day! No, sod that, making my week!

Currently, the complete stories I've done have had a rewrite, though nothing's been reposted. I've done a further two chapters of the uncompleted story as well as about 40% of a new one, charting Alexandra/s somewhat hazardous misadventures during the nine months of Thickness and the Death Eater takeover.

Finally, I've got an outline and Chapter One of a post-war story. Alexandra is eligible to join the Aurors on account of Shackbolt's emergency post-war recruitment of anybody who fought at the Battle of Hogwarts. And is reluctantly blackmailed into joining.

I'd be looking for betas for the completed stuff if anybody wants to have a go at it.....

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.
