Is anyone else writing dark, disturbing Christmas stories? Just me? I figure the Christmas just after the end of the First Wizarding War wasn't so merry for some of the characters.

** Remus is one of my favorite characters, and I love how you portrayed him here. I also really enjoyed readiing from Beth's perspective. You really brought her to life. Thank you for sharing!

*** Thanks! I feel that creating original characters is my weakness, but I'm glad you liked her. I just sort of poured her into a plot-shaped mold and that was how she turned out. Rowling's characters are forces of nature that shape the plot around themselves.
