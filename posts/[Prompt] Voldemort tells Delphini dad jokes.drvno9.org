Based on the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/drj2wm/what_do_you_consider_the_most_forgotten_or/f6iycxu][comment here,]] Voldemort likes puns in canon.


** Delphini? Considering canon naming, i can only guess Voldemort got either a pet dolphin, or someone is a dolphin animagus? What is this mysterious fic in which you found said dolphin named delphini? Might help with your promt ;)

*** Delphini is the name of Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange's daughter in the Cursed Child, which is a play that was endorsed/written by JK Rowling that can best be described as well-written, badly plotted fanfiction.

***** It was indeed weak sarcasm as an easy setup for some cursed child bashing, but then i realised it would just be too petty of me to bash it, it does that perfectly fine on its own ;)

Sounds about right, although I've read better fanfiction. FYI, she didn't write it, but apparently was involved in the production/endorsed it.

**** Which is why the heir to the throne of France was called the Dolphin - terrifying creatures made to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy.

(The title thing is actually true, though it's for a different reason of course.)

** What do you call someone with no body and no nose? Nobody knows.
