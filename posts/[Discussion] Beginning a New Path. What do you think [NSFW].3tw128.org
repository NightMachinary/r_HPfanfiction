I have read about 5-6 chapters about a year ago. I think I was till the part where Harry was with [[/spoiler][Buffy and Hermione]].

But, I quit later due to the ridiculous sex things, like them making a cum milkshake to rejuvenate or something. Another drink to keep their holes virgin tight.

I was weirded out by that point.

Have you finished it? So, tell me what you thought of it .


** The first time I got creeped out when it got to the real world and the author and Potter proceeded to enslave a bunch of actors as sex puppets.

It does have some interesting ideas - absorbing Gods, fighting Glory, etc and poor execution - the first chapter info dump eww. The smut was the strongest part I thought.

** The author literally wrote 1 million words of insanity. I'm not sure anyone's read all the way to the end except for the author.

That said, I'm impressed by the author's ability to put out that many words. It takes me a whole day's work just to put out 10,000 words of shite.

*** I made it partway into chapter 2. At first it was like a trainwreck you can't look away from [[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/creepypasta/images/0/07/Post-25055-NOPE-not-doing-that-gif-S3vn.gif/revision/latest?cb=20131215041923][and then it was just like...]]

The author comes across as a sociopathic 14 year old boy.

**** The worst part is that his author profile lists him as an "Electro-Mechanical Engineering major with a Bachelors of Science in Physics and Math. " I'm not sure if he's lying about this (could very well be), but he could also just be a really weird college student.

He's also supposedly 24 years old.

*** I presume that the writing process speeds up considerably when you have no concern for quality. This fic is basically a word-vomit fantasy.

** I didn't even get through the first chapter before I dropped it. It Gary Stu'd so hard within the first five paragraphs I think even Gary Stu is embarrassed to read it.

Also,

  A boy named Ronald Weasley kept on following me around school and annoying me so I used his pet rat first as a sacrifice.

This was mildly amusing.

****** Heh, it's a running joke from when I ran the "state of the subreddit" survey. There were several responses demanding that I ban HPMOR, generally in all caps and with varying levels of vitriol. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3j5rcd/mods_survey_responses_etc/]]
