So, lets assume Harry sits in a bar for some drinks (or not) and there he meets a Person, male or female, and both have a discussion. Later it turns out that said person is one of the Bad ones, if not even the leader.

It doesnt have to be harry. The Pair doesnt matter, but i would like if there are no "real" pairs.


** Philosopher's Stone?

Jokes aside, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] come to mind. Also lots of Betrayed!Harry fics (it's sort of in the premise).
