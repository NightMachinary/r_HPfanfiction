** Let's assume that magic isn't hereditary and instead both muggles and wizards have the same tiny chance of having magic.

I think that the result would be a lot closer to the mutants we see in X-men than the Wizarding World, not a separate society but a somewhat secretive organization in the normal society.

*** and to fullfill this hole they try to adopt magial children that are 'unwanted' by their muggle parents (some muggle would maybe really give up their children out of fear, other got talked into that it would be better for the child, other threatened or even forced)

** Just to clarify, by "wizard" do you mean all magical humans? Or only the male magicals? Well, I suppose it's irrelevant. I just had this interesting thought of what if all of the pureblood men were killed or something and for the first time in centuries, the old pureblood families don't have the option to marry their cousin. Instead, their only options are halfbloods. (Oh, the horror!)
