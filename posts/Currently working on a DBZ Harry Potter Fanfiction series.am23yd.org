After a being abandoned by his uncle and left in an alley, 5-year-old Harry Potter is found by Bulma Briefs. Noticing his Saiyan biology, Bulma takes him in and Chi Chi trains him. Together with his new friends, Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma, he will travel to Namek on an adventure that he will never forget.

Then, after fighting galactic tyrants and cybernetic bio warriors, Harry discovers that he is, in fact, a being of great magical power destined to defeat the evil sorcerer Lord Voldemort. He attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, all while keeping his true Saiyan power under wraps, he makes new friends and new enemies as he solves the mysteries of the magical world and avenges his parents.

This story is exclusively from Harry's point of view, unless Harry is asleep/unconscious, aside from at the beginning when Bulma first discovers him. Magical beings have had their power up-scaled, in order for the Saiyan-Who-Lived to have a better challenge, rather than wiping the floor with everything between Cell and Buu, and maybe beyond.

Ships: Harry/Luna, Gohan/Videl, Draco/Hermione

** A 5 year old with Saiyan biology can take solid hits from a steel bat swung by a pro-league baseball player and be okay. There's no way saiyan Harry Potter could be effectively beaten by his muggle uncle. It would have to be 100% mental abuse.

*** When Bulma and Goku first met, Bulma /shoots him in the face/, and all Goku has to show for it is a tiny bruise, /if that/.
