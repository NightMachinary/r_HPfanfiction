At King's Cross, Dumbledore makes it clear that Harry still lives because Lily's sacrifice lives on in Voldemort, but if the protection still exists why did the blood protection fail at the Dursleys?


** The killing curse killed the Horcrux instead of Harry. It's flimsy, but it's the cannon explanation.

*** And also because Harry at that point was the true master of the Elder Wand, and so the wand refused to kill its rightful master.

Basically, Harry got really really really really really lucky.

*** This is not correct.

Voldemort was able to attack him directly after he took his blood in Goblet of Fire. Honestly its the protection still holding on the house that doesn't make sense.

The reason the curse failed in Deathly Hallows is because a) Harry was the rightful owner of the Elder Wand, which refused to kill its master, and b) the spell therefore killed the Horcrux fragment instead, leaving Harry unharmed.

Harry lived because Malfoy happened to disarm Dumbledore, and Harry happened to disarm Malfoy. Basically, pure luck.

**** Harry damnable luck but lily's protection wasnt completely nullified by voldy taking Harry's blood. He still had it but voldy just had a back door so to speak. Lily's protection didnt extend to the dursley house until Dumbledore enacted the wards after he left harry there. He says so himself in either ootp or hbp cant remember which.

** There are two different things:

1. The power of Lily's sacrifice, which lives in Harry's blood. This is the power that burnt Voldemort in PS. When Voldemort took Harry's blood in GOF he gained that same protection for himself. The power was not gone, it was simply that Voldemort had it too.

2. The Bond of Blood Charm cast by Dumbledore on Harry, powered by Lily's sacrifice, which protects him so long as he is under the same roof as Petunia and calls that place home. This breaks when Harry turns 17 because once he is an adult, Petunia's home is no longer his home.

Dumbledore explains this in OotP:

#+begin_quote
  “But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated - to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.”

  “But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”

  “While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, while you are there he cannot hurt you.
#+end_quote

The Charm cast by Dumbledore had broken by DH, but the power of Lily's sacrifice remained. (And conversely, when Voldemort took Harry's blood, he neutralised the threat of Lily's protection, but he did not neutralise Dumbledore's Charm).

As for why Harry survived, it was *not* because the Killing Curse killed the horcrux instead of him. This is a complete misunderstanding of horcruxes. The only way to destroy a horcrux is to destroy its physical container; it's impossible to kill the piece of soul directly. That is why Harry himself must die; his body must be "destroyed" (i.e. dead) for the horcrux to be destroyed.

The reason why Harry survived is explained by Dumbledore in DH: the fact that Lily's sacrificial power lived in Voldemort tethered Harry to life.

#+begin_quote
  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  [...]

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”

  [...]

  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

*** Great explanation. So Harry's mastery of the Elder wand had no impact in him surviving at this point

For clarity: If someone other than Voldemort had killed Harry, would he still had been able to come back. Or is it a requirement that Voldemort did it.

Also, was this a one time thing? Could Harry had taken another Killing Curse from Voldemort and survived (assuming he was willing and didn't resist)

**** There's nothing /in the books/ which suggests that the Elder wand played a role. However, outside of the books, JKR gave the following explanation:

#+begin_quote
  What exactly happened when Voldemort used the Avada Kedavra curse on Harry in the forest?

  Again, Voldemort violated deep laws of magic he did not understand, but there is more to it than that.

  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, of course, he refused to feel remorse.

  Voldemort is also using the Elder Wand - the wand that is really Harry's. It does not work properly against its true owner; no curse Voldemort casts on Harry functions properly; neither the Cruciatus curse nor the Killing Curse. The Avada Kedavra curse, however, is so powerful that it does hurt Harry, and also succeeds in killing the part of him that is not truly him, in other words, the fragment of Voldemort's own soul still clinging to his. The curse also disables Harry severely enough that he could have succumbed to death if he had chosen that path (again, Dumbledore says he has a choice whether or not to wake up). But Harry does decide to struggle back to consciousness, capitalises on Lily's ‘escape route', and pulls himself back to the realm of the living.

  It is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic (the very deepest life and death issues) as essentially un-scientific; in other words, there is no “Elder Wand + Lily's Blood = Assured Survival” formula. What count, ultimately, are Harry and Voldemort's own choices. They have each been given certain weapons and safeguards, but the power of these objects and past happenings lie in how they are understood, and how they are used or enacted upon. Harry has a deeper and truer understanding of the meaning of the objects and past events, but his greatest powers, those that save him, are free will, courage and moral certainty.

As for why it was so important for Voldemort to be the one to do it: I suspect this was more related to the fact that Harry's "sacrifice" granted protection to all of Hogwarts, meaning Voldemort was basically neutralised as a threat from that point forwards.

** I believe the explanation is that Harry's blood in Voldy tied Harry to the living world, like a pseudo-horcrux. It's not so much that the protection was still in place, but rather Harry's own magic affecting him. That way when the AK hit Harry and /willingly/ he brought about a new Lily-like protection over Hogwarts, or even renewing it.

At least, that's how I understand it.
