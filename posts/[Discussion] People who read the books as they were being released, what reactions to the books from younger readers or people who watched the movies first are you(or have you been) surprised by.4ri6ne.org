Or are different to the reactions you had and things you thought when reading the series for the first time?

I'm aware that PS/SS, for example, is now nearly 20 years old. In that time, our society and our attitudes to so many things have changed a huge amount, so I wonder how Harry Potter and the world portrayed there still holds up as a picture of our real world to younger readers nowadays. And the same for how characters behave and where the story goes.

To give an example, one thing I (as an older reader now, who's been with the fandom a long time) have noticed is that since the movies, there's been either more, or a much more vocal segment of fans that ship Neville/Luna and Harry/Luna and have gone back to the original books in order to find evidence for their ships, that I don't think were /as/ popular when the books originally came out.


** Three years ago, a friend's 10-year-old daughter had a teacher who required the kids to read a chapter a day in a book of the child's choosing. 10-year-old mentioned to me that she didn't know what book she wanted to read. I offered to let her borrow my Harry Potter books. I was informed very quickly that "Ew! No way, only nerds read those books!"

Sigh.

** I've not spoken to anyone recently who has JUST read the books, but I'm in my 20s and read them as they came out.

One of the things that was really wild for me back before the series was complete was the sheer amount of speculation. EVERYONE was reading them and EVERYONE has opinions on what was coming next. I spent hours and hours reading on mugglenet forums discussing theories and trying to find evidence that Sirius was coming back, that Dumbledore wasn't dead, all kinds of things. I also was a Harry/Hermione shipper back then :) it was such a worldwide phenomenon and I can honestly say I've not experienced anything on that level since then. I went to many a book release and waited in line with my dad and with hundreds of other fans, it was like instant friendship just because we were all there together.

Now, a lot of people have only seen the movies and consider them canon, which is a bummer. They're so incredible and I wish more people would experience them.

Before I got into fanfic, I was really into fan theories, reading these forums that theorized everything they could from the smallest bit of subtext. I didn't ship back then, since I was only 10, but I was curious if Snape was a good guy and if Harry would survive the series and other stuff like that.

It's kind of sad that we won't be able to get that back. It was fun to ride that wave with the rest of the world. But because of all that, Potter has become so pervasive that there's nothing left to pique the average kid's curiosity.

** I see people who consider the films canon, which I do not. I would agree with JKR to a point that girls have loved Draco because they fancied Tom Felton, although I would disagree that this explains all Draco-based fanfiction, because I write about him, and I don't think of the films at all. The scene with Hermione and Harry dancing in the tent sails the HP/HG ship for many, and of course many Snape fictions are wholly based on the lovely Alan Rickman.

I think they appeal to many of us who did a collective eyeball roll at the rah-rahs who would have been happy to be in Gryffindor or Hufflepuff (though really, I suppose I would be sorted among them, if I were to have the Hat.)

And I see the call on Snape/Lily. Had to be a reason why a guy Harry's parents' age hated him so much. Please correct my if I am wrong, but doesn't Severus complain in book one to Dumbledore about Harry being as obnoxious as his father? My books are a lazy walk away, so I may be misremembering.

Look up Felton on Instagram and you see many rabid HP-generated fans.They seem to be very invested in his love life. That is part, but obviously not all, of the Venn diagram.

She called me in the middle or reading Deathly Hallows to basically tell me that she'd never realized how /dark/ the books became, and how she was internally cringing that she'd let my 10 year old brother read the last books before she did, just because she was under the assumption that they all stayed light and happy and good triumphs over evil, etc etc. I was shocked that she didn't realize this...

Yeah, DH is so dark, I think it's why it still holds up as my fave of all the books to this day. Ironically I think the movie-makers shot themselves in the foot by changing characterization so much in the previous films; the book characters could hold their own in that darkness, the movie characters (especially with so much added comic relief and angst for Ron) struggled to bring him back from that brink. Also by continuing to chase a lower rating so that kids could watch the films still. Bring on my HBO series in ten years time, please.

Of course, for me the worst scene in DH is Ron and Hermione chasing Nagini and trying to kill her by throwing rocks and pieces of rubble. Are you a witch and a wizard or not?? That scene was crying out for someone to utter that line.

***** Fair enough.

Speaking for myself, I have long since seen my shipping skills stagnate. Part of this is because I prefer Missing Moments fics and stories about deep, passionate, *platonic* friendships.

I'm especially fond of fics that explore Ginny's friendship with Luna.

On that note, my very favorite fanfiction was /Faith and Understanding./ But it got taken down--I think the author just disconnected her fanfiction account--and I didn't have it archived.

It chronicled the story of Ginny and Luna's platonic friendship, starting with their meeting on the train.

Oh, what a story it was. Through her friendship with Luna, Ginny pondered what "truth" meant. They sat next to each other in class and studied together and laughed and listened and made each other angry--Ginny is actually the one who coined the "Loony" nickname, though she only meant it as a private joke. They thought about what real friendship means. They confided secrets in one another and Ginny played a guessing game, asking Luna questions about herself and then tried to anticipate Luna's answer--which she usually got wrong.

They became very close. Luna spends time at the Burrow and lets Ginny use "Loony" as a private, affectionate nickname, because "if it's you, I don't mind. You can call me whatever you like."

And it balanced the tone of the books well, the juxtaposition of the war and the fact that these are just kids.

Ginny and Luna train for Dumbledore's Army, readying themselves for war, and sprawl barefoot in the grass on the Hogwarts grounds watching the clouds.

Well, Jo likes to give people names that mean something and Luna's last name is Lovegood, so, of course her love is good and would be good for Harry. Then she was also /the/ person Harry managed to have a somewhat helpful talk with after Sirus' death. - she seemed more interesting and better fleshed out than Ginny ( who I did consider the only other option, I was firmly in the Ron/Hermione camp and did not even consider slash as something that might happen in canon). So, it just made sense to me.

** Another unrelated thought --- I was so excited by Hermione as a strong, relatable female character, but I remember really loving Ron. And his portrayal (and I don't blame a child actor for this) was just the equivalent of the dopey dad in a sitcom. I really felt like he was not given his due. So when Ron shows weakness---as they all do, but his disappearance in book seven is pretty straightforward, I think he wasn't allowed much grace. He gets bashed by some Dramione shippers (and I have written one, so I don't lump all of them in) and some Hermione/Harry shippers. (Do they have a cute one-word name?)

**** I never knew the true depths of the angst involved in the 'shipping wars' til much later, but even immediately after HBP's release I knew several people who hated it. Quickly learned to just avoid the subject entirely.

***** In my opinion the post-HBP shipping wars were nothing compared to the pro/anti Snape arguments. The friendships that destroyed...

** My friend has watched the movies but never read the books. He was pretty surprised at just how much the movies cut out from the later books.

As an intern and student teacher I haven't seen a single Harry Potter book in the classrooms. Back when I was in school the books were the first ones to fly off the library's shelf. Now it seems hardly any kids read them, which is really a shame.

** I teach millennials - far from what Buzzfeed would have you believe, Harry Potter is not as popular as it was even ten years ago for the young ones. So I would say that quite a number of younger readers don't immediately reach for HP, or have even read it yet. My students know how obsessed I am with Harry Potter but the many references I make fly straight over their heads!

Some of the more popular books at the moment are John Green's novels, and the dystopian craze of THG and Maze Runner still hangs on. I also see a lot of YA type medieval fantasy romance series. Younger kids are really into Andy Griffiths, Rick Riordan and anything any youtube vlogger writes eg. Pewdiepie's book.

So I guess my two cents is that as a fantasy book, Harry Potter does hold up well, but younger readers of today generally are steered more to where our culture is going eg. stories featuring more technology etc and non-fantasy YA books. At least the flavour of the month isn't Twilight!

I find, as a member of the generation Buzzfeed loves targeting it's #TBT's to, the sheer amount of products and consumerism associated with HP is unbelievably popular and I think that says a lot about the fandom eg. fans getting very detailed or artistic HP tattoos, the slew of HP cosmetic products (some of which I totally own). I think that says a lot about where the fandom is moving.

*** I sort of suspected this might be the case, given that Harry Potter - unlike say THG - shows us a world that it insists is /our/ world, rather than a separate place entirely. It is set in the 80s and 90s, but it doesn't outright say so until pretty deep into the series, so for a long time it just seems like it has no technology or nothing that people nowadays rely on day to day for no reason. That would break my suspension of disbelief for sure.

** Adding more thoughts... I think personally, now away from the hype of the movies, I find a lot of the HP movies to be a quite disappointing adaptation.

I think a lot of fanfiction has stimulated a lot of in depth analysis and second-guessing of the good nature of Harry Potter characters since the books were released. I am particularly fascinated by the long term moral consequences of Hermione cursing Marietta Edgecombe with 'SNEAK' on her forehead; the way a society could be rebuilt after war; why great female characters like Tonks and Ginny get sidelined in DH when JKR promised us a kick-ass Ginny!

I also think, as mentioned on another thread here somewhere, the DH movie gave us a huge glimpse into the plausibility of H/HR and I've seen heaps of fanfics jump from those infamous scenes.
