Been reading a lot of Sirius raises Harry fics and I've noticed it's a thing in some of them (esp the ones where harry is older). It always feels weirdly like pro-spanking propaganda. Like I was reading one where Sirius beforehand is thinking about how he and James had been spanked by James' dad and how it definitely helped and then afterward Harry reflects on how he really did feel better.

It's just really odd, and I don't know why it sometimes pops up. It's first of all OOC (Sirius isn't used to being the authority and probably has firsthand experience with abuse, and Harry definitely has firsthand experience with abuse). Not that spanking a little kid is nessasarily abuse (my mom spanked me like twice my entire childhood), but spanking a 13yo that's previously been abused and you're now trying to form a good relationship with is weird.

Why is this a thing? Is it psychological? Why do people want to shoehorn it in?


** In my opinion, if its mentioned, I stop reading. I do that because Sirius would NEVER hit Harry. NO adult who knew what Harry went through with the Dursley's would use Corporal punishment with him. It is plain stupid. And if that portion of Harry's history is retconned out in the Fic, then Its normally a Harry raised by____ story, where the situation never arises anyway.

** Considering Harry was born in 1980 it could be justified as he being just the right age during the whole transition from corporal punishment being justified to corporal punishment never being okay.

But, I think it's mostly fanfiction writers trying to justify their own upbringing through their writing.

*** Maybe in a story where Harry is little, yeah, but even back then normal people didn't spank their kids past age ten or so.

**** Ah, yes, my comment was definitely meant for younger Harry. There's no excuse for spanking to exist in a fic where Harry is older (EDIT: unless it's /that/ kind of spanking but I doubt that's the problem here ¯\/(ツ)//¯)

** Honestly I think it's just one way people know how to add drama/angst to an otherwise happy home life for Harry and Sirius. Oh, Harry's getting over his abuse by the Dursleys? Better add in corporal punishment with a big explanation why it's DIFFERENT to shake things up. And then there's always the ending where there's a good dose of hurt/comfort where Sirius reassures Harry he loves him. It's kinda like how people continue romance stories once the pair get together with miscommunication or rape or other drama to give the happy couple something else to do.

*** This is also why these fics are so fucked up. "Yeah, he's getting held down and hit repeatedly to induce physical pain, but it's not /abuse/ because tough love fixes all the worlds problems, so sayeth muh feels".

You know, just like how domestic violence is a-ok as long as it's done out of /"love"/. /s

***** Nah, that shit works since it's consensual. If Harry's 18 in the story and getting off in that shit I have no problems with it... I probably won't read it since it's not my thing, but still.

** What confuses me even more is when the spanking or corporal punishment has very little to do with the plot as a whole, maybe just a brief mention or a threat to "wallop some sense into you", yet it is warned of prominently in the summary.

Ex: Sirius escapes from Azkaban and decides to raise Harry like the son he never had. WARNING SPANKING

If the story doesn't revolve around this minor detail, get it the frick out of the summary!

*** I don't know, I appreciate when authors do that because then I know not to read it. I really don't like fics with corporal punishment, ESPECIALLY of children who are old enough to be talked to and reasoned with about punishments/consequences of their misbehavior.

**** And I don't mind warnings being above the first chapter for those reasons. I have squicks that make me back out of a story real quick. But for the actual summary I only want warnings that are either pertinent to the story or big enough to trigger people. Warning about graphic violence in the summary is different than warning that a character spanks a kid once.

** Snake fics also fall into this trap too. One where Harry is discovered as abused in first year and he moves in with Snape and gets tucked in and gets spanked. (Never smacked tho which is the correct term in England) Acte so much younger than an 11 year old would.

I think I know the fix you're referencing too. Remus spends an entire chapter reassuring him he did the right thing.

*** I've never heard spank, living in England my entire life, used in reference to a none sexual situation. It's really odd to read anything with 'spanking' in as all I can think is that the adult is getting some weird sexual fulfilment from it. It makes me stop reading if I see it and it is usually indicative of a poor piece of writing as it's a poor plot point.

#+end_quote

Because it's mentioned once, and fanfiction authors have no imagination. It's like Molly Weasley turning into a Love-Potion-dispensing master manipulator based on that one little reference in the books. Or all the tired Sirius/Serious name jokes.

"Are you serious?"

"No, I'm Sirius."

No "favourite" for you.

***** OP's comment makes it sound like Sirius mentions spanking or spanks someone in canon. That Molly believes in physical punishment is mentioned on more than one occasion.

She did 'wallop' the twins with a broom after they gave Ron this tongue melting candy.

** Sirius-raises-Harry can often be a sort of pseudo-incest thing--an empty-nester's emotional hook, strong emotional and physical family situations even without overt romance. Remember, most romance and erotica is aimed at /women/.

Add in that odd obsession with spanking, and it seems pretty certain to be some soft-core smut. My guess is, you just wandered into a dark corner with someone's personal fetish on display. Back away slowly.
