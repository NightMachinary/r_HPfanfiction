** Oh God Not Again: linkffn(4536005)

Pretty much a parody-fic of Peggy Sues, Harry spends a lot of his time trolling people and having fun. My favourite part is Neville's Boggart being "the thought of Harry as Minister for Magic" - think "Mondays are depressing, let's cancel them".

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** linkao3(Messing with Time by slythernim)

This one is more of a cracky time-travel fic where Harry ends up in his five-year-old body and dwells less on the rebuilding phase after the first wizarding war. It's more about Harry pranking Death Eaters and trying to convince everyone that he's not a five-year-old possessed by Voldemort.

** Uhhh... I can only think of one off the top of my head, but it is centered around Hermione and I do believe the war ends up being a plot point, but it's due to the ramifications of the future and Hermione's knowledge, which does end up being a massive plot point that. I'll not spoiler it, since I did quite enjoy it. Gotta love the fanfiction portrayal of Harry's Grandparents. They are almost always great when they are part of the main cast.
