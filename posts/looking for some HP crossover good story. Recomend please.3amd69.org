well HP XOver is always interesting, to mix and match the plot and timeline story. i like something epic story, a bit dark harry, well AU story, im not worry about slash\\
if you have a recommendation it will be very appreciated.


** Hmm... enjoying a crossover generally hinges on whether you know the other fandom. But here's some popular ones anyway, (it's likely you're read them before).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield]] Harry Potter/Avengers - the 2012 movie where Harry basically integrates himself into the avengers, his magic being very useful.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar]] Really nice AU where instead of magic, Hogwarts is an academy for the benders from Avatars, with each house representing an element. It's also the year of the triwizard tournament.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]] Harry ends up in the star wars universe, a slightly crazy and risk-taking Harry. He ends up freaking out a lot of Jedi and Sith plus sort of joins up with the young Anakin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince]] Harry Potter in Westeros, he has some dreams of being a wizard and could use magic if he found a wand. However it's westeros and Harry's a rather principled prince.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183715/1/Awaken-Sleeper]] Harry in the Dresden files world, and gets caught up in fairy politics and games amongst other things.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image]] A weeping angel is Harry's boggart because they are the most terrifying things ever.

I've been following the work in progress fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10881593/1/Riding-Acromantulas-and-Understanding-Magical-Biology][Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology]]. A crossover with Worm, it follows Amy "Panacea" Dallon and Taylor "Skitter" Hebert who, in the middle of a fight with / escape from a super villain are astonished to find themselves in 1990s Britian, and wonder why people think their last names are "Potter" and "Granger". Since they are characters from Worm that have superpowers, they both have Issues with a capital 'I'. Taylor, specifically has massive authority issues, although at the point in Worm from when she was plucked she doesn't have a body count of authorities she had issues with.
