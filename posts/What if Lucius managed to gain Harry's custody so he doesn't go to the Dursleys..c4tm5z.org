Title. Preferably if he takes advantage of it. This could be abusing him, killing him, bringing him to master, making him a dark wizard etc.

Thank you.

  Much to his displeasure, Harry is thrown back through time into his six year old body. As a result, Harry decides to contort the timeline, purely for his own amusement.

** Harry's Cousins is a nice story about this, a bit lighter than you're looking for maybe but there's still some danger for Harry.

** There's one... and I can't remember the title.

Harry originally went to the Dursleys, but the Malfoys got him pretty quickly. Dumbledore tried to stop them, but couldn't.

The Malfoys intended to raise Harry in order to hand him over to Voldemort, but they made a mistake: they raised Harry and Draco practically as brothers. As a result, Draco was more loyal to Harry than to his parents, and when the opportunity arose they both fled (Durmstrang, maybe).

It's only one or two chapters, never finished, but shows Harry and Draco starting at Hogwarts (don't remember what year) after fleeing Durmstrang. They intend to get sorted into different houses so they can pull together a diverse coalition against Voldemort.

It's a pity this was never finished, because it always struck me as one of the more interesting/believable ways of reforming Draco. Usually it's his love for his mother which gets him to change, but here it's the unintended brotherly love for Harry.

It's an idea with a lot of potential, IMHO.
