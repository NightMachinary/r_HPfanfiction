I am seeking more stories about the Dursleys finally getting slapped by karma. It can be legal trouble or pranking.\\
Like I love this one Redo fic, where Harry returns to his kid years and while he tries to run away and get the Dursleys in trouble, dumbles keep bring Vernon back from jail and putting Harry back, making Vernon a criminal mastermind as he seems to always get away with it. Harry gets so very creative, that Vernon fears the word Bubba in the end. Funniest part of this fic is when, at a football game, Manchester United is my guess, Vernon says a little too much and a football hoodloon smashes a bottle on his head, starting the fight of the year. The football hoodluns take Harry with them on their tour, beats up dumbledore and Snape, harry tries to make an ear necklace and finally bows under McGonnagals stern disapproval, and her perfectly executed groin stomp. Point is, the Dursleys get karma and then a little more, maybe with a little humour thrown in,and that's what I'm looking for. We'll not necessarily the humour. Recommendations?


** Power of the Press by bobmin356 in which Hermione curses them. Fairly mild.

Also by bobmin356, Fall of the House of Potter, in which Moaning Myrtle is used and has a more violent end.

There's a RobSt one (Can't Have It Both Ways?) in which they're cursed in a varying number of ways, including needing a plumber, infestation of bugs and other vermin, and the exterior of the property--house, windows, grass--is turned jet black. Destroys their reputation in the neighborhood.

The Telltale Cupboard by Drauchenfyre in which Remus helps a conscience along. We don't see the explosion but know it's coming.

Testing Defenses by canoncansodoff; Dudley goes to jail for drug related reasons, Vernon's in hot water and kicked out. Available both on ff.net and fanficauthors.net (which is the racier of the 2).

I'm trying to remember the one in which they're taken to trial and Vernon and Dudley go to jail but Petunia has to do community service which she loathes.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13436100][Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe]]) has the main character call them out on their behavior and force them to get better via possession. Maybe it's not quite what you're looking for, but it's a great fic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956][Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d]]) has the Durselys get cursed at the end of chapter 1, and you see the results in chapter 15. It might be worth reading if you like Percy Jackson, but if you just want Dursely karma, you'd probably be better off looking elsewhere.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
