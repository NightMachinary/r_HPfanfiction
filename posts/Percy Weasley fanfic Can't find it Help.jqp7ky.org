:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so I don't think this breaks any rules but I apologize if this does. Also spoilers for the fix bc I can't think of any other way to describe it. Anyway!

I read this Percy Weasley fic a couple months ago and I've been trying to find it and am having trouble. Pretty sure it was on fanfiction.net or com? It starts after the war, Penelope Clearwater gets released from Azkaaban, Percy and Penelope Clearwater get married but she dies. Percy goes through depression, meets Audrey and it ends with him getting remarried and starting a family with Audrey. Made me cry, really good fic, can't find it!! Help? Thank you!


** What was the rating, genre(s), and word count? How many reviews, favs, or follows did the fic have? When you read it were you searching for something in particular (i.e. did you put Percy down as a main character in the search options, or a specific genre?) or did you just stumble upon it?

*** Oh dear lord I wish I remembered all of those. I googled something like "best fanfics to read" or "good Harry Potter fanfics" (I've already spent over an hour googling and was hoping someone might know the cursed name.) It wasn't any sort of crossover, strictly Harry Potter, after the war. I think i actually saw the fic on a reddit post from a couple years ago that popped up in a Google search. Sorry for the lack of info

**** It's alright. Can you make a guess at what the rating would be or if it was complete or not? How about the number of chapters, or an estimate of how long each chapter is. I'm assuming it's not a one-shot, is it?

***** It was complete, about 14 chapters? High rating i think.

****** Alright, that narrows it down. Thanks. Currently I'm searching by Percy as a main character and published within 6 months. I found one called /Unravelling the Formal/, does that sound familiar? I'm reading a few chapters and it seems like it isn't shown that Penelope was in Azkaban.

EDIT: Nevermind, it's only 2 chapters long.
