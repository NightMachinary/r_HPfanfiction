  Fifth and seventh year start off less than stellar for Hermione and the twins respectively, as they butt heads over the twins' product testing. Some scheming and bit of magical interference never hurt anyone, did it?

  "Someday you won't care what they say. . . and you'll do it your own way, not theirs!" Slytherin!Hermione, in which the brilliant witch catches the attention of creative twin wizards. It isn't easy, though. Not all Gryffindors are vastly brave, nor are all Slytherins loyal to their own.- FW/HG/GW, starts in Hermione's 1st year. Rated for a triad relationship and future chapters.

#+begin_quote
  After the Unbreakable Vow incident which forever altered the state of Fred's left buttock George decides that maybe a slightly less dangerous vow might be just as much fun. Things don't quite turn out exactly as planned. FredxHermionexGeorge, but not twincest. Please remember, YKINMK. Ratings for language, mature content, some violence, and Umbridge.

** Whooo! One of my favorite set of ships that doesn't get explored much, I've got a few recommendations for you. They're mostly Hermione with George, sorry! I really would like to see more stories with either of these pairings.

H/G - non-canon compliant - Weddings with Weasleys - linkffn(2117695)

H/G - non-canon compliant - A Day in the Life (continuation of Weddings with Weasleys) - linkff(2152513)

H/G - hella ooc/au and non-canon compliant but still sweet enough of a story - Who Woulda Thunk It? - linkffn(1510432)

H/F - 30 Kisses - linkffn(10999887)
