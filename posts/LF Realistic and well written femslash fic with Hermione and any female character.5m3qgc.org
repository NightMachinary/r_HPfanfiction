I don't have any real preference with who she is paired with, I would just like it to be a good read. Thanks!


** linkffn(11762909)

I think I did that right.

I personally thought this was well done. Fairly AU though, easy to get use to but perhaps not everyone's cup of tea. Main romance is between Fem Harry and Hermione.

Sorry if this isn't what you are looking for.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

  In another world, Hermione Granger never attended Hogwarts. Orphaned at age three, she grew up supporting her low-income adoptive family who hadn't the means to pay for her education. Desperation and a chance encounter lead her into the employ of the three Black sisters. She finds herself caught in their deadly web, helplessly waiting to see who will reach her first.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** /Sesquipedalia/ is my favorite of the bunch. Adult sexual encounter between Hermione and Minerva. Hermione is aroused by long and complicated words. linkffn(11943963)

/Image of You/ has the best portrayal of raw emotion that I've read in fanfiction, but is saddled by a genuine Worst of All Time tier ending. Left a long and rambling review for the author. linkffn(3292970)
