My definition of 'bashing' would be:

1) When someone is portrayed as a moron, or a bad guy, or just incompetent.

2) Protagonists mistreat the character-in-question, implicitly or explicitly using the above as justification/rationalization.

3) Nobody calls the aforementioned protagonists out on their behavior, or if they do, they're treated as being 'wrong'.

4) (Optional) In the worst cases, it doesn't even contribute to any character's development or progression of the plot.

So, Ron says 'but Slytherins are bad!' and gets hospitalized via tons of hexing by Harry, nobody gives Harry a detention (but Ron might lose points for 'provocation') = bashing.

Amelia Bones slaps all kinds of unrelated injunctions on Dumbledore for embezzling from the Potter accounts, his only defense is a 'but the greater good' = bashing (or maybe not, but arbitrary incompetence for the sake of the plot is bad too).

Ron has strange and improbable accidents that send him to the hospital wing several times; still friends with Harry & Hermione = not bashing (lacks mistreatment by protagonists), just slapstick comedy.

Dumbledore is legitimately evil and attempts to assassinate Harry = not bashing (again, lacks mistreatment by protagonists), also it sucks that the Lightning Speaker Saga was never completed.

What's everyone else's definitions?


** The first time I heard the term bashing, I pictured someone sitting in front of their computer, holding an action figure of the character they hate and bashing it on their desk.

That's what I envision when I read a fic that bashes any given character(s). The scenes where this takes place don't feel like scenes with plot and characters, but words on a screen that are there as a vessel so the author can punish a character for all their wrongdoings, because they just hate that character so much. I think it's one of the most infantile things a fanfiction author can do.

The key point that you mention is that if a character is portrayed in a bad light, that doesn't automatically make it bashing. If we imagine a fic with an evil Dumbledore who Obliviates Harry several times to keep him from getting together with his soulmate Hermione, steals all the money from his seventeen vaults at Gringotts, helps Molly brew love potions to set him up with Ginny, and is secretely in cahoots with Voldemort, that doesn't mean the fic has Dumbledore bashing.

For that to be the case, I think the character needs to be in the fic /specifically/ to be bashed. If a villainous character acts as a serious threat and obstacle throughout the fic, then the moments in which they get their comeuppance wouldn't be bashing.

A character who is bashed is reduced to a gross caricature of all that was wrong with them in canon, with a good handful of other things that weren't actually in canon but we'll just toss them in anyway because hey, we hate this character. Never will this character have a relevance to the plot beyond being someone to be hated, and never will the author attempt to give them a semblance of character growth.

This. So much this. As the only person that creates a story, the writer has /total/ control over the actions and characterisations of all of the present characters, and bashing them, to me, illustrates a kind of childishness that effectively ruins my opinion of the author and whatever work I'm reading the bashing take place in.

The only reason that characters act stupidly OOC for bashing purposes is because the writer /makes it so/, and therefore they've (usually) sat down and thought about what they wanted to do, and decided:

"Hey, I'll just reduce character x to some laughable exaggerations of their (often perceived/misinterpreted) negative traits, with /no/ redeeming features, /no/ depth and most importantly /no/ real importance to the story!"

It makes me wonder why the characters are even included at all, if they're going to be useless, one-dimensional stand-ins for actual characters. You want to make the Weasleys evil? Sure, but actually make it important, or don't bother including them at all, because if they don't add anything tangible to the plot or the protagonist's actual character arc, then /why the fuck are they there in the first place?/

** When the character's bad qualities are magnified and blown way out of proportion, or their good qualities are ignored completely/interpreted as forms of manipulation (e.g., Molly offering to buy Harry's school things and requesting his vault key --> Molly is stealing from Harry and dosing him with love potions so that she can gain access to the 'full Potter inheritance'; Hermione nagging Harry to study --> Hermione is, excuse me, a manipulative bitch who's spying on Harry and fucking Dumbledore on the side (I have actually read such a fic... /shudders/).

All this being said, I do love me a good bashing fic (although a good fic and a bashing fic tend to be two very different things).

** It's almost always one (or more) of three things.

Attributing them with traits they don't have. Ex. Ron raping Hermione, being racist, or only being friends with Harry because he has money.

Driving a single, insignificant trait they rarely show into the ground. Ex. Ron didn't believe Harry during GoF, so he's a horrible friend and a horrible human being and Harry should wash his hands of him because Ron has given him nothing with the exception of a best friend; a big, warm, loving family; moral and emotional support; and unwavering loyalty, but fuck that guy.

Or removing all of their positive traits and only focusing on their negative traits. Ex. Ron was a coward that was afraid of everything, was always angry, lazy, hungry, and liked to complain. Lets forget all of the times he overcame and faced his fears for the ones he loved, or when he starved himself to go help Harry find horcruxes, or when he showed care for those who needed his emotional support like Hermione after Mad-eye and Dumbledore died, or Harry when he was losing his mind, or how he put in 100% when it was needed, or how he always bit the bullet because he felt his problems should take a backseat to Harry's.

How do you define racist? Because even in canon Ron and Arthur have racist tendencies (although anyone with magic is acting pretty racist towards non-magicals in canon; just look at the epilouge or the first Year Kings Cross scene with Molly).

Seen when Ron is bias against Remus being a werewolf, due to the reputation revolving around werewolves, even though he's never met one. He overcomes this way of thinking when he realizes that Remus is still the same, no matter if a curse afflicts him. The same can be said for house elves, but he was right, house elves do like their jobs. Hermione was the one ignorant of their culture. Kind of the mentality that what you've been afraid of isn't so scary when you come face to face with it.

Ron is as far from an elitist as you can get. He has the innate prejudice of someone who grew up in the wizarding world, but if he were actually racist, he wouldn't have stood beside Hagrid, Remus, Dobby, Firenze, Fleur.

And those instances weren't racist. The epilogue was Ron still having that carefree attitude about him and thinking, "no harm, no foul," and in some ways resembled his apparition test where he only splinched half an eyebrow. I'm not sure what you meant about Molly, though. They have no bias against muggles, unlike purebloods. They just don't understand their culture, something Arthur was intent on learning. They see muggles differently from themselves because they are, but that doesn't mean they look down on them. Ron even married a muggleborn and tried to adapt to muggle society.

***** She's walking through King's Cross and complains that the station is full of muggles. Not humans or people. Imagine going to somewhere in Africa and complaining that the place is full of Blacks. Or to Tokyo and complaining about too many Japs. Instead of making a general statement she involves race. That shows some degree of racism.

** I never thought I'd read a love potioning fic that I didn't consider bashing, but for me "Two Out of Three" by Wynnebat fits the bill. Yes, Ginny potions Harry, but she acts like a human being in the story, not some psycho, evil to the bone, entitled bitch out for his money, etc. And she doesn't blame anyone else, or try to lie once caught, or re-potion Harry. Instead, before being caught she irrationally believes that he'll one day grow to love her, while simultaneously feeling guilty about what she's doing.

I can easily see little kids brought up in the wizarding world on tales of the epic achievements of heroes potioning said hero when those potions are so easily accessible. And this story makes it seem like something everyday, messed up people would do, not just the batshit insane ones seen in bashing fics (because the real world has plenty of regular people who are messed up). At the same time, the fic doesn't excuse her behavior.

** Well, I think all that in all cases you mentioned the behaviour should definitely lack a solid justification and complexity to be considered bashing. Simply projecting the situation on real life is a good way a to determine if it is bashing or not. For example, there is little to no chance that parents will love one child and hate another simply because he/she defeated the dark lord. While it isn't uncommon in big families for certain favouritism to occur, bashing pushes it to extreme.

Simply being evil and/or mistreating a main character isn't enough to be bashing.

** To me the first test is: If you remove the character from the story does it affect the plot? If it doesn't then it is bashing. A good example of this can be seen in The Lie I've Lived. Both Krum and the Weasley Twins are portrayed negatively. If you remove Krum from the story the plot grinds to a halt. The antagonism between HJ/Fleur and Krum is a driving factor in the story much like how the antagonism between Harry and Draco drives PS. If you remove the Weasley twins however the story is just a bit shorter.

** In my opinion, a character is being bashed when they are completely incompetent and/or evil for reasons that the reader finds lacking. As such, exactly what one considers "bashing" varies from person to person. For example, some people might find the idea that the brains from the Department of Mysteries in OotP turned Ron into an incompetent bully perfectly acceptable, while many others would consider it to be bashing. Generally speaking, I tend to prefer that all characters be complex and mostly competent with both flaws and strengths clearly visible. In particular, a lot of manipulative!Dumbledore fanfics fall short in my mind because while they /say/ Dumbledore is an evil mastermind that somehow managed to manipulate Harry into some horrific scenario, they end up never showing him as anything but incompetent.

** My definition is rather simple, and taken from the HP Fanon Wiki (which I wrote myself):

"Character bashing is a manifestation of an author's hostility towards a certain character, or in certain cases, another entity, such as a in-universe political institution. In fan-fiction, bashing is usually done by villainizing the character, and representing them without any redeeming qualities. In the process, the characters who are "bashed" are placed in direct opposition to the protagonist of the story. "

So Rowling is bashing Voldemort, Lucius, Draco, Rastaban, Rodolphus, Snape and Death Eaters in general? Because they are simply a bunch of racist terrorists, some of whom are cowards as well. Also at the DoM, they were beaten by a bunch of kids despite outnumbering them two to one. That does not look like the elite wizards the inner circle is supposed to be.
