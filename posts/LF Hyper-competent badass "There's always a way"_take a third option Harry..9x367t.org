Basically, if Harry Potter as a character was written by [[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A6DPH7UCcAE2QjF.jpg:large][Grant Morrison]] the way the Scotsman writes [[https://cafart.r.worldssl.net/images/Category_3603/subcat_81502/WIZARDassman%20copy2.jpg][Superman]].

Let's see if there's something like that, no Dumbledore bashing please.


** So Super Harry fics that are actually entertaining? I can actually do that, I'm a fan of the genre.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/]]

Pretty much the authors MO. A version of Super Harry that I actually find enjoyable to read and keeping coming back for more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal]]

The Dumbledore bashing is relatively minor in this one. It's mostly a time traveling stupidly competent Harry kicking ass and settings things right.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356]]

Parallels is your best bet, and Sphere of Influence is an especially comedic take on this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]

Not quite Super Harry levels of competence, but still a very competent, powerful, and well written Harry who's more well balanced and realistic than in canon. It also involves a very profane sorting Hat, an insane Dobby, and a relatively well written romance with Fleur.

I've only read about 10 chapters of West of Here so far so can't vouch for the whole fic but I like what I've read.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

** So it's Hermione and not Harry, but you sound like you /might/ enjoy my linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor).

For a particularly strange/comedic take on a Harry who always takes a third option, see also linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) and sequels.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** At the risk of becoming “that fucker who recommends HPMOR all the goddamn time,” Harry Potter and the Methods Of Rationality definitely does this, and in my opinion does it very well. At one point, he shuts up the Wizengamot by scaring a dementor into submission. No bashing at all, really - Dumbledore is just a different kind of good person (older, wiser, better-informed, and more set in his ways) than Harry is. For all that some people say it “preaches” the author's views on morality, it goes quite a way into the opposite.
