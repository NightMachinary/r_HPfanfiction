Explain how anyone can defend this man he is a 30 year old man who bullies children he needs to fucking grow up he literally bully's nevile and Harry And hates Harry because he looks like his fucking dad come on

And dumbledore should have said something


** Snape is a hero because, in essence, he saved the world. But he is not a good person. There are plenty of doctors and those types of people in history who have invented something that has saved millions, but have also killed thousands in the process of creating it. So yes, he was a 'hero', but he will never be a good person unless some other very important infomation comes out, because liking a girl is not an excuse.

** I hate Snape too. He literally ties to get Sirius's soul sucked out. Outs Remus out of spite. Is cruel to students. He's a shit teacher. The Prince's book shows he's literally a better teacher if he writes the instructions down and has no contact whatsoever with the student.

And some of the things he does just doesn't make any damn sense. Snape legitimately tries to get Harry expelled at least once (flying car in CoS). And then what? What's his plan to protect Harry then? Throw a 12 year out out into muggleland with the Dursleys to protect him from a reborn Voldemort?

Snape's only redeeming quality is possibly his courage and even that's suspect. Where was his courage in school when his housemates treated his best friend like shit. Hell, even his motivation is tainted. It's downright creepy. He doesn't oppose Voldemort because it's the right thing to do, he does it because his girl (who wanted nothing to do with him because he's a racist asshole) was targeted. If the prophesy might of referred to Neville or... Ron, Snape would still be licking Voldemort's boots.

*** He threatens the soul sucking, yes. Snape thought, along with everybody else, that Black was guilty. Snape took Black to the castle, on a stretcher, for the Ministry to deal with. Compare that with Lupin wanting to murder Pettigrew in front of the kids.

He outs Lupin. Lupin who kept delaying taking his potion when it was brought to him and let himself be a danger that night. Lupin who never spoke to Dumbledore about how Black could possibly be getting into the castle even though at that time he also thought Black was guilty and a danger to the kids.

I can't say he was a completely shit teacher since OOP mentions OWLS/NEWTS got better during his tenure. His behavior, when compared to current teacher behavior expectations, is shit. Unfortunately for the time, he wasn't that out of place.

He betrayed Voldemort because a childhood former friend was in danger. Don't see a problem with that. I can't see how, at that time, he could justify a concern with James or Harry and not be dead (Voldemort) or not believed (Dumbledore). Part of his story is that this grew from ‘just Lily' to ‘only those I can't save.' The point with his courage is that it grew.

Snape, Potter, Black, Lupin, and Pettigrew all behave horribly at various times. I can't give a pass to some and not give a pass to others. Except Pettigrew. He just doubled down on the Death Eater stuff.

**** Except Snape bullies children for fun and out of spite, there's no practical application or tactical advantage, he threatens to kill Nevilles's Toad, bullies Hermione("I see no difference") all because he /could./ He literally allows sabotage in his class, /sabotage,/ when dealing with unstable chemicals that could seriously hurt a kid, or even worse.

I doubt Draco and Lucius would've cared that much if Snape just acted like a normal strict teacher who favored Slytherin, instead of persecuting Harry like a madman.

***** I don't excuse, “I see no difference.” That was horrible.

He doesn't threaten to kill Neville's toad. He threatens to feed Neville's potion to the toad. Tactical advantage would be to have Neville be careful with the potion.

Embarrassing Hermione in class - tactical advantage would be to have her stop trying to answer questions he asks of others.

I don't agree that he actually does persecute Harry like a madman. We are meant to think that, because we always need to doubt his motivations.

Harry got off on the wrong foot that first day when he was screwing around with Ron and giving lip to Snape (Why don't you ask Hermione). Harry is always giving cheek. We like this about Harry. But Snape's reaction was not out of line for the time. I don't recall any of Snape's punishments to be out of line with the other teachers. Other than Umbrage. But she's kind of the gold standard for mercilessly persecuting Harry. Snape's bad, but he's no Umbrage.

Regardless of the time he taught and how that sort of thing was accepted, his actions are enough for me to dislike him as a teacher. I would've hated him as my teacher. But it's not enough for me to HATE HATE HATE him as a character and deny him his redemption arc.

He says he will give Neville's toad /poison/, and then Neville, the guy who he terrorizes and is bad at potions has to brew the /antidote/ in a lesson that's said to be hard unless you are Hermione, then it's only complicated.

To Neville, he basically said, "I am going to kill your pet and make you watch, while you hopelessly try to save him."

He doesn't do this to teach Neville, he's just terrorizing him, he doesn't expect him to succeed.

I am talking about the time Snape /saw/ a student cursing another, making her teeth large, she asked for help and he said "I see no difference." and left, making her cry, that completely invalidated whatever other interactions he has with her.

#+end_quote

Snape began the lesson by taking the muggle raised student who barely knew about magic and quizzed him in front of the whole class, then making fun of him and bullying him without the boy even knowing why.

Then, every time he could and for stupid reasons Snape made things difficult for Harry.

He only saved Harry because he used to be obsessed with his mother, that's it.

When he should've thought him Occlumency, he did something akin to telepathic "mindraping".

Canon Snape is just a broody guy who uses his authority to bully children and make the orphan son of his school rival suffer because his parents aren't there to protect him(because Snape himself got them killed).

He terrorizes the other boy whose parents also can't help him, just because he can.

He ruined Lupin, just because he could, no other reason.

He's not a good person, he only helps Dumbledore because Dumbledore guilt-tripped him over the death of Lily.

Honestly, people only like him so much because Alan Rickman was likable and talented and so made the character more charismatic.

People have headcanon about him protecting children during DH, but apart from that scene in the movie, we have no confirmation of that IIRC. In the Book, it didn't even happen that way.

No, Snape only lit into Harry after he was screwing around with Ron. Harry not knowing was the point. Harry needing to be quiet and listen was the other point.

True, the movie alters this and makes Snape's attack out of nowhere. But I stopped watching the movies half way through Goblet of Fire.

Are you talking about the Lupin that put students in danger by forgetting to take his potion? The Lupin that knew Black was an Animagus and had various ways in the castle but choose to keep everyone in danger rather than inform Dumbledore? Because at that time, Lupin was convinced that Black was a murderer and out to kill Harry.

But obviously there wasn't a real reason to get him fired.

I didn't see the movie. But I would say sending Neville and Ginny to have detention with Hagrid would be protecting them.

ETA; I got the Neville thing back around the wrong way, but the tactical advantage was still to get Neville to focus on what he was doing. Wouldn't have worked, and Snape should not be teaching children. But it still doesn't rise beyond that generation's acceptable level of teacher vindictiveness. It doesn't push him beyond redemption.

While I mostly agree with your sentient overall, I'm a bit confused by this point. At what point does his friends treat Lily badly that we know of in canon? We can obviously make educated guesses (she's a muggleborn and is basically the only thing standing between Snape and DE recruitment, so it can be assumed that they try to drive her away from Snape as a result), but we don't actually /know/ anything about it, do we? For all we know, she might even be "protected" from them as a result of housemates trying to appease Snape, with the premise that he better stay in line, or she will get treated the same as every other Muggleborn.

** Well, I don't like the person Snape but the character it's very interesting. I think that a lot of people want to redeem him or likes him because they could identify themselves with his childhood, and it was already mentioned that the movies softened him a lot. The same thing goes with Hermione, in the movies she got more lines and phrases than in the books and many of them were taken from Ron.

*** Agree. I love reading Snape-centric fics, but canon Snape takes it too far to be glorified as a hero at the end. Sure, he had to keep up the act of hating Gryffindors to the children of Death Eaters, but he could have terrorized them as a group. That's less traumatizing than focusing on attacking one kid specifically (like Neville or Hermione in GoF)

He has a lot of flaws as a person, but as a character, it's pretty cool to see how divided opinions of him are.

** The problem in my opinion is firstly: Alan Rickman, who was a really charming guy + that whole 'always' scene that teenage girls like to focus in on. They made the character of Snape way more likeable in the movies than in the books and Alan Rickman played him on top of it xD.

There's a scene in the movie where Snape admits to Dumbledore that he told the prophecy to Voldemort. And then he asked Dumbledore to "hide them, hide them all". In the books, he only asked to protect Lily at first. Not even thinking about her husband and child. To which Dumbledore responded with: "you disgust me" and Snape backtracked.

Secondly, there's also the preferred argument of him acting that way because he has to be a convincing double agent. No. He's just a dick. That wants to use every little excuse he can to use his power in the unfair teacher/student power dynamic.

Others like to point towards his childhood before Hogwarts but, as proven, a horrible childhood does not make you a horrible person.

Also, he drove Lily away on his own. Hanging out with 'friends' who considered her to be the lowest class of witch imaginable and then topping it off by calling her a mudblood. Imagine if Harry did that to Hermione if he started becoming friends with Malfoy. Yeah... doesn't paint a pretty picture, does it?

Ultimately, I think Dumbledore only tolerated him because he was so valuable in the war. The ends justify the means type of thing. Similar with Umbridge. Dumbledore is the type to use soft and calculated power over Voldemort who uses hard power.

There are no truly good/flawless characters in the Harry Potter series, just like in real life.

But I guess you could make the argument that Voldemort is as psychotically evil as one can get. Since he took joy out of hurting others from a very young age.

Hating Snape is kind of an unpopular opinion in the fandom. People love this super dynamic character and you can do a lot with him. And a number of people may even subconsciously associate hating Snape with hating Alan Rickman.

The character of Snape proves that not only 'good' people oppose Voldemort. And that war isn't black and white.

** I hate him and can't see how it's even possible for him to be a 'hero'. Correct me if I'm wrong about this bit as it's been a while since I read canon, but didn't Dumbledore say in a public trial that Snape turned traitor? What, did all the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself just forget about that? Surely Voldemort isn't going to tell a known spy anything he doesn't actually want him/the Order to know? That means that, as far as fanfiction goes, it's likely that he would either be unknowingly feeding the Order false information/leading them into ambushes, or he was actually spying on the order for Voldemort.

That went on a bit of a tangent from why I hate him but the point stands. It questions all the heroic sacrifice, brave man claims.

As for why he actually is a bastard, there's a long list of different incidents where he actively bullies children. Harry, Neville, Hermione, even seemingly random students. I seem to recall a time when he made a Hufflepuff student cry in class but I may be misremembering. Then there's all the things he presumably did as a Death Eater (a skilled duelist like Snape isn't going to be wasted only brewing potions) and the fact he was creating his own dark magic as a teenager, but the biggest one is Lily.

In the book when he tells Dumbledore that Voldemort is targeting the Potters he doesn't say protect them, he says protect /her/. He doesn't care about James or baby Harry, just the object of his obsession. If Harry had been born a day later and the Potters therefore weren't targeted, Snape would have never gone to Dumbledore. Children being murdered wouldn't have mattered.

Snape's semi-public status as an informant for Dumbledore is a huge issue with anyones motivation to keep him around. What use is an informant reporting to a serious mind reader on each side of the conflict, besides acting as a mailbox for deliberate misinformation.

Worse, Dumbledore actually gains less than his counterpart from keeping Snape around. To Voldemort, a master potion maker who can be discreet about his purchases is a valuable and rare resource for a recovering dark lord that can't just walk into an apothecary himself.

To Dumbledore, Snape is mostly a political liability. He has to pretend to protect Snape from his former death eater pals, keeping him nearby, at hogwarts. He also has to let Snape pretend to be a bad enough dude to still make friends /with/ his former death eater pals, encouraging Snape's behaviour towards students.

**** I remember a story where it was pointed out that Harry wasn't believed after the third task, since every time Dumbledore said "I trust Snape" he reduced the value of his word and opinion. So when Dumbledore said "believe Harry", that actually became a negative and was a large reason why people didn't think Voldemort was back.
