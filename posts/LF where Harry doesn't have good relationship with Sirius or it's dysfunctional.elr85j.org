I don't see many fanfics where Harry simply doesn't see eye to eye with Sirius, they don't like each other (or more likely they don't understand each other well so their relationship is failing) or their relationship is dysfunctional (like in Train to Nowhere) but I would like to read some more. Sirius being ignorant to Harry's belifs, living conditions counts too as well as being on different sides of conflict.

Slash, dark Harry, more intependent Harry... Whatever House sorting, alternatives in universe, timetravel, rebirth... I don't really care about plot as long as it's not badly written, doesn't have harems and illogicaly overpowered Harry who is heir to everyone and everything with creature inheritance on top.


** Do you want Sirius's personality to be consistent with canon or do you want him to be bashed? Most 'Harry doesn't get along well with Sirius' fics bash Sirius and have Harry siding with Voldemort in some way.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.

  Hermione Granger is fifteen, sixteen in a few weeks. She has this summer job in the local library she loves, but something is amiss. Why does she spend so much time waving things, like this ruler, in such a silly way ?

** Brother to Basiliks by Lomonaaeren

"AU of PoA. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle---and when he follows it, everything changes. Updated every Friday."

Still ongoing, I've gotten about half way though (i'm a notorious fic hopper). Harry and Sirius try to get along but Sirius doesn't get Harry and he's not very suitable to raising someone post azkaban. Has a bit of mentor!Snape from what I recall, and I think there's a bit of dumbledore bashing later in the fic. It is tagged for slash (harry/draco) and from what i've read it's a very slow build, harry and draco are not instant bff's either.

Granted, the plot/relationship focus is not with Harry and other people, so this might not be what you're looking for. I don't want to spoil anything major, but this is probably one of the better fics by this author.

edit: removed link to ao3 because I did it wrong

  I wanted Simmons to be able to have the chance to choose between Will and Fitz fairly without Will being helpfully taken out of the equation so this is my (whumpy) take on what her choice could have been like.Spoiler free mostly because mine is completely different.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
