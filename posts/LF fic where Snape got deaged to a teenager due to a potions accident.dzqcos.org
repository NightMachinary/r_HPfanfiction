:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a story I read ages ago, definitely snamione, and Snape got de-aged back to the same age as the trio at the time (about 5th year?) and was forced by Dumbledore to attend classes again. It sounds cracky, but I'm pretty sure the premise was played relatively seriously.

I dropped it for some reason, but now I'm really curious to read it again even though I have no memory of the title or author. Any help you can give is appreciated :)

*** I could've sworn Dumbledore was alive in the one that I read? It could be that one, but I don't remember Snape losing his adult memories in it.

**** There's 2 other SSHG deage fics I know of that retain his memories. Both of them start in 1st year, one of the fics is incomplete and never got past 1st year, the other fics goes through all years and is complete. I assume it is neither of those?

** Update: After some careful procrastinatory browser history combing, I think it was called 'Second Time Around,' however, it seems to have been deleted from FF. Rip me I guess, but oh well. Thanks for any suggestions given.
