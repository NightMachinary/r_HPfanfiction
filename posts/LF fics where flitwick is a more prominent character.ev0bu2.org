  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** There's Ah, Screw It linkffn(12125771). Harry goes back in time and Flitwick is one of the first (maybe the first) person he turns to for advice. It's actually quite sweet how the writer creates a deeper connection between them. It is a little all over the place but an entertaining read if you're into this kind of thing.

** I'm pretty sure there's an older fic out there where Harry trains under Flitwick to be an enchanter or something like this but I can't remember for the life of me the name of it.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.
