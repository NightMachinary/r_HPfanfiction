I ran across a few interesting fics with an interesting if unexpected twist of a female dominant relationship, involving Harry as the man. I got kind of curious and I wondered if there were any going the other way, with a female Harry playing the more aggressive role. Doesn't have to be anything too niche, just curious if there is anything even close to this out there.


** OP, can we get examples of the ones you ran across? Asking for a friend.

Yes, the friend is me.

  “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”The world seemed to move in slow motion, as Rose Potter, the girl-who-lived, beater of trolls, new marauder and many other less pleasant titles, watched as the blasting spell hit her godmother, the only real family she had left, her rock, her teacher, she watched her slowly being thrown in the veil's direction.Until a mysterious green-eyed boy changed everything!AU! Harry and Female Harry (Rose), Harem! Evil Hermione, senile Dumbledore

** I think your post a bit vague. That said, if you're looking for an actual story (and not a PWP D/s), possibly this.

It's about as gratuitously explicit as you can make it if you still want a serious story.
