I'm running low on fanfic so... Will take anything as long as it's not utterly cringe, even if it's hardly believable. I enjoy beautiful writing such as in linkffn(dark and light) or fun reads such as linkffn(full circle) . I've found that I can't really stomach het pairings and Drarry isn't intense enough (and kind of cringey) so Tomarry is my go-to. I've read a lot of Tomarry already but I've forgotten some of it so link me anything.

  Harry Potter found peace after the war in another world where a large number of Potters live. He makes his living as an animal healer in Godric's Hollow, surrounded by family and away from all wars. But his peace shatters with the arrival of a Tom Riddle from another dimension, who seeks a Potter who can be his foretold weapon in his own war.

**** A dangerous game is diary tom. Diary Tom effectively kidnaps fifth-year harry when he is released from the diary. Harry makes an unbreakable bond (promising cooperation/ not harming tom. or something to that effect) with tom with a (six-month?) expiration date to keep himself from being locked up by Tom. The two go look for horcruxes while enjoying a friends-with-benefits type relationship. It's a pretty good fic

**** i think the most fitting for the combination you like would be lnkffn(Rebirth by Athy). Harry is Dark, very out of character, in fact he isn't really even harry, he grew up with Tom in the orphanage, and much of the story has him acting independent of tom though so he is powerful in his own right. He is the same age as Tom with a similar birth year. (not a MoD story or a harry travels back to tom's time).

Maybe lnkffn(Love's Loathing) by the fictionist would be a good in between. Since harry grew up with tom, even though it takes place when they are adults and harry is pretty powerful to be able to match tom.

-----------------

A lot of the Dark!OP!Harry's I can think of are harrymort. Although, I find harry tends to call voldemort Tom whenever they are in a relationship. Although I still tend to think of these as harrymort. Examples of harrymort with Dark!OP!Harry: lnkffn(Death of Today), lnkffn(Dreams and Darkness Collide), lnkffn(The Black Heir), lnkffn(The Art of Hidden Personas), lnkffn(Consuming Shadows) (although that last one might be ao3

---------------------------------

Time travel: Well I can name a ton of varying quality. The first one that got me into time travel to tom's era and is a pretty decent long one is lnkffn(Bonded One). If you want Tom in Harry's era, lnkffn(Tainted by R.L.Peverell) is good but incomplete too soon.

  EWE. The war is over, but Voldemort isn't as dead as everyone believes. Harry returns to Hogwarts, expecting a normal school year, but a sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle has other ideas. It seems sometimes the line between good and evil is very blurry and fascination and hate can easily coexist. Features: powerful!Harry, Dark Arts, Slytherin schemes, and very twisted love.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** PREPARE FOR A MONSTROUSLY LARGE REC.

If you're looking for some good fanfics, there's this author called terrific_lunacy, and she's the best. SHe's like one of the original to marry shippers and creators, and I swear to god you'll love it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2702009][rebuilt-terrific_lunacy]]

After society as we know it collapsed, humanity struggled for survival. Following a decade of chaos and anarchy, a new society begins to establish. Lords try to assemble the best followers around them and battle other groups for territory. Young Harry Potter tries to stay out of trouble, but when a new lord with unconventional ideas sees the potential in his unique talents, his quiet life soon gets turned upside down.\\
Armed only with his wits, Harry has to take on one catastrophe after the other, all the while trying to uncover his own past and teach a certain smug bastard the meaning of personal space.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2717891][Blurring Reality]]

Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, headmaster, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, acclaimed dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection.\\
The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

(its actually a lot like black swan, but its super interesting)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5893567][Start the show]]

It started as a game. When two highborn lords come looking for a distraction from boredom, they merge the worlds of the highest class with those of the lowest class. A careless invitation sets things in motion that were supposed to stay locked away.\\
Because a kingdom on the verge of collapse, a noble without a past and a circus performer with a secret are not a good combination.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5893495][set the sails (and don't look back)]]

1. All Harry wanted to do was to cross the Atlantic and start his apprenticeship under one of the most renowned physicians.\\
   Tom Riddle is convinced everything floating in the seven seas belongs to him. That includes ship-wrecked, green-eyed youths. Especially if they tell him to fuck off.

there's also the fictionist, who's writing's like a must if you're into tomarry. Like, that's one of the building foundations of tomarry.
