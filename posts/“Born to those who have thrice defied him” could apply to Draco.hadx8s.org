So I have always hated that line, because it's so boring. Like defying Voldemort three times could be anything from refusing to join him 3 times, to fighting him 3 times, to wearing muggle clothes 3 times. But yesterday I had a thought so I decided to share.

What if that line applied to Draco? (In an AU, ofc)

Draco's mom is a Black, which makes him one too, and by the time he is born, 3 Blacks have defied Voldy. (Sirius, Andromeda, Regulus)

Soooooo.... thoughts?


** We know that 'defied' is more specific than wearing muggle clothing (for one, Lily is muggleborn) and can be made through process of elimination - both the Potters and the Longbottoms had a son born at the ending of the seventh month, so by working backwards Dumbledore and Voldemort were able find 3 concrete instances of both couples defying him.

Draco isn't born to Sirius, Andromeda or Regulus though, which why the wording of the prophecy is so important. Not to mention that he is born near the start of the sixth month, automatically disqualifying him.

*** People not understanding the true meaning of a prophecy until it's too late is a classic plot device. I can see this working. Voldemort's feeling pretty proud of himself after killing Harry and Neville, and then bam! Draco kills him.

***** This would be just after Voldemort praises Draco as being just as ruthless as him, or something along those lines.

******* Not July, but there are lots of different calendars. Draco might have been born at the end of the seventh month in one of them.

** I think you could make it work in fanfiction, the wording is vague enough that it could be interpreted any number of different ways. For example approaches implies soon but soon in terms of time doesn't necessarily mean within the next year. Canonically Harry and Neville are the most logical subjects, but the whole point is that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy it only comes true because Voldemort thinks it means Harry and continues to act on it.

*** There was a story where Harry retreats and hide for a while/for good? And in the end was killed by Padme because her parents refused 3 times to join him during the second war. In this fic the Patil-twins where born in end July.
