** Pluto by bikelock28!! It's non linear so jumps around a lot but really captures the dysfunction of their relationship.

Linkffn(The Werewolf Who Stole Christmas by Lady Bracknell)

Linkffn(Transfigured Hearts 1: Caught by MrsTater)

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1][Shifts]] and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2681&chapno=1][Shades]] by Fernwithy

^ Those are the ‚Äúclassics‚Äù. They'll come up on a lot of fic rec lists for this pairing. Note that Transfigured Hearts is a series of separately listed one-shots.

The rest of my recs are pretty recent!

Linkao3(Flying Colours by TauraNorma)

Linkao3(Bergamot by cafei_au_lei)

Linkffn(Lycanthropy, Love and Other Curses by Thora Jane)

Linkao3(Brave As a Noun by SKBones)

And seconding bikelock28's Pluto. Cafei_au_lei is one of my favorite authors for Remus and Tonks. A lot of these authors have other great fics that you might like too, especially Lady Bracknell, MrsTater, and Gilpin. Happy reading!!

  "It's funny" Said Tonks, pink curls grazing the scars on Remus' bare chest, as she peered into his face. "Last night I had the privilege of seeing you lose control and now I'm watching you try to reassemble yourself. Piece by piece" The Ministry's most unconventional Auror meets the Order's most self-disciplined werewolf. Told through their alternating perspectives, ‚ÄòFlying Colours' follows Remus and Tonks over the Order of the Phoenix canon timeline. It is the first story in the Flying Colours Trilogy.

  bergamot [ber-guh-mot, -muht] (noun): a small citrus tree, Citrus aurantium bergamia, having fruit with a rind that yields a fragrant essential oil. While Earl Grey tea never was quite Tonks' favorite, there's somehow always a cup to be found somewhere as she tries to get to know Remus a little better. Moments from Remus and Tonks' relationship from OotP through end of HBP.

  Remus intrigued her inexplicably. He seemed so proper, so professional, and yet she couldn't help but remember the way he had blushed so furiously when she'd suggested they pretend to be on a date, and the way his eyes had twinkled mischievously at her stupid librarian joke. He was an enigma, a man encased in a mystery, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.\\
   One late June evening, Tonks attends the first meeting of the newly reformed Order of the Phoenix. In the dark, damp kitchen of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, she meets Remus Lupin. They are partnered up for a reconnaissance mission, and so begins a journey which will turn Tonks' life upside down.Or, The Order of the Phoenix, told from the perspective of one Nymphadora Tonks.

  Complete! Tonks knows all about werewolves, thanks to her Auror training, so now she can humansplain lycanthropy to this intriguing man she just met named Remus Lupin. That'll impress him, right?
