:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that i read a while ago.

Harry knows that the Dursleys are liars. He knows that his name isn't even Harry potter, it is somthing Black (i can't remember the name). He knows this because his name is written on his arm and has been for as long as he remembers.

Then i think he finds a snake which then leads him to Gringotts and finds that he is related to Narcissa and he escapes to her for safety from the Dursleys. It turns out that he was stolen as a child and that the blacks' magic make it so that the stolen child's name will always appear on their skin.
