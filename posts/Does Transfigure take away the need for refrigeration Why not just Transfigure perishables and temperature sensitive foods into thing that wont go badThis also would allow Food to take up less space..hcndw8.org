  If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.

** In other words you're looking at trying the reverse of Gamp's Law. Instead of transfiguring a rock into food (which would turn back into a rock causing you problems if you ate it) you're looking at turning food into a rock or some other inanimate small objects..

That sounds like a neat idea. The problem is chosing what type of object as most things still age and you would have to determine how that aging would impact the food when you tried to return that inanimate object back to food. Plus a transfiguration is fairly power intensive so you might have a variation in how long the food stays in that transformed state.

For instance, if you transformed food into metal how would rust (which can start to form in a few days) impact the reversal? If you transformed it into rock/pebbles how would them rubbing together losing dust impact the reversal?

If you did this i would think some type of high impact glass/plastic marbles would be best as they would be less effected by weather and time. You could even have the color of the marble denote the type of food (i.e., green for veggies, red for red meat etc.) Then your only issue is the power of the caster and how long their transfiguration would last. And storing the transfigured food in a spell resistant container so a simply "finite" does not reverse all the transfigured food.

Transfiguration is physically permanent but not magically. If you transfigured a rock into a chair, that rock will stay a chair forever. Give it to a muggle and that rock will be a chair forever. However the rock is magically still a rock and a decent wizard would know it is a transfigured object and still be able to untransfigure it back to its original form

Conjuration on the other hand is not pernament

Transfiguration can do a lot but there seems to be some rule preventing inedible to edible transfiguration. Might just be a quirk of magic or there's something about food that magically can't be replicated by transfiguration.

I don't have the quote on hand, but transfigurations are permanent, unless some magical law says otherwise, rock to chair will stay a chair. It is still magically a rock, and casting finite will revert it back to a rock, but otherwise that rock will stay a chair until the heat death of the universe. I think transfiguring something into an animal, or food won't work, because your biological magic will screw with your "food," and cause a whole bunch of problems for you. I've always thought that buying cheap, nasty, but highly nutritious food, and then transfuguring it into something delicious would be a cool little work around.

I agree on the blueprint part making it easier, however the problem is where does this doubled food come from. I.e., you have one lb of food surrounded by air. You then cast a spell to double the food and now you have 2 lbs of food. So you basically just conjured 1 lb of food out of thin air which you're supposedly are not able to do.

On the other hand it suggests that Harry and Hermione while in the tent in the Forest of Dean screwed up as All they had to do was cast the spell to double the food they had and they would've never run out.

*********** This is veering into head canon category but this is the way I think of it. Transfiguration change what an object is physically while charm alters the attribute of an object.

When you're doubling the amount of food you're using a charm that alters the “number” attribute of the food.

You can use charm to change an object attribute from “broken” to “fix” or add attributes like “lightweight” or “unbreakable” or “larger” or “cannot be summon”, etc

Duplicating food is just changing an attribute and that is doable.

But for some reason physically altering an inedible object to an edible one is not. There is something about food or the concept of food that can't be transfigured (or charmed as well)

You can alter the aspect of a food but once an object becomes a nonfood you can't turn it back into food

McGonnagall changes her desk into a pig, the students change teapots into a tortoises. It is heavily implied if not stated that they are real. Eg if you dissected them they would have the exact same physiology as a natural born animal. So if that is true then why can't you eat them and how were you able to do it in the first place as Gamp's Law states it's impossible.

The only explanation I have other than plot is that an inanimate to animate transfiguration creates what seem to be a living thing, but it's basically an elaborate doll. Give a transfigured pig to Muggle scientists to study and they'll swear it's real. It acts like a pig, it's chemistry and biology is exactly like a pig and so is its molecular structure. It'll stay like a pig for years

But it's missing elements that would make it a true living thing, like the fact that you can't eat it. It might also not be able to reproduce

******* I don't see the problem? We know that wizards can turn objects into animals e.g. McGonagall's desk into a pig.

The rule is that you can't use transfiguration to create "good food"; a pig is not food. It is an animal. A pig can be turned into food via butchery, but there's no rule that we know of against using transfiguration to turn items into things that can become food.

Note that the trio did not lack for ingredients in DH. In the conversation about Gamp's law, they have fish and mushrooms. What they lack is the knowledge of how to turn the ingredients into something palatable.

******** Definitely splitting hairs but that's ok. I'm a hunter so to me a pig is food. Without a doubt I like your thought I'm just not sure that was what JKR intended with Gamp's Law. And the phrase "good food" was not in terms of how tasty it was but in terms of whether you got nutrients from it.

In other words the impression from the books I got was that you could "create" food but you would get no nutritional benefit from it. I.e., you couldn't create "good food".

I think the issue may be that you can not conjure food out of thin air but you could transfigure something into food (and by food I mean a substance that you get nutritional value from when you consume it).

This is because we know that more food can be transfigured from an existing amount, so it strikes me as being unlikely to exist only to feed more people.

Unfortunately, Hermione is rubbish at food charms so we find out very little about household charms. Molly Weasley is known to be excellent at them, insofar as Ron believed food could be created from nothing.

Of course, this is conjecture.

Regarding the idea of transfiguring food into a rock to make it more portable, I think a shrinking charm would suffice.

JK Rowling had to put some limits to the limits of magic, if things like food and money could be perfectly duplicated without losing some quality there could be no Wizarding economy at all. From the book descriptions it seems like after a number of Transfiguration the food would eventually become unedible. This is like Leprechaun Gold, or the Gemino curse placed on items in in Gringott's - there could be hundreds of copies of an item but they are worthless fakes that eventually just disappear. I'd think food would be the same way, after thousands of transfigurations on the same piece of bread it would be have no nutritional value.

** I don't remember if this is canon or Pottermore stuff or fanon, but I remember reading somewhere that when a time traveller tries to return back crossing several years from the past, the body ages too rapidly and the person ends up dying. I feel the same principle could be applied to food. If you change an apple to stone and change it back after a month, you would get a rapidly rotting apple as a result.

If it is impossible to extend the lifetime a human without extreme feats of magic such as alchemy or necromancy, then it should similarly apply to plants and animals which are the primary sources of food. Perhaps it is possible to extend the lifetime of food but it requires a large sacrifice of magic and no witch or wizard is willing to pay that price.

*** I'm fairly sure that's fanon because Cursed Child has Albus and Scorpius travel back and forth to their their parent's time without any effect. Whether or not you agree with CC, there would have been huge discussion over the topic had JKR made such an eagregarious contradiction.

**** Ummm... I thought most people agreed that you cannot time travel to the future and it was one of the major bone of contention with Cursed Child. I didn't read it beyond the first few pages though, so I probably misunderstood something.

I found the source for my anecdote - it's on Pottermore. I couldn't get the actual link so I'll give this for your reference.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Eloise_Mintumble]]

I guess it also made its way into fanon. Basilisk-born, which weaves a lot of Pottermore articles and other fantasy lore it, had a reference to it.

***** I'd completely forgotten about that.

So, I suppose it probably would have that effect on food, except if magic advanced enough to prevent it. It seems more likely that wizards would have continued to research food related charms as no death is involved? I suppose that involves a certain level of common sense on the part of wizards, though.

The premise of Cursed Child is that technology has advanced and a more advanced time turner exists, however the time turner is unstable so after 5 minutes you're pulled back to the future. I believe a second, less temperamental time turner has also been created but I can't remember.

In order to prevent catastrophic change to history, they have to re-travel to prevent their own actions.

It's also a highly 'secret' and therefore rumoured development.

But the incentive to do so is also less. When the magic involved is too advanced and there is a higher price to pay, the reward must be high. How much effort would I be willing to put into inventing an /extra-long food preserving charm/ and then use it on a day-to-day basis? I might end up expending a lot of energy and need more food than I required in the first place. All this hard work and I don't even get an extra five days added to my life. Tsk.

From what I remember, Hermione was so 'excited' that she discussed the 'secret' time turner on the Kings Cross platform. I don't bother with Cursed Child stuff because of several reasons:

- The Golden Trio seemed to regress in maturity and cautiousness - Hermione was more secretive about her time-turner in PoA and Harry always used Muffliato since HBP, but they talk about everything under the sun in the presence of their children without any precautions.
- Harry being weirdly insensitive to his child - This is the guy who instantly forgave Snape, Dumbledore and wanted to give a chance to Tom Riddle for heaven's sake!
- Illogical time jumps
- Existence of child from Voldemort and Bellatrix around the same age of Harry's children - Just how did that happen? Did she drop from the sky?

Sorry for the rant! 😁
