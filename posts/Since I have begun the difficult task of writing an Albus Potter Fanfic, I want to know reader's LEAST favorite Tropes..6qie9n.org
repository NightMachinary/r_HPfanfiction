I have my own least favorite ones, such as the ol' Dumbledore is evil, Weasleys all suck (except Gred and Forge), Sex God characters, harems, No flaws characters, and of course, spelling mistakes.

Also, since it is fan fic, I will try to skip over explaining canon things to readers and only explain divergences form canon. (e.g. My Albus Potter is not a James Potter clone but a red haired wimp.

Not much of a surprise since you're writing a (mostly) canon compliant fic.

I'd recommend to keep in mind that you're basically writing original fiction in the HP universe. Plot is super important! Don't rely on the original characters too much, don't retread old plot lines, don't try to 'wow' the reader with lore that has already been established (magical portraits are now boring, come up with something new!).

Don't put a pensieve in the story just so that you can go back on your word and write a Harry/Ginny/Ron/Hermione/Dumbledore story. This is an Albus Potter story.

**** So what is your plot?

Relationship drama?

New Dark Lord rising?

Disorderly collapse of SoS?

Time travel to the past?

Dimensional travel to parallel universes, where things:

- went a lot better?
- went a lot worse?
- were Harmony?
- were another Fanfic universe?

***** Time travel to dad's first year, but I don't want to sort him into Gryf, so I think Slytherin will work better since it will put him in close proximity to Snape. But I have seen a million fics that describe Slytherin, so I think it might actually push the story away from Hogwarts, at least for a while.

On the other hand, the introduction of someone from the future should result in significant divergences right from the start, so I might push towards either an early volei rebirth or an alternative enemy, maybe lower stakes.

******* TLDR: Runic ritual gone wrong with water acting as a catalyst to dive between dimensions. Debating on whether or not to use it for multiple dives because it needs willing sacrifices and unwilling sacrifices.

Book begins in a prison break prologue. Some former death eaters, are plotting something as they rescue this essential individual. Why is he essential? Because he is going to bring back the Dark Lord and prevent Potter from meddling ever again. dun dun DUUUUN.

First chapter is slight HP7 epilogue rehash, but I throw in the fact that Harry has been training his kids in the art of occulmency by disguising it as meditation exercises to use when stressed (when you get nervous, just clear you mind etc., I hate occulmency learning montages) Everyone gets on train, we meet what seems to be a quad of post HP7 characters, (Luna's kid, Scorpius [Nod at Exile's portrayal of Malfoy change], Rose, and Albus) and everyone seems pretty chill and falls asleep.

The Second Tradition attacks the train, decoupling Albus' car from the front and back sections. They break in, seriously injure Rose and kidnap Albus. They go a short way away from the train. As Albus is coming to he sees that his attacker is not alone and has placed him in the center of a runic pattern carved by magic into the ground as they call for places next to a pond. They laugh about how appropriate and useful it is that this ritual will be fueled by Potter's own blood. His attacker starts to move away but Albus grabs him and manages to shove the attacker who was in a circle just outside the center into the center circle where Albus was. Another attacker in a white mask, a woman screams that the array is about to activate and to get out of there and into his place. Albus bites the man and manages to throw himself out of the center section and push the attacker into the same section just as it activates. As the array activates, translucent green walls form around the various places in the array trapping the attackers and Albus inside. Suddenly, a loud drone starts and the people on the edges scream in agony as they literally disintegrate beginning from their extremities ending with their faces, turning into red droplets like blood. As they vanish, there is a bright green flash as it goes off aaaaand nothing. The circle disappears into a cloud of green smoke and vanishes along with any trace of the attackers.

Harry arrives, Rose is actually okay and will join them at Hogwarts for the sorting while she gets squared away and the train gets a move on. Albus, in shock, does not say anything substantial to his dad, trying to be tough but is really scared. They get back on the train and it gets to Hogsmeade. The first years start to make the trip across the lake and Albus, still terrified and shaken is just staring at the lake. When he looks down, about halfway across, he notices his eyes are glowing red. This scares him and he jumps backwards, flipping the boat and causing some kind of reaction when he hits the water. There is a green flash like before and he feels like he is on fire for a few seconds as he flails under water and then gets pushed out of the water into another boat by the giant squid. He notices something is wrong when he and the other first years get off at short because the professor that met them to get them into the boats was NOT Hagrid, and now, it is. But that can't be Hagrid is in France with MadMaxi. What is going on??? Who is this old lady? Prof. Longbottom was supposed to meet them here. Shes gets to Albus and asks, "And who are you?" Albus then spots Harry and Ron and faints.

******** I have one suggestion: better use dimensional time travel mechanism to avoid paradoxes. Even better, you can introduce minor (or even major) changes in the new dimension just to raise the challenge level.

Al should be able to recognize McGonagall.

********* I am embracing the time travel as moving into an alternate dimension with differences, but I need to lay more groundwork in the early chapters if I am going to emphasize the differences.

And I am going back and forth on whether one of those differences is that McGonagall died shortly after HP7.

********** Al might not detect subtle differences though. For example, instead of a bumbling fool, Quirrelmort might decide to play a relatively competent DADA teacher. Or maybe Arthur Weasley's Muggle Protection Act failed to pass and Lucius Malfoy never saw the need to get rid of the Diary.

Since this is alternate dimension, Al has full freedom of actions. But he might need to spend some time to realize it.

** You should be writing the story you feel you need to tell. The one /you/ want to read but can't find. The one that is fighting its way out of your brain.

Writing to try and please other people is pointless. You can never please everyone and you'll end up with a generic clone of a gazillion popular fics. And you'll get bored with it and probably won't finish it.

But I daresay it will get plenty of reviews and they're always nice to have.
