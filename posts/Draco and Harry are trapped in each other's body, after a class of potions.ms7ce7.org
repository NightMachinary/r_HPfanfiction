#+begin_quote
  I remember that in a class of potions Harry and Draco had to make a polyjuice potion, then for some reason the effect does not go away and one in the body of the other begins to fight.

  Draco in Harry's body, knocks Harry unconscious in his body, Snape comes to think that Harry would not live and threatens Draco. (Draco thinks that if Harry dies, he will not be able to return to his body and decides that he should at least act like Harry while awake)

  Draco goes to the Gryffindor common room and finds all the Weasleys, but tries to be nice, then talks to Hermione and she notices something different about Harry in the way he was looking at her (obviously because it's Draco on the inside).

  Hermione had a little crush on Harry and thinks that different look meant something.

  One day later, Draco realizes that Harry's body will be taken to Malfoy Manor.

  Some events happen that cause Hermione and Draco (in Harry's body) to kiss.

  Later Hermione, as always, realizes that Draco is in Harry's body and they go on the adventure of getting Harry out of Malfoy Manor, because if the Death Eaters found out, they would kill him.

  Draco and Hermione get closer on the journey, and to hide they enter a closet and kiss, just so that Harry, already awake, discovered them, etc.

  They discover that Voldy is alive, a love triangle between Draco, Harry and Hermione, Lucius escapes, the Weasley twins and Ron are taken out of Malfoy Manor, Draco and Harry develop a kind of brotherhood.

  AND EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL (it's a trilogy, I remember then it gets better)

Anyway, I will not tell you more about the fic, I only remember that it was written by Cassandra Clare, thank you very much if you can help me.

** If it's by Cassandra Clare, it the Draco Series: Draco Dormiens... I cannot remember the names of the others. There are 3 total. Someone on here probably has a copy of it, since she took them down before she published the Mortal Instruments.

Edit: here is a link to Draco Dormiens: [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/43605063-draco-dormiens]]
