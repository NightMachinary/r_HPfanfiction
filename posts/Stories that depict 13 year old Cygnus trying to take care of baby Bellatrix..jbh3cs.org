*** That would be a twisted story. I was imagining more like a gypsy or old school royal marriage where his branch of the family was the more conservative one and since he was the first male born he was married from birth and had to produce an heir as soon as Druella had her first period.

******** The siblings look to be listed from oldest to youngest, suggesting Alphard was older than Cygnus but Walburga is the oldest. All of it is probably a moot point though-- JKR has said that math isn't her strong suit, and based on the general rating of the series, Cygnus's DOB is probably an error.

*** In one fic she was sleeping with the head of the family and he got her pregnant, so teenaged Cygnus was quickly married to her. So he was basically ridiculed for most of his life, as everyone knew the truth. Still gross, but a fraction less horrific

*** To be fair, she was accused of being a Satan worshipper as soon as the books started to become popular (that would be around POA).

**** An (accidental?) red herring against the series' christian message no?

Although considering Cygnus' marriageable age and the proclivities of various churches, maybe the christian message was embraced a /tad/ too strongly.

**** Yes..... Tom Riddle was born on Dec. 31st 1926.Cygnjus Black is listed as being born in 1938.

So Voldemort was in Hogwarts when Cynus was born.

** Quite an age gap too with Walburga and Cygnus being siblings. Apparently she was born in 1925? His parents could have a strange age gap or something as well, lots to play with there

*** Eh, wizards and witches live longer and it's not ... Uncommon for sibilings to have a large age gap. Mother's have a child as a teen and another when they're in their thirties to early forties.

I mean I think it's weird to have kids that far apart but it does happen
