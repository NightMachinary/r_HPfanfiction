I love Ron, I really do, and I hate when authors go out of their way to bash Ron. I don't necessarily blame the author, if they've seen the movies more then read the books, since Movie Ron isn't the greatest.

And if you're someone who watches the movies then read the books, your opinions of characters will be different, and stuff like that.

But upon saying that, it always seemed like when Ron did do something wrong; in canon, he never really had to apologize for one reason or another, or they accepted him back in because Harry was in a really tough spot.

Same with any other characters really, if they end up doing something wrong, I'd like to see them Apologize.

So, without bashing him, I'm looking for stories that maybe dive more into Ron's flaws, his insecurities about himself, his self esteem, and the like.

Maybe they put more emphathes on his family, if so it'd be curious if Ron talks to his parents or siblings, or certain siblings about it. I could see Percy being understanding, I could see Ginny getting where Ron was coming from, and stuff like that.

I'd rather not have any real pairing focused, but just in case:

I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

NO Harry/Hermione and no Draco/Hermione though.

NO Character bashing please, I know this kind of thing can get difficult, to write about, without bashing, but the less bashing the better.

NO OP Harry. NO Harem Harry. No Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor, et cetra.

Can be on any Site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.


** Well, this isn't exactly /Ron/ having consequences for his actions but I'd posted a prompt sometime back about the consequences of Ron leaving Harry and Hermione during the war. I received only [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/egtpoi/-/fcm4u0m][one response]] but you might like to read it.

Props for asking this, but your standards are way too high (and I mean this in the most sincere way possible). It's easier to bash or praise characters excessively rather than put effort into exploring their virtues and vices.

The best I can find is the Son of the Archer series, first book here linkffn(11230962) but it's a crossover.

*** I know, that, I really do; just a shame that too often people would rather bash a character, than explore their flaws, and maybe even help them grow.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
