All the super powerful Harry fics have him as some super genuis who is amazing at politics. I want a powerful himbo Harry who is very nice and sweet and uses his ridiculous powers to help the Wizarding word. Like, he fixes both Astoria's blood curse and the Longbottoms with a basic healing charm, he beats the second task by levitating all the water and creatures out it thr lake and walking to his hostage.


** I've seen the "levitates the lake" thing, but he wasn't a himbo there.

**** Can't remember the name. It was a one shot in which Harry discovers that just as the Goblet forced him into a contract, he can force others into giving up their magic to him.

** I would love this story if it was from the perspective of his love interest, who is pulling her hair out trying to shepherd Harry into where he needs to go to actually beat Voldemort and generally being the sole voice of sanity echoing gently on the inside of his empty head.

** I absolutely love this idea.

How does he beat Voldemort? Cast one Stunner at him that knocks out all the Death Eaters through the Dark Mark and puts Riddle into permanent magical stasis?

** It would also be cool if his good deeds have some negative consequences as well: by healing Astoria's blood curse, it just gets transferred to Daphne, by healing the Longbottoms, the Healer taking care of them is fired, by lifting the water from the lake he kills all the mermaids and grindylows.

******** He's six when it starts. I don't write nepi. And if it weren't fictional it would not count as consent.

I'm well aware that children can't consent in real life. I find children being sexually abused in real life horrifying. But this is fiction. I hope you know the difference between fiction and reality.

********** You're probably right. I shouldn't be so flippant about it. If someone read it and it upset them I would of course be more sympathetic but merely being upset that it exists is not something I can understand.

The thing people need to understand is that for me and for my friend, who helps come up with ideas for me to write, and likely for most of my readers...it isn't a case of us fetishizing children. My friend and I are both bottoms and when we read or I write fics about children we're putting ourselves in the child's place. The ones I write where Harry is in his late teens are much more disturbing to my mind because those can come across as if I'm advocating for that kind of behavior. Which I very much am not.

I get that it can be upsetting, I frequently make myself cry while writing my fics. I don't think that means they shouldn't be written however. This fic in particular as much as it makes light of the issue of consent in a lot of ways it also addresses those issues at several points.

If we had been discussing something violent no one would have felt the need to argue I shouldn't write something in which there is violence, yet that can be just as upsetting and just as revolting.
