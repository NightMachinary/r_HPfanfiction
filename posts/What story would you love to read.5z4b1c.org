What story have you always wanted to read, but no one has written yet?

A twist on a classic cliche? A parody of an overused challenge? A ridiculous crack-fic that you want to read but don't want to write? An interesting magical theory that you would like to expand on?

Hopefully we can share some ideas and maybe inspire some original stories. If anyone does write any ideas please let us know.

I've posted this thread a few times before. If you're interested in reading the previous threads [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3u2kqg/what_story_do_you_really_want_to_read/][here]] is a link.

*** More than that - personally I have hard time believing that dark evil person can have realistically a healthy relationship with anyone. Yet so many "dark" stories portrey characters as having big epic love with nonsense fluff and flirting all around. Such relationship would either be one-sided or really twisted. Healthy normal person doesn't throw cruciatus / AKs around like candy.

**** Theirs a reason that in Star Wars Sith who turn to the darkside for a loved one (Darth Vader as a good example) do it out of love at first but then do it because they are basically claiming ownership of something or someone, Padme was just someone that made Anakin feel good by the time he fully turned, even if you look at Darth Plagueis in his novel he "Loves" his test subjects but in a sick twisted sort of way, the same way Voldemort might "Love" his followers.

**** It really depends. Killing your enemies does not destroy your ability to love. Unless you go with the headcanon that dark magic twists your mind/soul and is not simply a tool using the killing curse is no different from shooting people with guns. And by your logic, not a single soldier would be able to love after the second World War but even SS members had healthy relationships when they were back home after the war.

Of course, a lot of people get traumatized by war but there are still those that kill and then go home to their family and life happily ever after.

Also all those writers seem to love the word Lord.. I wish someone would really write a believable story, why wizards hate muggles so much.. The hate goes back to the middle ages, so religion would probably be a very good reason and the views on emancipation of women (which are extremely recent in the muggle world).. or anything really .. a believable reason, maybe contemplating the faults of our society, while staying close to the characters, but turning everything around...

***** I even think Muggleborns' poor reputation was well deserved, for most of the history anyway.

Back in Salazar's days, most of them would be illiterate, deeply religious, ate with their hands, and relieved themselves wherever they felt like to. They were not going to leave great impressions with Purebloods.

In 1800, many of them were probably scandalized by the first female Minister of Magic who took office in 1798, and some of them might have asked a Shacklebolt (black) whether he was a slave.

In mid 1800s, Wizengamot removed beast designation for Muggles.

I believe as late as 1900, there were still large number of illiterates among Muggleborns, and many of them displayed strong signs of racism, religious intolerance, and sexism. Even though they faced significant discrimination in the Wizarding world, the Muggle world itself was still highly unjust, and the level of personal comfort in magical world was so much higher.

After the WW2 began, British Muggles have made significant social and technological progresses. So the level of sophistication of Muggleborns rose dramatically since then. But old experiences and impressions die hard, Muggleborns were continually treated badly. Some of these new Muggleborns (Lily, Hermione, Justin) would no longer put up with the crap anymore, very much to the astonishment of old purebloods who knew little about changes in the Muggle world.

I think it's really interesting because it seems barbaric on one hand ("you'd rob parents of their child? How cruel!") and yet better on the other ("why on earth would you let a magical child grow up, totally unaware, in muggle society?")

** - Magical colonization of the solar system / galaxy

With an influx of muggleborns who are well aware that humans were on the moon, and hear the talk about Mars colonization, I could see some of them thinking about doing it with magic. The big "oh shit" factor will be when that muggle Mars-Rover makes an HD picture of the humble 500 people colony, complete with forests inside huge glass-domes, beautiful architecture and floo connected to Earth, the magicals built while the muggles were pondering how to get humans up there in the first place.

- A fic dealing with Harry and Ron trying to woo Hermione.

I made a Request thread yesterday and found that this, in the form I'd want it, doesn't exist - or at least it seems so.

What I'd like to read is a fic with a focus on this rivalry for the affections of a girl, best case scenario one playing in all three POV's. Voldemort and the doom of wizarding Britain would have to play a siderole in this one. It would be interesting to see how the shyer, more introverted Harry would go about it. How would Ron try to overcome his conviction that he's playing second fiddle to Harry? How would Hermione deal with two awkward teenage boys trying to woo her? How does it strain their friendship?

You have to get the girl to agree to it, C. you have to somehow get past Harry and Ron's respective anger Issues and Jealousy Issues respectably, either way it doesn't really work out. That's the entire reason why romantic trio stories are iffy at best and garbage at worse, they ignore the issues that a relationship like that would face, it's like any Harem story in the fandom, they completely ignore the problems that come with having more than one wife or more than one lover would have such as anger, jealousy, hatred of the primary wife or favorite lover (because we are fucking human beings and can't love another equally and whoever tells you that they can /hint hint/ "parents" are fucking liars) and other problems like that then the story falls apart.

#+end_quote

Thats a bit cynical, and I feel also not true, at least from my subjective perspective. I wouldn't dare claim to know how other people love.

But in essence, I agree. The trio isn't exactly the prime set of candidates for a polyamorous relationship if we keep it 100% in their characters until the end of their lifes. /However/, this is fanfiction and therefore "doesn't really work out" can and will be ignored.

True, if a story like the one I proposed would end with the trio getting together, the trio would then face the fact that being a couple is hard enough, being a triple is even harder. Relationships are hard. Polyamorous ones are extremely so. Yet, its the ending, so what do I care?

Also, I think the comparison with Harems doesn't quite fit. The nature of a harem is a hierarchy forming towards a shared husband/wife. Polyamorous relationships base themselves on the assumption that any of the three (or more) partners love every other partner equally, and with an equal standing. There is no love required in a harem, but a poly-relationship only works with love. In some senses they're on completely different sides of the spectrum.

****** I agree. While there are examples of successful polyamorous relationships I don't think the trio could become one. Harry has no idea about love since he was deprived of it since Halloween 1981. And he has to save the world again and again.

Ron has his jealousy. And he constantly belittles Hermione. And the whole business with Lavender Brown shows how little he cares about her (until he nearly dies).

Hermione has her own luggage but compared to the other two she could potentially handle it after a while.

** Stories I always wanted to read are:

- A story that contains a pro Muggle-born terrorist organisation like the death eaters only that they target Pure-bloods who they consider inbreeds whom they fault for their shortcomings in society, even though most members only fail in society because they lack skills or are unable to adapt to a different culture. They also embody the worst muggle traits and judge wizards for lack of sexism and racism(based on ethnicity and religion). The organisation would consist of Muggle-borns and Half-bloods who either believe in those philosophies, want to gain power or have a grudge against death eaters and Pure-bloods. They would do good and bad. They would save Muggle-borns and muggles from death eater attacks. They would do stratigical strikes against death eaters. But they also murder the families of death eaters to show their powers. They would burn down businesses owned by families who support blood purism like the Blacks and the Malfoys and they wouldn't care if they killed a couple civilian Half-bloods and Pure-bloods in the process, because they believe they are doing the right thing. The existences of such a group is also a good way to make people who think they are good join the death eaters. Pure- and Half-bloods who lost people to this group would have a good reason to start to hate muggles and Muggle-borns and Half-bloods and Muggle-borns who lost people to death eaters would have a good reason to hate Purebloods. Death eaters would also have chance to look like they do the best for Wizards by attacking this group and saving people from them. It would be really interesting to see the relationships of characters suffer because they lost people to either of those group. You could see people at Hogwarts really change their allegiance because attacks of either of those groups. You could have Fred and George start to dislike Muggle-borns because Charlie died in a attack by the muggle-born group. You could have Neville hate Hermione because the group burned his house down with his grandmother inside. Dean and Seamus could start to hate Pure-bloods like Ron and Neville because their Parents were killed by death eaters. You could also have people like Hermione join them before they realize how violent they are (like Regulus Black). I would also give the Group a Leader who is just a little lower in skill than Dumbledore and Voldemort and have him pretend to be muggle-born while being a half-blood.

- A different story I would like to read would be about Voldemort punishing one of his followers by altering the mind of one their daughters( via potion, memory charms or Imperius curse) and use her to discredit Harry by having her adapt her personality so harry starts a relationship with her and has sex with her just so it looks like Harry raped her and he also has to deal with the guilt of having accidentally raped a girl he cares for and still has to convince the aurors and the public that it wasn't his fault, while he partially blames himself.

- A story about Dumbledore who realizes during the first rise of Voldemort that he cant hold back anymore and uses any power at his disposal. I am talking about a Dumbledore who becomes minister just so he can fully mobilize the aurors against Voldemort. I am talking about a Dumbledore who takes all children at of people he is reasonably certain are death eaters hostage. A Dumbledore who uses the Order of the phoenix to do morally questionable things that while necessary to win the war cant be done by the ministry because of ICW laws. And I would like to see Harry growing up in a World where this happened ,because of the prophecy Harry would probably still be the boy who lived but under different circumstances.

Hermione had someone like that in her organization in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), although she found out his acts and killed him. She also had to constantly reign in Dean and Seamus. Even with her restraint, Hermione's little group had killed hundreds of Voldemort's pureblood sympathizers.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), she overthrew the Ministry after it passed a tyrannical (and very unpopular) marriage law, and executed most of the ruling class. The Weasleys and Longbottoms were all terrified. Foreign pureblood regimes decided to intervene and the situation quickly degenerated into a pan-european war.

And here is a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5oaujt/lf_malcontent_muggles/dci2gx0/][plot idea]] I wrote before about a certain Muggleborn Dark Lord.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** An inverse-fic where Slytherin's are the main muggleborn house, and the other ones have been corrupted by Hitler-Esque rhetoric for the most part. I mean the general rhetoric around Slytherin's "They're the ambitious, and cunning ones" makes me think they would make some interesting parallels for Hitler's portrayal of the Jewish people, or at least could be movie into that. Maybe something where the Hufflepuff are where the workers come from, the Gryfindor's are where the military comes from, and the Ravenclaws are where the politicians and scientist come from. But Slytherin is where a lot of lawyer, and what the magical world would consider "criminal" element come from.

** Not that they don't exist, but I've never got much feedback when I requested any post-battle, canon compliant year at Hogwarts/Auror training fics where Ginny is hit on since Harry isn't around or vice versa. It just seems such an obvious storyline, yet despite the thousands of fics set after the battle, very few cover that plot.

Or even fics set while Ginny is in her 6th year and despite all the craziness with the Carrows, she is still asked out since she is single. It would be interesting, even as a oneshot of her thoughts on dating during that year. On one hand, she still loves Harry and with the terrors at school, dating is not such an appealing option. On the other hand, she could be especially lonely,she is single, and it could help protect her by promoting the idea she really isn't with Harry.

Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** - For some reason, I really want to see a story where Harry is actually gifted with music and uses it as a way to unwind from all his troubles. Then in the summer, someone from the Muggle world discovers this and offers him a recording contract, wanting to make him the next big thing in the Muggle world. Now he has to deal with fame from both sides.

- Harry with Dr Doolitle like talents.

- A good quality story where Slytherins aren't portrayed as the evil House.

- TeenDad!Harry would be an interesting premise to me. I have read a few, but I can't say I liked much of them. I mean, where the child is biologically his. Not by blood/regular adoption, not by him taking in Vernon and Petunia's kid who they abandoned because he/she showed signs of magic, not by taking /Dudley's kid/ (and yes, I've seen all of those before), but Harry actually having unprotected sex with a female in his age group (witch, squib or Muggle) and having to deal with the consequences, all while Voldemort is still out there.

- Harry spending more time in the Muggle world. Seriously. Can't get enough of these.

  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?

** I would love to read a story where I (the reader) am the main character, a Muggleborn in Slytherin who pretends to be a half blood from another country to avoid to much ostracizing, where throughout the years I see Harry and we are sort of friends and i tell him the truth of my blood status and i start secretly dating Susan Bones and tell her about my blood status and then at the end of the story, everyone finds out that I've been friends Harry (Ron might get pissed idm) and it's a sort of happy ending.

If someone wants to write this please do, I'd really appreciate it!

** A story where Voldemort creates Horcruxes then they get bodys and make more horcruxes. since we see that he can go up to 7 horcruxes So if he stops at that and then his horcruxes make more horcruxes etc until they get to the limit. So then there is somewhere around 100 (i think) Voldemorts running around. To make it more interesting and not just a fic where Voldemort runs around a lot perhaps have some Voldemorts be 'faulty'. Perhaps:\\
* Some decide to team up with the Order, probably more likely for the Diary ones since they are younger.\\
* Some decide they won't join the Order but will lead the muggleborns in rebellion instead of the purebloods.\\
* Some of them become shopkeepers.\\
* Some of the diary riddles go to Hogwarts.\\
* At least one Voldemort goes to Hogwarts and becomes a teacher.\\
* Some go exploring the globe.\\
* If you want to make it really cracky have some of them be different races, so we have a Goblin, Merfolk, Giant, House-Elf, Sphinx, or any other race Voldemort.

** I've thought of writing this, but never seem to get around to it. (Also, can't write for shit.) "The First Slytherin" - a fic following the first Slytherin sorted post war. I'd really like it if the character didn't know about Slytherin/War pre-sorting... Things I want it to explore: how does Slytherin handle the shifts in power post-war? Does their natural desire for influence change their politics (at least superficially)? How do the students handle having their parents dead/incarcerated. Are they hounded by the other houses for grieving family members? How do the older students handle having been on the losing side? Is there retribution for the casting of Unforgiveables on other students while under the Carrows? Did some of them feel coerced into doing it? How does that effect their relationships with the students who enjoyed casting them? How do they handle the inevitable Anniversary when everyone is essentially celebrating what could have been the worst day of their life (if for example they lost their parents) If there is a sort of "piling on" by the other houses, do the first years get bullied too? How does this "guilt by association" get handled? How do they feel about Professor Snape when it all comes out? Is he labeled a traitor to the cause? Do they honor him in anyway as a fellow Slytherin?

I always imagine this little eleven year old super excited to be learning magic at Hogwarts, being sorted, and the Great Hall falling silent. Upon sitting down at the Slytherin table an older student leans over and offers their sympathy.

Part of me also thinks it would be "fun" to have the student be an adopted orphan... Do the professors keep an extra eye on the student wary of a first year turning into another Dark Lord?

** I've spent years longing for a decent Sirius-centric fic that isn't het--most of the type either suborn him to Harry as part of the Raising Harry genre (linkao3(A Marauder's Plan) is a personal favourite but definitely has this issue), is too heavy on a style of humour that's not to my taste (linkffn(A Black Comedy), I couldn't make it through), or goes too heavy into OC stuff (linkffn(Black Bond)). linkffn(Promises Unbroken) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) are the only two I've found, and even the Unbroken Universe veers off into Sirius/OFC. A nice long fic about his recovery from Azkaban (and in an ideal universe, from surviving two wars where pretty much everybody he knew died) would thrill me half to death.

On a completely different note, I'd love to see one of those marvellously tropey 'Harry goes back in time and dates Sirius' fics where Harry is the more dominant partner. Sirius ALWAYS is the one taking charge, and I'd like to see a nice reversal of that. There are two whole books (PoA and OotP) about why Sirius needs a short leash, and so many writers elect to conveniently ignore that.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

A well-written Founders' story or a Peverall story, would be interesting. The Peverall story would be very fascinating if it followed from the creation of the Deathly Hallows to the deaths of all three brothers.
