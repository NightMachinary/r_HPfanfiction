** The whole HP fandom is a bit stagnant. Few authors are actually writing anything meaningful these days (It seriously feels like we get maybe one top tier story a year at this point), and it's mostly just the same rehashed stuff, or newcomers who are 10 years to late to the indy!Harry fad or Daphne fad. Like, if there was a story worth talking about, it would get submitted for review or into the AR thread, but the truth is that there just really hasn't been any in HP.

As for DLP, it seems more or less the same. Enembee does come around occasionally, but as I said before, it's not like there's a plethora of new fics to stick in the C2, and shit like For Love of Magic and Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is certainly not going to be it. The IRC has about the same amount of members as its had for years. Most people on the site have grown more interests other than HP.

** I will admit I wouldn't have even noticed DLP if not for Scryer. It alone justifies its existence and Scryer is even still actively developed. From what I see on gitlab, they are about to roll out fanfic recommendations soon

** DLP is following the general trend of the fandom... which is stagnation. I mean it was the strongest fandom for a long while, but it's been more than a decade since the last book. Fantastic Beasts did not revitalize the fandom, the way many hoped it would and the less said about Cursed Child, the better - some people insist that it works as a play but, well, like 0,001% of fans will have the opportunity to see it as a play.

There's FB: The Crimes of Grindelwald coming in November, but I'm not super optimistic. It kinda smells like G will be a run-of-the-mill, uninteresting, cookie-cutter villain - again with the re-hashed, tired, "pureblood agenda".

Entropy comes to all systems, sooner or later.

*** Grindelwald doesn't have a pureblood agenda though, right? He believes that wizards are better than muggles, which has some real substance behind it whether we want to admit it or not.

Random unrelated thought, but that's probably why they included a muggle to serve the purpose muggleborn Hermione did.

**** Well...

From the wiki article, premise:

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the first film, the powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander. But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: *to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings*.
#+end_quote

I really hope that whoever wrote that pulled it out of their ass, however I wouldn't be surprised if it's factual.

Edit:

On IMDB

***** I think purebloods are just the most susceptible to believe in his ideals as they have no ties to the muggle world but as far as I have seen he doesn't believe that purebloods are any more special than muggleborns or even magical creatures. "Magic is Might"

*** /Dark Lord Potter/, a non-reddit HP fanfiction forum. Most famous for their merciless-but-sometimes-efficient "Review Board" where prospective fanfiction writers can post their stories and get (extremely) blunt critiques thereof. Many classics of HP fanfiction, such as /Seventh Horcrux/, debuted on DLP.

***** every couple of weeks someone starts or joins a thread and calls Ron an asshole. The community then explains that Ron is a character with flaws and virtues and not really different from any teenager. I assume this person either did post there something like this or agreed with someone who did.

** DLP is going strong. You see fewer fics posted if you're not a member, because new stuff is posted in our workshop forum, and even then DLP isn't meant to be a fanfic hosting site--FFN and AO3 work perfectly well for that purpose. As for fanfic in general, our scope expanded beyond simply HP and beyond just fandom in general. We're an all-purpose forum now, although fanfiction remains a large part of what keeps members coming back.

The community is maintained by one of our veteran members who does it on his time, and notice the criteria: DLP 5-starred and Featured Authors. So if you want a fic to get in there, it needs to be by a DLP author (and our authors have enough self-awareness that they won't ask for a subpar fic to be included) or it needs to be highly reviewed in our Review Board.

*** That's what happens when the scope of a community expands beyond a single subject. I hear another HP forum is about to close down. Other sites come and go, and yet DLP is still around. I reckon we're doing something right.
