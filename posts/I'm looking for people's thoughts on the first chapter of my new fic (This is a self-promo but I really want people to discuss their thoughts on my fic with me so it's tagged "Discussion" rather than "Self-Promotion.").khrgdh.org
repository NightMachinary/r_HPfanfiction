  (I'm pretty sure the title means "Travel Through Time" in Middle Egyptian but I know nothing about the language nor the grammar...)

  In which Auror partners Harry Potter and Theodore Nott get sent a decade into the past and decide to make the best of it and save as many people as possible. (And use the situation to their advantage, of course. Harry was supposed to go into Slytherin, after all, and Theo /was/ a Slytherin for a reason.)

*(Please read my thoughts below* */after/* *reading my fic since it reveals spoilers. I'd really like to see what your thoughts are on this! Tell me what you like, what you don't like, what you think is stupid or super cliche, that sort of stuff!)*

I came up with this idea after reading a fic where Harry and Draco get sent back in time and become friends. Originally, though, I was planning on writing a fic that explores Harry working as an Auror with Theo, but I had trouble figuring out how to start it out that way. So, I started writing short scenes that eventually bled into the first chapter of this time travel fic!

It was a lot of fun figuring out how to write Harry's and Theo's characters in this considering it takes place post-canon but without the Epilogue or Harry Potter and the Cursed Child taking place, but also taking some ideas from both of those pieces of work.

I wanted to make Harry's power level and intelligence in this fic to be somewhat believable and so I came up with the idea of Harry becoming obsessed with travelling back in the past due to his grief but eventually getting really into spellcrafting, wardcrafting, and curse-breaking. Considering that Bill was a Curse-Breaker for Gringotts and he worked in Egypt, I thought it would make sense that Harry and Bill would eventually discuss their jobs, which eventually lead to Bill explaining some of the things he learned in Egypt and also the fact that Egyptians studied time travel.

This would have taken place before the Trio split up completely, but I figure that I'll have some mentions of Bill being a consult of a sort with the Aurors after he moved back to England for his family. This'll probably come up when Harry eventually has to deal with rituals and stuff, so it won't be the main plot point unless I want Harry to interact with the Weasleys a lot (which will only happen after fourth year).

One of the things I can't really decide how to deal with is when Harry and Theo take out Voldemort. I really don't want them to kill all of the Horcruxes and then Voldemort by fourth year because so many fics have done it and I want to make it at least a little bit difficult for them. I kind of want this to be a drawn-out fic and I don't want it to /just/ be a "fix-it." I want some actual plot and dealing with Voldemort and the Dementor attack after fourth year will lead to that. What are your thoughts?

Um, I /am/ going to include some tropes, but I'm going to try and not make it seem over-powered and cliche. I'll probably play around with Slytherin politics a little but I'm on the fence about whether or not I want a Slytherin king or queen and their court. I might just make it an unofficial thing and a vast majority of the politics will be forming future alliances and trading favours for when they graduate. I will be employing the "first and second years are considered children and their political blunders are forgiven but third year is the main year to make your moves" trope.

The Wizengamot and wizarding nobility is another thing I'd like to discuss and add to my fic. I won't make all of these purebloods uber-powerful people who are like "bow down bitches," but I do want to have them play a part in the story. I think that their titles will mostly be mentioned through old pureblood customs/traditions and the Wizengamot. Like, the Wizengamot is going to kinda be like hereditary parliament or something (I have no idea who British governments work, forgive me) and they govern Wizarding Britain. And if you want to pass a law or anything, it would be best if you are backed up by a Lord or Lady on the Wizengamot. (Like if Hermione wants to pass a bill for House-Elf abuse to be limited, then it would be best for her to be backed up by someone since she's a Muggleborn with no influence and connections.)

Harry /is/ going to be "Heir Potter" and "Heir Black" but I'm not going to make it so that Harry is immediately emancipated, a friend of the goblins, partaking in the Wizengamot in eleven, and inherits all of these vaults (though I /am/ considering the Gryffindor/Slytherin's heir thing, tell me what you think, I might just make it so Harry plays around with the Chamber of Secrets, who knows, maybe its empty and unfinished). The earliest Harry will be emancipated is during the summer after fourth year due to the Triwizard Tournament and the Dementor attack. I'm going to make some bullshit law about how if three forms of authority declare you an adult (i.e. The Wizengamot, a Ministry official, and Dumbledore) and you have at least five OWLs, then you're an adult or some such.

What are your thoughts on this?


** This sounds like a really good idea! The first chapter was fun to read, and I'll continue reading when it gets updated. I'd be interested to see how you handle the Harry/Theo relationship since I've never seen them interact properly in any fics before. Having the horcruxes last a bit longer sounds like a good idea; it's no fun if they get destroyed super easily, lol.

Having their reason for time travelling being more distressing/discussed could improve it, especially if it's expanded upon in later chapters.

Really enjoyed this chapter and can't wait to read more!

*** Thank you so much! I've actually just completed the second chapter if you want to check it out!

It's actually kind of a little darker than I anticipated (nothing gory, just mentions of child abuse and swearing), and kind of feels like a filler chapter so I'd appreciate your thoughts on it. I feel like I don't really further the plot much save for the latter portion of the chapter and it feels a bit rushed and surreal compared to the first chapter. The ending doesn't seem particularly good, either. It's also significantly longer.

Expanding on their discussion on time travelling will definitely be discussed in future chapters because not only does it explain more about Harry (not that you don't already have an idea as to why he wanted to go back in time in the first place), but it also reveals an event of Theo's past that Harry hasn't learned about yet. It will be the basis of explaining why Theo is how he is and why his childhood is comparatively shitty to Harry's. This will also further their personal relationship with one another. And although I haven't read Cursed Child and I don't like what I've heard about it, it will also tie in the mention of Theo in that book with him creating a time turner.

** Hi! I really liked your first two chapters. I love Theo/Harry pairings, so extra thanks for your fic :)

First question: will there be chapters from Theo's point of view? Or this will be only Harry POV? Or someone else?

Are you planning to write the whole 7 years or will there be time jumps? How many chapters will there be in specific years? I mean are you planning to drawn out all the years or will there be some that will get 1 or 2 chapters and the rest more? Like example the 4th year will be longer then the previously ones?

About the Horcruxes....I think you can systematically destroy them: the tiara will be the easiest, but only after the chamber fiasco and then of course the diary, the locket after 4th year and if Harry will be emancipated then he can access the cup as Heir Black.....

I have so many questions. Will Harry and Theo let some events play out the same as in the original timeline? Like the troll with Hermione, the diary with Ginny and Malfoy Senior, Sirius escape, Harry's competition in the Tournament? Umbridge? And Dumbledore? Is Harry going to hide his new persona? Or will he show that he can't be manipulated? Or just simple wait until he is emancipated? What about Snape? Will he finally end up in Azkaban? Because I would really like to read a fic where he finally gets what he deserves. After all he turned spy after the prophecy but before that he was a loyal Death Eater. Will he be punished for his crimes?

I have some more but I will let you answer these :D

*** Eee! Thank you so much for the comment! This got me so excited, lol.

For the first question, I do plan at some point doing some other peoples' point of view. The chapter I'm writing now, the third one, I actually originally planned to write in Theo's PoV but decided to go with Harry's. Other than Theo, I'm not really sure whose PoV I really want to do. However, I will probably only have either short interlude chapters with someone else's view on something (i.e. Dumbledore, Snape, Remus, and Sirius) that are only about a thousand words or so. I don't want to be one of those people who write a chapter that's all over the place.

I definitely plan on writing out the whole seven years! I plan to deviate from the original plot of the books in some spots so there will be plenty of different stuff (I forgot the word, lol) to read.

From what I can guess currently, the years will definitely be drawn out in some places while short in others. A part of first year will be short as I will skip a lot of the original plot for certain events, while other parts will be drawn out. This is because I actually plan to have Harry be Sorted into Slytherin. I know this is done a lot, but I really do want him to work with a lot of the Slytherins and to have a reason to be sort of closer to Theo. I also just want to play around with Slytherin politics, lol.

So, first year will probably (I am pretty much guessing for all of these, don't take them to be literal) be between 3-7 chapters, depending on how I write it second year will be around 5 chapters, third year will hopefully contain a lot of Slytherin politics so depending on how that goes it'll probably be at least 5-10 chapters long, fourth year is kind of a toss-up because we already know how much of that goes so it's between 3-10 chapters long, fifth year will contain /a lot/ of politics and Harry preparing for (or dealing with the after-effects of) becoming emancipated so it'll probably be around 5-10 chapters long, and sixth and seventh year are kind of uncharted territory for now.

The summers between the years will also vary in length. For now, I only really know how the summers before first year, after fourth year, and either before fourth or after fifth year will take place. Depending on how long the chapters are (usually between 3-5k words a chapter, though I'm dabbling in extremely long chapters), there will be at least one to two chapters a summer.

(So far, I plan for the summers to feature Harry and Theo discussing what they're going to do for the next year, what they plan to do with various Horcruxes, and them trying to find the ritual that sent them into the past in the first place. At least one chapter will even feature them travelling to a different country.)

This leads to your next topic: Horcruxes and the original timeline.

For the most part, I plan to let things run their course in the first few years with a few notable changes in the plot. Those will be based around Harry's Sorting into Slytherin (and his Sorting itself), of course. That conversation Harry had with Dumbledore at the end of second year will be fun.

I haven't decided yet, but I think I may end up having Harry leave the Diadem alone until second year. I'll probably have him stop by the Room of Requirement when going to get Ginny from the Chamber so he can destroy the Diary and the Diadem together. He'll probably just leave the destroyed diadem in the Chamber because I plan on having Harry explore the Chamber of Secrets later on.

Most Horcruxes will probably be gathered around fifth year. Slytherin's Locket will definitely be grabbed and destroyed when Harry goes to Grimmauld Place. So far, that'll be the Diary, Ravenclaw's Diadem, and Slytherin's Locket down, leaving the Gaunt Ring, Hufflepuff's Cup, Nagini, and Harry himself. The Ring and the Cup will probably be taken out at the same time since I plan on Harry getting into Bellatrix's vault and I don't want Dumbledore to die (no matter how meddling I make him).

I kind of debated on when to kill Nagini. There are two choices: Have Harry kill her in the graveyard or have Harry kill her when he gets his Horcrux removed. The first option, while the easiest, will no doubt piss Voldemort off to no end and he may end up getting paranoid enough to remove his Horcruxes from where they are and realize that half of them are already dead or are in enemy hands. I really don't want to tangle with that idea, so when Harry dies it is. I'll probably have Theo do it.

As for the events, pretty much all of them will be played out. Meaning, Hermione will be attacked by the troll (with Harry saving her), Ginny will be taken into the Chamber (with Harry saving her), Sirius's (and then Pettigrew's) escape will be the same, and so will the main course of the tournament. However, Cedric's not gonna die in this one and while I'm debating whether or not to have Harry get the Chinese Fireball to speak to Parseltongue in, I think I'm just going to have that be the same as well.

Fifth year is where we'll see a lot of changes. Harry /will not/ allow himself to be tortured by Umbitch. Not only will he be (and know) that he's the heir to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses, but he'll also be the /Lord/ to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses. How I deal with that, exactly remains up to debate, however. I might just have Harry ignore her or maybe he'll catch Umbitch carving out Tracey's and some first year half-blood or Muggleborn Slytherin's hand up and he'll get pissed or something.

Harry will also either be appointing himself a proxy for the Wizengamot, or he'll be attending the Wizengamot itself. Sixth year will probably feature Harry, Theo, Draco, and probably some others actually attending Lords and Ladies functions themselves.

For Harry's persona, he probably won't hide it for the most part since he's pretty much just a bit more cunning and quiet, but he'll also mislead Dumbledore a bit. He'll react to the mirror similarly (or even /worse/ in first year) and he'll play up not wanting to be like Tom Riddle after saving Ginny from the Basilisk.

He'll play along with some of Dumbledore's manipulations (such as staying with the Dursleys, but he's not going to deal with their shit and he'll be hanging out with his friends or taking a little trip to Egypt or Italy) for the most part, but he won't allow himself to be turned into a martyr. He'll probably begin to show that he's not fond of Dumbledore in fourth year because the man could've gotten him out of the Tournament, but he'll definitely ignore him during the summer after fourth year due to Dumbledore telling Harry's friends not to write to him (only his Gryffindor friends, mind, I may actually have Harry still be somewhat friends with Hermione and maybe even Ron, just not close friends) and then that little trick he tried to play on the dementors as well as ignoring him.

And for the Snape bit, I'm sorry to say that I really don't intend on sending him to Azkaban or being outed as an "actual" Death Eater. I just really don't know how to write that out and I feel like it won't go with my story. I plan on Harry being on at least cordial tones with him (though Harry will definitely give Snape some grief in the beginning), though I might have Snape realize Harry's being abused sometime and the relationship will play out from there.

(There's a fifty-fifty chance that Harry either acts cordial with the man as a strict student-teacher relationship, or Snape loses his bitterness over James Potter and they sort of not become mentor-mentee, but Snape kind of talks to Harry sometimes or he gives Harry some books for his search or something. Snape could be useful, who knows.)

Other than that, I'm not going to kill or imprison Snape. I /did/ say that this fic is kind of a fix-it and that includes as least deaths as possible.

I know it's a bit disappointing as I also tend to jump on the "crucify Snape" bandwagon half the time, but I feel like that won't fit in and that Harry and Snape being cordial to one another will definitely be useful in the future (possibly for antagonizing Sirius, who knows).

Thanks for letting me rant this out, lol. The reason I asked for people's thoughts and questions in the first place was to actually help me plan out my fic and work out what will happen in it, so your questions are very helpful!

(Also, now that I think about it, I may end up writing a different fic to post when this is done about pretty much the same plot with a few changes, but instead with Harry in Gryffindor, him not pushing away Ron and Hermione at the end of the series, and Draco being his partner instead. I already had the idea bouncing around in my head, but your question or whether or not Harry will hide his true personality is making me itch to write it. I'll just continue with the two fics I'm already posting, though, lol.)

And since I really like working this out, you said you have other questions?

**** Thanks for the answers :D Here are some more questions: Will they figure out who send them back? Or that answer will be lost because they already changed the future so it won't be necessary to send them back again? So that group identity remain a secret for good? Or knowing Harry's curoisity he won't rest until he figures it out. Are they going to tell someone that they are from the future? Draco or Blaise? Or even Sirius? Probably not Sirius, he needs to heal a lot to be trusted I think. And here is my other question: what will they do with Sirius? I mean when will Harry help him get a proper trial? After 4th year? After all he will be the Lord to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses. So he can use his power in the Wizangemont to exonerate Sirius. I think you should use the proxy idea, it will give Harry more time to his other activities. Okay, I understand why would you want Snape to remain close, but please give him a little hell after what he did in the previous timeline, the bullying, the mindrape, his obsession with Lily (that is creepy!) and his treatment toward Nevill. I think that's it. You answerd most of my questions :)

***** Since my reply apparently didn't go through, I'm going to answer them again, lol. 😭😭😭

I haven't really decided whether or not Theo will find out who sent them back in time. I think that the closest they're gonna get is them figuring out what the ritual was and that there's no "undo" button for it or whatever. (And I just got the idea, but I may write it that they were possibly sent back via Unspeakables? Or perhaps a group that talks to the Gods---hel/lo/ Master of Death shenanigans!---and that the thing won't happen now that they "fixed" everything. Like, the ritual only works or whatever if one of the people is also a God or deity or extremely powerful---cough, Harry, cough---themselves.)

I was originally planning on them not letting anyone in on the secret, but when I wrote this out the first time, I actually had the idea of both Draco and Blaise figuring out. Basically, Harry's going to form some sort of Marauder group with the two of them and Theo (but they're not really going to act like the Marauders, it's just the fact that there the four of them seem to be close-knit reminds the teachers---Remus in particular when he comes to teach---of James and them). Blaise is pretty much going to find out between the summer of second year and the summer after third year. Basically, Harry and Theo are going to Greece because they heard of some guy who collected time travel shit, and someone (probably Harry) will leave a book on time travel out and Blaise will make---correct---conclusions. Draco will probably find out either during fourth, fifth, or sixth year.

Remus and Sirius finding out is up for debate. You're correct when you say that Sirius is going to need some sirius---pun most definitely intended---therapy and mind-healing. He's pretty immature and he relies way too much on Dumbledore for my tastes. (Regretably, this isn't going to be one of those fics where Dumbledore knowingly leaves Sirius in Azkaban. It just wouldn't fit in with the slightly-meddling! and not-evil!Dumbledore.)

Which leads to your next question: When is Sirius going to get a trial?

Well, I pretty much answered that in the other reply. Harry is going to get super into politics around fifth or sixth year, so that's when Sirius is going to get exonerated. Whether or not he picks up the mantle of Lord Black remains to be seen. Harry isn't going to like leaving Sirius in hiding because he remembers what happened last time that happened, but he can't really get Sirius an immediate trial unless he wants to show his hand too early. To pretty much stop Sirius from getting stir-crazy in a Black-house-shaped-Azkaban, he's going to convince him to pretty much take charge. He isn't going to let Mrs Weasley take charge of Sirius's house (and throw away all of that knowledge!) and he's not going to let the Order/Dumbledore boss Sirius around. He'll just tell him to transfigure himself a collar and to run around as Padfoot like a dog who got off-leash.

I pretty much plan to use the proxy idea. I'm not sure who's going to take up being Lord Potter, but Andromeda will most likely be the proxy for the Black seat. At this point, Harry will be on decent terms with Lucius and Narcissa, but he won't put them in danger by having Narcissa be the Black proxy while Voldemort's up walking around.

Snape's definitely going to be given a little hell. I'm not really sure if I'll let him in on the secret, but Harry's definitely going to enjoy subtly making him hate himself just a little more. Probably just things like him acting super uncomfortable with him (because Harry will be super uncomfortable because of the mind-rape and death thing) and perhaps even flinching and Harry making innocent comments that show his abuse.

Since I want Snape to be somewhat forgivable, I'm not really going to have him be obsessed with Lily. I'll have him love her, no doubt about that, but the way he'll actually view her is as a sister. Everyone just /thought/ he loved her romantically. How Harry discovers this is by two ways; Harry and Snape eventually become close (like I mentioned in my previous response, or Harry visits Godric's Hollow and finds some of his mum's journals that have letters from Snape between the pages---with him calling her "Sister."

I'll also have Harry be befriending Neville (he was still good friends with him after everything was over and since Neville's really good at herbology and has his own gardens with really good herbs, so Harry will defend his friendship with the boy as tutoring lessons and him getting fresh potions ingredients since some Slytherins will see that friendship as weak), so he'll try to get Snape to lay-off him.

Hope that answers any remaining questions!
