*** That's canon. The poem calls him “the hero who conquered the Dark Lord.” Voldemort and his Death Eaters called him “the Dark Lord.” The good guys called him “Voldemort” or “You-Know-Who.”

*** He wasn't /possessing/ her (remember that Harry had had the Diary since a few weeks after Christmas), but the influence of the diary on her thoughts is undeniable as pointed out by [[/u/MTheLoud][u/MTheLoud]]

** Love it! But I'm gonna go ahead and say this doesn't have to be an AU. In fact, I'm gonna just store that away as Head Canon.

At the very least, George somehow manages to give a speech at the wedding and recites it then.

** I don't have this, but I have Harry and Ginny making fun from this poem in “If You Can Help Her by witowsmp” linkffn(2788096) (one of the most sane and least offensive soul-bond stories out there).
