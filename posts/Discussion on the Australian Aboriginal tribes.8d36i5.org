It was just an idea that popped in my head, considering the Australian aboriginals is the oldest living culture alive today( considered to be 40000-60000years old) I would imagine they have knowledge of some much magic. Though they didn't write anything down, they had the Dreamtime which gives the knowledge of existence and many other things so I would imagine that the Dreamtime would be a way to preserve the magical knowledge that each generation of aboriginals learnt, making them an insanely powerful group of tribes full of the oldest known types of magic and more. Also I would believe the parseltongue ability would be almost sacrosanct considering the aboriginal deity is the rainbow serpent(a giant snake with a lot of ability's) and the amount of snakes native to Australia. Any thoughts about this and anything to add? It would be an interesting part for a fanfictionabout the main character learning the worlds magic and I would imagine aboriginals would be the best to learn from.

See this is very iffy for me. Firstly we have no proof that older magic is better than new. Old curses are more dangerous if their counter-curses are forgotten but that doesn't mean that on the whole old magic is objectively better. It seriously undermines the value of the research and devlopment of modern witches and wizards. It was one of Slughorn's students that created the Wolfsbane potion after all, it wasn't some ancient manuscript.

Another stumbling block for me is meshing together the idea of super powerful Aboriginal tribes and what happened to the Aboriginal population. The Statue of Secrecy was signed before Australia was being colonised. The Aboriginals wouldn't have to have signed or agreed to it. For a people you say are '/insanely powerful/' what happened in Australian history doesn't line up well. Once they learnt what was happening shouldn't they have expelled the Europeans and hidden the whole continent somehow?

An alternative if you prefer is that they're more in touch with abstract magic concerned with nature. That they had mastered living in their environment to an extent that they never branched out into other magics. Give them their own niche sure, but claiming them to be insanely powerful based on their age alone doesn't work for me.

This is basically what I came to say. Why would super-powerd Indigenous Australians' allow invaders to basically conquer their land?

The only way it works is if the community of Indigenous Australians magicals built a city/state and shrouded it from the world and just lived there, not expanding in any detectable way.

Things to note: * There are a [[https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/aiatsis-map-indigenous-australia][lot of different tribes and languages]], some common culture, some not

- The people I've met have had a respect and knowledge for nature and the land that makes me feel pretty shallow [so, yeah, herbology, magical creatures]

- Most of the people I have met have had a fairly mischievous sense of humour

- Some scary shit goes down

- I reckon that they are amazing polyglots - before invasion, they would have spoken maybe 3-5 languages and now many of them speak a couple of languages plus English. Given the lamentable state of language education in Australia, that puts them ahead of most of the anglo part of the population.

One of Australia's best song-writers Neil Murray has a song about one of the last of the desert nomads to come in from the desert - check out the [[https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Neil-Murray/Clever-Man][lyrics]] - a little bit of the flavour of a clever man.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Their numbers would be so low that it's questionable whether their society could continue much longer. Britain yields 20k witches and wizards out of 56 million inhabitants. Even taking the wars into account, that would give you very low numbers for any native magical society. As in 1000 at most. That's probably the size where inbreeding becomes a concern.

*** 20,000 magical humans to 56,000,000 normal humans? That's only around 357 per million.

The estimated population of native Australians before European visitors may have been less than a million...but they probably wouldn't have had as much of a cultural stigma against magic, so any muggleborns (or whatever they call Muggles in Australia) probably got to...you know, breed a lot with non-magical humans.

*** How would that school work? There are 20000 magical inhabitants in Britain, which gives you a Muggle/Magical ratio of roughly 1:3500. Australia has 24 million inhabitants, most of European descent. That gives you a total below of 9000 witches and Wizards in Australia. There are ~600000 aborigines, giving you not even 200 magicals. That would be not even 20 students in the Hogwarts age. Harry's year alone had 40 students.

Any kind of magical school would have been built by Europeans and would still be significantly smaller than Hogwarts.

** With wizards being so rare, and with Australia only able to support a limited amount of aboriginals, I doubt they had much of a 'magical society.' You are looking at having under 500 wizards on the whole Australian continent. They were probably integrated with the various tribes and treated more as a shaman/healer/one who communicates with gods, etc. They probably cared less if someone was 'muggleborn' or 'pureblood' and instead it was more like the kids who had powers were 'touched by the gods'.

These numbers would plummet when Europeans arrived as well until there was enough Europeans to recoup the loss of population. However, these people would bring their western magic, the wand. Australia would probably be very 'western educated' with wands with a hint of aboriginal presence and a few sticking with the old ways.

I would imagine North America would suffer a very similar fate (but to a less degree). Each branch of the tribe would treat their magic users differently, some with honor, some with curses and more. There wouldn't be a 'wizarding world' of North America until after Europeans came and the separation between worlds began. By this point, Native American Wizards numbers would have plummeted due to disease (even if Wizards were immune, muggles were not, and thus had a much smaller chance of a wizard being born). You would end up having some wizards adapting to the West, others working with other tribes to find a sanctuary, while others fighting the Europeans.

I would say there is a much stronger presence from Natives in North America compared to Australia but it is dispersed. My personal belief is there are hidden areas of native wizards who do things there own way, and somewhat peacefully exist with their European counterparts.

South America though... That is a way different story. In my headcanon, only Brazil has 'European magic' but it was never able to combat the influence in the Amazon, Andies or Central America. One main reason is that their populations were larger (thus more magicals) as well as having a more organized system that had them have a separate magical world. Thus, the Aztecs still exist as a magical nation, while the Mayans are a much of city-states constantly in conflict with each other.
