JKR basically wrote Harry as Wizarding Jesus, so why not go on step further. Horcruxes are supposed to be re-integrated by remorse, so Harry Talks Voldemort into Remorse, and all the Horcruxes are gone. Can then proceed to be Trialed and whatever else. Heck, if Orochimaru, who is basically Ninja Voldemort, can be redeemed/forgiven after Talk no Jutsu, and Obito that almost caused the end of the world can be forgiven, then why not.

No pairing, because Voldemort is like 70 in the Final Battle, and a 70 year old x 17 year old is creepy regardless of gender.


** I just want to point out that Harry is not even remotely close to being known for his talk no jutsu skills, and that carrying over the moral standards of Naruto to Harry Potter just doesn't work.

Orochimaru and Obito get kind of forgiven, but this is a world where torturing for information is standard procedure and parents are glowing with pride if their 8 year old has proven capable of slaughtering career soldiers. Those are the morals of the /good guys/.

That being said, I don't know any fics like that. Good luck.

*** It was mostly a joke at the amount of "Dumbledore used Forgiveness: But it failed" Style fics where Dumbledore forgives everything but fails. I wanted to see a fic where Harry talks Voldemort down and succeeds.
