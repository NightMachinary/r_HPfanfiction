Like, imagine their reactions to things from canon.

"WHY IS HE GOING TO /PETUNIA?!"/

"Where are all our friends? Why isn't Remus checking in on Harry?"

"Why did he send /Hagrid/ to introduce Harry to all this? Why not one of the teachers?"

"I'M GOING TO KILL SNAPE!" (This one is probably Lily when she sees how Snape is acting towards Harry, just because he looks like James)

"Why can four eleven year olds beat the security around the Philosopher's Stone?"

"Why did Dumbledore hire this incompetent moron?"

And /so on/.

Not really them reacting to the dangerous stuff (although, some of that), but more of them spending their afterlife questioning everyone's decision making abilities (and cursing Snape (and later Umbridge)).

*** Yeah, that'd be fun to read. Because, /really/, Lily would have no love for Snape when she sees what he's doing to Harry/how he's acting in general.

Snape's a dick, and I don't think Lily would hesitate to call him out on it.

I nearly feel sorry for him when he gets to the afterlife. /Nearly/.

"Chocolate frogs? Well that's just poor taste."

I just thought that Lily and James would have a /lot/ to say about some of the decisions in canon (see: my list for first year/Lockhart). But a more general comedy would be fun as well.

** As characters die, James and Lily take the opportunity to make their opinions known more directly, though at least Sirius (and maybe Cedric, if he wants to stick around) ends up joining them on the couch, while Quirrell is left in a state that's never shown but fits in a remarkably small box, whimpering and occasionally saying that he's terribly sorry and this is all just a big misunderstanding.

** There is a fic that kind of has this. A nonmanipulative Dumbledore takes the place of a manipulative Dumbledore in another world.

It had omakes at the end of each chapter where Manipulative Dumbledore is forced to watch nonmanipulative Dumbledore change the world while James, Lily and a few others make comments on the side.

***** It has never really shown that the wizarding world carries the same homophobia as muggles of the time. Yes they're muggle-phobic and discriminate against other species, but weirdly enough they seem to be more fine with intermarriage with other species than muggles were of interracial marriage in the 60s and 70s, and have been for a long time.

For example, Fleur's veela grandmother, Hagrid's giantess mom, Flitwick has a goblin ancestor, etc. And while some interspecies stuff raised eyebrows (like Hagrid's mom) and some experience social discrimination because of it, it wasn't punishable by any means.

****** Not only that, but when compared on prejudices that were historically prevalent on the time the WW surprisingly comes up as very open-minded, I think the greatest exemple of this was in Fantastic Beasts where the president of the MACUSA during the 30 was a black woman, but in the original series there are still cases like Amelia Bones being head of the DMLE which is regarded as a high-rank position or even (ironically enough considering how bigoted she was) Dolores Umbridge being the Minister's Undersecretary which seems to be also a high position since she had a vote on Harry's trial, the authority to send Dementors after people and was trusted with so many secrets and authority.

****** Yet you still don't get any gay couples. I know JK tried to make everything more appropriated to our times when she made Dumbledore all of a sudden gay, but her attitude towards the trans people that came to surface last year should indicate that her mentality is more traditional when it comes to relationships. So... yeah, I'd tend to think that a heterosexual couple in the Harry Potter timeline and even some gay people would still keep a closed mind towards the possibility of a gay couple. I do not condone that but claiming that they should have been accepted by those people in that time is just as ridiculous as the complaint that Game of Thrones didn't have more black people.

******* I kind of just assumed their absence in the story is because Harry is the POV character, who had a muggle upbringing, and he really just is 100% oblivious about relationships anyway. Any same sex couples around canon Harry likely wouldn't even register on his radar unless he literally walked in on them snogging. I mean, Harry didn't even realize one of his best friends in the world was dating Viktor Krum until she debuted at the Yule Ball. He didn't even know she had a date until she turned Ron down.

Regarding Dumbledore being gay, as I was reading Deathly Hallows I was honestly baffled when it got to Dumbledore's back story and the parts about him getting in that huge fight where Ariana was killed, then sparing Grindelwald and refusing to commit to stopping his reign of terror early on. The only thing that made sense in my mind was that they had an intimate relationship at some point and Dumbledore still was pining over him or something, but JKR had never once hinted at his sexuality either way before that moment. Aside from maybe his fabulous fashion sense, but I also figured that might just be an elderly wizard thing. When she said, "Oh Dumbledore is gay" years later, my response was "THAT GRINDELWALD JUNK MAKES SENSE NOW!". I really, really wish she had included some other subtle hints along the way in the other books though. Or maybe just had Aberforth straight up tell Harry, because it's not like Aberforth filtered anything else out of his story which might have been private or cast Albus in a negative light.

********* Yeah that bit about Aberforth was pretty yikes.

The first time I read through Deathly Hallows I just couldn't wrap my mind around Albus not wanting to kill or at least stop the goon that made his little sister dead at the first opportunity. The only way it made sense was if Grindelwald was equal or greater in importance to Albus than Ariana was.
