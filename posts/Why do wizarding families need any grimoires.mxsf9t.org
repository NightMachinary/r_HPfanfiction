They have all the necessary spells conveniently gathered in the Standard Book of Spells series, so why do the fanon version of all the ancient and "noble" families have grimoires when all it takes in fact is a trip to Flourish and Blots?


** Because spells aren't something fixed, from what I gathered you can create new ones and develop other ones. Take Snape's potions book in exemple, the "Mufliato" is very useful, and "sectumsempra" dangerous. It would definitely help him in a fight.

You can also create potions, write tips, how you created an object (Dumbledore's deluminator in example) So I guess a Grimoire is a way of passing down your knowledge, and inventions to you children and grandchildren and keep them in the family. "Mufliato" is useful, but if everyone knows it you can't listen on them. "And imagine people using sectumsempra against you?

** Chemical factories make chemicals that aren't made in high school chemistry class, manufacturing plants use designs that aren't taught in high school shop class, etc. I wouldn't assume that all the spells that one might ever want are taught to teenagers.

There must be more complex magic somewhere. Why wouldn't it be written down in family grimoires? The Ollivander family, for example, knows things that aren't taught at Hogwarts. There's no standard book of wand making that all the students buy for the mandatory wand making class.

** From the fanfics I have seen this in its always spells made by the family (that no one else knows about). In a few it was also spells only their family can do (some by blood others by name).

** I'd honestly be surprised if old families didn't have some sort of grimoire. I mean the Standard Book of Spells would certainly not contain all known spells, particularly considering that the vast majority of spells that we've heard are either faux latin or greek. Considering how many languages that exist, both living and dead, and how many cultures that magic would flourish in, the Standard Book of Spells would probably just represent the basics.

That doesn't mean to say that spells found in Grimoires are necessarily better than those found in standard books and education, but I'd be surprised if some inventive magical didn't invent their own spells or variations on spells and recorded them somewhere.

** Because if a family has been involved almost exclusively in a certain trade or particular field of magic for generations, chances are that that particular family will be a lot better than anything that's considered standard.

Just as you'd expect Ferrari to make cars that cannot be compared to your average Hyundai, you can expect someone like an Ollivander to know more about wandlore than any book in a school or a shop. And if generations of Ollivanders were to codify their knowledge as a grimoire, why wouldn't it be superior to anything else out there?

** Family grimoires in fannon and most any series that uses them are like a family cook book. Sure you can use that generic, store bought cook book, or you can use an instant mix kit to make some cookies. But wouldn't you rather use the recipe that was made by your great×6 grandmother and passed on, tweaked, and improved by every generation afterwards? Grandma's cookies are the family grimoire, not too special at first but unique and more improved by each generation that builds on its foundation.

*** I guess that's where my question stems from. Sure my great-grandma's cookies might taste good to me because I grew up with them but for anyone that's not used to them, they might taste like shit. If you want a real-life example, just watch Kitchen Nightmares, particularly when it involves an Italian restaurant, where so many 'chefs' claim to be using their grandma/mom's recipe and they have 0 success. At least something that has been standardized and approved for public use must have met certain standards.

**** What I'm talking about is grandma makes cookies using her recipe and they're ok but tastes good to the family because they are grandmas cookies. Grandma's daughter then goes on and periodically throughout her life experiments with different ingredients, preparation methods, cooking techniques, etc. By the end of HER life the recipe has changed and now the cookies are good but taste great to family. Her daughter repeats this and now the cookies are great but taste amazing. So on and so forth on and on and on again each generation the recipe produces better and better results objectively not just because you grow up with them but because of the countless generations of refinement and advancement. A wizarding world example would be a family that really likes plants. So they start cross breeding specific plants to make super plants and inventing new spells to make the process more efficient and produce better results. 10 generations later the have successful produced multiple unique species of plants and at least a dozen unique, powerful, and most importantly proprietary spells that deal with plants. Now if you want to get one of those plants or need magical help tending a beloved plant of yours then you need someone from that family and they get to charge whatever they want for their assistance.

** Because it's the “Standard Book of Spells,“ not the “All-Encompassing Book of Spells (Now With Self-Updating Pages!).”

It‘s for standard spells, like the cleaning one or whatever. Secret spells that families have, and they always do, would be in the family book.

** The spells in fanfiction grimoires are above the average Standard Books of Spells list. These are strong spells created from scratch by that family to suit their traditional needs while being tailored to be used only by family members. This helps them get an advantage in their field. For example, Neville creates a spell that speeds up the growth of magical plants like Mandrakes without harming them. So, he can now produce Mandrakes faster and cheaper than anyone else. As a result, he would put the spell in the grimoire to prevent another family from getting them and taking away their advantage

********** Neither do Care for Magical Creatures or Divination. Actually I think the whole reason the electives are electives is because none of them require you to use actual magic (except maybe for Divination? but even that relies heavily on interpreting signs). You don't need magic for Muggle Studies, Arithmancy mostly deals with numbers and Ancient Runes was always like a foreign language in my mind.

****** Arithmancy being necessary for spell creation is fanon.

The book says it's used in divination. That's it. While I like the idea of adding more, as far as we know it's not necessary canonically.

******* Arithmancy is heavily based on our practice of numerology. It could be that it's also a form of math but personal theory is that it is mostly the science (or whatever it is) of finding a relationship between numbers and the magical behavior of something. I won't deny that there could be some relationship between it and spellcrafting but it's definitely not a programming language for magic.

** In Canon, you would be absolutely why, which is why "Family Grimoires" are not a thing there and people just learn forbiden spell by raisind the Restricted Section of the library, as civilized people.

In Fanon, the "Family Grimoire" are usually an excuse to give the MC (or others character) some "super spells". As an example, I remember a fic where, while some people use the "/Patronus Spell/" like plebians, the Potter family (or at least some members of it) could use the "/Patronus Knight/" who could also directly attack people. Is there anything more metal/ stupid that breaking someone bones with a representation of your joy?

Also unrelated but not EVERYONE gives them overpowered spells. For example the Blacks have a spell that can tell with much more accuracy the acruel of a life debt and how strong the debt is. There is a standard spell for this but it lacks showing how strong the debt is, which fits thematically because the blacks would not want to give someone more than they are owed as a matter of family pride. In my fic Narcissa is the one who uses it, but she was once a Black so it fits

** Same reason people still hold on to their tapes and CDs even though you can listen to almost everything on YouTube or Pandora. While this or that spell is easily and commonly available, it's always good to have a backup, or just an old copy you happen to like. Also, perhaps some of those spells in grimoires are personalized or uncommon. I sincerely doubt that a borderline dystopian government like the Ministry of Magic would allow the Entrails-Expelling Curse to be printed in a students textbook or everyday guide; such things will be found in restricted books accessible only to those in the know, or recorded in privately held collections from when such things were not regulated.

Also, there IS some canon basis for private spells invented by people not affiliated with textbook writers. Sectumsempra, invented by Snape, is probably only written down in Snape's private notes. There are other spells that Snape seems to have invented as well, ones that I doubt he bothered to publish in a scholarly article or register with the Ministry. Luna's mum is referred to as a "spell crafter", and presumably would have kept notes of her research, up to and including a private "grimoire" of completed spells that had not yet been publicly disseminated.

** The Standard Book of Spells is a schoolbook. It teaches the basic spells used in everyday living. Think of it as containing things like how to tie your shoes and tell time --- the things everybody teaches their children. Grimoires would have advanced, proprietary spells developed by family members, and protected so that only they know them. Think of it as a patent. If you want this spell, you have to contract with the family that owns it.

(Or, in a Hermione-bashing fic, it's to keep muggleborns from attaining knowledge that purebloods hoard. Because information that I don't own should be free.)
