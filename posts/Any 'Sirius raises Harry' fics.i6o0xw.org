  Sirius chose to raise Harry instead of taking off after Peter. He just really, really wishes that people would stop telling him how to raise Harry.

** A personal favourite is 'The Wise One' trilogy by FarenMaddox. Essentially, Sirius escapes Azkaban when Harry is Eight years old and kidnaps him, then go on the run and Harry grows up with Sirius while travelling the world. They do come back eventually, though I can't for the life of me remember when or how (it's been awhile since I've read the entire thing - it's a little under 500,000 words across all three stories), so there is some Magical Britain in the plot. :)

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.
