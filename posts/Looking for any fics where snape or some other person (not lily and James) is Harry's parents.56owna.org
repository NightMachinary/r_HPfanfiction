** I've read a fic where Harry's true father was a OC brother of James Potter and a couple where Sirius was the father (both cases were biologically, James used a blood adoption Potion)

Plus there was the one where the parents were Molly and Arthur, with Harry being Ron's twin brother and James kidnapping him at birth, Lily not knowing about him.

*** Do you know the name of the one where Harry is Ron's twin? That sounds strange but interesting.

** If you like Snape being Harry's biological father, but not knowing it, then there are two good stories I have read with that theme.

"Digging for the Bones" - warning, deals heavily with abuse, although not by Snape. "By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept " - Petunia-centric, AU. A quite new take on Lily too.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
