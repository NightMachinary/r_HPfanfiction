I'm kinda tired of reading grimdark!Harry Potter, a morally ambiguous wizard who does what he wants, hurt people, in a dark world that is full of violence & pain & hurt. This has been the trend lately, especially with Harem!Harry fics, but even with a single pairing, I've been seeing it pop up and i'm kinda tired of it.

​

The closest I've seen to a hopepunk story would be "A Marauader's Plan" by CatsareCool, but even then, I'd think that'd be a stretch.

​

So any recommendations. Not a fan of slash or bashing Hermione. But other than that, I'm open.

because I was fed up with what you are describing. I mean, grimdark has its place in dystopias, but not everything has to be one. The result is a lot of sickly sweet fluff concentrated in a oneshot, but that's what's on the other end of the spectrum of grimdark.

Also, how do you feel about characters who try to be evil but end up doing a lot of good by accident? Reluctant Sidekick has a pair of stories which go down that route, and both are hilarious.

*** hopepunk is the opposite of grimdark, and its not meant to be a sickly sweet, but more that good can win and things can get better: it just requires someone to step up and do the right thing. I've seen it as more the idea of superman, a character whom embodies what it means to be good, even when things get hard. It's focus is on hope will overcome the darkness that exists.

​

but thanks! i'm looking forward to them and hopefully they are what i'm looking for

I believe "noblebright" is the actual term used to describe something that is opposite of grimdark.

How is "things are shite, but they might get better if we do the right thing" the opposite of "conveying the sense that our own world is a "cynical, disillusioned, ultraviolent place""? (first definition Wikipedia gives).

I'd say that on a scale from "everything is shite" to "everything is sunshine and roses", both are towards the shitty end. A modern fairytale would be the opposite. A Romcom maybe. Or copious amounts of fluff.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.
