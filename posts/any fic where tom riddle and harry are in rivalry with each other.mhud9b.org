*** that was good! I generally hate HP/TR. It's such a senseless pairing. It's palatable in this story because it doesn't try to treat it's scenario 'realistically' From the get go it's clear that the world is somewhat contrived. I admire how the fic doesn't flaw itself trying to justify it's plotholes and instead just plays to its strengths. Which are its brilliantly interesting main characters.

Sure, the weasley twins created an inderdimensional closet as a prank, but that doesn't stop the characters from developing!

**** Same here. My favorite HP/TR fics are all set in Major or even Muggle AU's. Further works in the friendly rivals/not trying murder each other section:

Linkao3(Kudosed, Bookmarked, and Subscribed): Boss/Employee Muggle AU featuring Tom, Harry and ...J.K. Roaring. Unique Metafic.

Linkao3(Matchmaker by Tannintele) Muggle AU with Riddle as the investigator and Harry as a criminal. Manages to pull off the pairing somehow.

  By day, Harry works as a lowly assistant to his boss: the cruel, controlling Tom Riddle. By night, he lives, breathes, and writes fanfiction. And when he's not writing, he's obsessing over the work of his favorite Ao3 author: Lord_Voldemort_.So, of course, it's only a matter of time before Harry gets caught reading Voldemort's latest fanfiction at work... by none other than his boss.

  'The Matchmaker' is a serial abductor whose modus operandi consists of pairing two same-sex individuals together in a coffin, six feet underground - buried alive. He isn't a killer. He's a kidnapper with morals, and Detective Chief Inspector Tom Riddle finds himself obsessed with solving the case.Unfortunately for Tom, the Matchmaker is just as intent on knowing him.

  Riddle's undivided attention snapped to him with the swiftness of shattering glass. His turbulent magic receded from where it had besieged the shop.

  "You,” he breathed.

  Coiling in leisurely motions, the eager tendrils of his magic reached for Harry, swathing about his limbs and neck and chest with a liquid, flowing fascination.

  "I've been looking for you,” Riddle continued, tilting his head to the side and sweeping his gaze over Harry. It was an appraisal that felt simultaneously like the raking of iron nails and the tender drapery of silk.

  It was so familiar, and yet... so foreign.

  In the winding streets of Knockturn Alley, an intricate dance of mutual obsession unravels between twenty-three-year-old Tom Riddle and a time-travelling Harry Potter.
