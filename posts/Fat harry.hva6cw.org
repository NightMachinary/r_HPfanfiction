***** Matthew Lewis. Just like fanon Snape tends to be at least 90% Alan Rickman.

Also, not to downplay this prompt or anything, but Harry would have to be genetically fat ('stubborn' fat, so to speak) instead of lifestyle fat for this to work. Because Hogwarts has around one hundred and forty-two staircases, and is basically huge in scope to travel on foot.
