Looking for the best and highly recommended fics off of archiveofourown. No Fanfiction.Net please


** I keep these three links open on my phone at all times because I recommend them so frequently: linkao3(the secret language of plants by endrina; life skills outside the curriculum; the changeling by annerb). Those are my top 3, ranked. I also loved these completed fics linkao3(reparations by Saras_Girl; tea and no sympathy; Making Do by ravenkira; Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails by Oceanbreeze7; Grey Space by noaacat; november tales by endrina; the problem universe; Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by waspabi) There are only a few WIP fics I follow (what can I say? Abandonment issues): linkao3(The Devil You Know by SilchasRuin; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin)

  With adulthood comes the realization that parents can't fix all. That there are dangers that are too big.This is the story of a war and the people who didn't want to fight in it but did anyway.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

** Do you want like "widely recommended" or just very good fics? bc I've read a lot of widely recommended stuff that you can find searching this subreddit but wanted to recommend my own niche of favorite works. I'm realizing looking at this how many have Petunia Dursley in them. I guess I like reading sibling jealousy fics that aren't WBWL lol

  (I am the one who says 'fuck you') - Benjamin Garcia, 'Ode to the Corpse Flower'.Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself.(A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War).

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.
