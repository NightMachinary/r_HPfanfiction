** OK, just the first sentence, but I have to mention “Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me” linkffn(12407442). Not only because I work (or rather not work, sorry) on its translation to Czech (linkao3(20896994)).

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

**** I could see Tom manipulating Luna into doing this, to be honest. He was charismatic, and she was a lonely, bullied, eleven year old girl.

Her common-sense of "not trusting anything where you can't see where it puts its brain", as said by Arthur and is something I can see Luna adhering to, would be overlooked out of her desperation/loneliness.

Her only friend was Ginny, and she's the only one who may see something amiss if they still have regular contact with one another (unlikely, due to different Houses and Ginny being a shy sheep at the moment to Harry's presence).
