The title already says it all really

I am currently looking for some more HP fanfics (Crossovers are fine too) that are novel-length (100k+ words) doesn't really matter what rating the fic has. the only thing i would ask for is that it is NOT a maleslash fic.

Would be nice if the fics don't follow the classic 7 years, but it wouldn't stop me from enjoing them.

Extra points if the fanfic takes a spin on how magic works

examles:

linkffn( The Life He Leads by TheSilverBoar )

linkffn( Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d )

linkffn( Basilisk-born by Ebenbild )

linkffn( The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries by MR.Omega573 )

linkffn( Touched by the Arcane by lisbeth00 )

Thanks and Kudos


** Does it need to be complete? I'm currently working my way through *Harry Potter and the Daft Morons* by Sinyk*.* The story is huge, maybe incomplete, but since the story could have ended several places, I'm enjoying the ride all the way to the end. Sinyk is a great fanfic writer, and I highly recommend his stories.

** I have a few Marauder centric fics?

linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5)

^{^{^}} A cult classic but genuinely brilliantly written!! The narration made me laugh and completely fall head over heels in love with James. It's a Jily fic that follows mostly James and Lily through their 6th year with a lot of drama but I love it some much.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680]])

^{^{^}} Into the Arena is a short time travel story where Harry and 9 year old Teddy Lupin get sent back to 1994 and try to get back. Teddy Lupin in this story is just... Oh he's a little treasure and I want one. He carries a sparkly bag and wears these big goggles and hijacks a car and oh I just adore him so so much! He's amazing.

linkao3(Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban)

^{^{^}} Exactly what it says on the tin. PoA but from Lupins point of view and how he throughout the year he discovers Sirius didn't betray him. And how he interacts with Harry. There's an abandoned sequel Sirius Black and GoF which is also very very good!

For something different, linkao3(Swung By Serafim by Flamethrower) is a story where Harry gets obliviated in CoS and basically has a whole personality change? So he's more cunning, smarter. It's a story but also... A critical analysis maybe? Of the HP world. So a proper look at Potions and how different ingredients do what. They fix Hogwarts, make it more accessible and fair and point out all the flaws. I suppose it is a 'bashing' story but I don't think that's the point? I just found it so interesting because they really looked into all the different issues in the wizarding world and how to fix them.

Flamethrower is an incredible author who does so much research into their stories it's insane.

I never realised how many of the stories I read have casual Wolfstar or some maleslash in it till I tried to think of ones without!!

It's not romance heavy, but at different parts of the fic it is H/Susan and H/Daphne. Lots, lots of action.

Also, it's pretty dark, so if 'grit' doesn't appeal to you, take that as a heads up :D

Gotta say its an interesting premis for a story and, at least so far, i can say that i really appreciate that you dont go the classic evil dumbledore path when it is clear that what happens at privet drive is really a bad situation for a child.

i also like that you stay away from the mini death eater trope.

In this fic at least, Dumbledore isn't evil, he just couldn't fathom that the Dursleys wouldn't take good care of their own family member. He makes mistakes, but he has good intentions.

As for mini death eaters, I think eleven year olds are still just children. They're influenced by their families, but they are starting to make their own judgements about the world and what they want their place in it to be. Some of them will be faced with making difficult decisions, but not until later in the series.

I'm glad you're interested in the story and the premise!

  As for mini death eaters, I think eleven year olds are still just children.

THAT is just the point!!! glad to see a fanfic writer that understands that without instantly going going the missunderstood/sweetheart slitherins/draco

i also appreciate the relationship with Millicent that you are building

  From a narrow escape from death at the end of the war Snape embarks on a new life. Yet how can a single escape be enough when it's not over? How can he move forward when the past is close on his trail? Rated for language, some violence.

*** I have heard of the pureblood pretense more than once already but it somehow always slipped through my notice.

the ashes of chaos is a fic that i am already following so i can agree that its a pretty good one

as for fem harry fanfics i am in general fine with most fics as long as they stay away from more bodily or even worse sexual torture of the mc or any of the caracters you are rooting for really.

that is one of the reasons why i am not that much of a fan of the black princess series even though i really like the kind of magic that this fem/harry is using.

it is also the reason why i really cant read the holly evans books anymore even though the story in it self was as far as i can remember pretty solid. its just that what happend in the last chapter of book one in the bonus material was... really really bad... not something i even want to read about...
