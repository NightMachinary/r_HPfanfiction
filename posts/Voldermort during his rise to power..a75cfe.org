Are there any good fics that address what voldy got up to between finishing Hogwarts and his rise to power in the 1st wizarding war. HBP alludes to a few things but no real detail. It Doesn't have to be from voldys perspective but I would like it to be canon compliant in the sense that voldy is true to his character.
