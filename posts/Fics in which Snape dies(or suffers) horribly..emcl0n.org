Snape is what I imagine would have happened if my father went into teaching. Today's my sister's birthday. He managed to ruin it so bad that my sister (the apple of his eye) told me in tears she will kill him. I just want to see Snape suffer today. She just told me that her birthday wish was that he has an accident and dies.

Especially want to see some fics in which he ends up in Azkaban, loses everything he prides himself over, or gets killed by Lily, Harry, Hermione, James, Sirius, etc

No Good Snape!, Redeemed Snape! or any thing of that sort.

If you can't find any such fics, then just recommend fics in which Snape doesn't play any part in the story.

Thank You.


** Robst stories have Snape get his due.

Linkffn(harry potter and the last chance by lequin) he dies in a violent manner

He gets his ass handed to him in linkffn(what we're fighting for) and linkffn(harry Daniels and the order of shadows)

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  Harry received some useful advice before the third task. The butterfly effect will be going full-speed. Not everyone is happy with the changes. Enjoy

*** Or, y'know, we could /not/ chastise people for trying to cope by reading a piece of fiction that makes them feel better in the middle of a stressful home situation and /not/ make assumptions about what they're doing or even capable of doing about said situation irl. Just a thought.

** The only one I've got is an NBC's Hannibal/Harry Potter crossover in which Will Graham is quite literally Harry, having changed his name and moved to the US to get away from everything. Hannigram heavy so it has a morally grey to darkish Will (Harry) and while the premise may sound strange it's spectacularly written and well worth a read if you're into both fandoms. Snape has long since died exactly as he did in canon, but Will does NOT have a single shred of fondness or forgiveness for him and makes it expressly clear when he's mentioned that he feels Snape got exactly what he deserved.

It's called "What Do I Know Of Life After Death?" by QueenofLit on AO3. I'd link but I'm on mobile and also new to the subreddit so I don't know the rules or etiquette for linking here yet anyway.
