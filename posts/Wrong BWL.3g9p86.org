  Ellie Potter was never the boy who lived, she just happened to be in the same room at the same time, and yet she can't help but grow and notice that it is never Harry Potter who must fight his own demons. Side fic/Spin off to "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus"

Agreed. Voldemort fears Dumbledore and sees him as the ultimate rival who knows everything and plans for everything. So it's really unlikely that Dumbledore would fuck up something as simple as identifying who'd been hit by the killing curse. Especially when he's comparing it to a scar caused by falling rubble. (That's the most commonly used device for the fuck up). He's an ancient and wise/manipulative (if you're into those fics) wizard with years of experience and knowledge of magic. It's very unlikely that he'd be unable to distinguish a curse scar or one filled with dark magic from a scar made by rubble.

*** It really isn't hard to believe when you consider that nobody was there to see Harry get AK'd. What actually is suspicious is how canon Dumbledore somehow knows what happened in the first place. He wasn't there, he isn't omniscient, so the natural conclusion is that he just guessed what happened.

** A very good suggestion: Harry Potter, Rise From Dust.

linkffn(7017751)

Some elements of interest:

First off, it is one of the few ( if not the only one) in its genre that does not have a gaping plot hole concerning the parent abandonment.

Secondly, there are some overpowered/ Marysuish elements, but the author handles them fantastically. Really, writers who aspire to write powerful/ godlike/ superawesome hero fics should be taking lessons from this.

It has three OC's as main characters (well, four if you count Daphne too) , but don't let that discourage you; the author has done a frigging awesome job in fleshing them out.

Finally: spectacular quidditch matches! Even if you don't like those in general, trust me, you will enjoy these in particular.

Tbh, most wbwl/obwl fics suck or have issues. This one and The Santi's fic mentioned above are some of the few really worth checking out.

*** I stopped reading as I got to the /completely/ clichéd GOLDEN LOVE SHIELD OF KILLING CURSE DEFLECTION in like the first chapter.

The reason Santi's BWL is awesome is because it does not incorporate such horrifyingly sappy clichés, and it has a Harry that paves his own path to greatness rather than relying on some unheard-of deus ex machina superpower.

**** I see your point, kinda. Just to be the devil's advocate for a second though, wasn't canon Lily's sacrifice and the deflection of the AK the exact same thing --- to quote you, a love shield of killing curse deflection? Wasn't the subsequent blood protection he got seriously overpowered?

A deus ex machina is not optional, but required for the premise of 'a dark lord falling by a baby' to work, be it a powerful baby, or the convenient existence of some arcane ritual that requires sacrifice, or an alien's defecation that somehow entered the earth's orbit and crashed onto V's head. As for it being a cliche, how many different ways have you seen baby Harry beating Voldemort?

Anyway, I did warn on my first post that there were those overpowered elements in the fic; it is all about how the author handles them. You'd just need to read a bit more to see how he does it, and if you'd like it or not.

***** Dumbledore is ambiguous about what truly saved Harry - he says "love", but that can mean and lead to a lot of things. I doubt Lily was the only mother who attempted to sacrifice herself for her child - given her background in Charms, I strongly suspect she dug up some sort of sacrificial ritual of blood protection. It is my headcanon that being the intelligent woman she was, she knew /exactly/ what she was doing.

There are quite a few fics out there with baby Harry doing something against Voldemort. Granted, some of them are time-travel fics, but that's not the issue. What really annoys me is the fact that the golden love shield exists in the first place. It takes all the suspense out of a fic.

Powerful Harry does not mean that deus ex machina is a must. In fact, some of the best overpowered Harry fics - such as Joe's Wastelands and Shezza's BWL - don't rely on clichés such as love shields. Instead, they give Harry challenges that match his power, and he starts off no better than anyone else - but quickly gains his way to power.

Perhaps the story is just not for me. My favorite type of protagonist is one that works their way towards power and achievements by the sweat of their own brow and sharp intelligence. That makes victory much sweeter. When a character is born into some sort of superpower, though, it quickly loses the appeal for me. The character doesn't have to have a sharp wit anymore, and they don't have to work /as/ hard towards their goal. Half of the formula for winning has been handed to them on a platter. What's the fun in that?

****** About what you say in your first paragraph: I agree 100%. However, even if we go that route, the fact that Lily knew what she was doing doesn't make the use of such a ritual any less deus ex.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Again, I agree. What I said was that a deus ex machina element was needed to beat V initially when Harry was a baby. (Probably an exception is those time travel fics you mention, but that is cheating... or we could consider the fact that Harry can travel to the past a d.e.m. itself. )

...And I just realised that we are discussing /semantics/, so I will stop. By the way, I totally agree with the last paragraph of yours as well. A protagonist that roflstomps the DE's and Voldemort without any training or strife is no fun. I will just say that this is not the case in this story. Also, I will say that Voldemort is the younger brother's nemesis in this fic, not Harry's. Harry trains to gain power. And iirc, the existence of a much much more powerful enemy is alluded, and Harry would probably meet his superior there. (That said, the story was discontinued at that point, so we will never find out probably, lol. )

** Are you looking for, say, Harry's considered the Boy Who Lived when in fact it's someone else? Or Harry's around and someone else is the Boy Who Lived?

In either case, there's the Sacrifices Arc by LightningontheWave. It's slash, which many people have a problem with for some strange reason. It has a serious pacing problem and somewhat repetitive conflicts. It attempts to establish a large and complex set of pureblood customs and traditions, but it ends up feeling like the author pulled them out of thin air whenever something was needed. But it's still at least moderately popular.

Gender is performative and not strictly connected to biology. Maybe Draco was born Lyra and informed his parents when he was eight that they had made a mistake and he was a boy rather than a girl.

Canon has a spell that can prevent people everywhere on Earth from thinking about a particular location. Lily's protection in canon seems to have functioned by handing a giant idiot ball everyone who wanted to find Harry while he was living at the Dursleys. HP magic is more than powerful enough to let someone born with a penis bear a child.

I have a Dumbledore-raises-Harry drabble in which Dumbledore is married and has about six kids with his husband (a pair every other decade, not eight at once).

On the other hand, I generally see people mostly skipping over the ill effects of pregnancy and romanticizing it, which is annoying. But the alternative is reading about all the problems with pregnancy, which is also annoying.
