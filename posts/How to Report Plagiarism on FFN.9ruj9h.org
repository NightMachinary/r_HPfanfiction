So this morning I saw this: /Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia/ linkffn(13104016) as "just published."It's identical to this: /Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia/ linkffn(8257400)

Looking at the "author's" page ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11295146/Potter-King-Lord]]), he lists himself as the author to two other really famous stories.

How do I report this?\\
Edit: To do this, go to "help" at the bottom of the screen in desktop mode (I couldn't find it on my phone) and email the support staff with heading [abuse].


** Crap, just figured out how to do it and have reported it.

** This is slightly off topic but I recently joined reddit and I am surprised by the number of posts I have seen about this sort of plagiarism. I am unable to understand why people are doing this. Posting a fic on internet does not really earn anyone any rewards other than reviews from the readers. But if someone posts something that is not at all their own, what do they stand to gain? The comments would not make them happy because they know the praise is for someone else. Even if their username gets some recognition, I don't know if that is really beneficial on the internet. So what do you think is the reason behind people posting someone else's work as their own?

PS: I am not condoning the act. If anything, it is very upsetting to find out that this is such a common occurence. The actual authors of the story put in a lot of effort into the story and deserve to be recognized for them.

*** I was thinking about that some this morning. I don't get it at all either, but here's possibilities I came up with.\\
-- They are young, desperately lonely, and in need of validation of any sort, and perhaps think that this will somehow make them feel better, not realizing the hollowness of praise that is not at all earned. (Just as you suggest -- the comments simply couldn't make one truly happy.)\\
-- They are young trolls curious to see how many people they can get to believe they wrote the stolen story. I mean, in this instance, the author stole three exceptionally well-known stories -- maybe s/he was doing it as a stupid joke to reel in the less well-read HP fans? (= someone has way too much time on their hands.)\\
-- They are young/idiotic authors who somehow think if they can win over readers with "good" (stolen) fics, they'll have a ready-made fanbase when they publish their own fics. (This would again require them to have limited knowledge of how well-read many HP fans are in fanfics.)\\
-- They are graduate students doing a study on plagiarism or similar in the fanfiction world. This sounds ridiculous, I know, but when I was in grad school I had a friend who studied plagiarism and blog posts, and she would actually set up studies were she replicated content from popular blog sites. I really don't think that's going on here, but who knows?

Honestly, any reason (other than the last, I suppose), points to a sad, rather pathetic individual who has too much time on their hands.

** On the app there is a report content button with many options when reading.

I don't use the site itself so I don't know if it has a similar option.

** Seeing as this is a story that slipped through the cracks, cheers for listing it. I'll make sure to read the original and not the stolen
