School is about to go on break and I like what you guys suggest. So as said above what HP fanfic was the best/ worse you had ever read? Could be slash, alt dimension, cross over, etc. My favorite is Chained by maquira on ao3 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14403330/chapters/33262935]]

I'm not sure why you would ask for the worst? But I'll offer a couple that are pretty divisive, so maybe you'll love them or maybe you'll hate them.

linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR) is the alternate/expanded introduction to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Note that it's first and foremost a tutorial in reflecting on your own thought patterns and trying to improve them, secondly a Harry Potter story, and Harry is often self-righteous and preachy. But it's a funny story (including his attitude and mistakes repeatedly coming back to bite him), quite thought-provoking, and he really does want to help the world. (So long as he doesn't destroy it first.)

linkffn(Harry Crow) is basically, "What if goblins were much more awesome than wizards?" Harry is the most extreme Gary Stu character I've ever come across, and I personally couldn't stand it, but if you sympathise more with his grievances (eg being left on the Dursleys' doorstep) than I did, and if you like one-sided beatdowns of the bad guys, you might have fun with it.

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
