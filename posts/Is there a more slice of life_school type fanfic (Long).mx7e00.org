I mean i want Harry, doing something else other than catching/killing bad guys for examples: -Harry in a school going to classes, maybe a date or two but a whole fanfic of him learning stuff in school -Harry traveling the world searching for the secrets of old magic or something -Harry makes his own Country/Comunity and being the Leader/King -Harry being a teacher, but literally reading a whole class in a chapter -Harry being a Headmaster with good world building of how this changes are affecting society (of wizards) -Harry owning Hogwarts and changing the Curriculum -Harry passing Laws in the Wizengamot -Harry being a Father raising Children -Harry owner of an orphanage for magical kids

I literally don't want to read other ways of how Voldemort died, it could be Au or post war idc i just want something else I recommend: 1- A Place apart Harry Making his own Kingdom with the help of Sirius and the goblin nation linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24850216/chapters/60115636]]) 2- Mischief's Heir Harry literally invented a Space program for Wizards (Voldemort becomes a good guy) and Harry and Tom with their Father Loki move all wizard population to Another planet, Crossover with MCU linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4629198/chapters/10555032]]) A Good Teacher Harry meets his new preschool teacher Mr. Harrison but he looks just like him, is he a relative? Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11289525/1/A-Good-Teacher]]) The Lone Traveler Saga is Good My favorites are The Slytherin Chronicles, Results of a Proper Introduction, The Greatest Minister in History and Professor of Defense Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-The-Lone-Traveler/116621/3/2/1/0/0/0/0/]])


** Oh! Also linkao3([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/8125531]]) is just Harry gets a job at Hogwarts for a year and likes it. That's it. It's really nice.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  Harry accidently gets good at chess after playing Ron for 6 years. Pity he doesn't even notice.All the chess matches are real and linked in the fic for you to follow along for context since, as it turns out, writing chess is bloody difficult!

** Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay - linkAO3(30508233) or linkFFN(13230340)

Voldemort is a thing, but he's never a major focus. I think he showed up like three times ever in the entire story? Pretty much the entire focus is on school life. Also, the fic just finished except for the epilogue!

I don't really know how to describe this fic but I think it might fit what you're after.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes.Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new.Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change.Transferred from fanfiction.net.

#+begin_quote
  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them.
