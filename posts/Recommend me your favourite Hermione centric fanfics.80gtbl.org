** Ctrl-f "Cultu" - No results. You disappoint me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]] - Hermione wanted to be a great witch, and there is a house for those who want to be great - Slytherin. There is just one problem, it may be not the nicest house to be in if you're muggleborn. Nice story about Hermione getting more hardcore thanks to fighting Slytherin bullies. Sadly on hiatus.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Sequel to Shadow Walks (probably want to read that one first). Full version was on [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][portkey]].

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305263/1/Shadow-Walker]])

Hermione travels to the past as a toddler and saves everyone:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them]])

Fun one-shot exploring the viscious side of Hermione. I love how everyone takes pity on Ginny in this one and considers her a goner:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5125698/1/Unforgiveable]])

Another Hermione takes Revenge fic:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5508237/1/Caveat-Inimici]])

Staying with the current theme:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8885902/1/Remedial-Lessons]])

Hermione becomes Queen of Magical Britain (interesting counterpoint to the millions of Harry Potter Gryffindor-Salazar-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Pendragon fics)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7543368/1/Vivat-Regina]])

Hermione is a genius Arithmancer:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]])

I'm sure I'm forgetting something.

  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** Applied Cultural Anthology is definitely one of my favorites. Here's a couple others I've enjoyed enough to re-read.

linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) SS/HG, has time-travel badass Hermione. Centers around the second Voldemort war.

linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) the summary doesn't do this one justice. It's written primarily via interview/advising transcripts, has phenomenal quality of writing, and does its characters justice. Unfortunately hasn't updated in a while.

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) features a Slytherin!Hermione and Harry. Also has some great characterization of Snape and Sinistra.

linkao3(Of Myth and Magic by Wonkington) Has some psychological thriller elements. I think I read it entirely in one sitting. It was a fabulous read.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** I would recommend a time travel story linkff(12456580). Aevum Praecantatio by ditzymagic. It is extremely well-written, above 100k, and the author updates regularly. Hermione and Lily are the main characters, but it's more Hermione-centric. I have been following it for a year now. Each chapter is super long, so it's always worth the wait!
