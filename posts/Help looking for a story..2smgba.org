A while ago I read a story that someone recommended here.

The one thing that stood out was that Voldemort tried to kill Harry but Harry opened a mini portal thing, with a second portal behind Voldemort. So he basically kills himself. This was very early on in the story. Harry then hides the fact that old Voldie is dead from the rest of the Wizarding world.

Anyone know what that fic was?
