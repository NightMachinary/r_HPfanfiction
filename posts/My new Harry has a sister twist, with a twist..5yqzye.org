** I tapped out at goblin king wanting to see harry. The twist didn't intrigue me. The typoes were annoying. Snaped instead of snapped was funny though.

** There is a reason your story did badly. Its because its chock full of cliches trying hard to not be cliche and failing at it. Because of that you alienated the people who /like/ cliches, and you also alienated the people who /don't/ like cliches.
