Can we get a fic dealing with a Muggle that is regularily obliviated (someone that lives near magical areas, comes into contact with them through their job...) discovering (and possibly revealing) the magical world.

My idea for it would be that they notice that they're missing substantial time from their day and start to investigate.

Basically, I want the Doctor Who episodes about the Silence (terrifying fuckers that they are) applied to the Harry Potter world.


** I've read a few that include characters in such situations - but as a backdrop for Harry, and not as the focus.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Yes. It's a mess. And that description barely scratches the surface.

*** Gahd Dayum, I feel as though I just read the prompts behind thirteen different movies of varying genres.

I don't think I'll even attempt that, I'm confused from just the summary, or maybe thats the sleep deprivation.

**** It's an attempt at writing what happens when muggles discover magic, and the thing is that there's a lot of seperate things that happen at the same time all around the world. Someone portkeys a shoe on a space station, someone else tries to magically duplicate weapons grade uranium, et cetera et cetera

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
