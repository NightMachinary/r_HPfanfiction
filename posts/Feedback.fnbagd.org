I've been writing a fic called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23149336][Not Slytherin]]

I'd really like some feedback on it, it's on Ao3 and is currently 9,338 words.


** I read your first chapter and I think your story has promise.

The sorting was confusing because it went Malfoy ---> Weasley ---> Potter and yet materialized Draco refers to “if it worked for Potter “. Obviously that may be his prior knowledge from the future, but ideally the past would still be going along without changes until changes are made. Thus, Potter should have been sorted after him and had the option to consider chanting under his breath (or not).

Hope that makes sense! I'll continue reading this:)
