What is in the Love room in the D.O.M.? I searched the net an got the answer that is contain Amortentia. I don't think that's true because: 1. Amortentia can be brewed (Slughorn did in cannon) so it doesn't make sense to lock it away. 2. Love potions don't create true love so it can't be the thing in the room of love. So if the room somehow contain the true power of love itself, then a) how did they did locked it in? b) why did they do it? c) what are the consequences in the world of it being locked up?


** Love experiments.

You Sexy Thing by Hot Chocolate plays on an endless loop inside it.

** There was a fic where the reason the Love Room is "locked" because it was spelled to only open to people in a happy, 'lovely' mood. So you have the occasional Unspeakable (verbally) curse the door, and sometimes, their job, when they aren't happy enough to open the door. Naturally, this doesn't make the door any more willing to open. I thought this was kinda funny.

  If you drew a time-line of Lily Potter's life it would look like a maze. But for the head of Temporal Investigations at the D.O.M. that's perfectly normal- What isn't is the strange man who appears impossibly in all of history. Add a temporally misplaced Potions Master, a time-bent elephant and her family and you get either a mess or a grand adventure. Lilly isn't yet sure which.

** As you probably deduced, there is no canonical answer.

An idea, what could potentially be there comes from the objects in other rooms: The time room had various time related objects. In the (?) memory room we could find brains with tentacles. The space room had planets and such.

So I would say there is a chance that similar objects/concepts are put into a room. I wouldn't be suprised if some unspeakable used themselves to try and understand the concept of love from a magical standpoint. Think along the lines of Beetle The Bards "The Warlock's Hairy Heart" story. Maybe an unspeakable removed their love from their body so they can see how it works. Maybe they have memories/actual feelings of love contained in some kind of vessel.

Why lock it away? Because it is far more intimate than any other branch they study. Because it is so personal they could not just used some random persons love to study it.

Of course it is just one possible explanation. Maybe love is truly as destructive that it needs to be closed. Maybe love is too abstract to be observed, maybe it is too powerful, whatever that means. For this line of though I sadly can't give you a good idea without thinking about it for a while...

There is also a potential jump, that love is a concept that comes from some kind of "hope". The room is in fact nothing, but a closed door, with the promise that "love is so powerful, it had to be locked at all time". Now lets make the human mind do the steps of fullfiling this premise with the help of also concentrating the magic available to it, to create this new branch of magic. Some kind of a placebo effect, build upon a "lie", but maintained with the collective beliefe of humankind.

** It's probably some fucked up mind magic/love research facility where they measure precisely the mechanics of magic and love

*** Maybe but is love less powerful , or more easily twisted/corrupted in the world because part of it is trapped in the room?

**** As I've said, it's likely just a research facility.

They don't have the power of love contained inside and there are no consequences to it because it's just not the case

** I somehow thought that some muggle-born read 1984 and called the war room the love room as a joke, and the unspeakables jumped at the chance for further deception. "ah yes, love is the most powerful force in the universe, so the room is always locked" VS "haha we tricked them again. Now the enemy spies and people who want to steal our snacks think that there's something esoteric and dangerous in there!" The DOM seems like it would like misdirection on principle. It's another (completely necessary) security feature for the highly secretive department.
