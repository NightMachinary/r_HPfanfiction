** It was part of a series called Chancing Chaos by Ell Roche. The specific fic you mention is "Kiss of a Maiden". You can find them posted by Wagga Wagga here: [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1318]]

*** Does that site have a serious issue with censoring things or did the "Gringo" part of "Gringotts" get displaced on purpose?

Also they're totally glossing over how having to choose between betrothal at age 10/11 and being spurned by the entire magical community is any worse than being forced to do something against their will. It's blackmail, yet Hermione is somehow the one in the wrong for not kowtowing for them.

**** I think the bonding aspect was optional, but I'm not sure... That section was a little hard to understand

#+begin_quote
  "Some sponsorship contracts contain a clause that allows for bonding between a family member and the person being sponsored. It's not required, of course, just an option for the future. I don't know for sure, but from what I do know of Miss Granger, I imagine she thought it antiquated and barbaric.
#+end_quote

Right. Assume this sponsorship stuff is true, and the rest of canon happened exactly up to this point. Malfoy gives her an "option". Yeah fucking right. There are a lot of reasons you can hate canon Hermione or make up to hate your au Hermione, but you can't tell me this:

Hermione and her parents are told 100% of everything. Exactly what the sponsorship means, exactly what the contract is, what would happen to her should she refuse, and that the bonding is completely optional. She, after repeatedly being called one of the smartest and most level headed witches in her generation, refuses. Not her parents, her.

In one shot format where you're supposed to agree with Draco and Tori? Nope, not seeing it. Maybe if you explore it further, maybe. But not likely.

Or, maybe what happened was:

Narcissa Malfoy sees her potential and tells her she will be bonded to Draco, period. They don't bother telling her its optional, or that she will be an outcast if she doesn't. Obviously Hermione refuses.

Unless you make her religious and opposed to the magical traditions for that reason, or make it a drawn out thing. But trying to make us think the Malfoys went through the effort of trying to change her mind before condemning her to being hated and rejected by both worlds for the rest of her life? Not going to convince me.

****** "the rest of canon happened exactly up to this point" is too big an assumption I think. Astoria clearly states that many wizards were under the imperious curse- probably including the Malfoys. I do agree that with just this one shot I'd might be in favor of Hermione. However, Jeconais wrote a follow up called Pureblood Princess- [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Pureblood_Princess/Pureblood_Princess/]] so that might be coloring my perspective.

******* Meh, I just like Hermione too much I guess. You'd have to string my disbelief up from the gallows before I'd agree on that. Besides, letting an 11 year old make that choice is disgusting to begin with. Consent laws exist for a reason, and 98% of it is because 11 year olds can not make decisions with any reasonable amount of understanding and comprehension of consequences. Asking a child to suddenly follow the rules of what is for all intents and purposes an ancient bigoted cult in her eyes, well that's just inexcusable. That this sentient entity "magic" would allow that much weight on a child (much like it did with Harry, to be honest) is just not a plot point I want to consider. Sure, a fickle ruler that gives its gifts at a high cost is reasonable in the real world and in dark dramas, but in an HP AU that isn't presented as something akin to the Firebird Trilogy, well like I said, you'd have to kill off my disbelief entirely, let alone suspending it from any height.

******** That's a very fair point regarding the consent, it would make more sense for the choice to be made after Hogwarts, when everyone has more experience and a comparison to their original life.
