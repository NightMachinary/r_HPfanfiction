I'm just curious as to whether this has been done.

Either in a cracky fic where Moldywart (Windemort?) led the Deaf Farters until his Killing Gas (Green mist, not green light) backfired explosively on him,

or a serious fic with Fred and George (or Harry, or even Dumbledore) promoting a Deaf Farters product, or even an organization, to mock and humiliate the real Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

...Or, you know, some other circumstance. Does anyone know any fics that include this?

*** Me neither. Apparently /some/ people think that fart jokes constitute trolling or something like that.

Maybe in a couple of months or so, I'll ask about this again, but frame it as 'can you help me find this fic that definitely exists' rather than 'do you know if fics like this exist'. See if that heads off the "downvote 'cause it's stupid" mentality.
