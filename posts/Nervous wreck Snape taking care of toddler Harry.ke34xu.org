My writing skills aren't up to par, so I feel like writing it myself would not do this idea justice.

But, hear me out;

Instead of the whole Dumbledore bashing 'Potter Wills' trope, Dumbledore DOES read Lily and James wills, and finds out, since everyone else is unavailable, Severus Snape is the only person who can take recently orphaned Harry Potter in.

Snape, understandably freaks the actual fuck out. He does it of course, because life debt, but he has no idea what he's doing.

The second he lays eyes as itty bitty Harry, he goes 'nope, my son now', and predictably scares the life outta his students with his new fatherly behavior.

Of course, Snape's still Snape, but now that he has a toddler it makes him a little less scary.

Was Snape teaching at Hogwards when '81 Halloween happened? And if yes, wasn't this his first year? I don't think that the Hogwards students would know much about snape at that moment...

*** Even if it was his first year, some teachers leave very strong impressions early on. The only thing he'd be missing is a reputation, but a couple months is plenty of time to strike fear into his students. There are some college professors that do it in the first class lmao.

**** It would also be Snape's first time teaching, I doubt he was as good at frightening his students as the Snape we saw 10 years later :)

***** That is fair, though I would wager there's still a solid portion of that that's just... his personality lol He might not have had long to develop his methods of tormenting students, but his overall disdain and condescension towards others is years in the making. We wouldn't have the same Snape we know, but I think he's kind of a pro at disliking and being disliked.

**** There's also the fact that if he went into teaching right after/shortly after graduation, some of the older students would still have known him during his school years, during which he still had a reputation, even if it was less intimidating than he was as a teacher.

*** Snape would have graduated in June of 1978. If it was between September of '81 through June of '81 when he started teaching, someone who was a 4th year when Snape was a 7th year could be a 7th year when Snape became the Potions Professor of Hogwarts.

**** It kind of makes sense for him to start teaching in 81 so that he could get proper rep with Voldemort as a spy.

** I actually started a fic like this ages back, but put it on the back burner... the idea is not only does Harry get a safe home out of it but snape is given something other than the dark arts to care about [now that Lilly is dead] allowing for a possible proper redemption arc... And I wanted to tie in searching for info about the horcruxes along the way.

  Very AU! Harry as a 6 year old, Snape with a gooey center! Harry is caught foolishly trying to explore Hogwarts' lake, and Snape must bring himself to discipline the boy. Contains very mild corporal punishment. 1 prequel, 1 sequel now posted.
