It's a Harry/Hermione fic. Probably under Humor. I read it on FFN.

Dumbledore is not actually harassed by Snape, but it's assumed such because of coincidental evidence against Snape.

/maybe/ it's a time travel fic, not sure about this


** It's "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood-]]"
