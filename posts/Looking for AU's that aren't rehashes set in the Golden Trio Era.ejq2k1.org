As it says in the title.

Would rather it be completed, but it's not needed if written well.

NO Character Bashing of any kind please. Characters hating each other is fine, but the author going out of their way to bash a character is a no go for me.

NO Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No super powered Harry or super intelligent Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter is fine, but make it believable

Can be on fanfiction.net or on another site,

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** If you're looking for big AUs you should check out what I view as the greatest AU in the Harry Potter fandom. It's unfortunately abandoned but it's got 1.3 million words of extremely well written story before you get there.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]

It's a somewhat dystopian story about what would've happened had Voldemort have won the war. With a fucking fantastic Voldemort and Harry mentorship as well as world building.

*** Maybe I was out of the loop and the reason why is known, but this particular abandonment of a story has always struck me as one of the bigger mysteries in fan fic.

Ive never understood why someone would write 1.3 million words and then abandon the project. Its less surprising if an author abandons shorter length stories because sometimes life gets in the way or ideas sputter out or focus is lost. But once you hit a certain amount of words you have devoted so much time to it it seems insane to just walk away. Not to mention walk away without any hint of what happened. No authors note, no profile update, nothing.

** Ok here are some AUs that I think have original ideas or are twists on common tropes, and are not set in the Golden Trio Era.

linkao3(15465966) *The Second String* is an AU that diverges at the beginning of OotP when Harry is kissed by the dementor on Privet Drive and his soul is sent to another place/time. Not completed, but regularly updated and almost complete. Pairing is Harry/Gideon Prewett.

linkao3(7549384) *Sunshine in My Eyes* is an AU where Minerva raises Petunia and Lily.

linkao3(12424344) *Grey Space* is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until students are 14.

linkao3(7331278) *Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run* is an AU where Harry doesn't find out about magic until he's 17. Harry/Draco

linkao3(5986366) *Face Death in the Hope* where Harry time travels after getting hit by AK in DH, saves Regulus from the inferi and they go about destroying horcruxes two decades early. Harry/Regulus

linkao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is an AU where Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle. Petunia/Sirius pairing, which works far better than you'd think.

Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself.(A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War).

** Sole survivor is pretty good, though short. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6888519/1/Sole-Survivor]])

I have the bad habit of enjoying fics that happen to be incomplete. Here are a few of my incomplete favorites that also feature what you're looking for (granted, they've been recommended a bunch before):

On the Way to Greatness. To me this is the most realistic depiction of what would've happened if Harry got sorted into Slytherin as opposed to Gryffindor. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]])

Deathly Hallowed is a wonderful story that touches on Lily doing some very dark things to protect her son that become problematic when he attends school. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]])

Hogwarts Battle School. It's a large enough departure from canon in that it's essentially Ender's Game pushed into the Harry Potter universe. Harry is a bit more than slightly more powerful than canon, but he consistently gets beat down in ways that I feel make things more level. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]])

** This is a really excellent gen fic, with great world building. The characterizations are good and it explores some of the characters minimized in Cannon or the films.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions Wyste]]

Summary:

Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.

Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

***** Typically when people talk about 'canon rehashes' they mean that the story may have some differences, but those differences never actually push the plot off of the main tracks laid down by canon. In "Problem of Potions" every important event in the books still happens, even if in slightly different ways and with a lot of people living who died in the original. 'Some things change, but all the major events still happen' is pretty much the definition of a rehash.
