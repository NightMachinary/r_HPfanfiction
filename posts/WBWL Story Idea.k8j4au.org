Harry is three years older than canon. He has a brother named Daniel Potter. JK Rowling said that Lily was pregnant on Halloween 1981 so he has a sister named Elizabeth Rosaline Potter, whom Harry affectionately calls 'Rosy'. The main point of this story is that I want to avoid all cliches. It's the fame that gets caught in James and Lily's head. (I know I know. But James was said to be a little arrogant and Lily is a muggleborn. Every muggleborn wants to be famous and she got fame by being the mother of the BWL).

- James and Lily are NOT abusive. They neglect him and forget about him but there is a difference between them.
- Dumbledore is not MANIPULATIVE. He is just himself in the fanfiction.
- Harry's brother is not spoiled and a show off. He is a little arrogant but has his good qualities. He is brave, loyal and also accepting.
- There will be no Lord POTTER, PEVERELL, BLACK, GRYFFINDOR, SLYTHERIN, HUFFLEPUFF, RAVENCLAW, EMRYS and LE-FAY.

Now onto the story, Harry runs away one day and is found by Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel and they take a liking to him. They learn about his story and raise him. Harry dislikes his parents but has no hatred for them.Now this is where the real story starts, Harry is sent to Ilvermorny. Daniel's years go like original(Philosopher's Stone,Chamber of Secrets and Peter Pettigrew escapes Azkaban.).

â€‹

I want Harry's Ilvermorny years like his real Hogwarts years. He will go like any other student, have a flurry of emotions, gets awed by description and is nervous during the sorting into Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird and Pukwudgie. He makes friends and will have his own adventures. I want to relive how JK Rowling portrayed Harry's Hogwarts days through another school with a lot of different OC characters. He will have loyal friends, a crush, will find love as he gets older.

There will also be a lot of character development mostly in his fourth year when Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel die and also at the time he has to face his past and family.

In his seventh year, his name is selected for the Triwizard tournament. He has to face his family again. He and his brother come close. (Voldemort knows that Harry is real BWL). Truths are revealed at the end of fourth year. Harry returns to America in Daniel's fifth year to sort out his properties and money left by the Flamels. Umbridge happens but DA is not formed. Harry is the horcrux so he sees his brother in Voldemort's captivity in the DOM. Voldemort's presence is revealed but no one dies. Harry, his friends from Ilvermorny and Dumbledore (who does not have the curse in his hand) together find and destroy horcruxes. Then they live happily ever after.

The main part of the story for me is Harry's seven years through Ilvermorny. So can anyone please suggest a name for the fic.
