I love reading Keira Marcos and I'm looking for similar stories... stories where he is a lord and that is a big responsibility, where he has house elves he needs to care for, Sirius might raise him, he is more mature, preferably H/Hr but honestly any pairing except H/G is fine. Basically the tropes that everyone loves to hate. New stories or perhaps undiscovered gems. Have read all the usual ones. Hopefully finished with over 100k wording.

Thank you!


** I love those as well! Have you read A Marauder's Plan? Its really long and has a lot of interesting family magic/lord!Harry linkffn(8045114)
