** “Harry! Grab the cup and get out of here!” Cedric shouted frantically.

“No!” Responded Harry, refusing to leave without his fellow champion.

“Kill the spare...” A voice came from the shadowy graveyard, and a flash of green light came flying out of the darkness towards Cedric, impacting against his chest.

Harry watched in horror as the Hufflepuff collapsed to the ground, dead, before seeing a flash of red light out of the corner of his eye and falling to blackness.

/What, would Harry actually accept that offer lmao?/

*** This is option 1. Option 2 is that Voldemort uses Cedric to come back, fed up of waiting for the perfect resurrection, and ends up regretting it when Harry's presence causes him to explode the next time they meet.

**** I don't know, would Cedric even be suitable for the ritual ? Maybe I'm taking Pettigrew's words too literally but I don't think a random teenager qualifies as an enemy to Voldy.

*** Maybe he could save Cedric and take the spell? Since he wouldn't be in shock then?

*** Possibly the wand was already pointed at him, and it would have been fruitless to try to get his wand out? Or he's pulling a James?

*** Maybe Cedric doesn't want to risk a little kid's life to save his own? He wasn't a Gryffindor, but maybe he could be a tad noble?

** Cedric thought it was part of the competition. If anything, Harry, who may have spotted Riddle's grave, should have been the one to point it out.

** "Harry," He panted pulling himself onto his elbows, "Grab the cup! Grab the cup and leave!" The Hufflepuff was trying to push his tired body in an upright position but it was difficult. He was tired and his body kept trying to drag him down.

Harry had another idea. He readies his wand and screamed out an /accio/ directed it to the cup. Right as it soars towards him Harry drops his body, the glowing cup soaring over his head.

His plan is for it to slam into Cedric and take him back to the maze. It would slam into his gut and Cedric would curl into himself in response and his fingers would wrap around the handles saving him from the horrors to come.

But Cedric, like Harry, is a seeker. His body drops as soon as he notices the item speeding towards him. Harry watches in horror as it speeds towards Peter Pettigrew and the contorted being in his arms. It slams into the two bodies causing them masses to knock backward. Right before they slam against the ground, they vanish as the portkey activates.

Cedric and Harry share horrified looks as they realize Voldemort and Pettigrew are now inside the wards of Hogwarts and they have no way back.
