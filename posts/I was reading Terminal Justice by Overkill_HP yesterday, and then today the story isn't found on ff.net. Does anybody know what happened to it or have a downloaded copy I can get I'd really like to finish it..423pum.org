#+TITLE: I was reading Terminal Justice by Overkill_HP yesterday, and then today the story isn't found on ff.net. Does anybody know what happened to it or have a downloaded copy I can get? I'd really like to finish it.

** IIRC it has large sections copied straight from JLU, maybe someone reported it for plagiarism?

** If he's pulled it or been jettisoned from ffnet, you could probably find the archive in the Caer Azkaban Yahoo Group in their files section. [[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CaerAzkaban/info]]

** I can only speculate about the reason why the last repost of this story was removed from FF recently, but it's not unlikely to be the case because it wasn't posted by the original author. The site usually gets around to it and removes plagiarized stories sooner or later. Since the original author (Overkill aka Josh Kirkpatrick, I think) isn't around anymore, it might just have taken a bit longer.

** Wow, I was wondering that myself...
