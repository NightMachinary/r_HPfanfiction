I posted this a year ago, then a second time six months ago. And so, I am posting it again! My previous posts for archived, so let's hope third time's the charm and someone knows what this fic is dammit DX

::::

I'm having a hard time finding a particular fic...

Tom is innocent, and was imperioused by Dumbledore as a Child, Harry reads out his diary in the Slytherin Common Room, A lot of characters essentially 'Time Travel' and regain their memories, includes the Twins, Lupin, Sirius, I THINK Tonks and a bunch of others I can't remember...

I hope that's enough information, since Google and my Memory has failed me!

Thank You!

::::

Seriously! Why is this fic so hard to find? Was it removed? Please help!

  Harry was supposed to survive the killing curse during the Battle of Hogwarts, but Fate, Destiny, and Death had other plans. Harry died, but when he did he learned the truth about Dumbledore, Voldemort, and the people whom he thought loved him. He came back to make some changes! *AU* Bash! Some Weasleys, and Hermione! Dark Dumbledore!* ABANDONED See profile for details.
