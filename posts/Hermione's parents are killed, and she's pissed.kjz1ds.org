I remember that she really wanted to avenge them, and I'm pretty sure Snape trained her. In the first chapter I remember Lucius (who killed her parents) being drunk with Snape and telling him that Hermione was terrifying and maybe (?) it was a snamione and on ff.net. If you could tell me the name of the fic it would be pretty awesome. Thanks in advance.
