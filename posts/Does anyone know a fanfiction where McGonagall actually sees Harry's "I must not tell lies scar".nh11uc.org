I always try imagine what would have it been like if she saw it on Harry's hand, it is clear that she cares about Harry a lot, and knows what he has been through.


** There's one with a title along the lines of "The Dark Mark would clash with her pink cardigan" or something like that. It subverts the usual fanfic trope by having the scars discovered and reported make things /so much worse/. Umbridge and the Ministry spin it as Harry having done it to himself - after all, everybody knows he's a very disturbed child - and use it as justification to lock him away in Saint Mungo's.

** I've read a couple of them, though it's been a while since I've done so, so I'm afraid I can't give you their names right now.

I do remember one detail though where someone asks Harry to reveal Umbridge's treatment of him to the Ministry, only for Harry (I think) to brush it off and point out they'd spin it as being him self-harming.

** Umbridge, as evil as she was, made Harry write with a quill that drew blood from his hand as detention for spewing anti-government propaganda. McGonagall sent him at night in the Forbidden Forest while a unicorn killer was on the loose for being out of his dorm. Who's worse?

*** Umbridge. Like objectively so. Send dementors after Harry, was about to use the torture curse on him. Allowed Filch to use his torture methods on students when she became headmistress.\\
Also, it was not just Harry who got the blood quill. Everyone Umbridge disliked got it. Even for something as small as mere pranks.

Not defending what McGonagall did, but Umbridge is worse, that is just undeniable fact.

**** The only other character specifically mentioned to get the blood quill is Lee Jordan. Also not defending Umbridge. In fact fuck Umbridge.

  "I thought she was making you do lines?" said McGonagall. "She is, yeah. But she didn't have me use ink," he said. "I am not Professor Trelawney," she said. "And despite that fact, I am still not psychic. You will have to use your words." OotP. No pairings.

  It might never have happened. In fact, it was a decision she nearly didn't make, and yet she did. See how everything can change when Dumbledore's Army recruits a Slytherin member, Daphne Greengrass, who just wanted to pass her O.W.L's. Pt 1.
