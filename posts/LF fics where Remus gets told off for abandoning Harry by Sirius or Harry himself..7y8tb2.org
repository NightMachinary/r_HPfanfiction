I really can't get over the fact that Remus practically ignored Harry's existence until his 3rd year, and even than he kept the fact that James, Sirius and him used to be best friends. I think Harry deserves better and Harry or Sirius really should have questioned Remus about it. I love stories with powerful, smart Sirius who stands up for himself and doesn't let Dumbledore or Mrs. Weasly walk all over him. Thank you!!

*** Yeah, I know what you mean. Just sometimes it really gets to me that nobody did anything about Harry's situation, I mean Mrs. Figg was there the whole time... At least some letters (where the hell are the fanmail, I mean he vanishes Voldi and no fanmail?) or bday gifts or at least a yearly check in visit from Dumbledore or McGonagall (the muggles wouldn't even see them because... hey magic!) I mean for me in the minimum it screams blatant neglect all around

**** My headcanon was that his owls from strangers have been blocked, and that held up until a reread, and I realised that Harry /did/ get owls, in response to his Quibbler article. Umbridge comes up to see what's up with all the owls.

So he could have owls. But nobody ever wrote.

It's just lonely as hell, and in my time-travel redo fics it's hard to not make him salty about that. Or soooooo many other things. (No links because they're still mostly half-written notepad files and the finished one is still in shitty-first-draft status.)

***** He got owls at Hogwarts, none at Privet Drive until first year. So we can assume that at least until first year, owls were not able to reach him. Though it does get weird because he leaves his home for school, etc, but that's an inherent flaw of the whole 'your mother's protection is protecting you at 4 Privet Drive' anyway.

****** Maybe Harry got lots of owls, but for Statute of Secrecy purposes they were redirected to come through muggle mail, and the Dursleys just destroyed all the mail they found addressed to Harry? Did Harry usually get the mail in the mornings?

**** Dumbledore knew. He said as much when he told Harry he knew about the "ten dark years" he went through. That's why I cannot see Dumbledore as someone Harry would like. He allowed fifteen years of child abuse to happen.

***** This is why I'll always hate Dumbledore. Because for me, in real life, that would be like if my sister just one day told me she'd always heard and known about my abuse and she just never told anyone, or told me that she knew, when she could have saved me from it a lot earlier.

**** People just don't get to see it, because it's hidden. My sister's room shared a wall with mine for ten years, and she didn't find out about my abuse from our mother until I was fourteen. And the more blatant abuses, like choking, hitting, hair pulling, and yelling at, my sister didn't see all that either, because my mother always made sure to do it when she was out of the room, or when she was out of the house visiting a friend, or just late home from school. My mother was careful, and she made me keep it a secret for her, which helped it STAY a secret for all that time. If I would have just opened my mouth once and said something, it would've all come out.

*** Yes, definitely true. I really hate how reckless and irresponsible Sirius gets about Harry's safety and his involvement in raising him. At least when he finally got out of prison he should have done more, but I really love the possibilities in Sirius's character ( he is loyal, creative, intelligent, charming, from an influential and rich family, I mean the Blacks are crazy for sure, but still it is a powerful lineage...) and to be fair probably 12 years in Azkaban ruined him physically and mentally, and it's not like he got any kind of help or treatment after his escape...

**** Yes. :( He should have given Harry what he needed - a parent - but instead he was trying to be his friend on his level. :( That is why I love fanfics that do have Sirius legally step up and get a house and do his best to be Harry's parent. :)

****** I guess it also just personally /resonates/ with me, because my older sister became my parent, after our mother went to prison when I was a teenager. She stepped up for it, and she loved me, and raised me, got me to school every day, bought me things, taught me stuff, and did everything an actual good, normal parent is supposed to do.

*** Well actually I'm reading one currently, It's Harry/Hermione soul bond fic (which not really my taste), but I love how it writes Sirius. He is fierce and loyal and doesn't take any bullshit if it's about Harry's safety. He fights for custody, and takes Harry to France and does everything in his power to protect and prepare him.

*** Also some others you might find interesting (I read these a long time ago, but used to love them)

Story: Forging Destiny [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6747856/1/Forging-Destiny]]

When Harry runs away after blowing up Aunt Marge, he meets Sirius, who tells him everything about Pettigrew and they leave together to Grimmauld Place. Goblins, healers get involved, new identity... etc.

Story: Harry Potter and the Return of Heritage [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9822874/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Return-of-Heritage]]

Sirius makes sure that Harry is aware of his family responsibilities and heritage

Story: Of Western Stars [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/662406/1/Of-Western-Stars]]

Can't really remember what this story is about in detail, but the title looked really familiar, and if I remember correctly I liked this fic.

Story: Unknown Relations: The Philosopher's Stone [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2970733/1/Unknown-Relations-The-Philosopher-s-Stone]]

This is a little out there ... in this story Harry is a twin, he gets sick after Voldi, abandoned by the Potters he is adopted into the Black family as Orion the son of Sirius Black. Everyone forgets that there used to be a twin Potter. The story starts in first year, somewhat canon... I just love the dynamics of the relationship between Sirius and Orion.
