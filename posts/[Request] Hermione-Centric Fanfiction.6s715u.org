After Granger Enchanted went down, I am having a hard time finding quality Hermione-Centric fanfiction.

Too many fanfictions about her today are very unrealistic or not of decent quality. I've read many such as:

linkffn(All the Wrong Choices by LadyBaelish1127)

linkffn(Presque Toujours Pur by ShayaLonnie)

linkffn(Becoming Lady Malfoy by MissFantastic)

linkffn(Well Roared, Lion by treeson)

linkffn(Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale)

These fictions are long, well thought out fictions, and I am dying for more. I have many more, but I know there are some out there that I'm just not finding. I love Hermione centered fictions, but I loathe finding long-time incomplete fanfictions about her, or ones where the grammar/plot is so disorganized that I can't enjoy reading it. I usually don't care if they pair her with someone, though if it's Ron Weasley, please don't link it. I don't care for him.


** Intelligent protagnist Hermione is featured in linkffn(The Arithmancer), linkffn(Hermione Granger the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation), linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them). Possibly linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) too.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** Among fics that haven't been recommended yet, there's [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700/][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire by Couldson Eagle]]. (I'm linking to the archive, since Portkey is gone.)

linkao3(Surprise, Bitches! by OfHealingLove) is promising.

[[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics tend to feature ensemble casts rather than a clear lead, but Hermione usually gets at least a plurality of the point-of-view scenes. He tends to 'ship her with Harry or Ron (or both, in at least one case).

Other than that, I second [[/u/Achille-Talon]]'s recommendations and some of [[/u/Flye_Autumne]]'s (though some of the Flye's have a lot of pointless Dumbledore-bashing).

  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

  Six months after Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, Voldemort, someone decided to turn back time and change history where Harry Potter was reduced to nothing more than a myth. Strangely, only Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, mortal enemies at best, were unaffected by the sudden time shift. Now they must find a way to return to their true timeline as only they know the truth.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
