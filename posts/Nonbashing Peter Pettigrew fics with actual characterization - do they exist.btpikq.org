I recently reread Happy Birthday, Mr. Dark Lord by angel272 linkffn(2658132) and found Peter's characterization to be a cut above the rest. I know that he's an easy hate-sink character, and for good reason: the man's a sniveling coward and a traitor to not just his cause, but to the people who would have called him a brother. The sort of evil that Pettigrew embodies in the Harry Potter series is a realistic one that we're sure to encounter in our own lives, which I think is why he's such an easy-to-bash character. So many writers in the Harry Potter fandom seem to have internalized Tom Riddle's rhetoric on the ultimate utility of power, and Peter is pretty much the antithesis of everything their uber-powerful bizarro-utilitarian Indy-Harry holds dear to his ideals. It makes sense, in that context, for Peter to be reduced to the sniveling butt of every cruel joke. But while it's easy to write characters that are jokes, it's a lot more difficult to write characters that are characters. Especially when the character is someone who we're primed to hate. After all, it's very unlikely that we'll run into psychopathic mass murderers in real life, but it's near-inevitable that someone we held dear will stab us in the back because it was the easy thing to do. It's like how people gleefully dunk on Umbridge because we all know and despise that obstructive, sadistic, lawfully evil authority figure seemingly hell-bent on bureaucratizing our lives into oblivion.

But I'm tired of reading about Peter Pettigrew the squealing rat, going through a cartoonish conga line of humiliation where he loses his limbs and his dignity because the author doesn't know any other way to make someone face justice. And on the other hand, I'm also tired of reading fics where suddenly Peter's betrayal was totally justified because “oh, the Marauders treated me like second fiddle, or the Marauders straight up killed someone who was important to me” (I get that they were teenage jerks and bullied Snape terribly to the point of almost accidentally killing him in a “prank”, but I feel like JKR's intent was not to turn them into schoolyard murderers [even by proxy]. The fact that James felt remorse and saved Snape shouldn't be so discounted. But that's a discussion for another day). I'd just like to read a story in which Peter is weak, and maybe he even regrets the choices that his weakness brought him to, but he doesn't feel powerful enough to change his destiny or stand up for himself and do the right thing. I'd like to read a story that shows that despite this overwhelming cowardice, there's still a little bit of Marauder in him. Maybe it doesn't do enough to make a difference. But it's still there.

  ONE SHOT. Lord Voldemort announces that he's going to celebrate his birthday with Sugar Quills, PintheBeakontheHippogriff, and Death Eaters in hula skirts. Has he finally lost his mind?

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus... Regulus is alive. No-one is more surprised than him. AU, sort of fix-it, but dark enough. Sirius/Remus, too (mostly in the past).

  Godric's Hollow, October 31, 1981. The fated night for the Potters.Peter thought he'd make a short trip to James' and Lily's. After all, he was the only person who knew where they were hiding (as far as they knew). They'd be alone. No Sirius to come muck everything up. Not even Remus could drop in for a visit. They'd be ever so happy to see little old Peter. Lily would probably make him tea and cakes, and then he'd be on his way with neither of them the wiser.Oh, he'd finally have gotten his laugh. After all those years.A prologue to the Everyone Lives series.
