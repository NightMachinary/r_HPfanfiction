Finding Harry/Hermione /friendship/ fanfiction isn't easy, but I know there are many fans of their friendship along with me. I made a new community with over 50 of the best fanfictions I've found that support their friendship, but only friendship. It'll be constantly updated too, since it's pretty much the only kind of fanfiction I read. :)

- Strictly Harry/Hermione platonic friendship
- No AU (alternate universe)
- Canon-complaint/near canon
- Some may contain a little Ron/Hermione romance
- Some may be closer to trio fics


** Nice idea. Hope to see longer fics eventually.

*** Using someone's sexual orientation as a put down is ridiculous and makes your argument invalid.
