I like James Potter and Despise Severus Snape, and rereading SWM noticed that everyone seems rather happy to see Snape's underwear dropped. What if Snape wasn't the greasy outcast he portrays but rather a despised boogieman and bully. And that made me think, what if Lily was also a outcast, her being best friends with him, and protector.

So what if Lily shows up for 6th year expecting fun and James Potter chasing her. Only to find James Potter ignoring her, her fellow muggleborns targeting her and her Room mates unwilling to talk to her outside the dorm. Lily learns that without the protection and attention of James she lost her biggest protector and without Snape (who seems to be on a violent and abusive roll since the year started) acting as a deterrent Lily is on open season with clear eyes,.who were her real friends and who used her, how her protecting and defending Snape for year made his victims feel. Lily falls from Her perch.

Essentially, Lily would of been gotten her ass kicked years ago for protecting Snape and for being James's sole love interest, but out of fear from retaliation from James and Snape people left her alone. But after her public cutting off of Snape and her most brutal rejection of James, her two guardians leave her to her own devices and Lily has to deal with her demons alone. The idea is that Lily learns finally the truths of Hogwarts, Snape is a Monster, she was lucky to have James Potter be so interested (and Patient) with her and she made dozens of enemies.


** Would the witch who defeated Voldemort at the age of twenty-one need protection? If the prophecy is supposed to make sense she will defy Voldemort three times before turning twenty-one and blew him out of his body a year later.

So we have a sixteen year old witch who is supposed to be the smartest of her generation. Within the next five years she will achieve things that even Dumbledore was unable of. I see her wiping the floor with a bunch of schoolyard bullies.

*** I'd expect the same - but then, too many authors want the smart (muggleborn) witch be useless without a strong wizard to protect her. Hermione suffers from that so often...

With regards to the proposal, why has Lily missed Snape being so despised for bullying others? And why would she not have any friends who told her? I can't really see her as having only Snape as a friend.

**** I think the OP is wanting an AU, since James was, by the admission of Remus and Sirius, a bully.

But, I don't think Lily was a particularly people person. We don't know of a single school friend of hers apart from Snape. Harry had no godmother. Petunia never mentioned anyone from her sister's life except for Snape and Potter. Lily failed to keep a relationship with Petunia, and I cannot believe that's all on her. Snape sat outside the common room publicly trying to make amends and she wouldn't forgive him - she held grudges, too.

Lily was very smart, Hermione Granger smart (according to Remus), very brave, very determined, and very beautiful, although the dead are always remembered as good looking. I can easily see her, like Hermione, struggling to make friends.

***** Yeah thats it, I want Harry's 2nd Year with double helping of hate, she defended their monster and put down their hero, she kept the hero to herself despite not wanting him. Every Muggleborn in Hogwarts would want her head to show her their displeasure at her ignoring their plight and every girl in Hogwarts between 3rd and 7th would want to tear her hair out. Lily Potter, Intelligent but not Godlike Lily Potter having to deal with 65% of the school calling Open Season on her, not including Blood Purist looking to do her in for being a Uppity Mudblood

Eveyone is shouting how James is Evil and Lily is a OP Princess ignoring that Snape essentially does what many would equate to Rape Apology by saying his friends were "just having a bit of fun" using Dark Magic to Torture a Young Woman. People hate the Phrase "Boys will be Boys" but that is exactly what Snape says. And lets not forget that Snape is friends with these guys so don't ignore the HEAVY undertones of Snape also partaking in these activities as well. And the Dark Magic is Called "Sick" not inflating a persons head or sticking someone to a wall, or even Pantsing someone. Magic used to cause pain and permanent damaged used to "Have a bit of fun" and Lily defends him, she blindly throws herself between a mild bully and a raging sociopath because Snape gets "Bullied". What if Lily is just Blind, blind ti Snape's true self and using their friendship as a excuse to ignore all the signs and the victims. Then one day, her social insulation is gone, one of her own doing by waking up to What Snape really is and the other by calling James Potter the Same as the Sociopath she just cutoff

****** It's an interesting concept. It makes sense for Lily, if she had trouble making friends to stick with her one friend even tho so many might hate him.

I don't think anyone's ever called James evil though. Just arrogant and spoiled, and a bully - as a boy. He grew up though.

**** I think that she had other friends, her dorm mates at least. But she stays with Snape because she still sees him as the boy he once was.

Also Lily being friends with Pandora (Luna's mum) is a fun headcanon.

*** Physical bullying and social ostracizing can be very different things. She could have been Dumbledore reborn, but how do you force people to like/talk/interact with you?

**** You can't force people to be friends with someone but you can stop abuse and bullying by putting Bullies into Detentions where suddenly they are the small fish. Let Filch have a go at them, make them scrub the toilets with a toothbrush. Let people know that you don't tolerate their bullshit.

So you agree with Voldemort? The exit is right there. What, your daddy is gonna complain? Well, Dumbledore wrecked Grindlewald. You sure you got what it takes to win against Dumbledore? By all means, give it a shot.

Dumbledore has nearly unmatched powers. He can easily defeat anyone but Voldemort so he should use the powers to purge the pureblood supremacy movement. He already has a group of vigilantes so do something about the problem instead of the grandfatherly act.

  [T]he KGB kidnapped a man they knew to be a close relative of a prominent Hezbollah leader. They then castrated him and sent the severed organs to the Hezbollah official, before dispatching the unfortunate kinsman with a bullet in the brain.

  In addition to presenting him with this grisly proof of their seriousness, the KGB operatives also advised the Hezbollah leader that they knew the indentities of other close relatives of his, and that he could expect more such packages if the three Soviet diplomats were not freed immediately.

Edit: Lily might have a lonely time but that is hardly unbearable for eighteen months. She might not make a lot of friends but she should be safe. If she is not safe at Hogwarts and has to fear physical attacks and rape see above. If not then that is hardly a real problem compared to the imminent death looming over anyone opposing Voldemort.

** Firstly, let me say that I'm biased because I really hate the persistent guy gets his girl trope.

Honestly speaking, I think Lily could have done better than James, but people fall in love for strange reasons, and they seem happy, so it isn't my place to judge. Your suggestion sucks, because it strips both Severus Snape and James Potter of nuance, while making Lily seem to be at fault. Why would she be "lucky" to have five years of attention she didn't ask for? She had no problem being blunt with Snape, she'd tell him off in private, at the very least. Also, Snape tried apologizing in canon, he would probably try even harder now that James has backed off.

Finally, she was head girl and in the Slug Club, described as witty and charming by Slughorn and so good at magic that Voldemort wanted to recruit her despite her being Muggleborn(this part is from Rowlings interviews). She doesn't need protection.

**** It's very possible I consciously decided to write Lily like that because how she's handled by much of the fandom, and even the original author if I'm being honest here, seriously bothers me. OP is one of the reasons Lily in my fics is the way she is.

Jumping in slightly late, I know, but I saw this and it amused me.

** Lily was a total badass. The Canon couldn't be more clear about that. Standing up to James and later blowing up Voldemort should be enough evidence.

Someone like her DIDN'T need protection at the school. Witches were also FAR MORE POWERFUL than comparable Muggle girls.

Furthermore, the head of the Slytherin House, Horace Slughorn, publicly adored her. She was a member of that snobbish Slug Club.

....What? Lily was a smart, powerful, beautiful girl. She's not lucky that any boy likes her. James is the lucky one in this equation.
