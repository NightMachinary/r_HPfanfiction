** Ultima Ratio (si think, if I'm wrong I'll correct it tonight) is TR/HG, time travel, and there are a few bombings, not rely detailed but it's important for the d√©veloppement of their relationship. Linkffn(ultima ratio)

They are brothers in this, as far as I can gather. Please don't tell me they also do the "slash" part with each other.

**** They are not blood brothers, and the way it's implied early on is that Hadrian will die and be reincarnated as the second Malfoy son.\\
But the author have not reachee that part and it's really rather confusing.

** In linkffn(Letters to Walpurgis) Tom Riddle is drafted into the muggle side of WW2. It's unfortunately not finished, but the premise is cool and maybe if enough of us follow/favorite it the author will be convinced to continue... (a girl can dream)

  1943. AU It was supposed to be Tom Riddle's sixth year at Hogwarts. A few more months then he would 17 and be free of the Muggle World forever. No one expected that he would be drafted. Grindelwald's campaign doesn't seem as righteous as it did before.
