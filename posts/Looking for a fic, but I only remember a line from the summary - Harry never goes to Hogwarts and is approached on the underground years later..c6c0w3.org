:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was looking for a different fic a while back and remember reading the summary of one that seemed interesting, but now I can't find it. The line I remember is something like:

It's a lot easier to believe in magic from a half giant when you are 11, than a couple of teenagers on the underground when you're 17.

That's not exact, but it was something like that. The concept was that Harry never learned about magic or went to Hogwarts, and some people (maybe Ron and Hermione) track him down once the war is in full swing. I didn't look into it too much further so I could be off base. I'm fairly certain it was on ao3.

If anyone has any idea what I'm talking about I would be super grateful!
