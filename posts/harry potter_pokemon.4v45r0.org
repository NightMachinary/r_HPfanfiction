ive been reading linkffn(12026631) and its made me want to read more pokemon-influenced harry pitter fic. i know theres that one series where hogwarts is a pokemon trainer school but ive lost interest in it because its so dense and not very enthralling lately.


** only ones i can think of that are any good

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Master's Ball)

Linkffn(Harry Mewter)

The problem with looking for crossovers in such popular franchises is that it's really difficult to find anything good based on regular metrics.

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Updates weekly.
