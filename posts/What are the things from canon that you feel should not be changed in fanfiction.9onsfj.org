Why do authors do that? British law has the age of consent at 16 and the magical adulthood begins at 17. 18 is just an immersion-destroying Americanism for me.

But you ought to do research for your stories. If I can dig up the snow height for Amberg on the first of January 1997 or the planes/airlines which operated London - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the summer of 1995, for one sentence, then the basics for whatever premise requires the age of consent aren't too much to ask for.

The analogy does not work as well for communist rules of terror (Stalin, Mao) as it works for fascist ones because there were no "Plans" which ended up killing millions of citizens during a "reform", nor was there a real civil war like the Russian or the Chinese one.

The Death Eaters are almost a carbon copy of the Sturmabteilung and the Muggleborn persecution was absolute, very much like the real final solution. It wasn't just some economic measures and a few arrests, it was a systematic persecution which shipped significant parts to the society away into concentration camps (and an argument could be made that Azkaban is really a Death camp).

I also hypothesize that his unstable soul may well have had something to do with the AK not working. We've got an intent-based curse, a promise not to kill someone, a willing sacrifice, and a tattered soul that is split by murder. After that happened, he tried to kill a child that he subconsciously believed to be special, using the same intent-based curse. All those thing would influence it, and none of it would be the same in any other circumstance.

[And imho JKR undermined the point by muddling it with the prophecy, which makes it all seem more like a whim of fate and much less miraculous than the beginning of the series makes it out to be... After all there must be a lot of improbable prophecies among those thousands in the DoM.

And don't get me started about putting Harry in a position with his back against the wall. His sacrifice is really diminished by giving him nothing to live for and no other choice.

'Harriet-called-Harry' for a girl annoys me a good amount, too, but isn't a major deal breaker if it's a decent story.

Highly debatable. He walked out on her daughter after getting her pregnant.

No mother would ever forgive someone for doing that to her child and grandchild. I doubt she was okay with the marriage in the first place - Lupin is a werewolf. Someone who literally turns into an feral, rabid animal with a taste for human flesh every full moon - and this disease is spread through biting. I wouldn't want to have much to do with someone like that. In fact, I'd prefer if someone like that were put down. Anyone yapping about wolfsbane can check book 3 to find out that accidents can happen at any time, and that you'd be a fool to think that you'd ever be safe around a werewolf.

Lupin was an incredible bastard to Tonks when he did this. As much as I hate canon HP's self-righteous streak, he's spot on in this regard.

** Potters being alive. I feel like their deaths are the staple of Harry Potter. It's the beginning and it's the one thing that sets everything in motion. Would Neville even be the bwl considering Voldemort would have no reason to spare Alice. I do not know if this speculation as to how Harry survived is canon or fanon but without evidence to the latter I'm less inclined to believe it.

*** Yeah, the circumstances behind Harry becoming the BWL is very specific and would be dubious to replicate on anybody else like Neville.

Lily was friends with Snape which made Snape ASK Voldie to spare Lily, which in turn made Voldie give Lily a CHOICE. Lily had to have a choice otherwise she wouldn't really be *sacrificing* herself. It was necessary in triggering the ancient blood magic. Without Snape asking Voldie to spare her, Voldie would have just murdered her outright and ancient magic wouldn't have been triggered.

It's one of those things that is very popular to change in the story but very hard to justify canon-wise so most writers just ignore it or aren't even aware of it.

But personally I'm more forgiving of it. It's not the ff writers fault that canon is so tangly like that. They just want Neville to be BWL? Fine, I can get on with that if they can catch my interest with something else.

Harry wouldn't have been (as) horrifically mistreated if magic didn't exist, and there would be a much higher chance of his parents being alive in the first place. There wouldn't be a "Boy-Who-Lived" without magic.

Dumbledore is an interesting choice for an example because so much of who he is deep down actually is tied deeply with magic.

Harry's a bit of doormat for letting Ron off the hook over that one. I'm actually more sympathetic to Ron over the desertion-during-wartime he pulls in book 7. /That/ shitty situation is down to trying to get an untrained normal kid to pull his weight in a situation that demanded heroes.

***** I feel like, after 3 solid years of friendship where Ron CLEARLY SAW how much bad shit happened to/around Harry, he should have known better. He knew Harry's circumstances, his luck, his adventures, as he was there for most of them. He knew 3/3 DADA teachers almost got Harry killed or at least seriously injured (2 on purpose, even). He knew how badly Harry was hurt by the mass-shunning in 2nd year due to the Parseltongue. But Harry was okay, because Ron and Hermione stuck by him for that.

Ron KNEW Harry just wanted a normal, quiet, happy life by then. And 14, to me, was damn well old enough to think critically and intelligently, even if it was Ron doing it. Yes, being a stupid teenager, hormones, jealousy, etc factors in. But what he did was pretty shitty. Maybe not quite a 'betrayal', but certainly more than '2 teenagers have a fight'. I don't know, I personally think Harry should have hassled Ron WAY more about it.

A really good moral lesson would have been Ron not ending up romantically with Hermione but be friends with her and Harry. He should have a loving family and overall a good life, but his fuck-ups should also have consequences.

****** Here's the thing: it's canon that the only one who cared about the "death toll" aspect of the Tournament, prior to the Goblet selecting the names, was Hermione. Both Ron and Harry explicitly expressed interest in entering before their fight. For example, Ron thinks that it would be "cool" to enter, and Harry agrees, with images of winning and Cho "showing admiration" in his mind.

Ron isn't aware of any plot targeting Harry (and Harry doesn't even bother to tell Ron of the potential plot brewing against him), he just has Harry's previous comments about the Tournament to go on. Harry expressly tells Ron how he would have done it and when Harry's name pops out of the Goblet, unfortunately Ron thinks Harry betrayed him.

Ron is clearly trying to be happy for Harry. But when Ron repeats Harry's own words back to him, Harry implies that Ron is stupid. It is only after Harry reacts less than positively that Ron gives up trying to actively support his friend. However, even when they are not talking, Ron is very concerned about Harry. When Harry breaks the conversation off with Sirius, it is Harry who overreacts: he decides he hates everything about Ron, throws a badge at his head and doesn't apologize for it, starts shouting at him, and storms upstairs to the dormitory. Ron just stands there and takes it. Additionally, Ron doesn't start laughing when the Slytherins are mocking Harry - now that would be a betrayal. And yes, it was "two teenagers have a fight".

Hell, if anything, I'd argue that between the two of them, /Harry/ was the one who acted the worst during their fight.

Are you sure? I might be wrong about that, but I don't think Harry talks about those things very often. Sure, he innerly monologues about them a lot and to an aware observer the signs are definitely there, but Ron was never particularly good at reading between the lines.

IIRC Harry never outright tells Ron just how much he hates being gawked after, or just how much the Weasleys mean to him, or just how much more important his friends are to him compared to his money and admirers, and with that it's far too easy for Ron to project his own desire for recognition onto Harry.

I can tolerate fics that don't have magic so long as the characters and their personalities are intact. Provided they're decently written ofcourse.

I'm not a fan of fics that focus too much on the magic. Magic on HP is purposefully vague and myterious. Quantifying and demystifying the magic is fine by me, it's just not enough to keep my interest on its own. I don't like fics that makes me feel like I'm reading some shounen manga.

** Mugglewanking and unnecessary wizard bashing.

One of the fics I took a look at recently had the author writing that wizards believed the moon to be made of cheese.

I mean...no. Just no.

A prepubescent HG (who I've always felt to be annoying AF) says that wizards don't have an ounce of logic one fucking time, and every single fucking author decides to treat it as gospel.

FFS, magic isn't logical. Turning a matchstick into a needle isn't logical. Logic would state that such a thing is impossible. Logic would say that a man cannot become immortal as long as he drinks his special brand of coffee from an egg-sized stone.

Another thing that annoys me (although not to the same scale of mugglewanking) is the author trying to write how purebloods are a minority. I can understand that demographics, population fertility and growth aren't exactly what most people read about when they're bored, but I'll make an analogy to make it easier to understand.

Muggleborns are basically the wizarding version of immigrants. Unless a society is on a massive downward spiral as far population growth is concerned, with fertility rates well below 2.1 (and having been that way for at least a century or two), the median in the demographic will always trend towards the natives (in this case, the purebloods, because, anyone with 4 wizarding grandparents is a pureblood). The only way for MBs to be majority is if wizarding society has been on the downward spiral that Europe is going through right now and has been in that state of decline for a few generations. Either that, or someone decided to commit genocide on the PBs and HBs.

Otherwise, it is not /logical/ to assume that PBs are a minority.

Also, the Purebloods seems to have only one child, with a few exceptions like the Grenngrasses or twins like the Patils and Carrows. Then theres the fact that Pureblood extremists tend towards you needing purely wizarding ancestry. Again look towards "The Sacred 28". Finally, the amount of Pureblood families killed in the First War and the Second war would've ruined a lot of houses, if not making them extinct at the very least removing a lot of members and thus ruining their own gene pool.

Evolution happens over the course of hundreds of thousands of years. It took over a million years for modern homo sapiens to emerge from homo erectus. A completely different time scale.

Look, you could try to account for low birth rates with that list, but a sample space of 10 families is nowhere near enough to simulate the growth or decline of a society - it is like you're trying to extrapolate the data you get from one appartment building to a country the size of the UK. It will be wildly off because of the sheer scale that you're trying to extrapolate.

Also, this is a children's story. It isn't meant to be analysed in such a manner. JKR probably threw some random numbers when she was asked about it, because it's not meant to be taken in such a serious light.

I repeat - canon characters are the ones that HP bothers to notice. If he doesn't notice someone, that person doesn't show up in canon.

None of their achievements, goals, lives - apparently none of that stuff is interesting enough to make an orphan look into them. Ridiculous.

This is another pit that ff writers fall into. With the mechanics I've described, and with TFR proving that the median is shifted towards purebloods, a majority of the 50k population (at least 60-70 percent of them) is pureblooded. That's about 30 to 35k people. That's a large enough number that "inbreeding" isn't an issue. Not for the general population.

Or, if you want to ignore all that, you can take a look at all the purebloods that HP notices, and count how many of them are inbred. If memory serves, it's just 3 - Marvolo, Morfinn and Merope. They're the only ones who are really inbred. The others have no deficiencies whatsoever. (And no, Crabbe and Goyle being dumb does not make them inbred. Stupidity is independent of genetic defects)

Incorrect. While Feminism is one of the biggest causes of the decline, it isn't the only one. Another cause for declining fertility is the fact that the Western nations have made it more expensive to have children. They have all the benefits of a modern society, with healthcare, technology, security and the like, only with no one left to inherit it.

Slytherin as a nice place to be. Canonically it was a shithole infested with bigots and/or people who would stab you in the back given the chance. Literally the only decent person we know who came from there was Andromeda Black/Tonks, the odd misfit who ditched the whole thing and ran off with a man she loved. And with the exception of Pettigrew, every Death Eater we know the house of came from there (and Pettigrew turned traitor because he was afraid of dying, not because he supported the ideology).

It might be a good house to be in because it prepares you for the Darwinistic realities of life, but Harry would be sleeping with his wand under his pillow there for seven years, and that is the best case scenario. More realistically, a bunch of seventh years with family ties to the Death Eaters would decide to get revenge for their incarcerated family and simply murder him or get burned by Lily's protection.

Edit: And even if just half of the students are Death Eater wannabes, that is still more than enough to make your time there miserable. Not every Slytherin is evil, but there are enough bad apples to spoil the cake and give you food poisoning.

Slughorn. Ambitious, gluttonous, politician-like? Certainly. But jovial and friendly and overall harmless and well-meaning.

Regulus Black. Enigma. But did the right thing in the end, even when he was likely terrified.

Merlin is canonically a Slytherin and described as "Member of King Arthur's court, advocate of Muggle rights, and arguably the most famous wizard in history."

Albus Potter.

Slytherin probably wasn't a 'nice place to be' for Harry's time there, and a good bit before it. But it wasn't always awful, and likely wasn't bad in the future.

This is by far the most ridiculous arguement I've heard of. Even if Slughorn told AD, what were they going to do? They knew nothing about where the majority of the Horcruxes were - AD only finds out about the cave and shack. And the one in the shack gets him cursed to the point where he's on a timer. If Slughorn told him about horcruxes the moment LV came back, AD would have died a year earlier.

What would you say to that scenario? That's that's also Slughorn's fault, for not telling things in the proper time?

Or what about Dumbledore? He knew there was something wrong with TR during the time when the Chamber opened the first time, why didn't he take pre-emptive action then? He knew there was something off about Quirrel, why didn't he take pre-emptive action then, instead of asking Snape to "keep an eye of Quirrel"? AD got a few names from HP after the graveyard, the names of the Death Eaters - AD is the veteran of 2 wars and he didn't bother trying to kill them discretely.

Would you say that all the killings done by those people can be laid at AD's feet?

The fact that we don't get that, or even a cursory scene of a Slytherin not being a scumbag, suggests to me that JKR sort of missed her own thematic content when it came to Slytherins, and only realized at the end that, "shit, I've made these people look like absolute reprobates."

That's Snape. That's literally what Rowling was trying to do with Snape, though I'd argue she failed. They spend seven books hating and suspecting him and then he's supposed to show them that they were dead wrong in the seventh book.

I know that not all Slytherins are evil, because it's completely at odds with the thematic crux of the series, but I think it's a huge failing of the series that JKR was not able to adequately portray that.

******* First, Harry's year is an odd one out. It has to be the single most connected year to both sides of the war. So it's to be expected that the number of bad Slytherins in Harry's year is going to be high.

Second, the only Slytherins Harry ever interacts with, meaning the only ones you ever get to see, are the Death eaters, a couple professors, the ones that play Quidditch, and the ones in Harry's year. How many Slytherins can you name that were in school with Harry that don't match one of those criteria? Of the ones you can name, how many have detailed histories and personalities? Probably not very many, because if they were Slytherin but not related to the Death Eaters, they weren't relevant and weren't a focus.

Third, Harry is **/BIASED/** and so is everyone else around him. Harry */DOESN'T LIKE SLYTHERINS/* and neither does anyone else around him. Harry and everyone around him avoids Slytherins. They do not interact with Slytherins. They are not friendly with Slytherins.

Your example of Cedric does not match because Cedric was a Hufflepuff and it was to return a favor as well as being motivated by the plot. There isn't animosity between Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs that would stop Cedric and Harry from being willing to interact with each other, Harry wouldn't be likely to approach Slytherins to do them a favor, and the plot is based around Slytherins being the bad guys so Rowling wasn't going to choose a Slytherin to do something a different house could.

Everything you know about Slytherins is biased because the viewpoint you're seeing them through is biased and so are most of the characters the character you're seeing through interacts with.

The Slytherins were literally kicked out of Hogwarts when it was time for the final battle. Mcgonagall tried to make them all evacuate along with the underage students and any of age students that didn't want to fight. Further, according to JK Rowling (which admittedly I only know of because of an interview. I don't remember if it was explicitly stated in canon and if it wasn't you may or may not believe what JKR says), a good number of Slytherins came back with Slughorn and fought on the side of Hogwarts. Even further than that, fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts was restricted to of age students. Do you know who was of age at that time? Harry's year, which I've already said was likely to have an above average number of bad Slytherins.

First, I just told you that Rowling said many of them did in fact do that. Second, why would they argue to risk their lives for people that are kicking them out because they hate and don't trust them?

#+end_quote

This argument makes perfect sense. Jesus Christ, how fucking difficult is it for you to understand that they don't like each other and that the entire series is structured with the Slytherins being bad guys. They don't want to be friends. Neither house wants to be friends with the other. Harry isn't friendly with them either. They have no reason to humiliate themselves to appease him. Not being genocidal doesn't mean they want anything to do with Harry.

Also, in case you didn't notice, the vast majority of the wizarding world is not directly involved with the fight with Voldemort. By far the largest involvement we see is in the final battle when the people who fight for Hogwarts are being attacked, which brings in people who were not previously involved. Both side's main forces are very small and mostly consist of the people closest to the leaders. There's a reason most of the fighters against Voldemort were Gryffindors and it's not because Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs are all evil scum that support Voldemort. It's because the two major leaders against Voldemort, Dumbledore and Harry, both have major biases towards Gryffindor and mostly interact and target other Gryffindors. By your logic, the fact that the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs aren't practically breaking down Harry's door to ensure he knows they don't like Voldemort means they're all actually blood purists and the ones that do, like Cho and Luna just aren't "proper" Ravenclaws.

And again, the series is based around the Slytherins being the bad guys. They are not portrayed as being good guys. Any of them that aren't bad aren't going to be shown. We're seeing seven years summarized in seven books. The irrelevant pieces that don't contribute to the narrative, like the everyday interactions with Slytherins that don't result in fights aren't going to be shown.

Seriously, I want you to take a step back here and realize that you're trying to tell me that basically every Slytherin, a quarter of the population children and all, are evil.

I also noticed that you didn't reply to my point that you could only recall a few dozen people across 35 years of Slytherins.

Being Slytherin is not the reason why they are bad. They are racially motivated terrorists/fascists who happen to have shared the same Hogwarts House. And because all they all were Slytherins, being there would have sucked. As for why that is, well my theory is that their believs stop them from being sorted anywhere else, therefore Slytherin is turned into a cesspool because they fit the other houses even less. They are not Slytherins because genocide is a trait of that house, they end there because they believe in social Darwinism, which excludes Ravenclaw, and the ambition to purge a whole race is neither chivalrous nor the sign of fair play (even though an argument for "hard work" could be made).

Tl;dr: I never claimed that all Slytherins are evil, I'm saying that because we know of plenty of shitty ones and the others did not take a public stand against them, it would be a shitty place to be.

Your first comment is mostly about it being unpleasant, but it's also trying to say that all Slytherins are bad and when I focused on that aspect of it you kept up with it.

**** Just to poke at this a bit, I don't think every house uses a common dormitory for each year and gender like Gryffindor does.

Like Knifehand's Strings of Fate, I think that Hufflepuff's have dorms that if I recall correctly One prefect and one newt student has to join in with the younger years. They have individual rooms, but have their own mini common room.

The Ravenclaws I've seen some people give them their own rooms, and other's just use a dorm. The same with Slytherin. But I see both houses as a lot more individualistic then the other two and so I think they'd have their own rooms. Maybe not in their younger years but at the least at newt level, though possible at third year or fifth year as well.
