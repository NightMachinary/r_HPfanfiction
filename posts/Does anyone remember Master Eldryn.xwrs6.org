He had a few stories with interesting concepts years ago (probably over half a decade now) but he pulled his stories and disappeared. Was an amazing writer though.

Anyone remember or know where I might find those stories?


** To my surprise, Dragon's Tear can be found on scribd with a cursory google search.

I have Highway to Hell on a USB somewhere, but I'm not going to make an effort to find and share it out of respect for one of the greatest authors in the fandom. He wanted his fics to remain unpublished.

*** Would it count as publishing if you shared it with us? I mean, he couldn't ever publish it anyways considering copyright and what not...

***** No need to be condescending. I was simply wondering why he would wish to remain unpublished if he had already published them himself. I mean if they have been on the internet in the past how does it qualify as remaining unpublished to give out the stories again now? Also, why share that you had the authors works if you weren't willing to share?

****** /"I was simply wondering why he would wish to remain unpublished if he had already published them himself."/

Uhh... that's clearly NOT what you meant in your previous post. But no worries... you don't need to save face on the internet.

/"I mean if they have been on the internet in the past how does it qualify as remaining unpublished to give out the stories again now?"/

About nine years ago, there were multiple issues with plagiarism, and then banning issues with his ff.net account, so Eldryn removed his stories altogether, told his readers he didn't want to see them in print, and vanished.

Basically, people sharing his fics without his permission is what led him to rage quit the fandom. I respect his decision.

/"Also, why share that you had the authors works if you weren't willing to share?"/

Just to make you angry. :)

** I think he changed his name to Fettucini, wrote an extremely good HP fic (Knowledge is Power (Not the one by Robst), and then to Oblong.
