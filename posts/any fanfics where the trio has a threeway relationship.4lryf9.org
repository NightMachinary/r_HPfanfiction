was curious to see if anyone ever made the trio is more then a trio in one way


** There's quite a lot of them, but most of them aren't particularly good in any way. S'pose that applies to most pairings though.

  Harry has only ever loved Ron and Hermione, Ron only loved Harry and Hermione, and Hermione only loved Harry and Ron. so why should there ever be more than just the three of them?

  Eventually, they find a note tacked to the gargoyle who guards the passage to the Headmaster's office. It is in Granger's handwriting and signed by her at the bottom, and tells them that, the danger being over and the initial aftermath winding down, she feels that the three of them need some time alone to recuperate and will reappear exactly three days from that day, at four o'clock.

** I'm also looking for more Harry/Hermione/Ron threesome fics, but so far I have found only two I like:

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), has a different trio, with Theo Nott replacing Ron. Although fairly short, that story is pretty good though.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), only hints at a three way romantic relationship between the Trio. [[/spoiler][However, they did sleep together, and they accidentally created a soul bond between them while experimenting with soul magic]]

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** You and me both - as in this combination (if Ron and Harry don't become wipped!) they balance out each other's flaws (so you can basically have a trio that really amounts to something - unlike in the canon end (sorry: One of the worst endings in a book-series I've ever read...not that the last two books are all that great as whole -.-)) perfectly (Ron and Harry make short work of Hermione's total obedience toward authority and total trust in book-knowledge, Ron has the information on pureblood-culture the other two lack, Hermione makes them learn (breaks the habbit of them slacking off) and Harry destroyes the prejudices both Ron and Hermione have (both have some, not the same of course!) and acts as a buffer in what would otherwise be a relationship that IMHO has no future!)

** I'd recommend linkao3(3499913) with a fair few caveats. It really, really earns its rating - there is a lot of violent and graphic stuff here. If you can get past that, it does have a lot of juicy character stuff that is better than it has any right to be. Having said that I couldn't finish it, not because of the graphic stuff but because it is super emotionally draining to read - apparently 150k words (Not even halfway!) of everyone being a psychological basket case is my limit. Do give it a go though, if I haven't put you off it too much, there is a lot to like.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
