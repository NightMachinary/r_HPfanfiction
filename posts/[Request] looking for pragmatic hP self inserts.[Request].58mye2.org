I have read many harry potter self insert stories and I hate it when self insert tries to fix the damn wizarding world. I know that when someone is writing a self insert, one of their main reason is they want to write a fix it story but it began to make me sick of self inserts. I have read few trully good pragmatic self inserts and I want to see more. When someone falls in to the HP verse they should care about their survival than the harry fricking potter. SI should be focusing on learning to be a reality bender. plot can go fuck itself.prophecy can go fuck itself. Dumb-as-door can go shove his prophecy where sun doesn't shine. when you have magic like charms transfiguration and Runes to give reality middle finger all you need is one genre savvy person to take advantage of their stupidity. use meta knowledge correctly. Don't tell any body your secrets. And can somebody tell me why every insert fears legimency from snape and dumbledore ? I mean, I get that they have knowledge that could change that worlds future but HOW MANY times that you encounter snape and dumbledore ? Only times you face dumbledore is the dinner and breakfeast times at great hall and in those times he is more interested in his food than to mind rape eleven years of kids. If he wanted to mind rape you he would call a staff member or a prefect to fetch you from your class and when you are with him he would imperio/confundus/laced candies/mindrape you. With snape, he only have classes with you for two hours in whole week. he would prefer to glare at harry and terrify griffindors to use legimency on you. Don't be a little shit to him,try you best in his class, do your homework and don't look him in the eyes. that is all you need to be left alone from him.He doesn't give a shit about his students to take safety protocols when teaching about potions. why would he care about what is in your head ? when a self inserts tries to abuse his knowledge and do something for himself he is called a dark wizard.

No I'm not kidding. I have seen a self insert fanfic that have done that. In a world with reality bending powers when a self insert tries to make money or gain power with their meta knowledge, he or she is called morally corrupt.

Can you guys and gals recommend few SIs that doesn't give a fuck about plot and tries to befriend golden trio?

Sort of what you're looking for, but it isn't complete and may be dead.

*** I remember this one. I thought it was kind of a disappointment actually. Also I vaguely remember one where a SI becomes Ron Weasley and ends up in Slytherin if that rings any bells for people.

*** I have actually read this one. It's not bad at all but what I'm looking for is more along the lines of Hiver from spacebattles style and Gothicjedi666 from fanfiction.net but with more using meta knowledge and more self centered. what I'm looking for in a SI is that they should mostly care about themselfs. Make themselfs powerful enough that they could face voldemort and not die for 15 minutes ( SI should be powerful enough to do that. not that he should.why need fancy dueling when you could use a sniper rifle and keeping him/herself out of conflict and safe.) I dont want any noble crap. I have seen weasley in slytherin too but it is too short for my liking. thank you though for trying :D

** Not on topic, just an aside, but when I hear the term "self insert" I always briefly imagine a physically impossible form of single character porn fic.
