In canon, Harry gets a bunch of letters because he missed the first one (cant remember why). What if another character missed the letter? What if Draco got letter bombed? Just am idea for a crack fic/one shot.


** You can't remember why Harry didn't get his first letter? I'll give you a hint: the Dursley's really hate magic.

***** Thanks. I wonder why he got letter bombed then. Harry read it. Did magic sense that no action would be made?

******** Then they send a professor--which is what happened to Harry, but because it's a story, they sent Hagrid instead, since he already had an errand to run for Dumbledore.

****** He is also famous, so that could be a part of it. Imagine the chaos if Harry Potter never rejoined the magical world. I doubt the government would ever allow such a thing to happen.

******* So what do you think would happen to a muggle born that thought it was a prank letter? Would they get letter bombed?

******** Possibly, but if the magic recognized Harry as not a muggle born, it might have thought that there would be no problems with sending so many letters. If it sensed a muggle born, it would know not to be so flashy with it in order to preserve the Statue of Secrecy.

********* True. I dont know if this is canon, but I know many authors write that Hermione got a visit from McG because Hermione was muggleborn. Does that mean anything? So far we know that Harry gets a bunch of letters because he didnt reply to the initial one, he is not muggleborn, and a member of staff wasnt needed yet. Have I missed anything? Thanks for your thoughts.

********** Hagrid was also sent to introduce Harry, which I doubt was a normal occurrence. Hagrid doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who would do such a thing, as he would probably once in awhile just ramble on about his pets /cough fluffy cough/ and scare the children, and would probably forget to explain a few things. Also in book one, Hagrid wasn't a professor yet, but still just the Keeper of the Keys/Groundskeeper. This could possibly point towards some special treatment, though maybe not.

*********** See I never understand why its Hagrid. I mean, besides Harry realizing later on about when the stome got stolen from gringotts. I feel like that feels like a start to a god dang rpg game. I mean, why not Vector, or Babbling perhaps? Really any other competent teacher.

*********** Special treatment? What type of special treatment leaves someone nore illprepared than usual? That aside, many fics make a good point- what were dumbledor's intentions when he sent Hagrid? It is believed that he always knows what he is doing, so what was he doing? A lotnof questions could be asked, and the fanfiction community has come up with many solutions. In some ways it would be cool to know what JK intended. But at the same time, I think I would prefer it if it was just a loose end.

************ Special treatment does not necessarily mean better treatment, just different. I don't know what the intent there was, but it seemed awfully convenient to me.

************* I guess it was probably just JKR setting some stuff up, like Hagrid and Harry's friendship. Yeah I know special doesnt always mean good. You would hope that Harry would be treated well (in the wizarding world) because of his status. Obviously not.

************** Your probably right. Hagrid does a good job though as a plot device. He highlights just how different and, dare I say it, magical the magical world really is by being an example of something new and exciting. Harry's status as a celebrity also works to show the differences from his precious life, but is later used to add some conflict to the series. JKR was most likely trying to set up the scene for the unveiling of the magical world. The letters were probably part of this too.

*************** Very true. You can image that there is a deeper meaning to such things, but often, certain scenes and situations in stories are exactly what they first appear to be. The letter and Hagrid opening scenes are exactly that I guess. Although it is fun to delve deeper into the lore than even the author, sometimes, you end up having pointless, unanswerable questions. Thanks for all your thoughts on the topic!
