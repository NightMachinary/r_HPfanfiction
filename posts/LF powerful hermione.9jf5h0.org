In the past few days I've devoured most of the dark powerful hermione fics. Starting from Reign of the serpent to Applied Cultural Anthropology I've read most of 'em. Mostly the greatest dark, slytherin hermione fics recommended here tho. Any more great recommendations? Preferably no pairing but I ain't a chooser.

Also is Reverse by Lady Moonglow worth it? I've only read the first chapter and the whole Ron calling her pet thing really irked me but I'm starting to see good reviews of that here so...


** Some [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics feature a darker Hermione than others. In particular, in linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) she studies and performs some very Dark magic to kill Voldemort, and linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) she leads a group of Muggleborn guerilla fighters, whose first act is to bomb the Malfoy Manor during a ball (which Malfoy was using to recruit for Voldemort)---and supplement the bombs with napalm, to make sure there are no survivors.

*** Hermione in Starfox5's fics is not really very powerful, but tends to always make the right decisions.

For example in both "Patron" and "Divided" you mentioned, she would not be able to beat Harry or most veteran Death Eaters in straight duels, even though she made for a very effective killer.

**** I am not actually sure whether or not she could beat Harry in a straight duel in /Patron/, but then, it's been a while. In any case, she can construct a ritual that lets her take your weakest blood relative and kill you and your whole family through them.

In /Divided/, I would count those who would obey her orders as a part of her "power".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), has relatively the most powerful Hermione I've ever read. Not only did she invent tons of new spells and rituals, but also carried the war mostly on her back.

Although the Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341;7718942), seems ridiculously overpowered compared to her canon version, there were others higher on the food chains here.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** /Reverse/ is well-written, but... It's not a big spoiler to say that Hermione ends up in a world where Dumbledore decided to Muggleise the wizarding world, which apparently required getting everyone to practice Dark Arts. I can see how it explains Gryffindors becoming vicious and mean; but how did it make the Slytherins virtuous and nice?

It's celebrated as one of the greatest works of Dramione 'shipping, but how much of a 'ship is it really, if Draco's personality had to be rewritten from scratch to make it happen?
