I wanna read a story where Hermione stayed a catgirl, what stories like that do you know?


** There was one called "Nocturnal" on Fanficton.net. I believe it had no smut, but it's been ages since I read it, so I don't remember for sure.

  It all started with the Polyjuice Incident. Second-year Harry and Hermione star in a very surreal romantic comedy. Featuring Ron "Lovable Comic Relief" Weasley and Luna "Not Dating Ron in my Stories" Lovegood. Overhauled in 2014.

** Due to no underage sex rule, no links from me. There is "Harry potter: nekos mate" and one from gandalfs beard. I think the one on ffn is without smut. There is also linkffn(the best laid plans) -shouldnt be smut in this one.

  Madara had a plan. The Yondaime ruined it. Madara made another plan. One that could not fail. But the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry and this one had just run straight into the number one most surprising ninja in Konoha, one Uzumaki Naruto.

  After Hermione's second year she is now stuck with cat ears and a tail. When she goes home her parents learn about her boyfriend Harry, how will this affect things going forward. A different storyline with not one but three Dark-lords. Will our hero prevail and if he can will he make it through unscathed? All chapters have now been beta read and edited
