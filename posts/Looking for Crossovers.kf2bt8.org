Hi I'm looking for Harry Potter Crossovers! My other main fandoms are Sherlock, Marvel Cinematic Universe, Game of Thrones and the Hobbit. but I'm not afraid to read Fics that crossover with worlds I'm not familiar with.

And of course I will rec a few of my favourite crossovers I have already read! For most of these you don't need to be familiar with the second fandom.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11255223/1/The-Wizard-of-Harrenhal][The Wizard of Harrenhal]] by Disobedience writer. HP/Game of Thrones crossover. Harry wakes up in westeros and decides to try and return magic to the world. Shenanigans ensue. Gen. Complete. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]] by Esama. HP/Sherlock. Harry finds himself in a world without magic, and makes his living as a medium. He catches the eye of Mycroft Holmes. Slash. Complete. AO3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard][Revenge of the Wizard]] by DarthMars. Hp/Star wars. When earth is raided and most of the population are captured taken to be slaves for an alien corperation, Harry stages a breakout. He goes on a revenge bender that reaches across the galaxy. M/f Unfinished. FFnet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/][I see the moon]] by hctiB_notsoB. HP/Marvel Cinematic Universe. Bruce banner meets a strange man who's not all that sane. He discovers that this man is more than he seems. Gen. Incomplete. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11426651/1/A-Child-Avenged][A Child Avenged]] by pandawearsglasses. HP/Avengers. Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them. Oneshot. Gen. FFnet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13220537/1/][A Wand for Skitter]] by ShayneT. HP/Worm (but you don't have to be familiar with Worm). Waking in the body of a murdered child, Taylor Hebert, once a super villain and later a super hero must discover who has been killing muggleborns while being forced to go to Hogwarts, among groups who are the most likely suspects. Gen. Complete. FFNet.

I'm up for pretty much anything oneshot/complete/unfinished/abandoned.


** Well, if you like the Hobbit, then no list would be complete without mentioning linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar). It's mostly set well before that, but recent chapters have started to catch up with canon events, like the dwarves' war against Azog the defiler (about fifty years before the Hobbit). Incomplete but active.

And I'm not sure which Sherlock you prefer, but linkffn(A Study in Magic) is a crossover with a modern version, where Sherlock and a female John have adopted Harry after rescuing him in the aftermath of a trap from Moriarty. Complete and quite long, with a sequel.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** My favorite two crossovers are:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) - this is about a Dungeons and Dragons character getting dropped into the Harry Potter setting through a ritual - it's great, both for if you know D&D and if you don't. Lots of humor, a good plot, and with lots of hijinks. Not completed/abandoned :(.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) - This one is a small series of fics with Harry Potter/Dresden Files crossover. It's also quite good, even if you haven't read the Dresden Files (I haven't either), and has Harry with a slightly different kind of magic. Naturally, as it involve Harry making a pact with a Fallen Angel, it's a little bit edgy and has a good bit of violence - but it's quite well written, it's one of the only fics that does Dumbledore justice alongside a super powerful Harry, and it's got great fight scenes.

***** If anything I'm understating its problems.

Smut, sure, okay, authors who want to write them can do that, I'm just pointing out that the smut scenes don't contribute to the plot at all. The author just stuck them in to show off what a womanizer Harry is.

Yeah, that character canonically loses her virginity early. So what? Firstly, she lost her virginity to a boy similar in age, and secondly, that's not really an excuse. Harry comes from a modern world and he should understand with all of his rationalist glory that he's forcing unhealthy relationships on a girl barely into her teens. I don't really think there's an excuse not to be a child groomer.

And finally, genocide is 'needed'. Really? How is it needed? Harry literally fed a young teenage boy to a dragon as a snack just because he was Dothraki, a teenager who doesn't know better than what he's told by his elders. Yes they're slavers, yes they're cruel, but for someone of Harry's power genocide is not the 'only' option. Or are you telling me that the person who values education above all else, the person who transformed the wildlings - several hundred isolated tribes that can't honor agreements and practice kidnapping as their marital ritual - into a somewhat civilized state, can't bring a positive influence to the Dothraki?

Yeah, no. Both the MC and the author are sociopaths.
