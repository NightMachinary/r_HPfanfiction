I see these referenced but I don't know what they mean- Harry is an aristocrat? Harry is the new Voldemort? What is these terms meant to signify?


** Dark Lord Potter is another community site. It is known for being a rather harsh and perhaps elitist group but maybe with reason. Many of the best authors we've had over the years have or have had a presence there and the WBA section is somewhere where work can be critiqued and checked.

Lord Potter is a trope and you're right to think it has things to do with Aristocracy. In the books the house of Black is called ancient and noble. People have taken the noble part and run with it. Now it could be an interesting premise that there is wizarding nobility, in fact Taure was recently talking about a version of this from himself. That being said, many people use it simply to make Harry 'better'. He can be richer and more influential without any effort on his or the authors behalf. It is frequently used to make Harry's life easier leading to dull stories where there is no challenge. This poor writing has lead to the whole concept being looked down upon.

**** Most Ancient is a muggle phrase. We're the Noble and Ancientest House of Black.

**** I think a fanfiction author could reasonably take the "noble and most ancient house" quote as mocking or truth. There's room for interpretation in my opinion.

** DLP is a great site. I was unfortunately banned from it because I can't keep my mouth shut on IRC and ended up insulting one of the admins, but that's on me. If I could use it for fanfiction, I would, and I recommend it to others.

** Dark Lord Potter(DLP for short) is a fairly old community site. They're known for being heavily critical for both their entrance requirements and their opinions on what make a good story. Basically, if a story has Lord Potter, Diagon Alley shopping montage, nice goblins, or evil Dumbledore, DLP will automatically label them shit - whether they are good or not. It is understandable, considering that I can count the truly /good/ Evil Dumbledore and Lord Potter stories that I have read with my fingers.

This doesn't make DLP hypocrites though, it does make them somewhat elitist, however. The writers there are among the best writers the HP FF community has to offer, and they have a keen eye for finding good stories - which they've additionally posted in the various subsections of the forum. I highly recommend taking some time to read some of the stories posted there.

** As many users have already explained what DLP is, I'll link a few of their resources where I have found great fics.

The top fics as rated by DLP on fanfiction.net - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Link]]

A DLP search engine created by a user there - [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Link to Scryer]]

The search engine is particularly useful if you filter by DLP Review Score

DLP critiques harshly, almost to the point of being caustic. You can pretty much count on the 4 and 5 star ratings being some of the best fics this fandom has to offer and even most of the 3 star fics are head and shoulders above 90% of the majority of fanfiction.

*** Is DPL kind of a male domain ? For fanfic, I mean. The top fics are all widely respected and good-- but with sharper edges and less emotionality is typical. Lots of drunk Sirius and battle scenes .

My favorites are Stages of Hope and Hermione Grangers Cranmer for Delinquents on the Run. Different vibe.

*** That's not quite true, DLP (Dark Lord Potter) is typically fine with any trope as long as it's done well. The reason that DLP hates some tropes is that the vast, vast majority of those tropes are indicators of a bad story.

For instance, try and remember a good story, not a story that you like because it uses the tropes you like in the way you like, but a genuinely well written fic that follows the Lord Potter inheritance from the goblins trope, the Diagon Alley shopping montage trope, or the Dumbledore is evil trope. If you can think of more than 2 I'd be blown away.

These are the kind of tropes DLP (stereo-typically) dislikes; tropes that, for one reason or another, seem to either inspire poor writing or that are appealing to people that are bad authors.

**** Black Luminary does a good job so far, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary]]). It's cheesy at times, but the world building is just fantastic so far!
