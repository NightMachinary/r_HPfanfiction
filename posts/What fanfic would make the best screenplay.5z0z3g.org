Suppose J.K decided to take the best fanfic and turn it into a movie?

Which would be best movie material?


** Linkffn(the skitterleap) would be best for a non stop action war movie.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the forests of valbone) would be a nice adventure/action/coming of age movie.

A lot of fanfics are way too long and have far too much plot for a movie, but might be good tv series. Linkffn(a long journey home) might be similar to the outlander tv show in the time travel setups.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
