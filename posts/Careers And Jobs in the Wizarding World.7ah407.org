What are your favourite careers and jobs you've seen mentioned in fics or in elements of fanon? Anything in the canon you wish we'd see more of or see explored more?

Everyone and their mam is an Auror in fanfic, it seems, and a similar popularity seems to be in the Healer and teaching professions - have you seen any interesting spins on these?


** I didn't want to put a huge wall of text in the main post, but these are just a few thoughts I've had already:

- /Writing/. We see journalists and a fair few textbook writers. Flourish and Blotts is a business doing very well, with book-signings and all sorts.
- /Law Enforcement./ The Magical Law Enforcement Office seems fairly big, as they cover both Aurors and Hitwizards and will likely have people internally too.
- /Government Employees./ The Ministry has dozens of offices under its purview.
- /Unspeakable Things./
- /Music/. The Weird Sisters and Celestina Warbeck both come immediately to mind.
- /Agriculture/. Food is coming from somewhere, as we know that food cannot be conjured from nowhere. Are wizarding farms different to Muggle farms? Is the technique different, or is the food produced drastically different? What about potions ingredients?
- /Animal breeding./ This is really a subset of agriculture in some ways, but we also have to look at the pet industry.
- /Herbology./ People love to have a flourishing garden - are private gardens important? Do people often want to improve as herbologists or hire people to come in and sort out their gardens? What about invasive species and magical pest control?
- /Brewing/. Somebody has to put together the potions people buy, whether they be cleaning products, Sleek-Eazy shampoo or medications. Are they done in big labs with huge cauldrons, or is that for some reason infeasible? Perhaps the jobs are privately contracted out?
- /Education./ We know that Hogwarts is the big boarding school, but there are probably tutors as well - particularly for disciplines not covered at Hogwarts, such as language acquisition and music, which seems to be covered as an extra curricular.
- /Religious Leadership./ According to JKR, all kinds of religions exist within the HP universe, but I imagine magical religious leaders are quite different to their Muggle counterparts. How do the magical leaders fit in with their framework? Wizarding Catholics, for example - is the Pope in on the Statute of Secrecy? Is there a separate branch of the church? How are teachings different for wizards - would we recognize a wizarding rabbi or imam or priest, or would they look drastically different?
- /Transport./ So, who designs brooms? Is the Knight Bus an independent business, or is it run by a framework? What about the Floo Network, who governs that? Who maintains it?
- /Banking./ Gringotts is obviously the main wizarding bank, but how many humans do they hire? We know Bill Weasley was a cursebreaker for them, but Gringotts get hold of Muggle money and presumably have to have /some/ connection with the Muggle world for that, etc.
- /Sports./ The sports industry seems heavily centred on Quidditch, but there are a lot of elements to that - advertising, management, training, branding, pitch care, etc.
- /Radio./ The Wizarding Wireless Network seems relatively important in the war, but even before then it's often in the background - Molly listens to it, for example. What sort of programming do they have? Are people salaried, or is it all voluntary? Is it international, or within the UK?
- /Building./ The Weasleys seem to have added a lot of bits to their own house, but what about wizarding houses in general? Are there builders who specialize in extensions or warding or the like? How long does it take to add to a home or build one? How big is the industry? What sort of materials do they need? Is there a lot of Ministry oversight?

**** I have to wonder what wizarding entertainment is like, too.

We know that they unsuccessfully tried to do a play of the Fountain of Fair Fortune at Hogwarts, but I wonder if the wizarding theatre is any good? Musicals, operas, radio plays?

What about zoos or circuses?

A magizoologist might happily study in the wild, but I have to wonder if there are any conservationist efforts - a la Brandon Mull's Fablehaven, perhaps!

*** You forgot things like art, enchanting, and the various craftsmanship disciplines like metalworking, leatherworking, woodworking, weaving, sewing, cobbling, etc. We know that magic can give a single worker the production ability of a team of muggles for complex objects, and a small factory for simpler objects. Thus any job that requires even the slightest bit of creativity or allows even a drop of artistic liberty is a wizard's dream.

Also, to transport, you should add shipping. No doubt English wizards are too lazy to wait for their fancy international goods to be shipped to them via normal muggle means. There are probably people who spend all day portkeying crates of goods around the world or carrying enchanted cases (like Newt Scamander's briefcase) with an ungodly amount of goods inside.

** I liked the random summer jobs that Harry does in linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom). At one point, he has to do lots of hiking in the forest and remote land to put up warding posts (that are sticks that you put in the ground that expand to warding posts when you put them in) among a perimeter to seperate werewolf colony territory from non werewolf territory.

Then he acts as a parseltongue translator for a bunch of researchers who study and take care of various animals and creatures.

He is also an office clerk to an international affairs/wizarding office and has to act as a German translator and Britain ambassator at some point.

** Interestingly, in canon, the British Wizarding World is simultaneously the size of a large town or small city, yet has such diversity in its range of possible careers (despite what fanon says about everyone being a ministry bureacrat), and almost all of its people pass through such a small school with fairly generalised education that acts as their secondary education.

But more on topic, I find the idea of spellcrafters a fascinating profession.

** odd potion ingredients have to come from somewhere. I like to imagine things like "Essence of X" requires a lot of work.

Essence of Death : hide jugs of binding agent the the attics or basements of convalescent homes and hospitals. visit annually to test the saturation levels. once a binding agent is saturated it needs to be refined with catalysts and separation rituals on specific days of the year or locations on the planet and you end up with small amounts of other essences and industrial 'taint'.

similar levels of convolution exist for all kinds of ingredients. each step of the process requires people who can do their specific task competently. there are so many varied tasks that can be focused on that they all just get group together under the job title of "Artisan".

**** Transfigured stuff /does/, however. I, like many, believe that the bulk of the raw materials (including the food) is just bought from the muggle world.

"Making clothes" falls within "shop owner": if you want to buy wizarding clothes in Britain, you go to Madam Malkin's, Diagon Alley, end of story. (/Maybe/ there's another tailor in Hogsmeade.) Same for potions ingredients (I think the same people growing them sell them).

***** But a shop owner might need employees for managing finances (secretary) or assisting in making the products (craftsmen). If they don't make their own materials, then they need someone to make those. If they sell internationally, they need someone to ship the goods. If they need specialized tools for their craft, they need someone to make those. They probably didn't build their shop. They didn't make the floo powder their customers use to get there.

Also, we know that some transfigurations undo when the caster dies - Slughorn's fish from Lily comes to mind. Whether or not this applies to all transfigured items is unknown, but the fact that an item is transfigured leaves them vulnerable to untransfiguration. It is very likely that the highest-quality products are those made of real, non-transfigured material assembled in magical ways (e.g. you use an enchanted needle to sew real thread into real cloth).

****** For the materials: I repeat that I'm a firm believer that they just buy from the muggle world. The tools are bought from another shop, naturally. The building itself was either passed down since before Christ (see Ollivanders), or bought from muggles in the first place. Floo Powder is issued by a Ministry department, I believe.

The fish is not in the books but only in the movie, and seems to contradict how transfiguration works in the books; though it is true that it could be untransfigured.

******* I don't really understand why they'd buy stuff from Muggles, though. Like, firstly, many wizards would NOT be cool with that - they don't even want Muggleborn MAGICALS in their community, let alone forcing an actual business relationship with Muggles.

Besides, Muggles wouldn't farm most of the things wizards would need. Pumpkins, for example, seem pretty damn huge with wizards, and just look at potions ingredients or the bizarre things people need for other stuff, and I imagine they have very different standards for butchery and farming than Muggles do.

Wizard farms wouldn't have the same constraints when it came to space or volume, and it makes a lot of sense to me that they'd have their own farms very separate from Muggle taints, like. Even if the farms are worked by Squibs or wizards with very little magic, I can see them being preferable to Muggle things.

Do you realize what a few selected compulsion charms can do on those muggles? Do you have any idea at what price we can get the materials from those idiots?".

Potions ingredient are another matter entirely; I was talking about food and raw materials.

Also, wizards with "little magic" = not a thing. As Rowlign put it, "you're magical or you're not" and there's no such thing as "not very magical"; it's all a matter of knowledge and skill with a wand.

********* But Muggles are dirty.

Like, that's genuinely what a lot of the pureblood wizards would think - Muggles are filthy and stupid. They don't want a tiered world with Muggles being their slaves, because Muggles are genuinely worthless to them; they want to be completely /separate/ from Muggles.

These people don't even know what Muggle money looks like, why the Hell are they going to care about the prices they can get for things?

Food and raw materials are not "another matter" from potions ingredients. For a big jaw of a beetle eyes, think about how many beetles you would need to breed, given how beetles have /two eyes/ each. You can't do that in the back of an apothecary. That would need to be done somewhere specialized in a farming facility. Potions ingredients /are/ raw materials.

And okay, stupid wizards, then. The idiots who barely come out of Hogwarts with 2 O.W.L.s, if that's how you want to look at it. Not everybody is going to be able to be a super-duper-magical-special-hitwizard. Not everybody is even able to be a clerk in a government job.

Like, you can't brush off the wizarding world as something where only great wizards who're very intelligent exist - that would be a fucking dystopia.

What information do we have to support your view of the pureblood mind? Sure, that's how the /Gaunts/ thought, but they were inbred extremists who were also cut off from wizarding society as a whole (I'm not sure any of them ever even went to Hogwarts). Voldemort's agenda, and by extension the Death Eaters', did seem to be taking over the muggles rather than exterminating them --- mass murder and pillage being a perks during the war that the large "population" of muggles could handle. But even ignoring that, I'm not saying the average Knockturn Alley resident would be okay with what I'm talking about. But I'm saying someone like Lucius Malfoy definitely would be. And once one Slytherin smartarse started smuggling ill-gotten muggle goods for cheap, wizarding competition couldn't handle it.

But according to Rowling, while you cannot /transfigure/ edible food (and that would presumably extend to potion ingredients as well), it is possible to increase its quantity. Starting with two beetle eyes, a wizard could easily get a jar of them.

And moreover, Lucius Malfoy is exactly who I'm thinking of. These people don't know what trousers are, or what Muggle money looks like, or anything similar - if they wanted to bridge the gap between Muggles and wizards, they WOULD. There'd be evidence of it. Sure, the wizarding radio exists, and we have stuff like the train and the camera, but for all we know wizards genuinely think /they/ invented those things.

The majority of wizards, even those that work closely with Muggles like Arthur Weasley, don't seem to know the simplest, most basic things. They couldn't possibly scheme to take advantage of Muggle resources - they don't even realize the Muggles have any!

I'm not saying he has any idea what a computer is, but muggles were already farming the lands before the Statute of Secrecy even existed (and in those days, I'm sure most wizards either bought fair and square from the farmers, or Imperiused them into giving them what they wanted; certainly no proud wizard would have lowered himself to working the land). Actively wanting to bridge the technological gap, and knowing muggles produce stuff and it's easy to use magic to steal it from them, are two different things.
