** Aberforth would have a lot of less nerve for all the drama and nonsense and focus completely at the task at hand, meaning being a headmaster. Snape being a bully to students, either clean up your act immediately or pack your bag, the potion post isn't cursed, shouldn't be too difficult to get somebody else. Hagrid, I like you, but we need to talk about a lecture plan and for the love of god, here is someone that knows something about teaching and you know stuff about the animals, together you make one competent teacher.

And yes Flitwick every students should learn how to clean a goat shelter quickly, really you should teach them useful things

*** By the time Albus's sabbatical is done, Aberforth's tenure as headmaster has produced a record year for OWLs and NEWTs. They want him to keep the job and Albus is rather forlorn.
