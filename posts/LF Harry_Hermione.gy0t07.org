I'm looking for a few good we'll written Harry/Hermione fics. I do a have requests though. No character bashing please (Weasley, Dumbledore, etc) unless it's normal canon hate, like Snape and Malfoy. It has its place but when Harry is paired with Hermione it just feels like an easy way out of the Ron/Hermione relationship. I'd prefer longer fics, I don't mind shorter ones if they are excellent but over 100,000 words if possible. Other than that I'm open to anything!

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power he knows not. First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.

** Portkey was a site explicitly for HHr shippers from when the books were still coming out, and there's an archive of it available. Ron bashing is pretty rare there.

Some great fics are [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/4723][Magic Never Dies]], [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]], and [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6070][Off-balance]]

I also really like these:

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

linkffn(Soul Thief by Walter Sobchak)

linkffn(The Purple Potion by B.B.Ruth)

My caveats might be that Lady Thief doesn't follow canon characterization that well, Soul Thief looks like it might be Ron bashing at one point but it isn't, and Purple Potion I think makes him look like a bit of a twat but like, within acceptable levels. He's understandably miffed at Harry for something. If like, Harry Crow is a 10/10 for Ron bashing, Deathly Hallows is a 3 and this is a 2

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
