Hey all, I recently finished reading Red X Rising which is a Naruto/Teen Titans fic, and it made me think of you all. What are your favorite Fandoms outside Harry Potter? Why? Mine are DC (Young Justice, Teen Titans, and Batman especially) and Naruto. I love these because of the possibilities. I love the fact that you can have a story of Naruto using the sharingan. I love the fact that you could have a story where the Joker and The Mad Hatter team up against the Batfamily all because Nightwing fell in love with Harley. (Harleywing series. BEST EVER) So tell me friends, what is your favorite Fandoms and why?


** I don't have any other fandoms.

Its odd, i don't embrace anything like i embrace Harry Potter, nothing has ever made me want to go and read more about it outside cannon existance. Harry Potter is unique in that repect.

** I'm currently hooked on anything related to Worm, a web novel about superheroes and super villains. It's always been a compelling setting because of the characters who inhabit it. For example, super powered characters receive their power after traumatic events - it sounds like it should create a planet of angsty woobies, but it's played maturely and gives many main characters a compelling back story. Even besides from that, few people hold the idiot ball, everyone has real reasons for what they do and why they are who they are.

** Star Wars does it for me, always. It was my first fandom, even when I didn't know what a fandom was. I'd spend hours on dialup trolling old message boards and fan sites while reading Young Jedi Knight books in middle school. (These books actually got me into reading in the first place, good old SWYA Books.) I met some really great friends by being involved in the Star Wars fandom too.

It has some great fics and novels and movies and some not so great ones, but the epic ancient/futuristic vibe in that universe is awesome. They've had space travel (in the old EU at least) for more than 35,000 years come the movies. So much history there, and such a huge world(s) to explore. Plus the whole clashing spiritual philosophies thing is always fun to read. Just an epic, epic fandom.

Basically if they put the Star Wars logo on something, then I want them to take my money.

** Legend of Korra is my all time favourite, probably. Amazingly built world, great characters, endless fanfic possibilities.

I enjoy vast worlds in general. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings (the entire east is more or less untouched by stories), The Elder Scrolls (most amazing Lore out there, imo),...

Also, I deliberately avoid getting into fanfic of any fandoms other than HP and Worm, because otherwise, I'd never get anything done.

** EXO. It's a Korean pop band, and while I understand how writing and reading fics about existing people might be weird, I honestly see it as being about the images and personalities they put up for the fans, not the real breathing people. The Korean music scene is really, really different from that of the west, so in my mind it makes sense to separate the image from the person. That being said, I have never read a better and more thought-out fic than Arbitrage by fumerie. I don't even read fics anymore, apart from an occasional bored evening, but that fic will forever be imprinted in my mind as something incredible. Basically all my favorite fics come from the exo fandom.

** I'm beginning to enjoy some of the DC comics universe fan fiction. It's a large universe and has a lot of interesting things in it. There are tons of opportunities for people to pick out just the things they're interested in and run with them. Or they can mash tons of things together to yield a canon-compatible story that goes far beyond what DC's authors ever envisioned (aka munchkining).

** Let's see.. After HP, Naruto is probably 2nd in good fics. Many gems. Other than that.. Well, I've read some Percy Jackson, but never any good ones, its a fandom filled mostly with shit.. Same as Pokemon.

A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones has a few good fics, I guess. And League of Legends has a few readable ones. For the most part though, the only fanfiction fandoms with enough readable quality fics to keep me hooked is Naruto and Harry Potter.

** Dishonored. I haven't actually read that many fics, but I haunt [[/r/dishonored]] and lurk around the tumblr part of that fandom. There's some awesome art and I love the headcanons and AU ideas that people come up with (even when they're heartwrenchingly sad). It's the only thing that comes close to my interest in Harry Potter; all other fandoms I merely dip into briefly to read a couple of short fics.

** Mine are Percy Jackson, Star Wars and Eragon.

I loved Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series and the fandom, while repetitive and clich√©d a lot of the time, has a few stunning pieces of work.

Star Wars has always been a big thing for me. The first time I really got into the fandom was after playing Star Wars KotOR, I really wanted to read about Revan and Bastila, with the whole Light/Dark thing they have going it leads to some fantastic character building. And it's Star Wars so the action is always great.

I got into the Eragon fandom when I was just looking for something to read and after a quick search I found Reversed Life (See link below) which is truly one of the best things I have ever read.

[[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/36enjr/what_are_your_favorite_nonhp_fics_rhpfanfiction/crhfa2u][Here]] is a link to a comment I made with recommendations although most of them are Percy Jackson.

*** I am a fan of some of the Star Wars fics, especially Revan. I love how Revan was portrayed in KotOR. Also I liked Percy Jackson, but not enough for the fandom to guide me into its arms. Eragon...Eragon after meeting the Author, (and actually having coffee with him) plus the emotional ties I have with the series, it would have to be nearly perfect fanfiction for me to read it.

Seriously though. It's easily as good as the original.

  Eragon never lived in Carvahall, but his half-brother, Murtagh did. Instead, Eragon took on the name of another as he bares the crest of the Empire, willingly, but will that change once he finds out for himself the choices he didn't know that exist?

Words: 578,181 and Complete with an actual Eragon/Arya pairing.

As for Star Wars...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6405545/1/At-the-Heart][At the Heart]] is my favourite of all the KotOR fics.

  AU: What if Revan was aware of Malak's impending betrayal? What if he was aware of the Jedi Strike Team's attempt to kill him? What if he had captured Bastila instead of the other way around? How will it have changed Galactic History? DSM Revan/Bastila

*** In regards to PJO, have you ever been to the PJO/HP xover page in ffnet lately(or ever)? It's disappointing that a fandom as large as that, and has a sizable number of xover fics, can't seem to write anything past the HoO crowd (+ whoever) protecting HP and co.

Moving on from that... thanks for the recs :) Personally, my favorite PJO fanfic would have to be Uphill and Against The Wind, probably because of the last conversation between Apollo and Harry before it got abandoned.

**** The crossover fandom is f*cking annoying. All anyone seems to write about is HoO guys helping Harry defeat Voldemort or Percy/Annabeth coming to teach DADA.

There are a few good original ones but I really can't be bothered searching for them, it's almost as depressing as sorting on Harry Potter Fanfiction.net for "Complete" and "Newest".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9199184/1/Danielle-and-the-Hunters-of-Artemis][This]] is one of the best PJO/HP crossovers but unfortunately not complete and it is probably abandoned.

  First story I'm putting on this website. When Danielle Potter was thrown out of Potter Manor in favor of her 'boy-who-lived' brother, she meets a certain group of man hating Hunters who take her to America. Welcome to the world of the gods, young witch. Twin story, girl-who-lived, minor bashing of Dumbledore and Potters.
