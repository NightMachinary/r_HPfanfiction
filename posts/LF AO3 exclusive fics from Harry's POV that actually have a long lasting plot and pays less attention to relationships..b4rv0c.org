I'd prefer no romance but that'd probably leave me with nothing to read. It's why I've totally ignored Harry Potter(or most fandoms really) on AO3. Its bloody hard to find a fic there that's not a ship fic, smutfic, hurt/comfort fic or fluff fic. I like character interaction but not when it's the sole draw.


** I'm not sure what type of fics you like, but here are some that don't focus on relationships:

Linkao3(The Sum of Their Parts)

Linkao3(The Definition of Normal) series

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) series

Linkao3(World in Pieces)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  Nothing is simple, after the war. Nothing changes, not very much, after the war is over. The slightest pull and the threads that have held their fragile peace together for so long will all unravel. In Azkaban, a Death Eater prepares to set the wizarding world on fire.It all starts with one man picking up his quill to write.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.
