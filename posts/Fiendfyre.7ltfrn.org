Since the incantation is unknown, what is the best one you've come across and/or the one you use/made?

I use "Ignis Irae" or Fire of Wrath


** I would call it Fire of Greed, actually. It consumes everything in its path.

*** Something along the lines of Ignis Avaritia?

** I always have this image in my mind of a mad Tom Riddle screaming "BURN!" and fiendfyre bursting out of his wand.

** I take the "it doesn't have to be grammatically correct or even etymologically consistent" approach to incantations.

The incantation I use in my fics for Fiendfyre is "Terror infernus".

** The good ones I remember are; Morsfyr, Malignis and Az-Reth (which is a rune drawn with your wand)

I'd suggest using Az-Reth if your world has an Atlantis tradition of some kind, cash in on those references. The other two speak for themselves.

*** ooh malignis is clever

edit: wait, it might not have been made to combine malign and ignis... might have just put mal in front of ignis. gah.

** I prefer "spiritus ignis maledictus" since such a large scale spell deserves a three word incantation in my opinion.

*** This makes me a bit curious, is there actually any three word incantation spells in canon? My canon has basically been shot to pieces by fanon at this point.

** I like yours. Most fics don't include the incantation

** I can't remember which fic it was, but I've always liked "malus ignis". Or it might've been "ignis malus". Can't remember which order it went.

** "Agnis Pestis" just sounds awesome. There's also the linkffn(Too Young to Die) incantation which is long and bullshit, but it still sounds awesome. Or it doesn't even really have an incantation. You just scream "BURN!" or whatever.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
