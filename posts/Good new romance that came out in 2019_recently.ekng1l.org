  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

** my favorite this past year has been annerb's work:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][Armistice series]], sequel to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]. it's a slow, post-war angst/romance, with great writing and some of my favorite characterizations in fanfic. The primary divergence from canon is that in The Changeling, Ginny is sorted into slytherin, but the characters feel very true to canon (if anything, they're even better characterized.)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16044434/chapters/37454639][we can't control]]: (late 2018) this is AU, and full of smut, so if that's not your cup of tea, skip on this one. it's a great read!

also one from deadwoodpecker:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13191881/1/The-Peverell-Dilemma][The Peverell Dilemma]]: AU, with a new newspaper on the scene!
