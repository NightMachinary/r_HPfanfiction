Magical trunk apartments are a thing, why not a house inside a snow globe you can even have garden.(or go bigger and put a while village and forest inside one.)


** It's certainly a cooler idea than camping out in a suitcase. Although I'm not sure how you're supposed to get in and out of a snow globe house.

*** I imagine you could use normal methods of magical transport. Like connecting the houses to the floo network,ect.

But mabye for people to young for apparition, also have something like giving it shake and then when you put it down you are transported inside.(obviously giving it a shake would not disturb things inside and there would need to be a way to stop yourself and other from being accidentally transported inside when you don't want to be)

**** Imagine a Wizarding landlord with a curio cabinet full of snow globes. You enter the reception room with the floo and the cabinet, then floo into your home. Could be attached to the leasing office and the maintenance department, even, like an apartment building would be.

** While its not quite what you were talking about, your post just inspired a similar idea for me but your office at work.

Wizarding work briefcases could be just a compacted office that when you get to work you put in the slot in the corridor and it expands to make a doorway to the room. It allows for convenience for travelling to other sites as you can take your work with you, allows for work from home if the same set up is available there, and allows for security as there is no office left behind for someone to break into when you have left for the day.

Maybe it could be something that only works to expand into an office in the Ministry of Magic building if you wanted it to not have them everywhere and wanted more security to keep secrets within.

Just the mental vision of the ministry worker finishing up for the day, stepping out of their office and activating something that puts it into stasis and collapses it down into a brief case they walk off with to go home feels like the rediculousness that could be normal in the HP wizarding world

** Ooh, there's a fanfic I read with this concept. Hermione asks Dumbledore to help protect her parents by getting them somewhere safe. She has no idea what he plans, but the story goes on that she's able to get letters to them through Dumbledore while they're in hiding.

Meanwhile Dumbledore actually hasn't sent them very far away at all. They're literally in Hogwarts the whole time...in a snow globe he keeps on his desk. When he wants to send them communication, he says a spell to send the letters magically to them, and he's able to go inside the snow globe and be their only visitor. The Grangers have no idea where they are, so their letters to Hermione talk about how very cold and snowy it is all the time and how there are no neighbors nearby. They get excited when Dumbledore comes to visit as they haven't seen another soul in months.

It was actually a very cool concept, and I enjoyed that story a lot for the creativity.

***** Just a reminder to check. I enjoy some dramione from time to time though it's really not one of my favorite ships. I haven't read any in awhile and I love the idea of that snow globe. I love the trope of magical bigger on the inside trunks and anything like that so yessssss give it to me.

** Idea 1)Magical university: admission to magical university is cut throat. If you can't learn how to enchant your very own snow globe appartement by the end of the 1 Day seminar you clearly are unfit to live on campus because they don't have the space to house you.

Coincidentally; the entire university consists out of a very narrow hallway with countless snow globes. Some student or teacher housing, some classrooms.

Idea 2) Also very interesting is of course the entire separation from the Muggle world trope and somehow making a network of linking snow globes for each and every magical location. This could be because muggles have started to hunt magical again, or as bio-domes in a post-apolyptical greenhouse-envirment earth.

Idea 3) The fancier and at the same time more understated solution to wizarding travel and conspicuous wizarding tents.

Idea 4) Someone made a fantastic beast sanctuary/ mini village for family and friends and enchanted their snow globe to have muggles hold it very dear and protect it at all cost. It ends up in a family where some muggleborn child touches it and sucks the kid in a la Narnia.
