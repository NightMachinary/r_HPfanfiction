I'm at the point where I'm about out of standard hetero pairings and I'd love to find some good bisexual and/or homosexual pairings BUT I don't particularly want to read anything tooooo far fetched.

I'd love a good Harry/Neville or Harry/Non-Ron...Hell, I would love to see a Harry/Luna/Neville story but alas that's never going to exist.

Most non-het stories i find are Drarry/Snarry stories where I just can't get over how.....beyond me it would mean for the characters to get together. I could see Harry's obsession with Draco in HPB turning into a crush, but that's about the olny point in the stories i see those two come close to being a pair, and that's stretching it.

So....any help?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/Reparations][Reparations]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5047623/1/Foundations][Foundations]] were the first Drarry stories I read, and I feel it handled it fairly well. It's set post-DH and begins with Harry as a Healer in training.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave's]] Sacrifices Arc, which is Drarry and a veritable epic.

Here are some Hermione/Ginny fics:

** Samstoryteller/Copperbadge writes (in my opinion) the best slash in the fandom. His piece [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] is outstanding. Other work of his can be found on [[http://copperbadge.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors.net]].

** I know you said you dislike H/D, and I can understand your reasons. I agree with you for the most part, besides for one fic. One tiny little exception, that completely proves the rule.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2493456/1/Bond][Bond]]

It's the only plausible H/D fic I've ever seen, and it's written very well.

*** I love this fic, and I always want to go back and read it again...except it's a three day affair, and I start wanting tattoos. Life is extremely difficult in for me.

** [[http://www.mediageek.ca/arsenicjade/writing/origins.html][Origins of Myth]] is a great Draco/Ron story. It may necessitate reading [[http://www.mediageek.ca/arsenicjade/writing/body.html][Body of Knowledge]] which is a Hermione/Severus story.

Most of my stories

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker][Oathbreaker]] is a phenomenal [like...fucking wonderful] story that is detailed enough to actually get to Harry/Draco.

Most of the non-het pairings I read are the secondary ship, so if you're open to that then you might want to try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]].

Good luck.

Wait, what are standard het-pairings?
