the first is a dimension travel fanfiction where harry appears at hogwarts with a lot of gold on him and finds his mother and a younger sister alive, lily has divorced james and has very little money, harry help. i think lily in the end gets with sirius but i am not so sure about that.

fic no.2 i am unsure if it still exsists out there as it seems to have been romved from ff.net or atleast my favortite for it has gone wrong. it starts in the GOF and harry is blind but cool and gets along with everybody. he falls in love with fleur and it was full of lemons.

fic no.3 is a also a GOF fic where harry gets injured seriously by the dragon in the first task and becomes a sort of magical inventor with a specially designed broom and staff that help him with his new impairments.

and the 4th and final fic i remember not that much of but i know it was a harry hermione story where hermione's parents are involved. there relationship starts before hogwarts. the main scene i remember is one of a little ginny screaming a dumbledore for what he but harry though with the dursleys and then breaking his nose with the harry potter story book she was trying to get her money back on, then bursting into teas thinking that there is no way she will then get her money back when a reporter buys the book from her cheering her up.

hope you can help me find any of there from the auful description i have gave them
