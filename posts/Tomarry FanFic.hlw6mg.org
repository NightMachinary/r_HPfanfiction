** Please, for the love of god, atleast try to write in a way that conveys soberness and a bit of clarity instead of.. whatever your end result is

We don't like wattpad (mostly atleast) as the quality content is on either Archive of Our Own (AO3) or fanfiction.net (ffn), thus I must now guide you to the correct path

The best Tomarry fic (in my opinion) is linkffn(again and again) but to be fair, I haven't had much experience with Tomarry.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
