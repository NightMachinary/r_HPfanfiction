I searched for a MTG crossover using the search bar and came up with ziltch. I tried the crossover section in ff.net and there was one that was my cup of tea. It involved Potter and Urza of the Urza saga.

So, are there fics out there that have the system of magic in MTG or Potter's Power He Knows Not as the Planeswalker spark?


** I've found some more MtG crossovers using [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bfandoms%5D%5B%5D=224&search%5Bcrossovers%5D%5B%5D=1565&search%5Btitle%5D=&search%5Bauthor%5D=&search%5Bsummary%5D=&search%5Bcharacter_optional%5D%5B%5D=&search%5Blanguage%5D=english&search%5Bstatus%5D=&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=k&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=kplus&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=t&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=m&search%5Bwordcount_lower%5D=&search%5Bwordcount_upper%5D=&search%5Bchapters_lower%5D=&search%5Bchapters_upper%5D=&search%5Bsort_by%5D=updated&search%5Border_by%5D=desc][Scryer]]. Nothing that looks particulary good at first glance though.

Searching by title only brings up Planeswalker: Return of a Lost Soul (linkffn(3170426)).

*** I never did sign up for DLP. Also, that has a Mary Sue Potter. Not worth it. I saw the Urza fic I mentioned. The writing is bearable and the pace is good, as compared to this one where the fic's Potter just steamrolls the plot.

If you're curious, the title is Harry Potter and The Lessons of Urza.

** Oh fuck the hell yes!

Urza is one of my favorite characters of the game, and the art of Artifice is sorely neglected in canon and fanon. Nobody writes about crafting artifacts hardly.

*** It could've been a one shot. It was neatly tied up when he said [[/spoiler][I have transended]]. You could've places hints about the kinds of mana, and what he saw people in the HP-verse primarily use like Voldemort for Black, Hermione for Blue, maybe Black-Red for Bellatrix. Those kinds of stuff.

8/10. Need more polish if you're intending to publish it as a one shot.

As a start of a story, it sounds more like a generic crossover start 6/10.

**** Agreed with all your points. It could easily be the start to a Worm crossover as well. The plan is to have Harry go on an adventure on Zendikar when the Eldrazi are unleashed, but I haven't really found the time to write it. A couple of my other ideas involve Chandra coming to Earth, and Voldemort performing a demonic ritual to gain more power, and Liliana being the one to answer, but none of those went past the first chapter either.

***** I'm not sure with the lore but isn't Vess just a superpowered planeswalker and not a demon? Even with the chain veil iirc she's just a human necromancer with bad deals in life.

Why would Chandra come to Earth? For one of her guild thingies? Maybe you could spin it into her following a lead on Ugin's Eye.

Or drop the whole new Planeswalkers plot and get him in the Onslaught or Timespiral blocks. Onslaught if you're into armies and sieges(Ixidor vs Khamal vs Phage iirc). Timespiral if you're up to Oblivion-esq saving the world thing(Teferi). Or ignore those and go to the block that started the in depth lore The Brother's War (Urza and Mishra).

****** The set up for Chandra was during "the purifying fire" novel. There's a scene where she gets tortured and has a snake burrow underneath her skin and stuff after she broke into a building (called the sanctum of the stars I think) and stole a scroll (she thinks it contains an extremely powerful fire spell, which connects to her eventually using ghostfire to open the Eye on Zendikar). She manages to break free from her captors and desperately blind planeswalks away. She barely makes it to a plane called Diraden, which is run by a vampire and is cloaked in black mana. Gideon manages to follow her there. So, instead of barely making it there, she goes to Earth instead.

As for the Liliana stuff, I didn't flesh it out as much, but the idea is the Liliana defeated Griselbrand (and Kothoped), and wheras someone looking to make a deal with a demon, accidentally gets her on the line instead. Liliana becomes intrigued, because half of her time is spent trying to retain her youth and beauty now that her spark has been altered thanks to the mending. So might be intrigued be the idea of a Horcrux, and would ultimately lead Voldemort on with promises of power while she is looking to further her own.

******* And then Jace learns of shit going down and confronts Vess. Lol. Also I think I spoiled you in your Chandra plan with some canon lore. Another lol. These new planeswalkers are more confusing tbh. Past planeswalkers were walking gods. The new crop are like Voldemort or Dumbledore in their respective mana pools.

Welp too bad it didn't pan out. I still would suggest polishing the chapter and make it into a full one shot though.

******** You didn't spoil anything for me. I'm quite well-versed in lore, as I have every book up through kamigawa block, and I have all the rest after that in pdf. I've also read most of the stories on the website, but that quality in them is suspect at best, especially since they've reconnected their own stories there in under a year. I've even read Test of Metal and In the Teeth of Akoum, which are amongst the worst pieces of fiction that I have ever read. Teeth of Akoum might actually be the worst thing I've ever read, even worse than Twilight.

The problem I've found when trying to write fanfiction (specifically, crossovers with HP since that's what this forum is - I've tried other fandoms as well) is that the series is so long and diverse. Like, the Weatherlight saga is my favorite, but you can't exactly just add a random character to an ensemble cast and expect everything to work out peachy. The series of events is very carefully choreographed, and I don't think there's a way to alter it without is just feel like a canon rehash just with a new character added. Like, you can make Harry an apprentice at the Tolarian Academy (even replace Teferi if you want), or even make Harry one of the Nine, but what can you really change plotwise?

Of course, then there is the retcon problem, and the fact that they have a retcon in canon in the form of the Mending. That really messes up a bunch of things, and essentially just makes it so walkers are just normal wizards and witches with a special ability to travel between planes. It's not as exciting, but I guess it's more relatable? We won't have situations like with Urza who literally had his head cut off and was still alive afterwards and talking.

********* From what I've researched, when Urza got his head chopped the stones popped from his head, and he was officially dead. Either that or living through Karn. Also pre retcon Planeswalkers was OP as fuck. Before Urza died, he was four thousand years old.

Plotwise, you're right, inserting him anywhere would either make a big enough ripple effect that would alter canon mtg (like maybe place him at the start of Jace's story and make him his mentor or make him one of Gideon's prey.) Someone would have to insert Potter somewhere that it'll be significant enough that it'll change something. I think there are points in Onslaught, Mirrodin, and the start of the retcon phase that would be perfect inserts.

Either that or apply an alternate source of magic to the HP verse, like the one I linked somrwhere on this thread. Hogwarts is a perfect Green, Red, Blue mana battery.
