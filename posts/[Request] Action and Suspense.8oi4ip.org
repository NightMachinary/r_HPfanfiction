I love a story with *good action*, *dueling*, *more canon-like magic* (none of the magical core nonsense), and possibly larger scale *battles*. So I'm looking for a good story with any of these components in at least noticeable capacity.

Some fics that fit this that I have read include:

- The Unforgiving Minute
- The One He Feared
- Magicks of the Arcane
- Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived
- Patron
- The Dark Lord Never Died
- The Dark Lord's Equal
- The Long Journey Home
- The Mind Arts
- On the Way to Greatness
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom
- By the Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song
- Skitterleap
- Hogwarts Battle School (I'm hesitant to include this one)
- Forging the Sword
- Unspeakable Things and the Firebird Trilogy

Thanks in advance.


** Try A Stranger in an Unholy Land. By far, my favorite fic.
