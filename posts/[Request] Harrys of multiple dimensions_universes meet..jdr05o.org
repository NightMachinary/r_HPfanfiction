Any story where there are 3 or more Harrys present at any given time. Not necessarily the same age. I read linkao3(5924716) about a year ago and I've been curious about more.

Thnx in advance.


** They don't really interact physically except at the very start before it flashbacks, but they interact a ton, in this:

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know.\\
  Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group... WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
