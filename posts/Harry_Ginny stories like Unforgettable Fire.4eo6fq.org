Was wondering if any of you guys know any fics that have Ginny like she was in Unforgettable Fire? Much appreciated. Thanks.


** Can you give more information on Ginny's character for those who haven't read the fic? You'll get more responses that way.

*** Ah. Good point. She was damaged emotionally, severely. She was with Draco for a while, they did not love each other, but it was two damaged individuals seeking solace with each other. She used her sexuality to seduce men and get information, powerful in that way. I guess Ginny was like Vanessa Ives from Penny Dreadful, best comparison I can think of right now.

**** linkffn(Rebirth by Irina) and its sequel have some of the elements you seek. The fic is hella old though, and the writing at the start is really ordinary. I genuinely like the sequel though.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ginnysdarkside/SDIWIWIS.html][Somedays I Wish I Were in Slytherin]] has some of the spy stuff and a not-fully-committed relationship with Draco, but I don't remember her being particularly damaged in it.
