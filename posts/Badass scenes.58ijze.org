** Well, /Nightmares of Future Past/ is a Peggy Sue fic, where Harry goes back in time to save everyone. It has its share of badass scenes.

In one scene, Ron stabs a /Dementor/ to death with the Sword of Gryffindor and then he steps forward and shouts "Come and have a go, if you think you're hard enough," to a crowd of dementors.

Ron's only thirteen when it happens.

** Aw man, I have so much. My favorite would probably go to a year like none other, either the owlery chapter or the one where harry gets captured and then rescued, just for the shivers it sent down my spine at the time. The whole fic is so beautifully written and interesting too.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

***** Awwww. :-( I haven't read the sequel yet. I get so into the fics I'm reading that I tend to read them all day for days (or weeks) and neglect my actual job, so I think once I finished the first one I stopped, then forgot about it.

****** From memory (keep in mind it's been quite a long time since I checked it out) there's less action than the first novel since it happens during the summer, but the amount of character evolution is nuts.\\
He really delves even deeper into relationships of the characters and it's really well written that you don't feel lack it drags out.

You feel like Harry and Draco are 16 - 17, which I really found refreshing because there's so much stories where they just gives a 15 year old Harry the mental acuity and maturity of a 30 year old man just because they can't actually put themselves in a still rather immature boy.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
