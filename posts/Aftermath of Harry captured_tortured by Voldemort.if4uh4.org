:FlairText: What's That Fic? (And a request)
:END:
I'm looking for two specific fics, and then some suggestions for something similar!

*1st Fic*- I remember it was mainly Bellatrix who was torturing Harry, and was pretty messed up. Potentially triggering/graphic violent description, I remember at one point she made spikes grow up from the floor and pierce though his feet. It may have included sexual assault as well but I can't remember. He recovered at the burrow but I don't think it went into much detail?

*EDIT: Found it as I was looking through tags: linkffn(Ouroboros)*

​

*2nd Fic*- I read this about 6/7 years ago, so probably was from ffn, it was basically Harry being captured and held by Voldemort, and Dumbledore rescuing him after quite a few months as the order attacked? Super vague sorry! Not expecting anyone to know it, but anything similar would be great!

My only issue with these kinds of fics is that they often don't focus on the after affects enough for me. I just want that pure hurt/comfort and recovery stages.

I'm not a fan of mpreg (although I did read one once that fits the criteria and it was amazing?), dark Harry, 'dimension travel' or 1st person/diary format. Also please no messed up ones where Harry becomes a pet or whatever. I just want a 'realistic' recovery fic (Harry centric).

​

*Fics I have read already, and can find:*

linkffn(The Lies That Bind)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills)

linkffn(A Year Like None Other)

linkffn(What it comes down to by Greycie)


** Either this is the 2nd fic or another suggestion [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7791963/1/The-Road-To-Recovery-Is-Long-And-Winding]]

  When Chloe convinces Max to make things right, something strange happens, resulting in a new beginning and a chance at a life together. With everything seemingly "fixed," the two are ready to live normal lives. Lots of fluffy "Adventures of Max and Chloe with friends" with a bit of "dealing with things" thrown in.

  How do others view Snape's adoption of Draco and Harry? Rumors don't necessarily reflect the truth. A side story from aspeninthesunlight's marvelous A Summer Like None Other, for which there are spoilers.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath. Warning: This fic depicts violence, rape, torture, suicide,etc. Both HET & SLASH. It is intended for a mature audience.

  The cruel, beautiful smile, the predatory violet eyes of his torturer, lover and savior, Bellatrix Lestrange, ensnared him. Even after escape she became his sole obsession. To feel her touch again Harry will tear apart the Wizarding world, stone by stone.
