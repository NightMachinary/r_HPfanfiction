** I'm indifferent. I like Ginny. She is a well developed character for how little page time she gets. I get how her and Harry could work as a couple quite well, and I also get why that's not to everyone's' taste

** I think Ginny works well with Harry from what we see of her. It's a shame that we don't see more of Ginny which does weaken readers' opinions of their relationship, but the books aren't based around romance, and the conflict took precedence.

I honestly think the canon pairings are the best. Many of the reasons people claim Ron is bad for Hermione apply to Harry and Hermione as well. Harry isn't interested canonically in someone like Hermione, and that's okay. Ron and Hermione honestly seem far more compatible than Hermione and Harry. Their relationship isn't perfect, but no relationship is.

******* Well it depends in what terms are you speaking of. Hermione had her own insecurities. Was Hermione more prominent with magic? Yeah, and I don't think that's bad. Relationships are not resumes, one doesn't try to find one that is as accomplished as one is. Ron was a person on his own right, and I do think he made more sense for Hermione than Harry.

*** I stand with canon. Though, if weren't Ginny, I guess other characters could be made to work, with the proper ground work. (Insert Daphne Blankslate Greengrass comments). I, however, simply feel like Hermione is just not one of those characters that could work as Harry's other half.

**** Why not? She definitely doesn't fit to Ron, he always argues with and there's no way their relationship could work. I think she fits Harry way better because she motivates him and they trust each other completely. He's also open to her more radical ideas and she keeps his head straight. As a slight bonus for my argument, JK Rowling admitted that she preferred Harmony and Hinny was only because it fit the story and ending better.

***** About Romione. Dude, it can work. Does it need some work? Yeah, sure. From both sides. Ron needs to learn to think on consequences and improve on his way of voicing his needs. Hermione needs to be less condescending and own when she is wrong, more often. I can tell you it works because in many ways that relationship has many things in common with what I have with my wife, and we have been happily married for quite some time now.

All you listed about Harry/Hermione... those are things not inherently romantic. YOu described a friend, not a romantic partner. Still, people who ship Harry and Hermione see what you saw only on a surface level.

About trust:

Do Hermione and Harry trust each other? Yeah, pretty much, still Harry wouldn't tell her about the Dursleys and Hermione is not very trusting to Harry's judgement on 6th year (prince book, Felix Felicis, Malfoy... you name it). She does talk with Ron behind Harry's back on 7th, about not knowing Harry hadn't been given more clues about Dumbledore. Other examples in other years. Does this mean they are secretive or that they can't work because this. Not precisely, people are a mess, there are plenty of layers to even closest relationships when one talks about things as trust. Though, it doesn't mean that "Hermione is perfect for Harry because they trust each other" either.

Motivation.

Does she? She gives him reassurance when it is logical. She doesn't reassure him to go and face 50 death eaters by himself, though. She ponders and gives a good advice when she sees is within Harry's skills. Not in everything though. Classwork, she tells them they have to study, but does she trust them to give pull it out themselves when they don't. Not, really. She seems pretty permissive with keeping them copy her homework. Does she motivate Harry or anyone else to do things she doesn't agree with? Not either. Another interesting question... Does Harry motivate Hermione?

Radical ideas,

Is he open to her more radical ideas? Like SPEW? Harry clearly dismissed it and just talking about it made him uncomfortable.

Keeps his head straight

Can she? I mean, DA was a good idea, thought the teaching experience was more what did it for Harry than Hermione perse. But she didn't seem able to convince him about dropping his crusade to Malfoy on 6th year. There are plenty of things where Harry just doesn't listen to Hermione. And DH was basically arguing Horcruxes vs Deathly Hallows... it wasn't Hermione who convinced him of not pursuing the DH, it was Dobby. Harry's character development has always been tied to the sense of loss, not to Hermione telling him what to do and he listening.

Harry and Hermione might have argued less... but I don't see passion there. And to people who argue there's not much in common with ROmione interests. Harry does not share any of Hermione's interests either. I don't see Hermione sharing Quidditch either.

Extra note to support Hinny. Hermione's character is passionate about what she does, about doesn't need anyone to share it with her, she's perfectly well having those moments for herself. Harry does need someone to share things with him, his whole argue is about finding belonging. Ginny or not Ginny, bonding over Quidditch is something that makes sense for Harry's character.

****** You make a good point and I'm going to concede the point because holy shit this was well thought out and seeing as your married I haven't had a girlfriend yet, I will bow to your superior knowledge. I'm not going to start liking Romione but I'm just going to accept it as possible. But on your point of bonding over Quidditch, yeah sure but where do they go from there? Apart from fighting together and Quidditch, what do they share?

******* The thing with Hinny is interesting... people argued that's Mary Sue and to some extent they're right.

I mean HBP Ginny feels perfect for Harry. Quidditch... understands his need for belonging, understands his gloomliness and need for space (see break-up at the end of 6th year). She's sassy. She has a drive to be her own person, but doesn't really care what other people think (a crucial part to deal with post-5th year Harry). She can't stand injustice, but has that push to do "pranks" Harry thinks that are funny/cool but doesn't dare to do it himself. In a way Ginny is like the confident sport-prone jokster Snape thought Harry was, come to think of it. She is direct as well, and has that right amount of bluntness to cut straight to the point when Harry is sulking. Making him put the feet in the ground. In my opinion her bluntness helps Harry realize the true nature of situations in a way a Hermione lecture can't.

What's the problem then? matching young Ginny to HBP Ginny. People see her as a Mary Sue because she turned into this confident all-guys-want-to-date-her girl from one book to the other. They're kind of right to some degree... I mean, it can happen, but it would have felt more realistic if HBP GInny and eventual love interest of Harry was a different character who was always confident. Adding her more underlining issues would have helped as well. Though, with the series on it's last part by the time HInny came to happen, it was hard to get Ginny enough time to develop those more nuisance parts.

​

In other words: Hinny does make sense... but the young GInny turning into perfect-for-Harry HBP Ginny came out of nowhere.

******** You offer compelling arguments that are hard to deny, especially because you offer some critic before I can even write it. Again, I'm conceding the point to you. The last thing I'm going to argue on is that even if I liked Hinny, the ending was to abrupt and the nineteen years later kinda weird (why would they call their poor kid Albus Severus) because Hinny doesn't get a lot of time to show how they would continue to grow as a couple, they just kinda happen.

********* Yeah, epilogue was weird. And the weirdest part was why Albus wasn't named Arthur Billius Potter or something like that... I mean, Harry gets 5 out of 6 names, and even Luna was a friend him as well.

That being said... here is someone who is better putting thoughts to words that I am:

​

They don't talk about Ginny at all there. Just Romione vs Harry/Hermione... still you can see who the HBP Ginny that Rowling created is in fact more emotionally strong than Hermione and Ron, so she can deal with Harry's baggage. ALthough, it is quite of odd how she came to be so emotionally strong after the Chamber... maybe a well placed conversation with her in book 5 would have helped to transition her character better from shy Ginny to confident GInny. But hey, book5 was long enough as it was.

​

As someone else said about this same article:

"But for Harry, well for Harry, it was that *spark*. Harry never seemed to have that spark for Hermione. The kind he depicted for Cho and Ginny. He was never *attracted to Hermione,* and that's how he set their relationship away from a possible love interest. It's not whether he was superficial or not. It was just - he didn't think of her as more than his one of his best friends. He had hung out with Hermione a lot, and even when Ron wasn't around. But those moments lacked that... excitement he would feel with another girl he might have fancied."
