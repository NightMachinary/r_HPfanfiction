I'm looking a specific fic (might be two separate, can't remember.)

Harry, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, Luna and Neville form the next generation of Marauders and are all animagus. Harry is a dragon, Hermione is a kneezle, Fred and George are twin monkeys, Luna is a Snorlack. I can't remember what Neville is and Fleur is just a Veala. Together they do a bunch of pranks/vigilante justice stuff, including high jacking the ceiling of the great hall.

In the other (or possibly the same fic, not sure) when in the graveyard Fleur and Gabrielle both end up there, and Voldemort threatens to have his death eaters rape them. Harry manages to save them all before he can do more than remove there clothes, however.

Thanks in advance!

*** Neville is an Ent.

I doubt recall that specific graveyard scene but the Deatheaters do manage to kidnap Fleur and the gang rescues her before they do anything to her.

Bot didn't work for hpfanficarchive so heres the ffn one
