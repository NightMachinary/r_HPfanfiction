I can't remember a lot, I only know that the author used the title Lord of Magic for Dumbledore and Voldemort but not Harry although he was close. In this fan fiction there were political games and intrigue. I remember that Voldemort was a certain species he invented that he transformed Harry into it even though he hated it because he was going to look 16 forever. The Dark Lord was a certain Snake as well, it was great and there were mentions that they would war against each other and ally with each other because they had thousands of years. There was also one incident where Harry couldn't be around magic and the Dark Lord took him to his house and didn't use magic while they were recovering. It was HP/LV.
