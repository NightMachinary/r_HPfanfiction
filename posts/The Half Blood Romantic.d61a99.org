I'm not a big fan fiction reader but I ran into this Romance story between Harry and Fleur that I simply loved! The dialogue and realistic building of a relationship between the two is just incredible. Easily the best depiction of Fleur that I've ever seen. She is very opinionated and arrogant, but also very clever, funny, and like-able.

I couldn't stop reading. I'm saddened to see that it hasn't been updated since February. Has anyone heard any updates? Anyone enjoy it as much as me? Any other Harry/Fleur recommendations?

**** Speaking as a Haphne writer there's not much to know. She had no canon identity beyond being a Slytherin in Harry's year, but the fandom has - in a rare case of hive-minded goodness - created a personality for her that is rarely detracted from. The older stories focused a lot on Pure Blood idealism, the impetus of most of their stories being marriage contracts, but the character has moved beyond that in recent years. A few examples of good Haphne fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/][The Grass is Always Greener]] - a classic and one of the first I read

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13323518/1/Ice-Cream][Ice Cream]] - a one-shot sweet enough to give you a tooth ache but a good read

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/][A Champion's New Hope]] - this one shows its age a bit, but its a half-decent read I'd still recommend for the ship

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7888771/1/][The Snake Within]] - admittedly I don't remember much about this one, but what I do remember is positive

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13215314/1/Tattoos][Tattoos]] - shameless self plug number one

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13337496/1/Scars][Scars]] - shameless self plug number two

Speak for yourself. I enjoy making her a minor antagonist because the fandom likes to turn her into a Mary Sue. Hell, her omnipresence as the "good/neutral" pureblood whose family never had anything to do with Voldemort gets old very quickly.

I don't like the fic. I started to read it when it had 5 chapters and kept coming back for the updates. But, I don't find infidelity a compelling theme to read about in fiction and once it became apparent that Fleur would not end things with Bill despite also having the thing with Harry, I quickly lost interest.

This makes it worse IMO. She strings Bill along despite knowing that it's over but she is too comfortable with her overall living situation to dare a change. I am hesitant to say that Fleur is the sole villain in that fic because Bill is older and should know better than to rush their relationship to the point of marriage when he is very absent. At the same time, I don't want to victim blame him for having an adulterous fiancee because ultimately, she is the one who is cheating.

The relationship is honestly a clusterfuck and I feel bad that Harry got mixed up in that mess because it is clear that Fleur would have been unfaithful eventually. If not with him then with someone else. Which is why I don't enjoy the fic.

** I really have enjoyed HBR, too. If the author decides to update, it will probably be on DLP first. I know the author is still active there so maybe they've just been busy.

If you're looking for some newer H/F, you might take a look at linkffn(13140418) and linkffn(13261043).

"The International Triwizard Tournament" is a fun read with some excellently written characters. It's still up in the air as to what the pairing will be, but if I had to guess, it will eventually be Fleur. Even if she doesn't end up with Harry in this fic, their interactions are immensely entertaining regardless.

"A Veela's Intrigue" is told from Fleur's POV and is also well-written. The Fleur portrayed in this story is very cunning and kinda-evil (at least her motives were at first). This one seems destined for her and Harry to be a pair. Also, in this story Harry is very sick and Fleur attempts to take advantage of that which makes for a compelling read.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** Harry paired with more than one person. It does it in a good way imo, but isnt everyone's cup of tea
