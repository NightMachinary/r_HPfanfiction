So I made a post the other day about some Canon Compliant fic and Ive gotten some great suggestions, the one thing I've noticed though is a lot of these have romantic subplots that imo take away from the story. Now I'm not against Romance, but when I started reading Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness and got to the Parvarti/Neville scenes, I groaned. Any suggestions for some good canon compliant fic that don't necessarily have a huge romantic element to them?


** What I find funny about these replies saying "EVERY HP story has romance, it's intrinsic to the series!" Is just how little romance the actual books had. There was a crush on cho chang, the tension between ron and Hermione, and some random bits in book six, which were more "sitcom" than "romance."

Not once is there any serious, overblown, Romance with a capital R.

*** Thats what bothers me! A lot of these fics seem to have Romance with a capital ROMANCE. I just want stuff similar to the books, so it isnt overpowered by diff ships

** If you're looking on FFN, you can filter out the 'romance' category in the genre section, and/or filter out a particular pairing by clicking the pairing box and selecting which characters you do not want paired.

I just did this and there are over 244,000 results.

*** Oh awesome! Is there a way of sorting what is canon compliant and what isnt?

**** unfortunately no. You could try using the search function AFTER applying the filter... something like 'canon compliant' would work, I suppose. Otherwise, you pretty much just have to read the summaries.

** Northumbrian's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] fits the bill.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]'s /Alexandra Quick/ series of novels is technically canon compliant and has essentially no romantic subplots.

Both are very good writing.

** A lot of fanfiction is going to have some sort of romantic element to them. If you look around, the story's pairing is one of the primary methods used to categorize stories. I would suggest that you want to look for adventure/action stories, but those are most likely to be non-canon compliant. Sorry, and good luck!

*** Ahhh gotcha. Yeah this is my first time getting into fan fiction, so I'm extremely new at all this. I don't mind a little bit of romance, I mean after all the original books had it too, its just some of these are way too cheesy for me to take it seriously

**** DAYD has very little romance, compared to other fics, as you continue on in my opinion. Yes it's there, but it's not a major element to it. AND it's canon compliant, so if you're at the part where Neville is still kissing Pavarti you're not very far into it.

**** My recommendation is to look for stories that are non-canon compliant. I strongly dislike stories that are "what would happen if X" and basically repeat everything that happened in canon. Nothing changes (except maybe the pairing). Arg! Boring! Give me something new.

I think these were already recommended in your earlier thread, but I'd suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. Both are humour stories, and a good starting point. Or for action, try something from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern][jbern]].

** You're not going to find one. Love is supposed to be Harry's Power (with a capital P, even), so it's always going to be at the very least a subplot. Not every story will slip into lemons/smut but easily 90% of the stories will have romance, and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw][the other 10% aren't worth reading]]. With canon fics, it's probably closer to 98%, because there's nothing but a bunch of peoples' relationships to build on, either the Marauders or the trio or their kids.

*** Love does not mean romantic love. Romantic love had little to no role in Harry's defeat of Voldemort.

We know of four instances where love has had a magical role:

Lily's sacrifice for Harry

Harry's grief over Sirius

Harry's grief over Dobby

Harry's sacrifice for the entire wizarding world

None of those are romantic love.
