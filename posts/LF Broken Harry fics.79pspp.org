  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

*** I just ran into this one over the weekend and it is very very good. A bit slow at the start, and I kinda wished I got to see them explain their universe to DD, but still. I was crying at the end.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

** Linkffn(signal to noise) has a very mentally ill Harry with a really bad eating disorder/self harm problem. It's painfully realistic (sadly a good amount from personal experience) and it's not overly melodramatic/glorifying stuff like 99% of these types of fics. Warning - it's incomplete so things never get better for this version of Harry.

Edit: bot gave the wrong link, here
