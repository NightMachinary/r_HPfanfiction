Harry potter methods of rationality. Where things are much more realistic and scientific. Anything works even slash if that's what you know of. Thanks.


** I enjoyed "Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation" linkffn(9950232). The premise is a Hermione who actually works for her intelligence and questions some of the bizarre things about the Wizarding World.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

*** This fic is pretty awful. I don't want to get into it here, but suffice to say there are some pretty gross attitudes and beliefs on display in this story that are never challenged. Hard de-rec.

*** Seconding. The other sequel/prequel/it's complicated, Orders of Magnitude, is also pretty good, but it has a pretty niche appeal and I wouldn't rec it as much as Sig Digs.

** Look at the two pinned posts at the top of the [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] subreddit. They both contain lists of recommendations. Actually the two lists are pretty much the same, but you get the idea.

** It's not like HPMOR /at all,/ but linkffn(Victoria Potter) is really how a rational premise would play out without devolving into crack.

There are somewhat rational adjustments to canon, but they're really subtle and make the world a little tighter than in canon. And there's a great humanistic element under it all as well.
