Been reading the HPFF since September and only hit one xover, which was Harry Potter Geth. Looking for some more complete ones. Thanks


** I really liked the Denarian Renegade series, a x-over with the Dresden Files.

*** It's a good crossover for those who haven't read Dresden Files.

The Denarian series itself hasn't aged too well, unfortunately - if you can get into it from the first chapter straight away, you'll probably enjoy it immensely however.

**** Yeah, I've never read them, but I remember enjoying the x-overs. I think they were fairly well done...he ended up quite powerful, but I don't recall it being too Mary-Sue-ish.

** I seldomly read crosovers because they often require at least some familiarity, but there are some great ones ot there, like "Harry Potter: Geth" and the aready recommended "Browncoat Green Eyes". That said, here is a short list of some completed crossovers I enjoyed enough to keep copies of. Be advised I included "Freak like me" because it is utterly adorable, but it IS (non-graphic puppy love) slash. If you are into that I can dig up some more but most folks don't like that so per default I don't include those ;)

Also I will post a child comment with Madness at the gate (the sequel to a previous non-crossover crackfic, In the Mind of a Scientist) and a great but in-progress Doctor Who crossover.

Have fun picking through these, there should be at least some you can enjoy here ;)

#+begin_quote
  "We need to talk," She told Willow simple, then glanced at Xander. "A room."

  ..

  "Down the stairs," He pointed, "The basement's been converted into living quarters, magic lab, that sort of thing. Willow knows which room it mine, take your pick of the rest."

  She inclined her head, then dragged Willow past Xander toward the stairs.

  ..

  .. "Now, we need to speak."

  Willow shifted uncomfortably, "I... k-kind of thought we were."

  If Wednesday hadn't already known the impressive mind that existed within the redhead's skull, she would have been far less disgusted with her actions. She also wouldn't have bothered to pay any further attention to the girl, which might have been a mistake. People always managed to surprise her, Wednesday found... usually for the worse.

  "You love Xander."

  "What?" Willow blurted, eyes wide as she shook her head, "N-no, I mean..."

  "You love him, or..." Wednesday shrugged, "you think you do. At this time it's likely a mere infatuation, but that doesn't matter. You believe it to be love."

  Willow swallowed, then sighed and nodded, "I do."

  Wednesday looked at her for a long moment, the silence stretching on. Finally, she spoke, "I'm going to sleep with him this year."

  Willow reacted much like a bomb had been dropped in the room, her eyes bulged and her jaw dropped as she tried to speak though nothing was coming out.

  "Well, to be honest," Wednesday went on, "I don't expect there to be much sleeping involved."

  Willow staggered, leaning into the door frame of the room. She'd had some expectations of Wednesday being interested in Xander, but this was beyond anything she'd imagined in her worst nightmares.

  "I... I... You... He..."

  Wednesday observed the mental breakdown with a passive kind of interest, Willow was turning several fascinating colors to be sure. She was tempted to let it continue in the direction it was currently going, but that would be counterproductive. Still, she suspected that the direction she was about to take would accomplish just as much.

  "I've offered him to two other girls as well." Wednesday said simply, "and as I require one more for the set, I'd like you to consider joining us."

  Thud.

  Wednesday walked over and looked down at the unconscious redhead.

  "She survived." Wednesday said after she spotted the rise and fall of Willow's chest.

  "Pity."

  The Addams child reached down, grabbed Willow's arm, and pulled her body into the room. The door swung shut of its own accord a few seconds later.

#+begin_quote
  “Have you considered the offer?” Wednesday asked, not looking aside at Willow. It was her estimation that the redhead would be better able to respond if she felt that she wasn't being too closely observed. “You may have the Summer solstice, if you so choose.”

  “This summer?” Willow squeaked, turning rapidly red.

  Uncharacteristically, Wednesday hesitated. She wanted to say no, to tell Willow that it would be the following summer. Her pride, she knew, wanted to claim that first time with Xander for herself. It was slightly foolish, */it wasn't some issue of young love, it was a ritual and it didn't matter who went first./* (emphasis mine)
#+end_quote

That's the ritual I'm talking about. This whole "harem" thing is about a 4 part ritual where Xander is going to sleep with 4 girls, 1 for every season. It's considered an enslavement ritual

Same page:

#+begin_quote
  He froze partway through, then went back and read slowly and carefully. Fifteen minutes passed before he said anything, then he closed the book with a snap and looked Wednesday in the eyes.

  “Not a chance.”

  Wednesday merely raised her eyebrow, “Oh?”

  “This is a slave ritual, what are you thinking?”
#+end_quote

The text has made it quite clear to me that this is a one time ritual that Wednesday thinks will be highly beneficial to all participants because Xander is selfless enough to not try enslave the girls.

There's other textual evidence, but its a LONG fic, and I'd rather spend forever digging it up. I don't believe there is any evidence in the text that this is turning into a harem fic. Mostly because I've read it three times, and I didn't find any. I love this story.

This isn't long term, its a one time ritual. He's not even sleeping with all of them at once, but 1 every 3 months, and one time for each.

Really, if you are creeped out by the weeping angels, don't read this when you are alone or after dark or.. at whatever other time. Otherwise, liked it very much.

** The Black Wizard by Azraeos is my favourite LOTR/ HP crossover that doesn't involve slash : linkffn(2335832) . Harry comes across a little angsty as it's set after 5th year, but otherwise, it's a pretty good fic. Azraeos also has another fic where little Harry (about 8 years old I think) gets pulled into the LOTR universe. Incomplete I'm afraid. I haven't found any good complete ones either...

Wand and Shield is an excellent Avengers/HP crossover (more towards Avengers comics instead of the movies). linkffn(8177168) Also ongoing.

** Matou Shinji and... series.

It's crossover with Nasuverse (and Assassin's Creed, with references to few others) with the plot guided by readers votes. The author has done his research on the both series which in combination with his own ideas resulted in the really interesting and detailed settings. And that reflects on story really well, combine that with lack of predictability resulting from votes and you get a really good fanfic. Currently on it's fourth year with at least one update a week. Its best to have at least some familiarity with Nasuverse, especially Fate/Zero, but it explains main concepts pretty well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531][First part]], [[http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/6311-Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains-%28HP-FSN-CYOA%29][voting thread for current part]]

Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina.

It's not being marked as crossover on FF.net, but it crosses over with James Bond. Be advised that the fanfic doesn't focus on the crossover itself, even if Bond plays significant part in it. The fanfic uses elements of New Agey esoteric, creative uses of magic and its time travelling during time travel during time travel (etc.) make you would make Xzibit proud. Completed, has mentioned sequel that probably will never come to be, but it stands well on its own. You can read without even knowing who the James Bond is (if that is even possible).

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Harry Potter: Geth is a pretty decent fic. Crossovers are my passion(I almost only browse new crossover fics now). What kind of things do you like? What other fandoms do you know that you like? It doesn't matter if you think HP would go with it, just let me know. I've seen some super-surprising crossover fics that were very, very good that I never would have guessed would be.)
