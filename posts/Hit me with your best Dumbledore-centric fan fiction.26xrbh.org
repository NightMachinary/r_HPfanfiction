Realised I've never read a fic where Dumbledore was anything other than a mentor or a manipulator. I'd like to see him in other roles so please help me out if you know any interesting fics,

Thank you :)


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/621897/chapters/1122440][Lemon Drops and Blood Pops]] is the only one coming to mind. I haven't read it in some time and it hasn't been updated in 5 years but it's certainly worth reading.

** This isn't exacty what you want but the best Dumbledore I ever read was in enembee's Conlaodh's Song. He's still a mentor of sorts but the writing is publication-par so that makes up for it.
