:END:
I have not watched the RWBY series or read novels, if they are available, and I would like to start reading crossovers with that fandom. As such, I'm looking for RWBY Crossovers with HP where I don't have to be familiar with RWBY to enjoy the fic. An example is Denarian Renegade by Shezza, I didn't need to be familiar with Dresden Files to enjoy it.

​

Thanks in advance!!!

PS Im not sure if Recommendation is the correct flair to use, if not, pls tell which one is


** The flair for this would be */Request/*

​

*Request* - Asking the community to give you stories that meet your requested criteria

*Recommendation* - Is when you just finished some totally awesome story and you want to recommend it to everyone else to read.

*What's That Fic* - Is when you can't remember the name a story, but you think you can remember a couple details or maybe a whole scene from it and you want to see if anyone else can recognize it and help you out.

*** They should simply change "Recommendation" to something like "Read This!" based on the fact that people make this mistake so often.

  "To the well-organized mind, Death is but the next great adventure." When Harry wakes up in the world of Remnant, he quickly comes to the conclusion that he's either really bad at dying, or the best there ever was.
