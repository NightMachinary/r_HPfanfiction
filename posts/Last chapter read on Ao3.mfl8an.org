How do I find out what the last chapter i read on Ao3 is? I have let many chapters of some fics accumulate, but I gave no idea at which chapter i last looked.

Am I just too dumb to find the function on the website,or are there browser add-ons or something?


** Download EPubs (so you have archive in case the story is taken down) and read offline, most EPub readers remember where you finished. Besides, you won't be limited to just sites with apps.

*** Yeah this. It lets you keep track of what fics you've read, where you left off, you can make comments or review fics so you remember whether you liked or didn't like one. And if a fic you're currently reading gets deleted you'll have it backed up
