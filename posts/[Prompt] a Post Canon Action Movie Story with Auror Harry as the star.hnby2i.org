I just want a dumb post Hogwarts Action Movie Story with Explosions and John Woo doves. Cheesy one liners, Harry making out with a attractive woman and just plain old fashioned testosterone filled action


** AZKABAN HAS BEEN TAKEN BY A GROUP OF DEATH EATERS!!! Not only that, but they have taken hostages and have set magic missiles all through the island... Only the young Auror/Researcher Nicholas Corner can defuse it, but to infiltrate it he would need the help of an old veteran legend, Harry Potter. Now in his late fifties, the once famous auror Harry Potter is prisoner because he killed Dumbledore for stealing his money, but this new event gives him the chance not only of clearing his name but also of saving the world. Once more. The Rock!!! AvadaKedavraBombs. SexyGreyBeardHarry, AzkabanHeist.

** Theodore Nott has something in his hands, something so deathly that could have dire consequences to the whole wizarding Britain. However, he is too trained to fall under Veritaserum, and only he can defuse the threat on time. And polyjuice is not an option. So this time, Auror Harry Potter would have to do the unthinkable, and use a new unproved spell to switch faces and places with Nott in a race against time to find the magic bomb and defuse it, only that he would have to do it as Nott. FaceOff/HP... HP/GW, TN/GW TN/PP,HP/PP... FaceRemoval, Smut. Senseless amounts of action.
