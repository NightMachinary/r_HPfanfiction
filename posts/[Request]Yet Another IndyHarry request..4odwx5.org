Any Independent Harry fics where Ron doesn't get bashed to death? I won't lie. Fics where Harry effs off and does his own thing is generally a favorite trope...except for one thing: almost all of them I've come across can be pretty heavy on Ron-bashing. I know that it can fit his character, but to be honest, almost all of them do it, so it's gotten old. If Hermione can overcome her love of books and rules and her thing for authority figures and "Dumbledore is always right!", the Ron can certainly do the same with his.\\
Thanks!


** Whenever I see "Indy!Harry" I always imagine him with a fedora and bullwhip dressed as Indiana Jones. I want to read that crossover some day.

Okay, I'll leave now.

*** Same! Maybe an after Hogwarts, as a gesture of goodwill towards the goblins, Harry becomes a curse breaker for Gringotts.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.
