** ... across all realities

Harry hopping over to Westeros to reinforce the wall .. much to the bafflement of the nights watch

Harry being shot at by Sam and Dean every time he comes to clean up their messes

Harry point blank murdering suspicious weponized virus scientists

Harry explaining to Thanos that death is an asexual, agendered being who really would appreciate a few bunches of flowers.. not a genocide.

** "Hey, Harry! How are you doing, mate?"

Harry smiled at his best friend. "Good, good, just came back from India. They had a bit of an... Incident."

"Oh, you mean the explosion that occured in the middle of the magical part of their capital?" Ron asked.

Harry paused for a second. "Yeah, sure, let's go with that."

** Sadly, no one actually tells Harry about his new responsibilites. The previous Master of Death had accidentally destroyed the artifacts used to guide the MoD to where he needed to be, so there is no warning when, in the summer of 2021, Corona Virus mutates and its victims gain a hunger for brains.
