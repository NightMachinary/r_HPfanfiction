Harry Potter loves the plants and animals of the earth but is neglected by his relatives. Hes much more curious about the world he lives in so when he goes to Hogwarts he actually tried to improve himself.... Yada yada yada first two years pass by somewhat the same but when he gets bit by the basilick and healed by the tears the horcrux inside him burns up but the Phoenix tears heals it at the same time. He spends the summer with a massive headache because he's getting a download of all the memories and skills of Lord Voldemort.

This is where the fic becomes different than others because he empathizes with with Tom Riddle but hates Lord Voldemort. He starts getting more in tune with his magic. Realizes he's a centennial wizard as seen another fics. Third year comes around he captures pettigrew but get his eye taken out by the werewolf lupin because of Granger and snape.

He brings a trial for serious black but unknowingly steps on the toes with malfoy and crouch and other administrative officials. He relates more to Dumbledore who has always tried take the high route but realizes Dumbledore is trapped in his own image with the public.

The tournament comes around Harry gets chosen. He shows off his extraordinary magic but but this only makes the ministries more nervous because he's not under anyone's thumb right now but dumbledore's.

Harry takes the porkey and overwhelms riddles servants. He designs a new ritual after gathering the horcruxs to give Tom Riddle back his soul and more importantly his sanity. The ministry trying to snap his wand and hermonie trying to mother him/tell him what to do. Ron got jealous during the tournament as in other fics. Luna stays the same with a wild background.

After the ministry send s dementors to his relatives house. Harry finally snaps. Tom Riddle is now fully sane which is scary. Dumbledore is protecting Harry as much as he can yeah he's facing pressure from the ministries and that ICW.

Harry realizes magic is dying in the world yet he doesn't want all the muggles dead. He decides to go on a quest and enlists the help of Tom Riddle, Dumbledore, and breaks out of prison Grindelwald. The famels are backing their group / organization. Definitely add a couple more OC badass centennial wizards.

They search for the quest of Atlantis and go along on an adventure to restore ley lines across the Earth while combating corrupt ministries, mercenaries, muggle owned wizards (magical contract) and old world creatures/puzzles.

Overall their goal is to shut down all the nuclear warheads as well as protect wildlife such as whales and make the environment more sustainable.

Wizards would no longer have to hide and many muggles could not adapt or some bullshit.

Anyway I finally ran out of things to add. You can obviously polish a step expand up on the plot and make something out of this without making the main characters too op.

I just want a fic with Grindelwald Dumbledore Harry Potter in the sane tom riddle that literally fight the world.

Hope you enjoyed the rambling if you even read this far and someone make this fic please


** So, godlike Harry with an attempt at a reasonable explanation, then turns into again and again type stuff which actually has a good explanation for being frikin op (being 600 years old with constant magical growth) and then does some weird shat to save the planet? Sounds fun

Sorry but I suck at writing a story that has any kind of base, if it's not completely out of my creativity I can't write shat

The biggest guideline I ever worked with was ”MC is attacked and survives with magic”
