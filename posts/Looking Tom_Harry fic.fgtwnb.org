:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember much. But I think Tom finds out Harry is a horcrux either in the graveyard or DOM. I can't remember much, but he tries to convince Harry to join him. and eventually finds out that he can use Harry's scar for pleasure or pain. IF you don't know this one but know another where LV can use the horcurx like that, let me know. Thanks.


** The plot points you mentioned are actually very common in fics with that pairing. Here's one example in which Voldemort finds out about him being a horcrux at the DoM:

  The rendezvous at The Department of Mysteries spirals into a series of events which change the future of the wizarding world. As always, Harry is right at the middle of it all, yet in a situation he couldn't have ever fathomed and alongside the very person whom he was supposed to hate. It changes them both.
