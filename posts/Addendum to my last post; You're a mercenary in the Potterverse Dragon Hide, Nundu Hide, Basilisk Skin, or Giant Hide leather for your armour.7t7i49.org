***** No, no. The novelty aspect is optional. Without a codpiece, well, one may as well be naked.

Sadly, in the clockwork orange film they didn't have the novelty codpieces they had in the books.

** Like, we can just choose one? Because the nundu and basilisk skin ones would be wayyyy more expensive than dragonhide. IDK about giants, because 1. they are sapient, and 2. I think there might have been laws protecting them? and 3. they are endangered regardless of whether it is legal, so it would be more expensive than dragonhide, but I dunno how much compared to the other 2. Anyway, dragonhide would be by far the cheapest, so unless I'm a rich mercenary...

As far as actual protection goes, its likely the nundu is the best, since 100 wizards are needed to take one down; it seems unlikely that they need that many wizards just to cast some wind spells to keep the breath away from them. After that it would be giant hide or basilisk skin because Hagrid, a half giant, took 6 stunners with no effect, while dragons are taken down by 6 or above. Basilisks we don't really know how effective their skin is, so it could be above or below dragonhide.

*** It takes 100 wizards to subdue one (as in stunning or otherwise taking it alive), which does not mean killing it is difficult. NBC gear and a good rifle will make dealing with a Nundu easy but good luck trying to deal the instant mortal gaze of a Basilisk, which also happens to fry optical systems.

**** Yes, but it is the magical resistance we are talking about here I'm fairly sure. The ability to resist 50+ stunners at once is far greater than a dragons, though again we don't know how good a basilisks skin would be. Maybe it /is/ better than a nundu's skin, but we probably will never know for sure.

Also, as far as not being able to kill a basilisk... it depends on the situation, but just aim a ton of machine guns in its general direction, as well as a few RPGs. lol. Or with time to prepare, I'm sure people could get a sonar system for a basilisk. And of course there is the canon method of recruiting Fawkes, though that only works before 6th year. hmmm... I wonder if theres any giant (and entirely blind) bats that are the mortal enemy of basilisks lmao, or maybe some deep sea horror.

** How about all of the above? Depending on thickness of the armor, some of them (like dragon hide) would be very unbendy, and horrible for joints, so i would say depending on heaviness and how they each stack up to different spells (thickness x spell resistance) nundu hide for joints, gloves and such. Basilisk (because of colour) as a vest/undershirt and pants. Dragon for pauldrons, shin protectors, bracers etc.

Tl:dr flexible material as clothing and in joints, hard material as serious protection over that. (Think knight)

*** Omake

Sirius studied the reports from the North Pole. It boiled down to three data points:

Basilisk Skin armour was the strongest but too thick and unwieldy.

Dragon Skin armour was light and incredibly resistant and could he hinged properly.

Nundu Hide armour was deficient in gross protection comparatively but had an interesting property. If attuned to a wearer, it acted as the hide did on the animal: stealthy, reflective of non-lethal spells(a too strong lancing pierce had cut right through it and removed a researcher's arm), and could be induced to mimic other materials.

As he read, he had a mental image and grinned. A hastily penned memo was sent back to the North Pole.

⁂

Head Researcher and former Unspeakable Hamish Doright idly watched his assistant, Glenda Goodwitch, as she cleaned up the broken vase. The room they were in was completely proofed from magic so she was currently bent over sweeping up the shards, shaking the best looking arse Hamish had seen outside muggle pornography. He tore his gaze away when she started to stand and didn't notice the smirk on her face.

A tap at the door and she opened it to find her assistant, Sara Leigh, holding a missive from Sirius. "The big boss had an idea."

She took the note and brought it over to Hamish, bending over more than necessary to put it on the desk in front of him, showing off her lack of of undergarments. Hamish blushed and she grinned.

She was going to marry him no matter what it took.

~•~

Hamish pushed the thought of Glenda underneath his desk and read the letter. He laughed and went to do as ordered.

⁂

Harry saw the mark of the Academy on the box and, after verifying it with his glasses' verification mode, he opened the box.

As soon as his fingernail broke through the spellotape, the box burst open in a bout of fireworks and somethign white flashed past as Harry thought Sirius promised to stop doing that!

His vision was obscured as he felt something wrap around his leg. Then his arm. Then his waist. And his other leg. And the other arm was wrapped in a cool embrace. His vision was obscured again and then he could see but something was pressing against his face.

~•~

After a long moment, the students watching what was happening to Harry burst into raucous laughter. The third year student was covered in a nundu hide and head, cut and tailored to fit the boy.

A letter appeared in front of Harry and Hermione grabbed it, as she, Licorice, and Sophie giggled as Harry sighed at the humiliation.
