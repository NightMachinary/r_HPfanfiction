I'm looking for any fics where Harry and Ginny are in the same year at Hogwarts. I'll take a soul bond to explain but I'd prefer slight changes in her age (I saw one where she and Ron were twins). Hopefully a story that's finished and goes through all seven years if possible. Thanks for the help.


** This series plays off the soul bond. Pacing is really slow, and it's only the first couple years and incomplete. I dunno, you might enjoy it.

*** I love that series, but the downside of the author going into so much detail on how the soul bond affects everyday life means updates take forever.

***** Perhaps, but every other soul bond fic I've read pretty much skims over the soul bond, so I find this one rather revolutionary in comparison.

****** The first one I found enjoyable, but the second part did me in. I just couldn't find the motivation to read any further.

And not because the quality is worse either, it just got old.

******* I remember reading this a while ago and I think I had the same response. It's really well written but the author gets... Tolkienesque... when describing the soul bond and it becomes rather difficult to read. I'm really looking for a story that goes all 7 years though because a lot of the ones I've found get to about 4th year and then are abandoned.
