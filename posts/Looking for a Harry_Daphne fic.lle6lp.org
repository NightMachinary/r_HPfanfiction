:END:
I remember it being on ffn. It started in 4th or 5th year. There was a marriage contract. They left great Britain to America. They travel around and doing their owls and newts. Then settle down in Alaska have twins and adopt a baby girl in the hospital when they found out she was a witch. After a while the order finds their coordinates. Snaps tips off Voldemort

That's all I really remember but I've been thinking about it for a week and haven't been able to find it
