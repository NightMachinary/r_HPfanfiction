Hi, I'm hoping you all can help us out with a psychology study we are conducting. We are doing an anonymous survey (30 min or less) about fanfiction. If you participated in the first study, you are more than welcome to participate in this second study (it is different).

Participants *over the age of 18* are eligible to win a $50 Amazon gift card (chances of winning are 1 in 100, draw entries will be confidential and not associated with survey responses).

You can take the survey online at:

[[https://tamuc.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dpdjnAF4AaEG4MB]]

The survey will be open until May 15, 2019.

Thank you!

** That questionaire is completely ridiculous, repeats questions and asks questions that are impossible to answer correctly.

*** I strongly agree. In more than ten years reading HP fanfiction I've never encountered any sort of drama... (who cares about drama? Do you refer to dramatic stories? wtf) I mean, it feels like the people making the survey have 0 experience with fanfiction or are basing their research on a community of 13 year old teens somewhere... I thought this would be interesting but I can't even.... damn.

** As someone currently studying for a PhD largely centred around Qualitative research methods I found that survey painful. In an undergrad dissertation/thesis the important thing to do is have questions for participants which aren't overly complex, or long, and which has a syntax grounded in existing theory. You're relying on brief explanations and acronyms at the top of a page and hoping respondents stick with this and intuitively grasp the labels of SFF, NSNFF, etc. You'd have been better grounding these as situational questions and applying these labels for the academic side of things in the write up. The way it's structured currently means you'll probably lose a lot of your N to partial completion, meaning you'll lose a lot of valuable input. In future I'd recommend a small pre-test group for your survey using 10 or so people who have nothing to do with psychology of anything and take on board the feedback you get from them before rolling it out for full data collection.

** Tbh I think it's probably ok? I mean, now's the time for undergrad capstone thingies, and Reddit's a good place to find fanfiction enthusiasts. If I were a senior in college doing research on fanfiction, I'd definitely think about finding people here. That being said, if someone steals my identity or something, I'll let you know ;)

** That was an awful survey. I've done quite a bit of psychology related surveys, and they way things were formulated and asked in this one was - I don't even know the word for it. It's like it gave me a headache trying to figure out what they heck it was trying to ask and how I was supposed to answer. I'm not sure what sort of info OP is hoping to get from this, but I'm not sure it's going to be worth anything.

** Well. I think they need to specify the people they want for this survey. I've read like 400 Harry Potter fanfics or so and I felt unqualified to answer most questions. How should I know if my fanfic-group is better than others? Or if it is easy to change such a group? Or questions if I want someone of this community as a coworker. It's not as if I interact with alot of people reading fanfiction... Just feels to me as if this survey has wrong questions...
