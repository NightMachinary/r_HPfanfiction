#+TITLE: Searching for a well written, fairly long fan fiction with godlike Dumbledore. I get bored with bashing, so no Ron, Harry or Dumbledore bashing. Preferably minimal bashing of anyone period. I've seen godlike Harry and powerful Hermione, but I've never seen powerful or super intelligent dumbeldore.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

However, no matter how special the magic is, your framing is everything for the perception of the reader (e.g. blocking the avada kedavra is more godlike than others since a lot of emphasis was put on it being unblockable)
