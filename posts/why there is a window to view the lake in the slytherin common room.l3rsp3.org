frequently in fafic (not sure if in cannon) there is the window to view into the lake.

i like to think that when building the dungeons and common room area Godric was digging and accidentaly dug into the lake, causing the rooms to flood for a while.


** I like to think that Salazar both liked the view and that the great squid was his pet. I mean, the dude already had a Basilisk in the basement, is it really /that/ far of a reach to imagine him with a giant squid?

I just like to think of him as a copy of Hagrid.

*** I like the idea that Slytherin was not a blood purist in the traditional sense.

but he was just suspicious of muggleborn students not having any loyalty to their fellow wizards and selling them out.

I also like the idea, the legend of the chamber of secrets only spread because slytherin in his dying days returns to hogwarts to tell godric about it and apologise

**** Wicked headcanon, you've got there.

I mean, it was around that time that Muggles started targeting and killing witches(which is also why i ship him as a feminist). He had good reason to not trust Muggleborns.

****** Ah, but there are Muggle-borns and Half-Bloods and old pure-bloods who I assume might have some old views(from what I remember, it was on the oldest male to inherit and such)(in the case of the Black family), so I can totally see it as a thing. Maybe not as much as the Muggle world, but they would still have it.

****** Only if you assume the only difference between the sexes is athletic. If you /don't/, then...

Pregnancy and childbirth is still a thing. Magicals and muggles are interbreeding enough that wizards and witches will have mostly the same genetics as muggle men and women. Hormones too, barring large-scale intervention with magic.

Sexism would still be a thing. It'd just be shaped differently.

**** I like to think that Salazar didn't want muggleborns at Hogwarts because he thought it wasn't good for /them/.

Remember, this was a time when there were lots of different languages being spoken - Anglo-saxon, Cumbric and Cornish in England, Welsh in Wales and Scots Gaelic in Scotland. On top of that, nobles would have spoken French and there were numerous viking enclaves speaking Old Norse. And of course everything was written in Latin, which was also the language of churches and courts.

So a young muggleborn at the time probably wouldn't even know the language being spoken at Hogwarts (I'm guessing Latin). Never mind the fact they wouldn't be able to read or write, would not at all know how to behave in a school setting (likely would have been working the farm), and culturally would have nothing in common with their fellow students.

And when you consider the population size, Hogwarts probably only had 1 muggleborn student every 5-10 years. The idea that Hogwarts maybe wasn't the best place for them to learn isn't that outlandish.

** *CoS:*

#+begin_quote
  The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high backed chairs.
#+end_quote

No further descriptions exist in CoS. Interestingly, to my knowledge, the dungeons are never described as "damp" (that is reserved for the CoS). They are, however, very cold in winter. This is potentially relevant, because actually, below 10 or so metres under the surface, the temperature is constant 10°C all year round. So this variation could be explained by being under the lake, where the lake functions as a giant heater/cooler. In summer, you won't get above perhaps 15°C, and in winter, it might be just above freezing.

(Obviously, magic could throw a spanner in the works here, but it doesn't seem intuitively obvious why you would have magic to make it cold and uncomfortable for half the year.)

*Pottermore:*

#+begin_quote
  Our emblem is the serpent, the wisest of creatures; our house colours are emerald green and silver, and our common room lies behind a concealed entrance down in the dungeons. As you'll see, its windows look out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. We often see the giant squid swooshing by --- and sometimes more interesting creatures. We like to feel that our hangout has the aura of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck.
#+end_quote

As to /why/, it's because it's cool and I dig living in an underwater common room :3

.

The more interesting question is actually /how/. As we know, Hogwarts sits atop the lake on a cliff. So for the common room to be /under/ the lake, you need to go a whole lotta way down. It can't be simply one or two storeys beneath the ground floor. So either, Slytherins (and everyone going to potions, possibly) have to walk up and down a couple hundred stairs every day (imagine climbing to the top of one of the mediaeval cathedral towers, if you've ever done that), /or/ there is some serious magic going on that shortens the way. If it's the latter, maybe Slytherin got Ravenclaw to do it for him?

*** First-years go across the lake and into the castle on boat, so the lake does reach the castle.

From the first book:

#+begin_quote
  They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of under-ground harbour, where they clambered out onto the rocks.

**** Is your point that the harbour is technically part of the castle?

Because otherwise, it literally says "underneath the castle" -- after the castle was declared on top of a cliff above them, and before they go /up/ a passageway from the harbour that leads onto the grounds near the castle.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
#+end_quote

However, yes, my headcanon is that there are secret ways from the dungeons to the harbour. Because that, too, is cool.

*Edit:*

Also, the harbour and the entire cliff are seriously underused locations in FF. There are lots of things you could do with it. Use it more, everyone!

****** Oh, I see. Well, there definitely is a discussion to be had about how tall the cliff is. I always kinda imagined at least 100 ft or so, but technically, a cliff can be 10 or 20 ft too.

It's never specified. But perhaps it's rather on the small side, so the dungeons don't have to be all that far below the castle ground floor.

**** I once read a fic in which the Slytherin common room had enchantments that could detect intruders and it appeared unwelcoming to Harry and Ron when they came in as Crabbe and Goyle. It explains why they found it off putting and it also fits the semi-sentience that I like to imagine Hogwarts has. Or J.K. Rowling just hadn't thought of underwater windows for the common room yet.

**** True. Out-of-book explanation could be that Rowling only came up with it as they made the movies, and it wasn't a thing when she wrote CoS.

In-book ... it was dark outside, and they didn't notice?

** Part of the Slytherin dorms are located under the lake. I think the window thing is purely fanon as there is no canon proof that it exists. Still, I think it'd be neat to have a window to see into the lake itself, like a massive aquarium in the dorm.

** I don't think they actually do have a window into the lake, mostly because I don't think the Slytherin common room is anywhere near close enough to the lake for such a window to exist in the first place. I think it's just a very sophisticated piece of magic, kinda like the one on the ceiling of the Great Hall, that creates the illusion of a window into the lake.

** I like to think that none of the Founders used future architecture when building Hogwarts and the Slytherin dorms are a later addition to the castle (like ALL the parts we see) and someone thought a window into the lake would be awesome, not considering what would be required of the house elves to keep the outside of it clean and clear.
