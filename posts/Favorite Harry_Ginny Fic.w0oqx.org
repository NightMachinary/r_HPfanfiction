#+begin_quote
  When the Weasley Boys interfere in Ginny's relationship with Dean, they make the biggest mistake of their lives. The witch decides that revenge is in order, and her first point of call is a new boyfriend - Harry.

It was started pre-HBP so it's AU; hope you don't mind.

*** The whole "email" things made me laugh far too hard. Those names they call themselves are rather ridiculous.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry_Potter_and_Godrics_Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]] by hermyd. This is one of those "Harry strikes out on his own" type stories, with a little Dumbledore bashing if that bothers you.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5307000/1/Just_You_and_Me][Just You and Me]] by kq551. This is a retelling of canon if Harry and Ginny had become friends sooner. A couple warnings: a) this is not a complete story, though it was updated a few months ago so it might still be finished eventually, and b) it gets a bit dark after CoS, with some implied pedophila (onesided Tom Riddle/Ginny).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] by S'TarKan. Harry, having lived through Voldemort and gang killing everyone he loves, sends his consciousness back in time to his 11 year old self. This story is NOT COMPLETE, much to my dismay, and probably never will be (has not been updated since 2009). But it's fantastic, and there is Harry/Ginny. It's very limited, though, since Ginny is a kid and Harry is not creepy, even though in his "past future" he and Ginny were married.

The Potters seem to be quite the perfect family, but it took them a while to get there. This is the story about the extreme highs and extreme lows of Harry and Ginny's relationship after the war ended.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward_With_Purpose][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1779333/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Runespoor_Shield][Harry Potter and the Runespoor Shield]] Harry is still angry but this year he has a person to blame. A secret trunk, a kitten with a secret and an secret potion.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1089264/1/][I'll be Home for Christmas]]: /Harry was supposed to be home for Christmas three years ago. Now its that time of year again and all of the Weasley's are gathered at the burrow, including Ginny and her son.../ It's complete, so that's good, and it's very sweet - I cried :)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563043/1/][The Real Memory]]: /Voldemort strikes and Harry falls. When he comes back to himself he isn't at Kings Cross with Dumbledore. Instead he's at the Dursleys, going to Stonewall High instead of Hogwarts. Why?/ An interesting piece - I feel like I can't say much without giving something away, but it's different.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that both are AU
