I'm looking for stories similar to this, like the munchkinry or D&D aspect. I prefer 100k+ fics but if it's less than that and still updating that's fine. I just really want something similar to HP&N20, it's a fantastic read.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** HPMOR certainly has a bit of munchkinry.

You might enjoy “So How Can I Weaponise This?” - but I think it might be stalled.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
