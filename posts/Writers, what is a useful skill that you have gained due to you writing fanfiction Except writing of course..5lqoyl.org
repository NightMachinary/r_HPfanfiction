** Planning and organization definitely.

Keeping a serialized story going for any length of time takes a good grasp of scheduling, pacing, and a very good ability to keep yourself, your thoughts, and your notes arranged in a way that makes progress as easy to achieve as possible.

** Confidence - and it should be acknowledged as a skill far more often.

Before I started writing fanfiction, I was socially awkward to a comical degree. But the exercise of actually writing down all of the snarky, steamy, schmaltzy and generally absurd conversations that I fantasize about having all the time forced me to loosen up. A /lot/.

No longer do I fear embarrassment. I do with on the daily with relish, and my social life is all the healthier for it.

** - Editing/Con-crit, if those count as not writing. I'm more aware of grammar and structural elements in writing and gotten much better at reading analytically as a result (noticing trends, conventions, and literary elements and understanding how they affect the reader).
- Learning how to design a website/blog (so HTML and CSS).
- Openness to concepts and ideas that might seem 'out-there' at first glance like m-preg, polyamory, and homosexual relationships (I wasn't homophobic, but uncomfortable with the subject bc I didn't have any experience w/ it).\\

** Being proficient at writing using British spelling and vocabulary. After my fanfic days had waned, I got a freelance writing gig with a U.K. firm. About 90% of the assignments specified British English. Because of writing fanfic, I could easily pass the British usage test and qualify for those assignments.

** Understanding people. Each of the characters that I write is very different -- they come from different backgrounds, have varied personality traits and react to the same sorts of situations in wildly different manners. By understanding what makes them tick, I think I've learned a lot about the people around me and how a wide variety of factors can influence any one behaviour/action.

** I tried to think of something else, but for me it is the improvement in my writing. Other than that, my American English has improved greatly.

Good luck with your writing.

** I've learnt quite a lot about 'fanfiction', but when it comes to skills outside writing, well it has to be the giving and taking of critique I suppose, and reading criticallly as a writer (makes it very difficult to find fanfiction I enjoy, but that's another thing). I have grown a reasonably thick skin too, and discovered a dogged bloodymindedness I didn't know I had in being able to keep writing even without getting any reader response at all. Which is probably a skill of a sort.
