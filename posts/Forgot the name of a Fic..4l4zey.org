Read it quite a while back. I don't remember whether it was good or not but what I do remember about it is that Harry went on a one-man rampage against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. And he kept using potions to boost his health/stamina/etc. but he was definitely in bad shape. There was a Wizengamot session happening at the same time as well about what he was doing. Anyone know the name of this fic?


** Unforgiving minute maybe?

*** Just finished reading it.

It's just not credible that Harry could be that powerful after year 5. Other 'super Harry' stories at least have explanations, be it muggle weapons, intensive training, super wands, horcrux merging, or elemental transformation.

Your *Spygirl* story also had Grangers as super spies helping him out.

**** And in Spygirl, the Dark Lord wasn't defeated in battle, much less by Harry.

**** I think its like that potion law, when they are making a combined antidote, where some sort of alchemical process magically makes the potion better than the sum of its parts. Thus combining large amounts of narcotics, by some alchemical process makes Harry super.

  This story, as a few are in the world of Harry Potter fanfiction, stems from one of those many ideas of Rorschachs Blot, entitled "Nothing to Lose." One of the areas this story will explore is the possible impact on Harry Potter and friends of the isolation that our dear old friend, Albus Dumbledore, always fed to him: this isolation will make up its own reality.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

*** Ruthless was awesome. I just wish Harry had been a bit more 'ruthless' with one of his last choices haha. Very well written though.
