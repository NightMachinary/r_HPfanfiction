Fics on Voldemort's years in Hogwarts, after, I don't mind. Well written, decent length, good feature of magic, conflict with Dumbledore.


** I'm not sure what length counts as decent, but here are some I've enjoyed that are long or fully completed.

*Starting pre-Hogwarts*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11562871/1/Addendum-He-Is-Also-A-Liar][Addendum: He Is Also a Liar]] - Tom's accidental magic repeatedly sends him to Hermione's present. They become friends before they each get their Hogwarts letters. linkffn(11562871)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185107/1/Stepbrother][Step Brother]] - AU fic in which Hermione was born in the 1920s. Her parents adopt Tom Riddle and they are both forced to adapt. linkffn(11185107)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] - The night of his parents' death Harry is sent back in time to grow up with Tom at Wools Orphanage. linkffn(5925524)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][Them's the Rules]] - Harry travels back in time to adopt Tom Riddle. linkao3(284278)

*Starting during Tom's Hogwarts years*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] - The course of history is derailed when Tom meets MoD!Harry on the train to Hogwarts. linkffn(10311215)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]] - Dumbledore takes Tom under his wing to protect him from a time traveling dark wizard (Harry) who wants to kill him. linkffn(12331839)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2501577/1/Riddle-s-War][Riddle's War]] - Riddle is evacuated to the countryside along with the other orphans during a summer of the London Blitz. linkffn(2501577)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] - Harry accidentally travels back to the year that Tom Riddle would have opened the Chamber of Secrets. Events spiral out of control beyond what Harry would ever have expected. linkffn(11261838)

*Post Hogwarts*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7452468/1/The-Children-of-Set][The Children of Set]] - Tom travels overseas in search of ancient knowledge. (H.P. Lovecraft inspired one-shot) linkffn(7452468)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/chapters/23549517][Blood and Gold]] - Hermione meant to go back in time to murder Merope before she could give birth, but an accident strands her much later after Tom had already graduated from Hogwarts. linkao3(10643571)

The following fics are excellent, but still relatively new. The authors update them frequently, so I'd recommend checking them out.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] - After his death, Voldemort awakens in the body of his teenage self. With his sanity restored, he resolves not to repeat the errors that lead to his ignominious death. linkffn(13088810)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13126915/1/Diablerie][Diablerie]] - Tom Riddle is summoned to the present from a summer of surviving the London Blitz. linkffn(13126915)

  It's a pretty safe bet this isn't the war you're thinking of. It's 1943, and Tom Riddle has found himself completely caught up in it. Like hundred of children he's being evacuated, and dear God he's not happy. Basically, a character development that took

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)

  Despite his impoverished circumstances, Tom Riddle always knew he was destined for great things. The ability to travel back and forth through time was a bit of a surprise, though.

  Eilin Firebeard will find herself in Erebor at the end of the battle of the five armies. There she will have to come to terms with how different she really is.
