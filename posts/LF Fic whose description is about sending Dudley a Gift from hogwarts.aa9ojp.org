All I remember from the description is Harry asking someone, I suspect Hermione whether there was a way to send gifts from Hogwarts. I think the premise was that this change affected Harry and Dudley's relationship. Would appreciate help finding the title

Cheers in advance!


** Not in the description but it's in the first couple paragraphs of chapter one. Linkffn(9969014)

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.
