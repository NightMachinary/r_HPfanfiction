I have this idea for a full 7-year series. Its basically an American Parody fic where at least 70% of everything is reversed for the heck of it. Protagonist: Harris Porter. Sidekicks: Rhonda Wesley and Herman Strange. Now, I do have most of the plots ready: the only ones I don't have are books 2 and 4 (i moved CoS to book 6 and GoF to book 5, it works better with the escalation of the overall plot) so i need alternate plots somewhat based off Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince that could conceivably be done by second and fourth years respectively. Book 1 involves a similar sort of 'save cool thing from people who follow main antagonist' sort of thing. Book 3 involves both a jailbreak and a jury-rigged time machine that has noticeable flaws and no safety features whatsoever. Book 5 is basically triwizard but for paid professionals and people who legitimately know what they're doing. and the whole thing is a field trip. Book 6 involves big monster, possession, and patronuses. Book 7 is basically a yearlong Harris and Co vs basically satan.

Please help with plots for books 2 and 4? I want to actually plan things out for once in my life. Thanks!


** For Half-blood Prince, Harris could be granted an apprenticeship with a really old guy who never quite tells him the answers to things, often trying to make analogies to the cigars that he smokes. The old guy keeps getting almost killed - poisoned, things dropped on him, animal attacks, etc. but Harris keeps expecting him to be dead only for the codger to reappear with some bullshit power having saved him. End of the book the codger dies. Harris finds the body, asks if he really means it this time. Sits down and stares at him for a while. Takes one of the codgers cigars and smokes it. "Yeah. You're dead."

*** /Harris wipes his eyes/ "He... he was a great man, Professor Drombledroe was. He taught me most everything I know." /Harris pauses./ "On second thought, he literally taught me nothing. I taught myself using his inane ramblings about cigars and what may or may not be phallic symbolism as background noise. But his existence was pretty convenient for my education, I guess?" /Harris steps away from the podium and stays silent for the rest of the funeral./ But really though, I love it! I think I like the idea of this teacher not actually teaching him anything, but really just getting Harris into mildly educational situations through sheer coincidence and trying to compare everything to either cigars or phalluses, Harris being 12 lets the latter go right over his head.
