Hey everyone, this is my first post here but I've been an avid reader of Harry Potter fan fiction for years. My recent kick is some next generation stories, specifically stories with Lily Luna as the main character. Was hoping someone could recommend some good fics, hopefully on the longer scale. I've read Slytherin's Potter and loved it so if anyone has any ideas or suggestions let me know!


** Came here to suggest Slytherins Potter ðŸ˜‚ that's my favorite one. I've read a lot of other one's too, I'll look through and get some together and get back to you

** So there's a few of these I actually don't remember well as it's been so long but: (All on fanfiction.net)

Seasons May Change- LadyZaidey (30 chapters)

Slytherin's Littlest Potter- Konflickted (47 chapters) *This one I'm not remembering right now but it's on my reading list so I think I liked it?

Devil's Kiss- runningYODA (20 chapters)

Wanting What You Can't Have- nadenlouis3 (29 chapters)

Snake Charmer- x8xdani6x (59 chapters)

Out of My Reach- ShopacholicRed (40 chapters)

Give It All For You- C. N. Bailey (56 chapters) * I'm not recognizing this one at all so I'm not sure if it's good or I stopped reading because I didn't like it

Birthday Wishes Always Come True- albe-chan (43 chapters) *okay so for this one theres 16 chapters of Birthday Wishes Always Come True but then she starts the second one (Wish Upon a Star) in the same thread and it's not finished on ff.net but it is on AO3 under the username albe_chan and supposedly she's writing a third but not sure

All the ones I've listed above are complete. There is one I'm reading that's not, but gets updated pretty frequently and I'm really liking it so far:

Lily Potter and the Villain in the Valley- LiloLunaPotter (89 chapters so far and a lot more story to go) Sorry I took longer than planned to get back to you

**** You're welcome! If I think of more (some of the ones I remember reading are lost to the void of when I read them before having an account) I'll add them to this thread! :)
