** It's not disarming, but in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18549484/chapters/43965880][another bend in the road]] by LullabyKnell Cedric just apparates him and Harry away from the graveyard.

** There's some time traveling fic I don't remember the name of where Harry drills "if you're suddenly in a graveyard, run" in to Cedric for basically all of fourth year, ends up getting him really paranoid about graveyards. Fortunately when he eventually ends up in the graveyard the training sticks.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** I think I've seen one where they land on the edge of a slope and Cedric rolls down. Harry does his stuff while Cedric runs to get help.

Even if Wormtail was disarmed Nagini (who took out Harry and Hermione as 17 year olds) is still roaming around...

** Damn! Now the divergence for one of the +three+ +four+ five different versions of the same general fanfic I'm writing but will never finish has been spoiled.

In all seriousness I really do like that idea though, I always thought it would make a lot of sense for them to end up in a graveyard, look at each other and go "Take the cup back to the maze you reckon?" "Yep."

**** Perhaps, but it's only a matter of time before Fake Moody shows up, and Harry still doesn't know that he isn't really Barty Crouch. He'll probably try to disarm both Cedric and Harry, and then continue the ritual.
