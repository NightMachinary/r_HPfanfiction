This isn't really a big thing but I've just come to realise how often Harry and Hermione meet as kids whenever Harry is raised by someone else . It's kind of a trope.

I'm just curious if there's an actual explaination have I missed something?

Have stopped reading some good fics because of this. As you can probably guess not a big fan of Hermione.

On that note if there any fics where they don't meet as children and become besties in alt guardians fics please recommend.

Thank you!


** I almost want to do a subversion of this, where Hermione ends up hating Harry because he's clearly in a loving relationship with his (adopted) parents, while her parents are so focused on their careers that they constantly forget that she even exists.

*** That's awesome, and you've got me thinking about trope subversions.

What about, AU Harry does end up at the same school as Hermione pre-Hogwarts - but they still don't become friends! No bullying or anything, just plain old 'didn't really notice you that much' primary school acquaintances.

And the bonus would be, they still don't become friends at Hogwarts lol.

*** This thought also came to my mind as an interesting way to write it. Other trope that was constant and that I hate is removing Ron from the trio so that OOC Hermione Harry Neville, or Hermione Harry OOC Draco be a trio. I wanted to create a fic with a Harry/Ron/Neville or just Harry/Ron/Male OC/Neville, just out of spite to reverse the roles. Or even better Harry meets Hermione first in the Diagon Alley and like it is in his canon mindset, thinks that he couldn't imagine anyone being that annoying and bossy, reminding him of Petunia, cause lets be honest, that's what he would think, and what he precisely thought before the troll incident(that she was annoying and that she should just mind her own business, not reminding him of Petunia).

** Yeah, I've seen some incredibly stupid examples of this.

I once saw Harry being raised by Sirius and then, I shit you not, he accidentally mispronounces Diagon Alley while Flooing there and ends up... in the VERY MUGGLE and VERY NOT CONNECTED TO THE FLOO home of Hermione. I stopped reading after this.

That's the one example I remember off the top of my head.

He almost always meets Hermione early and becomes friends with her and/or he gets immediately introduced to the Weasleys and becomes best friends with them, which I don‘t think makes sense either.

#+begin_quote
  There were many different versions of the first chapter of 'Philosopher's Stone' and the one I finally settled on is not the most popular thing I've ever written; lots of people have told me that they found it hard work compared with the rest of the book. The trouble with that chapter was (as so often in a Harry Potter book) I had to give a lot of information yet conceal even more. There were various versions of scenes in which you actually saw Voldemort entering Godric's Hollow and killing the Potters and in early drafts of these, a Muggle betrayed their whereabouts. As the story evolved, however, and Pettigrew became the traitor, this horrible Muggle vanished.

  Other drafts included a character by the name of 'Pyrites', whose name means 'fool's gold'. He was a servant of Voldemort's and was meeting Sirius in front of the Potters' house. Pyrites, too, had to be discarded, though I quite liked him as a character; he was a dandy and wore white silk gloves, which I thought I might stain artistically with blood from time to time.

  The very, very earliest drafts of the first chapter of 'Philosopher's Stone' have the Potters living on a remote island, Hermione's family living on the mainland, her father spotting something that resembles an explosion out at sea and sailing out in a storm to find their bodies in the ruins of their house. I can't remember now why I thought this was a good idea, but I clearly recognised that it wasn't fairly early on, because the Potters were re-located to Godric's Hollow for all subsequent drafts.

** For a reason: I think people still just gravitate towards the most familiar characters.

I didn't mind this scenario the first couple of times, if the story introduced it in good way I could live with it. But now I'm like you, I'll drop a story that has them meet out of nowhere pre-Hogwarts.

One of the better rationales is if the AU Harry is also a genius or very gifted at something, I can accept that the odds of them meeting may shorten and they could end up at a specialty school together. It's still a reach, but I can see a bit of logic behind it, so let it slide.
