Preferably not Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Peverell-Hogwarts-Whatever stories or Harry subjugating the sitting Monarch, but rather Harry becoming involved with them through accident (e.g. hidden identities) or looking for help.

Bonuspoints: Harry marries into the Royal Family (e.g. Princess Hermione or something)


** Actually now I want to read a story in which Hermione is Royalty and anyone who threatens (You're next Mudbloods) or attacks her gets a visit from a group of well-dressed gentleman send there by the MI5. Or imagine the following scene

"You are nothing but a worthless mudblood bint."

"You know that my grandmother commands 300 thermonuclear missiles, right?"

** I read one of these a few months ago: linkffn(11500936)

I will be interested to see what others have to suggest, since I think this could be interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

  This is in response to a plot bunnie on how to give Vernon Dursley a heart attack. Rating to be on safe side. This story is a one shot and complete.
