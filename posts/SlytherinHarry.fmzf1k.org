Harry gets sorted into Slytherin, which makes Malfoy try to get closer to him. (After the *failed handshake*, I guess he gained some respect for Harry since he was able to hold his ground against him??) However, the famous Harry Potter goes off on the other houses when they try to give him crap about being in Slytherin, but also doesn't tolerate people (including those in his own House) acting like jerks in general. (This applies to Malfoy when he gives every Muggle-born student crap for their parentage.)

Random Gryffindor, trying to Slytherin-bash Harry: Y'know, Slytherin is the House of snakes, full of the evil and cunning. A majority of the Dark Wizards have hailed from that house!

Harry: And Gryffindor is the House of the brave, full of heroic, lionhearted wizards. However, they have been known to produce quite a lot of Dark Wizards in the past. Doesn't seem too heroic to me, buddy.

***********************

Malfoy: *making fun of a Muggle-born student*

Harry: Shouldn't you be worrying about your Transfiguration scores rather than picking on some kids, "Slytherin Prince?"


** I feel like I have read this story a couple of times. But Slytherin!Harry is always good.

**** You should try reading Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235]] it's my favorite slytherin!harry fic. It's also a WBWL but turns all of the normal cliches on their head. One of my favorite ongoing fics.

** My version of this scene from my Harry Potter and the Elder Sect:

[[https://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Elder_Sect/index/]]

*September 12 1991*

Madam Hooch draped her arm around a whimpering Neville Longbottom and turned to face the class.

"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!" She said, her eyes flashing. "You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."

Longbottom, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, limped off with Madam Hooch.

As soon as Hooch and Longbottom entered the castle Malfoy burst into laughter.

"Did you see his face, the great lump?"

Harry frowned when several of his fellow Slytherins started laughing.

"Shut up, Malfoy," snapped the Gryffindor Patil. Harry tried to remember her name... Parvati? Something like that.

"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" Pansy teased, "Never thought /you'd/ like fat little crybabies, Parvati."

"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."

A glass sphere glittered in the sun as he held it up.

"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find... how about... up a tree?"

"Do you have to be such a dick all the time Draco?" Harry asked with a sigh. "I mean seriously, why mess with the kid? He's hurt."

There was a pause while most of his housemates suddenly seemed to be a bit embarrassed. "Since the first night in the common room, you're all been complaining about how Slytherins are abused and blamed for everything that happens, and now, what happens the first time we end up with kids from another house and no teachers are around? Draco pulls a dick move, and you're all giggling like six-year-olds. What the hell?"

"You aren't in charge here Stevens! A Muggle loving nothing like you shouldn't even be in Slytherin!" Malfoy thundered, his eyes narrowing. "Maybe after today, you won't be."

Harry smiled. "Threatening me Draco? Ah, I am stung and oh so frightened. You have wounded me with your caustic wit and repartee." He held out his hand. "Quit being such a jerk and give me Longbottom's thingee."

Malfoy pivoted to throw the sphere against the wall of the castle, no doubt wanting to damage or destroy it. Harry speeded his perception of time and plucked the glass ball from his housemate's hand before he could complete the throw.

"God you're a dick Draco, worse than that, you're an ineffectual dick," Harry said as the blond stumbled when he found himself suddenly throwing nothing. Harry crossed the gap between the groups of students. "Hey, Parvati, right?"

The girl nodded suspiciously, and behind her, a redhead suddenly had his wand out and was pointing it into Harry's face.

"Calm down Red, I'm trying to be nice" Harry sighed. "Here's Longbottom's whatever it is."

"Rememberall," the bushy-haired brunette at Parvati's left said.

"Thanks, Longbottom's Rememberall. Could you get it to him?" Harry reached out and lifted the pretty girl's arm and placed the glass ball into her palm.

"Ok," Parvati whispered starting to blush.

"Thanks," Harry said turning away to return to his housemates, then paused and smiled. "Remember, Slytherins are just kids like everyone else here. We hardly ever have human sacrifices down in the dungeons anymore."

Absolute silence was his only answer, in fact, several of the Griffs paled.

"That was a joke," Harry pointed out.

The students from his Grandfather's house stayed silent.

"Oh, come on!" Harry said shaking his head and returning to the Slytherin side of the brooms. "Great Googly Moogaly, what's wrong with you people?"
