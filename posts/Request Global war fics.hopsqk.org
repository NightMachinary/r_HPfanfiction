I feel like the Second Wizarding War is not devastating enough. I mean, in most muggle conflicts, the total casualties of both Wizarding wars probably occured every minute. Any fics where there is a global, not local conflict? I had an idea once for a war between a Muggle-Wizard alliace and a powerful faction intent on destroying both, but I haven't written it yet. Any fics like this?


** The Stygian Trilogy by Slide seems to be going that way, but I'm on Starfall right now, the second part of the series, and there's definitely some global threat. It starts with linkffn(Ignite by Slide)

*** One of my favorite series. Without spoiling anything, can confirm that it goes full apocalyptic World War Z by the end.

Enjoy Starfall, by the way! The highlight of the series for me. (Oblivion is really good, but not as exciting and suspenseful imo).

**** I definitely am! I think my only gripe with it until now is how Draco is portrayed, but you've got to hand it to the author; I was never going to get into next gen without this series. Scorpius is precious, and I really love Selena Rourke, she's a very well-crafted OC, but I think Professor Lockett is my favourite anything here, she deserves everything.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** The four long next-gen series I've read are all apocalyptic to a degree. The Stygian Trilogy, mentioned below, is probably the best-written of them.

There's also linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation), a series which has a global conflict with some absolutely crazy buildups. Vekin87's linkffn(Albus Potter and the Dungeon of Merlin's Mist) series also features some worldwide conflict, although most of the warring is based in Britain. And G. Norman Lippert's James Potter series is pretty suspenseful and has some global strife iirc. Since Lippert took down his site, I'm not sure if it's accessible anymore besides a few illicit copies floating around on the darkweb.

Expanding the global scale of the Wizarding War is pretty much the focus of linkffn(Animagus at War), though you should probably read Accidental Animagus first. This expansion happens to a lesser degree in the same author's Arithmancer series, which is complete.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick) might not be your cup of tea, and is probably the least apocalyptic of all of these fics, but has a really interesting and complex civil conflict in an AU Wizarding America. It fits the description of the fic you were looking to write, and I'd recommend it anyway since it's so well written.

linkffn(Mud, Blood & the Sound of Guns by chase glasslace). The Ministry sides with Voldemort against the muggles. I don't remember how much of the war is shown.

linkffn(Burning Times by Alathon). Harry went into a long-term coma during the Horcrux hunt. The muggles definitely got involved.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** The problem is in my opinion, that except for the Battle of Hogwarts (perhaps), the Second Wizarding War was not really war, but something between guerilla war and law-enforcement operation. For the real war one has to go to the Grindewald's War, which was apparently much more drastic. See linkffn(12155794) for some lovely images from that.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
