Looking for a fic about Harry coming across a book full of forbidden knowledge(lovecraft shenanigans etc.) and goes kinda loopy with the knowledge. It's frustrating because I can't for the life of me remember the title. One scene that sticks with me is Harry doing a blood ritual in a room covered in blood runes where the blood bubbles up to form a person that looks like Harry's mother. If that jogged anyone's memory I'd really appreciate it. Thanks

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

  This story came to mind in the form of two questions: What would it have been like for Harry to have learned of magic before Hogwarts a different magic? What would it have been like for Harry if he had been in a different house? This story explores an alternate view of Harry's life and one of three choices.

  A prequel of sorts to Leviathan Rising. Harry got through the first task of the Triwizard Tournament thanks to some good, general advice. But what if 'Moody' had given Harry some different advice?
