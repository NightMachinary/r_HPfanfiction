As the title says I am looking for well written and believable Next Gen Stories. I love the Next Gen because there's a lot that you can do with it while still having it be believable and make sense to canon.

I am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. And I love Scorpius/Rose and Albus/Scorpius, but here's the thing. I don't want them being the exact copy of their parents.

So I don't want Rose/Scorpius if it's basically just Scorpius as a slightly nicer version of Draco, and being like hey this is what Hermione/Draco could have been like if Draco had been raised differently. Likewise I don't want Rose being exactly like her mother. Some similarities is fine, but I want her believable and not just a Hermione clone in her personality.

Also likewise if it is Albus/Scorpius I don't want it written in such a way that it's basically saying hey this is what Harry/Draco could have been like if Harry and Draco had been gay and nicer to each other. I don't want that. I don't want Albus and Scotpius to be the exact copy of their parents personality wise. I want them to be different and still believable enough, I want them to be their own person, just like Rose/Scorpius if the story is with that pairing.

And same with the other characters, I don't want them to act like other characters in canon, I want them to act like their own person, with their own personalities.

Anything else is fine, just as long as the story is interesting and makes sense with the world. So if a story has Teddy as a Metamorphmagus I don't want him to be a Werewolf, just because that is way too much. He's either a Werewolf or a Metamorphmagus , not both.

The main character can be any of the Next Gen characters, or even a Golden Trio Era character, just as long as the main focus is on the Next Gen.

Any rating is fine, if it's a multi-chapter I'd rather it be completed, but if not then updated regularly is fine or a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with any other pairing.


** I have three.

"Hogwarts Houses Divided." is my very favourite next-gen story, it focuses on Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts. Very OC-heavy, but then next-gen stories have to be by default, and the OCs are pretty fun.

"The Noticing of Lucy Weasley" is a very cute one-shot about Percy's daughter Lucy, and what it's like to be a shy introvert in a family of loud extroverts. The one gripe might be that James Sirius Potter doesn't come across well in the story; he's sort of portrayed as an obnoxious jerk.

linkffn(8035006; 3979062)

James Sirius Potter is a lot more positively portrayed in "The James Potter series," which is one of the most elaborate and polished-looking fanworks ever. This isn't your average fic on FF.Net; they have their own professional-looking site and everything.

The Our Little Secret series is great (first book works as a standalone as well), but I really enjoy some of the spinoff oneshots like linkffn(Mastermind vs LaVeela by Kerichi) and linkffn(Felix the Niffler by Kerichi)..

** If you're looking for drastically different Rose and Scorpius, maybe you'll appreciate Deceptive Natures and its sequel Devious Minds by frostykitten :

Linkffn(9059759) Linkffn(9820375)

I've read those something like three or four years ago so maybe I don't remember well, but it was quite an enjoyable read and a really interesting take on Rose and Scorpius' personnalities.
