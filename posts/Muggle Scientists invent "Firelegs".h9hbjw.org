You thought it was Pureblood Ignorance when they mentioned Firelegs, but Muggle Scientists managed to create them, and the world was forever changed.


** Actually, what springs to mind is a wizard hearing the term and attempting to recreate it. After scratching their head for a long time, wondering how setting your own legs on fire could possibly be a weapon, they settle for using it as a way to keep warm without a fireplace.
