** I just read through Blackpool which is essentially a story about the fucked up childhood of Regulus involving gaslighting disassociation trauma and what seems to be an addiction to dreamless sleep.

** I interpret the black family madness to manifest as obsession. Bellatrix is obsessed with the blood purity movement. I like to think that when you get the madness it's a long slow road to becoming fixated on one central idea to the exclusion of other thoughts.

Like the moon landing hoax people who would accost notable astronauts in public places. Or the Oklahoma City bomber for a direct comparison to Bellatrix (intelligent, skilled, and absolutely a menace to society).

*** yeah i agree obsession is part of it, i think that growing up in an environment surrounded by people like this makes a somewhat abusive and unstable childhood which definitely contributes so they throw themselves into one thing. and they are ultimately obsessed with their family. for all he hated them, sirius could not shut up about his family (and also murder), narcissa escaped by being perfect, bellatrix escaped by being unhinged, imo andromeda escaped through her intelligence
