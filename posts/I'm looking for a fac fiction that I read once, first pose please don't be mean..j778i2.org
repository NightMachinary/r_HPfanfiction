:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I once read this HP fan fiction and I don't really remember the main plot, but ire member that there was this one part where Harry locked the Goblins and the Dwarves in Gringotts and basically didn't let them leave until they had sorted out a banking system that worked for both of them. I'm pretty sure that the dwarves started a religion off of Harry, but I'm not to sure if that was a main point. Let me know if there is anything that is remotely close to what I'm looking for, because I suddenly got an intense urge to read it RIGHT NOW! and so please yes
