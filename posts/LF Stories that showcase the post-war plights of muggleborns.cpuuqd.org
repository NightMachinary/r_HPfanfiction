Something like linkffn(11196963) but without all the Deatheater whitewashing.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Not only Muggleborns, but anyone who is not part of the corrupt old establishment is s suffering. That's the key reason why Harry takes up the fight and why Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys, Neville, and the DA are united behind his cause. Honestly, it feels very good to see them take their revenge.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  All is seemingly well in Wizarding Britain as the last aftershocks of the War against the Dark Lord fade away, but a series of murders lead ace Auror Daphne Greengrass to a threat that may throw her world yet again into imbalance. COMPLETE!

** - /Dangerous/ by Black Lotus, unfortunately went down with the GrangerEnchanted archive, but there are copies floating around. (Short summary: a decade after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry has retried to a village in South America; while Hermione had stayed behind to try to reform the wizarding society. Now, the Ministry wants him to come back to help with the new Dark Lord---Hermione. It features a number of flashbacks about the events shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts, and how they impacted the Muggleborns.)
- I recall linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky) exploring some of these themes.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
