I'm chill with some stuff like canon divergence or AUs as long as they don't stray too far (I like gryffindor Harry plus Hermione and Ron), but I'm sick and tired of mediocre, bloated bullshit of goblin tests and political ploys with plots that go nowhere, characters who never fail, and one dimension characters and bashing. What are some good stories out there somewhat similar to canon that take their own path? Like Harry getting deeper into spell work, or magical creatures under Hagrid's tutelage, for example. Or bigger stuff like that one fic where Harry and the Ford Anglia accidentally land in a magical forest that's a wizard politics hotbox after running away from Hogwarts.


** I have some Trio centric fics with little bashing:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is highly recommended if you can accept non magical sci-fi settings. The story goes through all 7 years, but allocates half the length to the last two years. The Trio is totally awesome here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]], linkffn(10132530): Canon compliant until Harry's first private lesson with Dumbledore. Here, he bullied the answer out of Dumbledore during their first lesson, and things changed rather significantly afterwards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): A very interesting fic with a good, kick ass Petunia Evans. The Trio's adventure continues in its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Canon compliant until end of HBP. Grindelwald broke out after Dumbledore's death and offered to help Harry and his friends. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): A very different 'Harry' went through all 7 years, still made friends with Ron and Hermione, and still revisited several canon stations, albeit with some major differences. Most popular fic on this sub by far, and totally hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Canon compliant until the end of DH. Harry had it enough after the war when the Ministry and Wizengamot turned out to be incorrigible. The Trio dived very deep into dark arts, including blood and soul magic. Another very popular fic on this sub.

--------------

Finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650][Backward with Purpose, Part I]], linkffn(4101650): A time travel that goes through all 7 years. I personally disagree with the decision the author (and her characters) are taking, but for readers who enjoy some canon rehashes, it's a pretty good fic.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
