Alright. I am looking for new-ish HP crossovers that you would consider must-reads

excluding: sob-story abuse/rape/tumblr-ptsd/femharry/absurd-family/mpreg/slut-harry/yaoigayness


** Definitely Harry Potter Squatter - linkffn(13274956)

Pretty funny and quite well written, though kind of slow on the plot.

Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death is a JacobApples fic, so some people don't like his writing style, but I have no problems with it - linkffn(13299423)

Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe is kind of okay, nothing spectacular but a bearable crossover - linkffn(13326497)

Those are the only ones from recently published that I would consider must-reads.

*** 100% seconded for Harry Potter Squatter. Its just hilarious, and so so cute. You can't help but want to snuggle Harry.

I'd say Post Apocalypitic Potter is a bit of a sob-story fic though, at least in the begining.

I honestly just hope that Jacob actually finishes this one this time and doesn't get forgotten like a lot of other good fics of his.

**** He is adorable, isn't he?

It's nice seeing Enterprise getting back into the fandom. I really wish he would have finished his other stories, but I'll embrace this one with all the love I can give.

Also, do you have any ideas who is Harry's mother? It has been pointed out that it's probably not Hecate in the last chapter, but then who is it?

  Also, do you have any ideas who is Harry's mother? To be honest, I think its Aphrodites, simply because he's extremely charming. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was a minor or irrelevant goddess. If Hestia wasn't such a big part of the plot, I'd say its her, but it would seem too obvious. Mostly because of her demeanor compared to Harry's.

***** Thanks for pointing out "Harry Potter, Squatter"! I always avoided Percy Jackson crossovers because I have neither read the books, nor watched the movies. But I decided to give this one a try and I am loving it.

And when done, I have all the other Percy Jackson crossovers to read. Do you maybe have any recs there?

****** Oh, dear. There aren't many. Most of the crossovers are very, very poorly written and just bad. But I can post a few that are bearable, even if they are not exceptional.

linkffn(10641167) - Serpents and Celestial Bronze is interesting, starts very nice but quickly devolves. It has a curious premise but is almost completely in the Percy Jackson verse, so not really a crossover.

linkffn(8182529) - Prince of Death and its sequels, is bearable, it involves both universes and is semi-good.

linkffn(11441234) - Son of Athena is humour first and everything else last. It's mostly trippy and not really serious. You can see the author is having fun with the premise. I can recommend it as a light read.

linkffn(12662997) - Carpe Diem is probably the best of the bunch. It's seagate, so you know the writing is solid, it's well developed, but like the rest of his fics, it's slow paced and not finished, but it has been updated last March.

** Felix Fortuna is a very well-written crossover with Worm character Contessa/Fortuna as the protagonist! In case you're not aware, she has a power that gives her answers or steps to complete anything she wants as long as it is physically possible. Yes, it sounds powerful, and yes, the authors handle this quite well. The premise is that she wipes her memory and de-ages herself to have a normal life in a new random world - and just happens to end up as a witch in Harry Potter - which yes is a bit strange, but it's great. Just get past the introduction bit if it seems weird, it really is incredibly well-written, evocative, with excellent dialogue. It has some OCs however so if that's not your cup of tea be aware. There is also a Flavia de Luce expy - one of my favorite characters ever! - who is seeming to be a deuteragonist. Give it a try! linkffn(13347956)

**** There is really very little about the fic that is like Worm. It could just as well read like a story about a girl who has really good Seer powers, who was orphaned, and has vague memories of her parent's death. The first chapter is an introduction that explains why Fortuna ends up in the HP-verse, and in my opinion can be skipped entirely to allow you to focus on the HP part.

*** As someone writing in the HP/Witcher fandom, I really wish there were a few more fics in the archive. We're pretty starved of quantity compared to other traditional fantasy like the HP/ASOIAF or the HP/LOTR archive, which number in the hundreds versus 18 total, many of which are abandoned.

***** You're certainly right, a lot of the people I've come across who are interested in HP/Witcher crossovers have admitted to only playing the games, and many are only interested in HP/Witcher fics on the basis of being Harry/Ciri fics, which is a damned shame, but hopefully the Netflix series convinces a few people that the books are great and there's a lot of cool stuff that you can write in a crossover between the two universes.

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.

** I really enjoyed this full metal alchemist crossover wherein mustang makes a bargain with Truth to get his eyes back by righting the wrongs of horcruxes in the HP verse, set during 5th year. I think it does a really good job showing Mustang's character, and introducing him to the world of magic and nonsense (and secret organizations for overthrowing governments / vigilantes). Also does a good job at not making Dumbledore too overbearing. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6870892/chapters/15678928]])
