We all know "THE Ice Queen of Slytherin" Daphne Greengrass, whose family is strictly neutral (well, besides that one uncle we don't talk about) and we all know "Don't call me Nymphadora" Tonks, who will drop down on her knees as soon as the MC asks to see "her true self".

But after reading those characterisations for a few dozen times, I'm getting sick of them to the point where I give Daphne minor antagonistic roles whenever possible. Am I the only one who enjoys new spins on those characters more than the established traits?

And in a similar vein, what are some of your favourite stories which use the "name only"s in an unusual fashion?


** Get Neville a new wand after he doesn't immediately get a spell right because obviously you can tell he's using an old one. Now you've got your super loyal minion that is as powerful as Voldemort...

What I want to see is a Neville that isn't good at spellwork because he just doesn't care and wants to spend his time gardening.

*** I also see it as being more of a confidence issue early on tbh. It's not a given that using an old family wand is all that weird.

And it's always Neville in these fics, no one points out that /Ron/ is using Charlie's old wand when he starts school. And if it was Charlie's "old" wand and he now has one that matches him, it might not have originally been Charlie's.

**** No, not really.

Neville improved dramatically over the course of fifth year, thanks to the DA. This was in part inspired by his drive to take down Bellatrix and co., and part by his acceptance and joy in being part of the DA. He worked and practiced incredibly hard- he was often the second to get new spells, behind only Hermione.

Neville's wand was broken at the ministry and he got a new one for 6th year. That probably helped, but the big change was his time in the DA, and his increased confidence.

** It can be fun, but don't overdo it.

Examples of fun background stuff:

In one story, I had a recurring background gag of Daphne in my story parodying her usual fanon self by having her be downright creepily cold whatever happens (even if a werewolf is eating someone in front of her), and psychotically devoted to the "Greengrass neutrality" to the point that she refuses to voice any opinion about anything whatsoever, even "whether breakfast tastes good".

Also in my story, Goblins loathe excessive politeness (their idea of etiquette is to be as brutally efficient as possible so as not to waste anyone's valuable time), and the "may your fortunes and the blood of your enemies flow" phrases are an incredibly offensive stereotype spread by Rita Skeeter, about on the level of "talking-um like-um this-um" for Native Americans.

Also, not by me, there are two fics with two different takes on "Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore", which I both love. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12344176/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Manipulative-Old-Coot][Here's one]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11613187/1/What-Was-Your-Plan][here is the other]].

** Linkffn(The Casebook of Harry Potter) had a Daphne who was a Healer, I think? She tags along as Harry works cases like Sherlock Holmes, and she's written as the fairly normal and temperate half of their duo. It was incomplete when I read it, but still enjoyable.

There was another with her as an Unspeakable, and Harry tests something she created which somehow goes wrong. I don't recall the title of that one, sadly.

I'm fine with any trope/cliché done well, pretty much, even longstanding fanon.

** There's a fan consensus about Tonks on her knees? I guess I wouldn't know as I don't read much explicit stuff.

I'm writing her as I see her in canon, fun, but with a slightly creepy, clingy, insecure girlfriend vibe. This doesn't seem to be a popular portrayal, but if anyone wants to check it out, she's in two of my stories. In her sixth year at Hogwarts, she helps the Weasley twins with a prank in an attempt to impress their brother Charlie.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14846531/chapters/34366397]])

And when she first meets Remus, she's perplexed that her pursuit of him doesn't go as planned.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828709/chapters/34317807]])

I'm also having fun fleshing out really obscure characters that as far as I know don't have a fan consensus. Voldemort's muggle family, his father Tom and his grandparents Mary and Thomas, were just rape and murder victims in canon. I've given them strong personalities that explain why no one mourned them, and Mary in particular has a wild backstory I haven't revealed yet, as it's a work-in-progress.

And while I agree that "Can you look like X" won't fly on a first date, something like "Can you do that silver hair chopped on the left again" or similar wouldn't really matter a few months into the relationship.

Given that she was the only one who didn't shiver in Fear of Voldemort in OotP, I don't see her as insecure. She might have a bad track record, but even that doesn't have to be related to her abilities.

  Miyuki Kazuya enjoys his new boyfriend very much, but the recent rash of almost unsolvable high profile thefts is going to drive him crazy at work. As he pushes closer and closer to the truth, he starts to realize that the two are not entirely unrelated. However, when the chips are down, he'll find out who Sawamura Eijun really is.

** No you are not the only one who enjoys that. :) I make Daphne Greengrass whoever I want her to be - or NEED her to be for the story I want to tell. I've had her be a skinny white girl with super snarkiness from Ravenclaw, and I've written her as a shy, anxious overweight girl in Slytherin before. And I've even written Daphne Greengrass as being a transgender boy from Gryffindor who likes Herbology and plays Chess.

There is really no such thing as "fanon characters" anyway; no matter how popular any one characterization might get, they have zero validity at the end of the day over any OTHER writing of a character with nothing to her but a name. I really don't like seeing in reviews or comments all the time about this: "Daphne's an ice queen, why are you writing her like this?!" "This is OOC for Daphne!"

People really seem to forget that it's just a fanfic characterization with no basis in any reality, no more so than any characterization for her. Popularity does NOT lend any weight, because it's still just as made up as anything else.

** While the generic, 'fandom' approved versions of minor characters can serve a purpose, I do tend to prefer interpretations which go against the grain. Blank slate characters can fill any role you need and that makes alternate interpretations all the more enjoyable. Give me a Theodore Nott who is neither a snarky swot with a heart of gold nor a sadistic mini!Death Eater. Or a Hannah Abbot who isn't just nice.

One example is with Astoria, whose limited canon information slots her into a rather unfortunate dream girl/too good for this sinful earth type---tropes which get old pretty quick. Two examples that go in slightly different directions are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12225378/1/Enter-Astoria-With-Her-Hair-About-Her-Ears][Enter Astoria]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5401946/1/Antipathy][Antipathy]].

Also, you can subvert fanon characters to shock your audience (eg Daphne collaborating with Voldemort) without contradicting canon at all.
