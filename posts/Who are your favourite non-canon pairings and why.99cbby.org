** Probably Harry/Luna.

Why? She never seems to care that he is Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived. She was an unambiguously good person, no matter how whacky.

She wouldn't care about status or reputation, like Harry. Hermione and Ron, along with most of the Weasleys, are quite prideful people. Harry is proud, but it's really easily shattered when challenged. Luna is one of only a handful of similarly blasé characters in the series.

*** I think Luna is great but I really don't like Harry/Luna. Unless Harry or Luna's characters are very non-cannon they just don't seem to fit for me. They share few of the same interests and their temperaments are too different. On top of that Harry will never truly believe her crazy theories. Maybe I'm projecting but I feel the best he can do is humor her. Every time Luna references the Quibbler he can't really take it seriously which is fine in a friendship but would present the same level of difficulty in a relationship as two people of different religions. Which isn't impossible, but when Luna life goals resolve around her beliefs and trying to prove they are true then the problem is magnified.

To me Luna deserves to be with someone who is at least open minded enough to the idea that her theories might be true and curious enough to explore the possibility. Barring that, it should be someone without so many strong aspirations that they're happy to go along for the ride would also work (Like Colin Creevy, his interest in photography would work great with Luna's magi-zoology research and he's enough of a follower to just go with the flow) Harry however has strong aspirations of his own and is not suited to being a side kick.

Maybe my biggest problem is in a lot of Harry/Luna stories Luna is less faithful to her character and more of a relaxed [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl][Manic Pixie Dream Girl]]

Luna does offer Harry some things like understanding him enough not to boss him around, or make him do something he doesn't want to do, but on a day-to-day level they just don't work.

It's hard for me to see H/Hr happening within a relatively similar canon framework, but there is a good reason that post OotP a lot of people were thinking Luna appeared because she would be the ‘love interest.'

Outside of that: Dean/Luna-because I thought that's where it was heading in DH, Dudley/Cho Chang-I read one story and it's kind of hung in my head as being interesting, George/Katie-read a really good story with them as the main pairing.

Vaguely interested in: Harry/Luna-because of canon interactions, Ron/Luna-I got the impression Luna had a crush on Ron so this could be interesting, Hermione/Fred-I think if done right this could be quite good but I haven't read anything of this pairing, Hermione/Neville-same as Fred/Hermione.

** Harry/Hermione. In spite of their different personalities, there's a trust between them that's very noticeable and unique in canon. OoTP has some very clear examples of this. Ron, Ginny and no one else could break Harry out of his self imposed loneliness after his vision, but she shows up and he's opened up in the span of a few minutes after she talks to him. Similarly, even when I was first reading it back in the day, I always liked how Harry and Hermione are arguing about how they should go about responding to Harry's vision of Sirius being captured. Everyone else is described as just watching them go at it, no one else could even say anything because they were just operating at a different level and in the end Harry still, grudgingly, listened to her.

DH has some nice moments as well. Of course, not many stories pull this off well. Aside from it being hard to capture that sort of bond, most romance of every pairing sucks so there's a lot to get over to make this work believably.

Harry's not exactly (read:not ever) had any real consistent support in his life, much less friendship or love. In many ways that's exactly why it's not hard to read OoTP as validation of that.

  I always liked how Harry and Hermione are arguing about how they should go about responding to Harry's vision of Sirius being captured. Everyone else is described as just watching them go at it, no one else could even say anything because they were just operating at a different level and in the end Harry still, grudgingly, listened to her.

That's an interesting viewpoint. I never saw it how you do. Just out of curiosity, what specifically did you like about that scene? (I'm not being a smartass, I'm genuinely interested.)

**** Well, more or less what I said. It's an example of how well they understand each other. More than any other pair of people in the series, they get each other completely. Hermione understands Harry's potential weakness, how his mind is working and is able to convince him to think before immediately running to the Ministry. None of the others present, not even Ron, are shown to consider these things much less have the capacity to know how to get Harry to slow down a bit. And Harry, despite what he sees in the vision, in the end agrees to listen to her suggestion. It was a followup to their earlier interaction of his vision of Arthur getting hurt, where Harry immediately opens up to her at Number 12.

Basically, they're portrayed as being without secrets to each other and it's a very nice image of nothing else.

**** linkffn(Definitions of Romance) is probably my personal favorite in terms of capturing the essence of their relationship realistically.

linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid) is good on this too. The only issue is it starts out a little forced in how Hermione begins thinking about Harry romantically (and Harry, likewise, is a bit cheesy a couple of times).

There are probably others, but I'm not sure what you've read. Check the community thing I made on FFN for decent H/Hr (ignore my favorites list, it's a mess and needs to be flushed):

I had a random thought/writing inspiration in my head some years ago about Dudley/Pansy: Pansy leaves the Wizarding World after the war because she needs a break from everything and then falls in love with Dudley, only later to find out he's cousin of Boy-Who-Lived.

**** Coming from an only child perspective, I think Harry would still have a sense of only-ness that makes sense to an only child. Even with as loved as he was by the Weasley family, there would still be a sense of separation from them that's just true on a very deep level.

I am extremely close to my best friend and have always loved her parents. I joke that her mom is my other mother and consider her the closest thing I have to a sister. However there's still a sense of separation there. Like all families, she has inside jokes, loads of family history, and stories that are all part of her family and not something I was privy to. She and her siblings have their distinct and unique relationships that were always fascinating to me coming from my only child background. And even well over 15 years after we met and developed our close friendship, there's still that deep sense of being not-family that keeps me from being able to relate on a sibling level. Plus as an only child, I really do struggle to understand sibling relationships. Sounds funny, but it's true.

I imagine Harry, with his screwed up upbringing and orphan status, would find a true sibling relationship very hard to actually relate to. He may put into words that Hermione is “like a sister” to him, but ultimately he doesn't really understand it and simply means that she's the closest female friend he has. That's how I always described my closest male friend (though I also had a crush on him), so I could see the “like a sister” sentiment changing to reflect more romantic feelings.

And I would also argue that he's more likely to see Ginny in that sister sense because she was the tagalong from childhood. But that's just my thought.

***** But I think that it is different with regard to Harry, because he has grown up in different circumstances. I just don't think it is possible to compare it. He is "raised" in a negative surrounding, such as with regard to Dudley and therefore consciously or subconsciously he is looking for something else. Would he do this if he was an only child in a stable environment? He quite often compares the Dursley family and the Weasley family, especially in /CoS/ (who he pretty much holds up as ideal). He feels like this is something that has been missing his whole life, and he thus feels that this is how he relates to Hermione. This may not be the case with other only children, but neither is it seriously unrealistic.

One should also consider the context of what Harry said: that being trying to completely dispel with Ron's concerns about them being romantically involved. He could have just as easily said "she's simply my best female friend" or something along those lines, but that would have left more wiggle room. So he did not simply mean that Hermione was just simply his best female friend.

Also, I think that this is beyond who Harry ended up with. If he had ended up with Hermione and felt that Ginny (or Luna or anyone else) was like his sister, I think the same would apply.

***** I suppose fanon Daphne is one candidate.

I always felt like the really interesting part of Daphne is that she is programmed social conflict waiting to happen. I greatly dislike any Harry / Daphne fic that just waves away this problem, or "solves" it by half-chapter stomps. The only real spice she brings into this is the fact that she is a Slytherin in a relationship with a Gryffindor.

If her only purpose is to balance out Harry, you may as well just not write her and let Harry find the "Necklace of Wisdom", or whatever, in the Room of Requirements, because thats essentially what she becomes in so many fics. Some grant her a modicum of personality (because, suprise suprise, character development is hard) and make her Executive Harry Manager, but definitely not a romantic interest.

A third gripe I have with just... */so many/* Harry /Daphne is when authors wave away the cultural differences between the two. She is a pureblood, Slytherin and according to fanon, from a prominent family. But then of course, we can't have her be sympathetic to wizard Hitler and his Snake-Youth, so we make her "Grey" (which is part of probably the dumbest naming scheme for political parties ever) and "just playing along with them". This often completely ignores that even "Light" families like the Weasleys have, at best, a hobbyist interest in muggles and at worst charm their driving instructor to pass a test without batting an eye.

And this went off the rails... sorry. I kinda fell into a rant about the state of this ship.

** Harry or Hermione paired with Tonks. For Harry, I'd see it go down more of a hurt/comfort kind of path where she helps him deal with the shit life had thrown at him over the years. It would certainly be an unbalanced relationship given the differences in age and experience, but that makes it far from impossible. I dislike how most authors ignore that kind of imbalance in favour of turning Harry into an emotionless beast of a man who tears through any and all opposition because the love interest can't be stronger/abler than the protagonist.

With Hermione, it would be a completely different story, more akin to "good girl gone bad" where Tonks would be the bad influence on Hermione, who would probably enjoy her "corruption", like in the "breaking the rules is exiting" in OotP (we are talking alcohol, weed and sneaking out at night here, not murder and genocide). You can write Tonks as badass without adding all the baggage usually found in pairings with BAMFs like Narcissa Malfoy or Bellatrix Lestrange.

** Tom Riddle Jr./Hermione Granger

I actually just wrote down some of my thoughts on why I love the Tomione ship.

Mind you talking Tom, not Voldemort, who although being the same are also NOT, due to age and experiences.

ALSO remember this is FICTION. I realize he's emotionally troubled and has issues. Doesn't mean it doesn't like thrill me to read shit like this. Battles of wits, wills and power in a relationship of equals is something I personally really enjoy.

They both are seekers of knowledge, who are naturally talented, with stubborn streaks. Hermione would challenge Tom, and vice versa. If you can get behind the possibility, usually through time-travel, that these two could meet. I believe Tom is someone who would appreciate, and probably covet, her intellect and talent.

With Tom, there is such a range of possibilities that fanfiction gloriously explores. Sure he would have his anti-muggleborn agenda, but most stories play with the idea of her shattering his preconceived notions. Hermione would challenge him and disprove him at every turn being a muggleborn with more power than most.

I believe she would also find him intellectually challenging and stimulating, and he would push her to be and do more. A least that's what I would imagine, a relationship with someone who seeks greatness seems like something that would only open up her own potential not hold her back. And that's why I like the idea of this ship, because it opens up the possibility for these two to do more, be more, and achieve greater than what was written for them.

anyways just some excerpts from my thoughts anyone curious could read the whole thing here: [[https://jd-sparks.tumblr.com/post/177222935536/why-i-like-tomione]]

** Harry/Snape. I know slash gets a bit of hate here but I like this pairing for the same reasons I like a lot of other pairings: both the characters have a lot in common, I like seeing a fic where the author turns the hate/dislike into grudging respect, then affection by playing on those similarities. I think it makes the best slow burn.

Harry/Voldemort for the same reasons, though it's a bit more of a mindfuck than Snarry and it's hard to find one that is done realistically, imo.

** Late to the party, but here goes:

I immensely enjoy a well written Harry / Hermione pairing. Even more so because most H/Hr is absolutely awful. They are the most complex / fleshed out characters in the series. Both of them have agency, wishes, desires, and most of all, a plethora of flaws. In most fics out there, one of them is reduced to a state of "love-interest" cardboard-cutout. Reduced Harry often becomes the executioner of whatever Hermione tells him to do, while Reduced Hermione becomes a walking library.

Why I enjoy the both of them together has 2 reasons.

First, I wanted them together when I first read canon. I identified with Harry and Hermione embedded herself in my adolescent mind as a wishful dream of a girlfriend to have. Its the easiest reason.

Second, I think their relationship is what I now, in my adult years, want from my own relationships. They are totally in sync. They know how, when and why to deal with each other to a point where they themselves have problems really putting a frame on it. For this reason I often enjoy a good fic in which Harry and Hermione come together a few years past Hogwarts, when fleeting teenage romances have made way for a more mature and complex wishlist when it comes to romance. Their arguments and fights never have idiotic reasons or are ways to blow off steam. They fight because they are passionate about an opinion and /want the other to understand/. Lastly, even after a fight, they are not above compromise. In any case, the more I've become an adult, the more the relationship between Harry and Hermione seemed like the one that would be able to withstand decades (for magical folk maybe even centuries). I can't say much about Harry and Ginny because, well, she is a barely fleshed out character that has shown a bit of romantic interest (not counting fangirling) and genuine concern for the other. I always thought Ron would be a drag on the relationship between him and Hermione that would require her /and him/ to have sometimes extreme patience for the other. From the few indicators I saw, its simply not a relationship built to last when I compare it with similar ones IRL.

*** I dunno about Harry and Hermione ever being more than a brother-sister type relationship. They've obviously been through so much together and were really close throughout their childhood because of those experiences, but sometimes I got the feeling that if it wasn't for Voldemort, they wouldn't even like hanging out with each other. I don't think they handled disagreements well at all; they are both way too stubborn and I actually think Hermione did not truly understand him when Harry got in one of his moods or was depressed or sad about something.

You mention they fight because they want the other to understand. But look at one of the big scenes where they are sort of at odds. After Harry curses Draco with sectumsempra, he is clearly distraught. When he, Hermione, Ron and Ginny are together, Hermione uses that opportunity to basically say "I told you so" and just make Harry feel even worse about himself, all in an effort to get him to just admit the potions book is no good. Now, Hermione may be right, but in that moment it's the last thing Harry needs. Ginny, conversely, seems to understand this and defends Harry. I think Ginny better understands Harry and knows when to push him and when to support him.

Ultimately, Hermione really does have that big sister role to Harry. There is genuine love between the two and complete trust. Harry knows Hermione will always be there for him and will be a great source of advice, but she will also have no qualms admonishing him. They might not actually get along in the sense of being able to live together day in and day out and have fun together. This dynamic accurately describes a lot of sibling relationships, IMO.
