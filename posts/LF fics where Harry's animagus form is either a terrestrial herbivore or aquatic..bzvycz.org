In most fics where Harry is an animagus, he's some kind of aggressive animal, like a snake or jaguar or badger or eagle, some fics even give him crazy good magical forms like a dementor, dragon, or ghost. I always felt that none of that really matched his canon personality, as to me he never seemed that aggressive, outside of OoTP, and to give him some kind of magical creature as his form is just a bit OP. So I'd like to see a fic where he's some kind of non-flying prey animal, like a hare or a sheep. I also don't see any fics with an aquatic form for Harry, so it'd be cool to see that too.

Thanks in advance!

PS: I've already read linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) so no need to rec that. :)


** I'm interested to see if this has been done too. Honestly, so many fics seem to tack on Harry's animagus form as just another cool power he suddenly has without giving it a second's thought, and it always bugs me. Nine times out of ten it doesn't even end up being relevant to the plot, so why include it unless you actually have a good idea for his form?

I remember seeing a fic ages ago (no idea what it was, sorry) where Harry's form was a mongoose and I actually thought that was a bit clever. I'd appreciate more stuff like that, or, like your request says, an actual non-predator, and less fucking panthers and dragons.

*** I really dislike the idea that it needs to be plot relevant. That's a major gripe I have with the original books in general, though.

You have access to magic! You can potentially learn how to transform into an animal at will! You can transfigure one thing into a completely different thing! How are these kids not trying to learn every bit of awesome magic that they can for no other reason than it's freakin magic?

**** The more things you include in your story that aren't plot relevant the bigger the scope gets and the more you're in danger of either burning out from having to fill in so many details or losing your audience because you can't get to the ending in a timely fashion, which is a bad thing when you have a publishing deal. Less bad in fanfic, when it just results in an abandoned story or one that loses popularity.

It would be cool to see more fics that take on the learning of magic as a plot, though. I would absolutely read fics where the MC is focused on learning as many techniques as possible, and in a fic like that becoming an animagus would absolutely be plot relevant. It's just about deciding what kind of story you want to tell and how the elements you want to include fit into it.

The problem with the fics I was complaining about is that the animagus stuff feels like wasted potential. It's just used as a way to tell the audience that Harry is powerful without ever showing him doing anything cool with it. If that's the case, why include it instead of some other powerful technique that actually has relevance to the plot (which is usually defeating Voldemort just like in canon)? Basically, I'd rather not see it than see it wasted in a boring, uncreative way.

***** I guess you're right. I also cheated by starting my fic with Harry being 31. I get to ignore the training montages that so many fics go through.

But honestly that's more because a lot of fanfics start way before the actual plot comes up, just so they can do the training montage. Just start a year or two later and tell us Harry is an animagus (or whatever it is.)

If you're going for canon compliance, though, the animagus transformation has nothing to do with power and everything to do with tenacity, which I think Harry has in spades.

****** I agree with all of this pretty much 100%. And yeah, aging Harry up into adulthood definitely changes what you'd expect his skillset to include.

The animagus transformation being a power move is such a widespread fanon thing, at least it is in the fics I've read. Tenacity fits much better. I think an adult Harry would have no problems with it, and a younger Harry could also pull it off well with the proper motivation.

*** I don't mind if being an animagus isn't super plot relevant (granted it's preferred) because let's be honest, its only as useful as the form. I find that many authors have a tendency to use OP forms for an already OP (or really powerful) Harry so he tends to use his form like he would any other cool spell, frequently, but not in a way that's going to stand out from anything else that he's doing.

I think that's why I'm just looking for a marginally or conditionally useful form. Sure, being a sheep will protect against the effects of dementors, but it won't help you in combat. Okay that shark you turn into is great in the water, but using it is quite limiting since you're almost exclusively fighting on land. When somebody actually uses these forms it'll be more memorable because it's finally that one useful time for it.

**** Yeah, it doesn't have to be a main element or anything, since even a highly useful form isn't going to be useful all the time. But if it doesn't get one or two cool moments I don't think it's worth including, and a lot of authors do anyway, sometimes without even showing Harry transforming at all. Though I can also accept fics where the form isn't important but where Harry learns something over the course of his training. Like how to study properly or improve his mental state. Stuff like that can make for good character growth. But too often it's just checking off a box on a list of OP skills, and of course the form has to be an OP predator.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** linkffn(Teeth by Hathanhate) has a Harry with an aquatic form, a mythological creature called a Mishipeshu, which basically amounts to a giant panther with scales and gills. It does the standard "Kill the Dork Lord" spiel then goes off into a pretty decent Avengers crossover, if I remember right.

Overall the writing's pretty good. Cheers
