** I'd just like to comment about the Putunia bit. There are more than a few family members I would never leave a child around especially ones who have shown active disdain towards me. Family does not always equal someone you would trust please remember that when you are judging these sorts of fics

** I highly doubt ‘not Petunia' would be in a legal document. When it comes to naming a guardian, only one person is named (or two if they're a couple). I think it could have been Alice and Frank Longbottom, especially as they had a child Harry's age.

But more likely is that they didn't write a will. They were young and didn't expect to die. By the time the threat of death came they were immediately put under the Fidelius and I think the books mentioned that they were cooped up there, couldn't leave. I doubt they had the availability to find a lawyer and write a will, they probably just came to informal arrangements with friends and they trusted them.

A court would have given Harry to Petunia anyway as the closest relative but only if she agreed. If not, he'd be sent to foster care.

I've just realised that this isn't a discussion post lol. Ngl I've seen no good ‘Potter will' stories as they all without fail end up being tropey. But I'll tell you about the funniest one I've ever read: a will in which James reveals that Lily is love potioning him, Harry is actually the child of Regulus Black and James, and Snape is his older brother (somehow?!). God that was hilarious.
