I thought it'd be fun to list all the worst clichés I have come across, the clichés that make me face palm and close the story... If you have one that I missed, do comment! :D

They are in no particular order, but i did try to have what I consider to be the worst of them near the top.

1.  Horridly abused Harry. Somehow, I feel like the one who was abused by reading it. Shame.

2.  Goblins. Apparently, all this time Goblins were horribly misunderstood softies who just want their name remembered ;( do that and you are now "honorable Harry" or some BS.

3.  Custom ultra overclocked quad-core wand! Made with the rarest of wood and the most mythical of cores. Previous "legendary" status optional.

4.  Hey look! I drank a potion and am a falcon animagus! Scratch that, I'm actually a dragon animagus. Wait, no, a basilisk animagus is so much cooler!

5.  Evil Dumbledore. Somehow, in the stories where Dumbledore is supposed to be this evil mastermind, he is the dumbest (hah) person on the planet, with plans liable to be figured out by an 11-year old. "Harry, m'boy, it's just the cruciatus! Surely you can put this behind you?" Twinkle twinkle.

6.  Super magic-core Harry! 'nuff said.

7.  Harry was framed and sent to Azkaban! Without a doubt the laziest plot line ever. All his friends now hate him, and Evil Dumblydore^{^{TM}} didn't help! Gasp! Befriending Bellatrix optional. Misunderstood Bellatrix optional.

8.  Scheming Weasleys. Ron is friends only for the money and fame by association, Ginny is convinced she is destined to marry Harry, and Mrs. Weasley will do anything to make it happen.

9.  Harry/Hermione & Harry/Ginny. These aren't clichés as much as pairings, but i consider them to be just as bad because they are just as predictable, popular, and formulaic as the rest of them. Most of them read like they were written by awkward teens with 0 experience. Perhaps I am in the minority on this, but I can only read so much about goody-two-shoes Hermione and shy, awkward Harry holding hands before I bash my head against a wall.

10. Romantic pairings early on.... Do people forget that these are 11 year-olds? The fuck? Again, I might be in the minority on this one, but i find it disgusting how so many fics want to shoehorn a romantic pairing in on these preteen Hogwarts kids. Not to mention the disturbing pairings like Snape/Harry. Some people have issues. Everyone has different tastes, but pedophilia is NOT okay.

Those are the worst I can think of. Of course, many problems ans plot-holes are present in canon as well, which is understandable seeing as how it started out as a children's book.


** As far as number 10 goes, I remember having "boyfriends" when I was in the 11-12 year old range. They were the most adorably pitiful relationships ever, and all we ever did was share candy and maybe hold hands if we were feeling particularly bold, but there you have it. Obviously our love was deep and meaningful. I'm expecting a Hollywood movie adaption any time now.

A year or two later and you were starting to see some of the more traditionally "teenager" romances.

A movie that pretty accurately portrays "romance" at this age is My Girl. Just without ending in tragedy, I would hope. I'm sure there are others I could think of if I put my mind to it.

But as a (presumably) adult, is this really what you want to read? Is this what you want the story to focus on? And how in the world is this relevant to anything in the plot? As a 20-something adult with 0 sexual interest in kids, I find it a chore to read through.

Especially considering that most authors who write in these relationships don't restrict their characters to holding hands and sharing candy. At that point I just drop it.

**** Not sure what little boys you're familiar with, but the little buggers I went to school with were already pretty lewd as early as 5th or 6th grade. XD They had definitely started to notice girls by that age.

As far as "is this something I want to read" I guess that depends on the whole point of the story? Like I said, "romances" of this type have been depicted in movies and age appropriate books for decades. My Girl is the example that jumps to my mind, but I know there were tons of others. I know I'd rather read a story about a cutesy puppy love romance than have to endure 11 and 12-year-olds who behave too young, which is another thing I see all too often in fanfiction.

As far as the kids having more "adult" romances, I agree with you. I don't find anything at all appealing about that. But there's a reason schools start teaching sex ed to kids around the 10-year mark. That's the vague start of when boys and girls start to notice each other.

A lot of countries have laws to make teens having sex with each other legal (mostly so that one 13 year old doesn't commit a crime by having sex with another, consenting 13 year old), but most also have age limits in place to prevent exploitation of children.

However, while it's normal for some kids to have sex while they're in their early teens, it's also normal for people not to have sex until their early twenties or later.

Depends on where you are. In the Philippines for instance 12 is the age of consent. In some areas it is even lower (Afghanistan for instance). The idea that you can't consent until 16 or 18 is very much a cultural construct, not a fact. We have no information that I'm aware of how magical society in england sets such rules.

** Slavish canon rehash: I already had a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kyfr0/did_you_change_your_preferences_or_pet_peeves/dbrqa2r/][rant]] about this a week ago, so I won't bore you with the same arguments again. Unfortunately, this cliche happens way too often.

--------------

My most hated cliche is however a Postwar Hermione submitting to a marriage law. Fortunately marriage law fics are becoming rarer these days.

It's the worst form of tyranny, something even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't dare to implement. It's most likely something cooked up by immature teenagers who have no clue about what kind of human rights violation a marriage law is.

When it comes to fics dealing with it, I like the following 5 levels of responses:

1. The protagonists were too weak to fight, so they ran away as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]]

2. The protagonists organized a mass exodus, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]]

3. The protagonists asked a third party to eliminate certain individuals responsible for the marriage law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]]

4. The protagonists took out those responsible individuals by themselves, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]]

5. The protagonists staged a revolution, took over the government, and executed anyone who supported the marriage law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]

*** While I agree that a hypothetical "marriage law" is a violation of personal liberty, comparing it to Communist China and Russia is ridiculous. Saying that "even Mao" didn't institute it is silly, because the situation in these two countries was infinitely worse. Marry someone who is not in the party? Your life is over. Marry someone your parents do not approve of? Your life is over... If you manage to actually do it. I have had family in communist Russia, and I have read several first person narratives of Mao's China. Bringing up despotic regimes in relation to a fictional marraige law is not only irrelevant and unneeded, but it trivializes what those people had to go through.

As for writing a fic featuring a marraige law, there's nothing wrong with that. It's fiction. You are willing to accept that the Harry Potter magical world is some 300 years behind technologically, yet you can't stand for it holding true societally as well? Come off it.

Is it really? The magical world have been (mostly) separated from the non-magical one for 300 years, that's a fact; but stating it is "300 years behind", on any level, is wrong in canon : the bets examples are brooms, we see them through a "technological" evolution in the books (Nimbus 2000 then 2001 then firebolt, in only 3 years).\\
Even if the Status of Secrecy was brutal (which is an assumption, and not a strong one at that: such decisions are frequently the end of a long process), the magical world have been diverging from the non-magical one for 3 centuries, it has not stopped brutally in 1692.\\
Now, regarding contracting in marriage : yes, it has been done historically; in the richest parts of society mainly. But, except for the highest nobility or the merchant class of the late middle ages, choice have frequently (and in a more or less visible way), been given. Choice between spouses deemed acceptable. This exists even today, in most if not all countries in the world, where a person (male or female) is expected to find a spouse in the contacts met in school or in social events, where everyone answer to a set of criterium that makes the persons met acceptable for the family.\\
In no society, by my knowledge, had it been acceptable for the state to choose a spouse for an individual; when forced, it has always been a choice of the familes involved. The last case I know of, when someone was married against his/her wishes, and those of his/her family, was Anne of Britanny (in the end of the 15th century), and said marriage was forced through a war, had deep political consequences, and a good image still had to be given (the bride went, free, and with her army, to her marriage).\\
Hogwarts, as the best school for magical, and further than that with the separation into houses through similarities, is probably already the best "meet your future spouse" that a society can accept.

*** B) Canon Harry was indeed a potential chick-magnet, it's just that he wasn't interested in being one himself. There were a significant number of attractive girls willing to sleep with him if he opened up just a little, such as Cho, Ginny, Parvati, Romilda, and potentially Luna. He could turn the DA into a cult if he really wanted to, as its members were already extremely loyal. And I believe Hermione loved him too. H/Hr didn't work in canon not because of Hermione, but because of Harry.

**** Of the two big/currently updating WBWL stories from last year, neither really has abusive parents. The first has time travel, but he's put with the Dursley's and his parents are told not to communicate with him because of MostlyGood!Manipulative!Dumbledore. In the second, there's a hidden reason that's revealed at the end of Book 1 explaining why it makes sense that he was put with the Dursleys, but Lily and Dumbledore are both actually good.

DP+SW is pretty dumb because of the whole harem thing, but at least it's readable because Harry actually faces roadblocks and the story is well-proofread. It gets confusing because of all the fanon politics, AU, and time travel. The end of Year 1 (Book 2) was solid, even if the path to it had pitfalls. Probably one of the better Manipulative!Dumbledore stories, since Dumbledore is a little OOC but not evil.

HP Prince of Slytherin has James being a dick, but he has a pretty well-painted motivation that Harry still isn't aware of, and Dumbledore isn't evil for once- it's long and is currently in the summer before 3rd year, and while it has some pitfalls due to the large cast of characters and slow start, I do think it has an interesting plot and good execution. Some AU elements obviously, but well done and made interesting- Year 2 was especially good, and the 1st chapter sets the scene by being a flashforward to the end of Goblet of Fire. It does suffer from the 11-year old problem, but I think I've gotten used to ignoring that, and it's addressed in-universe and handwaved. The end of year 2 revelations and some of the pre-year 3 summer stuff is really good.

I don't remember the title, but the first WBWL story that I read (4 years ago?) wasn't that bad, I think Harry went to Azkaban for a year but it still ended up being Harry/Ginny.

And even if he was starved at the Dursley's, from age 11 onward he only spent two months there out of the year, if that. That would have given him plenty of time and several growth spurts to catch up as he positively inhaled anything that wasn't nailed down at Hogwarts and the Weasley home.

You're right, we have no way to know for sure... but if I'd have to bet on it I'd put all my money on the bet that this wasn't the first occurrence. These are people who had a child living in a freaking cupboard for 10 years and the idea that they might not have been feeding him right is were some readers draw the line? Really?

***** I always assumed that it was more like "gets the smallest portion" type of underfed. Since child abuse is a pretty serious issue, that's one thing I really do prefer not be overdramatized. I can buy a Harry that's a bit skinny for his age at 11, but all the talk about how he's malnourished and half-starved are taking it a bit too far. The school lunch thing....eh, I guess that can just be considered personal interpretation since it wasn't even mentioned in the books?

I take it as the Dursleys being mean and spiteful, but in this one example not abusive. Dudley got to eat as much as he'd like, and Harry got /just/ enough. The only way that the Dursleys were truly, technically abusive is in the way that they spoke to Harry, at least by the standards of United State's CPS. I'm not sure if Britain's got different criteria.

****** Yeah, the school lunch thing was just me thinking about the only way he'd probably end up skipping two meals in a row - Vernon did make him skip meals as punishment for accidental magic, but I imagine that was a case of 'go-to-cupboard-without-dinner'.

I don't particularly care about technical abuse, I think the thing with the Dursleys was that it highlighted how abusive a parent can be without technically being abusive. I know a lot of people with Dursleys as parents really related to Harry a lot because of how he was raised. It verifies that no, parents like that aren't normal. Perhaps some people arent comfortable with monsters looking like normal parents, so they amp up the monsterness until they look like it.

I think if a social worker saw the cupboard, Harry wouldn't get taken off them, but only because heck, there aren't enough foster homes out there. I imagine they'd end up on a list, with them getting regular check ups, and Harry would get moved into a bedroom. But of course, with the second bedroom, they'd no doubt convince them that the cupboard was time out only, Harry had a perfectly good room upstairs filled with toys.

But the way they spoke to him, the way they treated him - that damages a child's psyche a lot. Who gives a child an old sock for their birthday? Harry was happy on Dudley's birthday, because he got to eat the unwanted dessert because it wasn't good enough. And a lemon pop because they didnt want to look bad in front of the vendor. As far as I'm concerned, the Dursleys were horrible monsters who should never have raised a child. It's due to magic neither of the boys they raised were completely ruined.

******* I was raised by a mother who reminds me very strongly of the Dursleys (won't go into my sob story, but I'm one of the people who related to Harry because of this.) The thing is if it's the way you're raised and all that you know it /is/ normal. It wasn't until I was an adult and saw how other people interacted with their parents that I realized that something was wrong. So the stories where Harry goes off to angst and lists off all of his abuses seems off to me. Abused kids often don't realize they're abused, or if they do, they don't realize the full extent of how abused they are, because all of that is "normal" for them. And it pisses me off when fanfic authors get all melodramatic and say that Harry was treated like a house elf, because it is not a crime to give a kid some chores. It just makes you an asshole if you give one kid chores and not the other.

I agree with you that most of the abuse was mental. Harry knew pretty much from the start that he was unwanted, and you can't believe how much that can affect a kid. They were also so very wrong to encourage and overlook Dudley's bullying. As far as the old sock for the birthday, try no birthday presents at all. Or even recognition that it is your birthday in the first place. :P I was 23 when I got my first birthday cake after I told my boyfriend that I'd never had one before, so he went and bought me one. Years later, it's an iron-clad rule in the house that no matter what, /everyone/ gets cake for their birthday.

I've said before that Dursley abuse is a tender subject for me, and that's mostly because fanfic authors (and even JKR, to an extent) like to use them as a cheap source of angst and drama without actually putting thought into what it's actually like for kids raised by adults like that.

Even then there are still small instances of physical stuff. The Dursleys never tell Dudley discourage Dudley from being physically aggressive towards Harry and in the mail instance Vernon encourages Dudley to at least poke Harry with Dudley's Smelting Stick.

There is also the time Petunia swiped a frying pan at Harry. A frying pan isn't exactly the first instrument you'd think to hit someone with, and it wasn't a light tap cause it was at hand. Chamber of Secrets specifically points out that it's a heavy blow aimed at his head. I think it would be safe to say there's probably mild physical stuff occurring "off-screen". Certainly no midnight beatings with a sock full of battery style stuff, but maybe a whack to the back of the head as Harry walks past for no reason other than amusement.

That said, how cavalier it was treated was definitely a mistake and a huge one, especially when Snape was the one taking it and we later learn that he had to have known about the possible consequences.

  Horridly abused Harry. Somehow, I feel like the one who was abused by reading it. Shame.
#+end_quote

Depends on what you define as horrid. There's plenty of over the top Dursley portrayals in Fanfiction, but I think people also got desensitized about the abuse Harry suffers at the Dursleys: It is pretty horrid and it's fair to expand on the glimpses we see in the Books.

I blame Rowling and the stupid Elder Wand bullshit. I still can't fathom that this was her honest to god best idea to wrap up the final fight. I'm not surprised that fanfic authors pick up on that idea and try to resolve their conflict with +technobabble+ technicalities.

#+end_quote

Totally annoying, especially because this happens in fics where Harry just "collects" these kinds of things and never uses them. You could probably get away with a Fic about a special magical Animagus form, but then you'd better make it the central point of your story.

  Evil Dumbledore. Somehow, in the stories where Dumbledore is supposed to be this evil mastermind, he is the dumbest (hah) person on the planet, with plans liable to be figured out by an 11-year old. "Harry, m'boy, it's just the cruciatus! Surely you can put this behind you?" Twinkle twinkle.
#+end_quote

Meh. IMHO Dumbledore is either evil or dumb.. I haven't yet heard a convincing argument why he didn't intervene at the Dursleys that didn't make him either an idiot or evil.

  Harry was framed and sent to Azkaban! Without a doubt the laziest plot line ever. All his friends now hate him, and Evil DumblydoreTM didn't help! Gasp! Befriending Bellatrix optional. Misunderstood Bellatrix optional.
#+end_quote

IMHO there's actually potential in the "Harry in Azkaban" idea, especially considering Fudge's and Umbridge's animosity. Most writers are just too lazy to do it with authenticity and just want a shortcut to their Dark!Harry who doesn't take no shit from no-one *swoon*.

#+begin_quote
  Romantic pairings early on.... Do people forget that these are 11 year-olds? The fuck? Again, I might be in the minority on this one, but i find it disgusting how so many fics want to shoehorn a romantic pairing in on these preteen Hogwarts kids. Not to mention the disturbing pairings like Snape/Harry. Some people have issues. Everyone has different tastes, but pedophilia is NOT okay.
#+end_quote

Meh, there's a fine line here. Yeah, first year "true-love" romances are dumb, but Rowling's characters seem almost asexual until 5th year, which is equally as stupid. Most girls will certainly start puberty at age ~12-13 and be more interested in boys (which is second year at Hogwarts). Boys probably a good year later.
