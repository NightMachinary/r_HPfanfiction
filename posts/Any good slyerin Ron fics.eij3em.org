Ron always feels like he is just there as exposition or as a needed friend (when not being a twat), I want to see a driven and ambitious Ron who can be manipulative and cunning. A Ron that could actually achieve his desire from the mirror.

Edit: I can spell, but typing fast is the bane of those with clumsy fingers. Slytherin.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
