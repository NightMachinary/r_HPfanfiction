:END:
There's a fanfic that I can't find and really want to reread. The only thing that I remember is that it is a Drarry fic and in it Draco refuses to be a Death Eater, tells Voldemort "Fuck you" to his face then goes to Grimmauld Place. Can someone please tell me the title? I believe it's on AO3
