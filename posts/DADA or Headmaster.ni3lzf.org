I'm looking for something where Harry becomes either DADA prof or Headmaster. Preferably with a pairing. I do love time travel fics where he teaches the Marauders, but a modern one would be great too. Preferred pairings are with Daphne, Hermione, Bellatrix (so long as some kind of tom foolery made them closer in age), Tonks, or Luna. Any recs would be welcome!


** This is gen, but it's a really well rounded fic of Harry time traveling and him becoming the DADA teacher and caring a lot for his students, while also being a bamf at the same time. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1852420][Princeps]]

** Wind Shear filts this recommendation. Harry accidentally time travels to pre-Marauders age. He becomes the DADA professor and it is a Harry / Bellatrix fanfic, although they don't actually get together until the end.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
