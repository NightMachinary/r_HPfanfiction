I can't find any that haven't been taken down :( if you know any please help. If not just any fanfics you like and think I should read


** Linkffn(Through Emerald Eyes: A Hogwarts Reads) is really good, it changes the book text hopefully enough to avoid take down, and gives you story outside the reading to keep you entertained.

Fair warning though, it is slightly AU to help keep the Fanfic overlords from deleting it.

  Victory came at a cost too steep for a nebulous future to pay. Hence 'the reset button' - seven books, sent back to 1995, read in front of all of Hogwarts and pivotal guests to prevent the coming calamities. The subject, a fifteen year old Harry Potter, may not have minded the loss of privacy if only it wasn't also read in front of every girl he'd ever crushed on! Multi/Harem. AU.

** Trading Places by Inigma is similar and REALLY good

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
