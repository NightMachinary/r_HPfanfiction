** I do recall one story where Molly grabbed a reluctant Harry in an attempt to drag him through the barrier, and he screamed blue that some lady was grabbing him. It went poorly for the Weasleys, needless to say, as several of the kids fought back when muggles tried to take their mum in.

Harry, of course, had time travelled and was ready to make a scene, but still.

***** I think I'd sacrifice a first born for them to write a story together. No outline, no end planned. Just writing alternating chapters each with their individual styles and seeing what kind of shenanigans can be had.

*** this isn't a discussion (if you can't read the tag, it says request) it is a request for fanfic. Nothing in the title says canon.

** I don't see how this would work though, unless you try because Molly mentioned Muggles and stuff, otherwise it wouldn't work; because all Witches and Wizards use the Muggle platform to get to 9 and 3 quarters.
