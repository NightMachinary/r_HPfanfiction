** Weaknesses, probably the standard ones, like wood in the heart, decapitation, though I've seen a vampire harry or two that didn't have the weakness to sunlight or garlic. Though almost no one uses garlic in urban fantasy these days, it's that whole Our Monsters Are Different Trope, and we don't see or hear all too much about vamps in canon, though the first book may imply they're weak against garlic, but that may also just be a lie and an excuse that qurriel uses to have garlic around to cover up the stench of death and decay coming from having Voldemort attached to the back of his head.

One thing, please, please, don't let it be slash. There's almost no straight harry's that become vampires.

That right there is one weakness of Harry Potter type Vampires, cock, since damned near all the vampire men are gay apparently.
