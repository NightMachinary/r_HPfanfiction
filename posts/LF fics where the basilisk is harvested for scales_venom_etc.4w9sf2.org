It just seems like such a waste when there is an entire magical animal just rotting away, when Harry could harvest it for potions ingredients, or even just make some nice leather boots. The fangs and venom could be very useful for destroying horcruxes. Maybe he can use it to make friends with Snape, letting him share in the bounty. Butchering a basilisk together is a lovely teambuilding activity. Who knows what potentially lies in that chamber!
