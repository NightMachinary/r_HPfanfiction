This is part request and part prompt.

So, I was driving, and I got an idea of Sirius getting caught by animal control while Padfoot. Does anyone know any fics that have him escaping or James/Lily/Remus rescuing him and the ensuing hilarity? If you want to write it please do, just please leave a link so I can read it!
