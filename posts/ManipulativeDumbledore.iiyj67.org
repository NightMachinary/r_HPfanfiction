Manipulative!Dumbledore to the point of absurdity.


** Saga of the Lightning Speaker has it pretty bad.

** This is the last one I read with Dumbledore trying to manipulate Harry more and more, to the point where I actually started to think he's the dumbest greatest wizard of all time.

Edit: The story is basically about Harry bring raised by the goblins and becoming a little strategy genius because of it. I'd say he's also somewhat overpowered and it's a Harry/Hermione shipping, so there's a lot going on.

** I read this probably more than a decade ago and really dug it back then but now I'm cringing just thinking of it. Massive Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. Dumbledore cast spells on things in Privet Drive to make the Dursleys hate Harry and gave Ron and Ginny love spell-infused objects to give to Hermione and Harry. His lemon drops were also laced with mind-reading potion or Veritaserum. He felt more like the villain of the story than Voldemort.

So the fic is alright, with Dumbledore trying to bring Voldemort back to the light. Harry however is an autistic little shit with anger issues who can't deal with stuff without yelling like a 3 year old and acts so stupid sometimes. The author put in abuse but it feels so forced and doesn't really add much to the story. There is honestly too much bashing and it feels like colt01 has a vendetta against them. Here's a list of every character bashed: 3 Dursleys Dumbledore Snape Umbridge Ron Molly Ginny Percy Remus McGonagall Hermione Malfoys Every death eater Voldemort Anyone that looks at Harry or Daphne the wrong

Like don't get me the story itself is good but there's a bit too much bashing for me. Like I would take out the bashing of Remus, McGonagall, and maybe Ginny as well get rid of the rape and intense physical abuse

** I don't remember it's name. But there is a fanfic in which hermione is a Phoenix animagus who dies and is reborn as a daughter of the house of Black and as Sirius and Regulus's sister. And because of her, the house of Black doesn't support Voldemort and apparently all members of house Black are magical animagi. Very manipulative dumble in this one, who has Fawkes only because he stole him from Grindelwald and is keeping Fawkes captive by holding it's eggs hostage. Also, Hermione is paired with Snape, I think.
