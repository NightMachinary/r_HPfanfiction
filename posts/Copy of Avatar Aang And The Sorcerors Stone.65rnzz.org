Does anyone have a copy of "Avatar Aang And The Sorcerors Stone" by AvatarCat12 saved somewhere? I found the fic from TVTropes, but the link provided returns a Code 1 error (which I'm pretty sure means its deleted?). I'll take whatever format you might have please and thank you.


** Not sure if this is the correct one, but AvatarCat09 posted some chapters of a story called Avatar Aang and the Sorcerer's Stone.

It's on DeviantArt: [[http://avatarcat09.deviantart.com/gallery/]]

The first chapter is somewhere near the bottom of the page.
