** We talking “Harry X Ginny” and “Ron X Hermione” or “Hermione X Ginny” and “Ron X Harry”?

Because there's a big difference, in there. That's why “Harry” is usually “H”, and “Hermione” is usually “Hr”. So we don't get confusion like this.

*** I think they meant canon pairings - Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione.

The double-slash pairing is a relatively uncommon request.
