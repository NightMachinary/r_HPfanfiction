Honestly this was one of the earliest fics I saw that explored the American system of magic so in depth in the 1930s time period (never read Alexandra Quick does it cover time travel?), and it was published before Fantastic Beasts. The authors finally incorporated canon into the story and I love her characterization of Grindelwald, who is not a wizard Nazi, but he's still terrible and possibly planning on reforming the wizard system through force? Fair warning, as you can tell this is a time travel story, but you expect it's your usual Harry goes back and raises Tom Riddle to be good and it's different. Not too different, it fills that need if you like those stories- but Tom's still a lovable cold monster who likes dead things, and there's some exploration on necromancy and international traveling. It's a fem!Harry story, so you know what you're getting into, but it's better than I'm describing it. I might recommend this fic way too much, but this is my last time. It just seems to fit a lot of search questions for time travel AU fem!Harry fics. The author updates once every five months-one year so I thought I'd mention to anyone interested linkffn(crawlersout)

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel
