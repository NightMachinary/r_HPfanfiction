[[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights]] Hello, please see the title and also the link to my Quotev! :) This is my newest story that came from an idea someone said here about the spiders in the cupboard, and how Harry thought of them as "his only friends" in canon! So I decided to take that and make it into a story about how my "Harry Potter", Annabelle, learns she's an arachnatongue and can understand spider language. She will go out into the world this way, and eventually when the story reaches her adulthood she and her spider friends will become advocates for nonhuman sentient rights! :) Yes because in canon magical society is horrible about that, with slavery and oppressing goblins and confining centaurs and genociding giants and also the abuse of dragons like the one in Gringotts or the triwizard tournament.

I will not spend too much time at all on the seven years of Hogwarts, because most of my interesting ideas are for her adulthood, but I do want to show some of those years because she will make important human friends and even a centaur friend and some House-Elves!

I love animals so much and so yes I am looking up /real spider facts!/ At least for the nonmagic ones! The magical spiders I will make up entirely. :)


** Oh! GOD! /YES!/ I love "nonhuman" stories, I always thought the spider idea was interesting (I only know one story that used it before, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigues)), by God am I going to be reading this. By the way, you might want to read my own story involving nonhuman rights, linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), wherein Hermione is a Parselmouth...

****** Agreed! And living Gargoyles are canon --- wizards can and do enchant statues and give them life, much like in /Hunchback/. See for instance the gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore's office. However, in the books, the characters will interact more with them, and with other artificial beings like the Sortign Hat.

Harpies in South America? A novel thought. I tend to think Veelas in their transformed state were the source of muggles' legends about harpies, but if you have alternative ideas on how they could work in a Harry Potter setting, be my guest, I'd love to see it along with everything else!

**** Well done! You once again proved that you're much better at writing magical fights than I am, heheh... Stray observations (keep in mind that those are nitpicks; I still love that story!) :

- It still works for the most part, but I do wish you had introduced Daphne Greengrass a bit more before jumping into the rape-attempt/fight. Since it wasn't the case in canon, it comes a bit out of nowhere that Daphne and Annabelle were good friends, and the shock that Daphne would try to rape her friend doesn't really work if the reader isn't sure whether Daphne and Annabelle were enemies previously. Perhas you could add a paragraph detailing Annabelle's thoughts when Daphne comes into the room (something like: "There was her friend, Daphne --- they got along well usually, but Daphne's expression right then seemed surprisingly unfriendly... Just a trick of the light, it must be...").

- Dragontongue, eh? Why not! I like concerned-sidekick Norberta. (Mind, perhaps Draketongue would have been a better name than Dragontongue; after all, Parseltongue and Arachnatongue don't have "snake" and "spider" in the name). Where did Annabelle learn that language, however? Your version was natively an Arachnamouth and Parselmouth, but surely learning the dragon language wasn't innate?

- Do I detect a hint of /Charlott's Web/ in Ycu's death scene? Very poignant either way! Maybe I would have avoided the F-word there, though.

- Dragons /used to be/ sentient... oh, I love me some intriguing worldbuilding. Well done again!

- Well that's a downer ending.

As always, anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing more of this excellent story!

P.S.: I've been quite lengthy in my reviews of /Fight for Rights/, whereas you, although you've obviously read my /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/, have told me very little about it. Care to sum up your opinion of it?

Oh, so you're following the old version where losing the Horcrux would remove the Parseltongue? Okay. But either way, that wouldn't have to be "forever", would it?

********* Oh no! :( Actually Achille, I am sort of yes caught between two ideas that do not matter RIGHT NOW but MIGHT MATTER LATER. My first idea is that Voldemort just was smarter and kept biding his time in exile up to 1998 so far, or else he just never encountered Quirrell and missed the opportunity to go to Hogwarts in 1991. But my second idea is also pretty much the same, EXCEPT that he will return sometime in the future for a Resurrection of Voldemort arc (like dragon ball z resurrection of frieza movie). :) And THEN that would be when a battle or a war starts, except nonhumans would get to join in and things would be very different.

But I am undecided, because either way Achille I do not WANT Voldemort in my story very much because all my plots REQUIRE Annabelle being free to live her life without him messing it up all the time like in canon. Also I am sick of yes like you said canon rehashes and I do not want to tell the billionth story of that. I am yes sick of Voldemort and Death Eaters all the time, whether it is gritty and dark or whatever else people do with it.

Sick of Voldemort and Death Eaters yes, that is why my story has and is planned to have entirely totally original stories and worldbuilding. Because yes I am sick of stories being so confined to the same places and storylines. That is why I made it start after Hogwarts entirely. So I am free. :)

********** Good points. I had a similar reasoning behind petrifying Voldemort in first year in /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/. I think you have the right idea with your second idea. Leave Voldemort hanging in Albania or wherever for as long as you like. Then at some point around Chapter 50 or something, when your story has really built up its own plot and Annabelle has grown stronger, /then/ you might decide to bring him back. He might not even be the main villain --- whoever is your antagonist, it would be interesting to have them, perhaps, find Voldemort as a weak phantom still, and to take him under their control as a powerful, but ultimately submissive, henchman.

*** There will be adventures with her spider friends and allies, and sometimes yes that means she will ride on the giant ones, but no she will not become spider-woman herself. She will just be on very good terms with the world's spiders! :) Together they will fight for sentient rights of all nonhumans, and also go on random tangent adventures like fighting crime, yes.

** Heh I saw that idea thread. Interesting start, though I was a bit disappointed about fem!Harry. But that's mostly cause I was secretly hoping for "Harry could also be paired with an Acromantula, who is a qt monstergirl of course." as [[/u/Rek-Lama]] so eloquently put it. :P

That last line of the chapter.... makes it kinda seem like she accidentally squished the spider in the midst of her panic...

*** Well you might still get some kind of romantic relationship between Annabelle and a few different magical arachnids, because she is gay and I have a few gay female spiders take interest in her. Please try not to help spread heteronormativity! Thank you! :)

Also no she did not squish her! No I did not mean to imply that! :( I meant to imply that she just made Ycu upset and stop talking to her for a while!

** While your premise seems interesting, the thread title made me think Harry as a party animal, ala Beastie Boys' (You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)

Which sounds hella funny
