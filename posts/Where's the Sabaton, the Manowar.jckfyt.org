Hey folks, got another request/prompt. I'm looking for stories with some real Power Metal moments. Acts of great heroism in battle, final stands that aren't-so-final, and legendary actions are some of my favorite tropes in stories/tv, but you never really see it in fanfic. I'm rather tired of all the "harry dodged to the side at the last second and used and ak to kill voldemort yeehaw." Give me waves of earth and fire falling from the heavens, give me "we brave few, standing at the edge of the world," give me the sky shattering under the stress the magic used in these battles create.

I understand that wizarding combat itself seems to favor guerilla tactics, having high mobility and low numbers, but this is the sort of thing fanfiction is for, no?


** I think you won't be disappointed with joe6991's Wastelands of Time and maybe its sequel.

** A) I honestly thought you were in the wrong subreddit from the title.

2) The magic of linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) has some moments of magic that I would consider power metal-esque (maybe more Rhapsody/Rhapsody of Fire than the style of Sabaton or the US Power Metal of Manowar)

C) If you're down with anime, the very anime inspired linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) definitely hits what you're looking for.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

*** I generally stay away from thimgs that are less than 100,000 words and more than, say, 3 chapters(being a prolific reader), but I'll try it out. Yeah, I thought your A) might happen, but power really does imply a very particular emotion.

I've read the first 4 or so chapters from Magics of the Arcane, does it get any better? I remember having issues with some of the writing.

**** It get's better a bit, but there is something about the writing that is just a bit wonky which I am fairly sure has to do with the anime influence? Don't really know.
