Who's felt this? What fic was it? How did you get past the soul-crushing feelings of inadequacy? These are the important questions!

I got hit hard by The Sinister Man's Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. It's so well put together I can't even afshilnalnfcecnsd,gmdslgfv

** If I would get crushed by reading better stories I'd never even have started writing fanfiction, since that's based on other stories.

** ^{y^{e^{s}}}

Long Journey Home did it several times. Changeling did it twice. Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation confounded me- I kept thinking 'but you can't change the time and setting within a paragraph', and yet the story flowed so well.

In each of these cases, it seems like the authors break the rules in how they use narrative style, but I can't figure out how they know when to shift without losing the reader, and yet they know.

** Mirror by theresnomeaning on Fictionhunt.

I have read many cliffhangers at the end of unfinished stories. I thought I'd grown a thick enough skin not to be affected by just another unfinished story.

I was wrong. So very wrong. This is a great story, but it's not worth the absolutely crushing cliffhanger that finishes this incomplete story.

A pity the author changed her name and deleted all of her stories on fanfiction.net. She was a good writer. Some questions forever remain unanswered, unfortunately.

** I do sometimes, but the feeling only ever lasts for a day or two, then I go back and try to work out what the other writer did so right and what I can take from it. I have to admit that the one you linked wouldn't do that for me. But there are some that do.

** For me, writing fan fiction is very low-risk. There's a lot of reasons my fics might not be popular, completely separate from quality. So when I read fan fics that I consider to be amazingly well written (Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux as an example) I don't feel inadequate or disheartened, but instead try to analyze the writing and see what exactly I like about it.

Idk. Fan fiction is funny because writing it is so purely for the enjoyment of writing.

** I get this feeling in a specific circumstance. English isn't my first language, but I like to think I have a good grasp on it. However /writing/ is a different kind of mastery of language. I think I've managed to turn a clever phrase once in a while, but then I'll read one of the authors who imo write well. I want to stress /write/. I love POTDK, but it's not particularly well-written and it's not why I enjoy it. Take joe6991 or Newcomb, or Swimdraconian. These guys actually write well. I reread their works periodically and sometimes they make me just want to.give up and not bother writing myself anymore. Haven't crushed my spirit completely though.

** The moment that hits me the hardest of any fic is the climax of linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca) in the Louvre.

Everything in the story leads up to that moment and it's so powerful and full of emotion. Perfect.

Honorable mention to the shed scene in Linkffn(Backward with Purpose by Deadwoodpecker)

** It isn't a HP fanfiction, but this story is genius. It's a Naruto fic where he and Sasuke become friends early on, but Naruto is mentally unstable. Eventually, he starts to drag Sasuke down with him. It's addicting, dark, and perfectly written.

I was in the process of writing a Slytherin Harry fic, and reading this story made me want to quit. ;-; I know the feel.
