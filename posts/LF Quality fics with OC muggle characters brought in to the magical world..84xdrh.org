I recently read linkffn(Grow Young with Me) and I really like the idea of introducing a complete muggle with no links to the Magical world through siblings or ancestors, to the magical world.

It doesn't need to be romance like "Grow Young with Me," but I'd prefer it to be Harry-centric or at least feature him heavily. and preferably no slash unless it is REALLY well written.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
