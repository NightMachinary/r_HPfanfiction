We all know that JKR's math is questionable and that the books suffered a little in the transition from a kids series to YA, so that leaves some gaps. One such being the odd question of Madam Hooch. Flying seems to be a course for first year students only, and - going by Harry's year where Gryffindor and Slytherin learned together, logically will only comprise two class groups of two Houses each.

As Harry is a Quidditch player throughout all the books, we know that Madam Hooch doesn't coach - or we would have seen her. She /does/ referee the Quidditch matches - not wonderfully, given her questionable decisions regarding the Bludger and the Dementors in COS and POA. But even then, how many can there reasonably be a year? (on that note - isn't it kind of odd that Harry never seems to attend matches unless Gryffindor are playing? if he's such a fan and also player).

So what is she doing for her (presumably) full teacher's salary the rest of the time?


** It's entirely possible she DOESN'T do more then that, and acts in a part time capacity. She could be some manner of “quidditch authority” or perhaps a representative of the Department of Magical Games and Sports to ensure adequate safety, which would explain her rather extreme reaction to unsupervised flight.

** I headcanon that she maintains and supervises the quidditch pitch. School brooms only being used for two class periods a year for first years? That doesn't make sense.

It would be responsible to have someone down there to make sure no wayward first year has a Neville happen and nobody can find him or her.

As for Oliver's mania? Probably him sneaking the team down while she was sleeping or the pitch not being "open".

I feel that this isn't unreasonable. She's probably sitting in her box seat-like office, bored as hell, waiting for people to do stuff. Like recreational quidditch, broom races, seeker duels, beater target competition, ANYTHING.

We need more fics that add more depth to school quidditch. I mean, it wouldn't be that hard to go to her and set up a league independent of the school league. Hell, they could probably write to a Quidditch magazine with the idea, and they could sponsor the whole thing. Tax deductions AND free advertising?

Also, it's a freaking magic school... Why are the teams fighting over the quidditch pitch? Just transfigure some goals and make a temporary pitch...

Edit: Also, I'm of the opinion that there are broomstick licenses. Or a permit. Something. Or more of a certificate of taking the first year class and managing to not kill yourself on a broom.

I did some thinking in that regard for my own stories and I don't think your idea of a separate league would work. There will probably be quite a few pickup games, just a few kids going out there to "toss the quaffle", much like Muggle children meet and play football or basketball. Probably without beaters and maybe without seekers. Just throw a ball, maybe with one keeper and 2-4 people playing against each other to see who scores the most.

The goals are quite high in the air and the balls are enchanted. So it is not as easy as waving a wand around. Even if canon transfiguration is pretty overpowered.

** Theory: students take flying classes until they're proficient. For Harry, this was one lesson. For Ron, most of first year. For Hermione, well into second year and /of course she never mentioned this to anyone/.

She also may take a more active role in coaching quidditch when the captains are less obsessive (probably Ravenclaw).

*** This was my head-canon as well. Flying is apparently a skill most wizards/witches learn, and having a singular lesson on the subject when you're eleven doesn't give you the kind of instruction you'd need to be flying half-decently for the rest of your life. Since the story's told from Harry's perspective and he's given /plenty/ of instruction on flying from Wood during their tri-weekly practices for Quidditch, Harry never needed to attend Madame Hooch's Lessons after that first time, and thus it wasn't shown in the story... But almost everyone else did because Flying's not that easy, and becoming "competent" (at minimum) probably takes time and practice.

***** I mean, technically, Apparition would be the closest equivalent as you need to actually be certified to Apparate legally - you need to be 17, it requires a specific test to get a license allowing it, etc... it's the closer parallel to a Muggle's driving license.

Flying on a broomstick seems to be the wizarding equivalent of learning to ride a bicycle for Muggles... or more accurately to the way broomsticks might sometimes be tempermental and quirky, learning to ride a horse for Muggles prior to the 1880s. Incredibly useful skill for general travel that pretty much everyone learns, and doesn't require a license like Apparition does...

But yeah, I get your point. Once you know how to ride a broom to a decent level, you're not liable to forget how to fly and there's little point in continuing to hone your skills if you don't need to fly regularly.

** Offically, Freelance.

If you want the real scoop however, open your mind, my friend to a nice few set of facts.

Madame Hootch was the only one not inspected during Umbridges reign of terror.

Madame Hootch has full year lodgings in Hogwarts whilst only teaching for one or two months at most.

Madame Hootch would benefit greatly from the brooms being replaced.

Madame Hootch would do anything to get the brooms replaced.

Dumbledore won't replace the brooms.

Fudge would benefit greatly from a spy in hogwarts, yet he doesn't put any effort into acquiring one.

He doesn't need one, A certain flight instructor spends her days spying from the roof, discovering secrets, unveiling lies, seeding dissent.

Wizards never look up.

** I always thought of her as the PE Teacher for First Years. There will always be more first years. She teaches them how to fly. If they cannot do so after the entirety of 1st year, they get to try again With the next batch of first years. know that in canon we never get mention of Hermione or Neville flying, but I figure they both know how to and can competently; they just don't like it. I'd say she just runs the flying class for First Years, has an elective class for years 2-7 once a week to stay sharp (for the students who don't want to take one of , COMC, Divination, Arithmancy, Muggle Studies and Ancient Runes; or students who are enamored with the fact that they can conquer gravity with nothing more than an enchanted cleaning implement - and fuck you, if that wouldn't tickle your pickle; but to keep up with academic rigor, you'd have to be VERY good on a broomstick to get the credit), and refs Quidditch. Sounds like a nice job.

Edit 1: Also, a lot of your problem is from the third person limited point of view of the story lol. Just because you don't see it on the page doesn't mean it doesn't happen. If that was the case, Harry's spell repertoire would be like 4 incantations.

Edit 2: The headcanon part of my theory - not everyone is capable of apparation and disapparition. So Hogwarts makes sure every one of their students can fly from A to B or they cannot graduate. And there is no stigma about it from some old custom or another.

Edit 3: Maybe it's even a required class, but certain extra-curriculars mean you don't need the credit. Like how football players, wrestlers, marching-band members, baseball players don't need the PE credit because they get it from their extra-curricular - quidditch players also get the credit. Maybe even there's a Quodpot team that we don't read of in canon.

Edit 4: Fuck it, have Flitwick being a crazy cook and have his choir perform flying based musical pieces during some intermission in quidditch! Picture band members on brooms enchanting their musical instruments to play while flying in formation! Let the higher years charm their instruments to play independently!!! Let 7th years transfigure their own instruments and charm them to make ludicrously inhuman music!!!!! Holy shit someone write it!

** So, I definitely don't think that she's a full-time teacher; her title is MADAM Hooch, not PROFESSOR Hooch. This could be that Flying isn't an academic pursuit, and therefore she isn't a professor, but the fact is still that we only know of 3 other people who work for the school that don't have the title of "professor:" Pomfrey, Pince, and Filch, all of whom do not teach in any capacity, and all of whom look after something within the school: Hospital Wing, Library, and school interior. Now I would say that perhaps it's Hooch's duty to look after the Quidditch Pitch, except in GoF, it's implied that this is Hagrid's job, as Harry and Diggory are appalled at the state of the pitch before the 3rd task and are assured that Hagrid will have it fixed in no time at all. Therefore, I think it likely that Hooch only shows up on an as-needed basis. We hear no mentions of her in any situation that doesn't require flying, and one thing that I think JKR did well throughout the books is describing what and who Harry sees around him, even when it doesn't seem to mater. And we never see her except for flying and quidditch.

If we want to go into some fanon ideas, I expect she'd probably do a lot of liaison with the Quidditch teams - with them sending scouts or other observers, for instance. It's possible she'd do research on newer broom types, or look to improve the school brooms - or, alternatively, just spend a lot of time on improving them or fixing them (or fixing student's brooms).

I could also see a variation of Hogwarts - where clubs are more prominent - where she might be in charge of overseeing a flying/quidditch club, to add to her duties.

I am fairly confident that he does. Because we get brief descriptions of how the matches go down. Much like lessons, Harry is there but we as the reader don't get the details because it doesn't really matter in Harry's life how Ravenclaw beats Hufflepuff. Because in the end what matters is someone won and Harry will play against the winner.

** Regarding Harry and Quidditch...

Not everyone who likes a given sport is also a fan of watching that same sport. I find it weird... but it's not that different to not being into streaming or watching recs of computer games but happily playing them. Given Harry also seems to show absolutely zero interest in professional Quidditch (in contrast to his best friend who shows quite a lot), I think it's reasonable to conclude this is the case for Harry too.

From this point of view... it's entirely possible to see the Quidditch World Cup final as being less about the Qudditch and more about a kind of family event Harry's never really had before.

Also, Harry's enthusiasm for it could be because of that specific match (or, possibly, who was playing). I mean, I tried to watch a Super Bowl several years ago and turned it off because it was trash, but I did watch the Philadelphia Eagles win. From what I understand, the latter was a quite unusual and unrepresentative game... whereas the first match I tried to watch was actually what American Football fans (i.e. not me) would consider a classic.

Anyway... in terms of Madam Hooch... I choose to believe that the flying lessons continue throughout the year and that she manages the Quidditch pitch schedule. I mean, we know they have to book times and while Snape can clearly alter the booking schedule, it would make sense that there's someone to enforce these rules. Thus, Madam Hooch has some kind of tower office that oversees the pitch and she'd fly down if necessary.

In the McGonagall era, I like to imagine the Quidditch season is extended to a double round robin so there are more games each year.
