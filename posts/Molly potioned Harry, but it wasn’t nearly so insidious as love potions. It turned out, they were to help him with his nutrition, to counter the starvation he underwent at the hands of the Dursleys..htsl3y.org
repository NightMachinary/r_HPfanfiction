**** I remember someone else talking about a fic where every year, a student's family gets "tasked" with guiding any lost Muggleborns onto the platform, subtly. The Weasleys opted to do so by using the terms "Muggle" and saying the platform-number out loud just inside the range of the Muggle-Repelling Charm.

It was just about the most wholesome aversion of the "Molly's openly talking about Muggles, she must be evil" trope I'd ever heard of and I'm still kinda sad they never said which fic it was. If anyone finds it, /please/ tell me.

***** Something like that is a throwaway line in the Star Wars/Harry Potter crossover fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]]. The actual reference is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/19/Harry-Tano][Chapter 19]] and consists of a small conversation between Sirious and Molly with Sirius explaining to the kids that the use of a small charm to distract non-magicals allows the volunteers to use words like "muggle", thus attracting the attention of any magical on the other side of the pillar.

There may be other fics where similar things happen, but this is the only one I can find so far.

Is that why it has to be done because they want to steal his money, fame, and manipulate him?

Why Dumbledore wouldn't have visit the Weasley and say "look, from what Hagrid told me, Harry will be alone and kind of lost at the station. And there's no way his family would let us bring him to the station. He is also clearly not comfortable with being famous and people recognizing him.

The best one still is that Molly was stressed out by the day and sad to send her children away for months. So she got less careful about the statute of secrecy and temporally forgot a previously well-known information.

It's supremely annoying that some fanfic authors use it as some bottled Imperius Curse. I feel like authors read about /amortentia/ in HBP and apply it to all love potions. I feel like it's comparing everclear to wine coolers.

But again, I feel like that plays it too harshly. "Hurrdurr wizarding world hurrdurr rape drugs hurrdurr makesnosense"

Even if the wizarding world was as irrational as most fanfic, even if they were as backwards as most fanfic, even if the wizarding world was as ass-head-retarded-go-muggles as some fanfic says, there's no civilization that would let actual love potions exist. They were introduced as funny. They were talked about with humor. Even the most powerful love potion can't create love. Just fucking relax.

If you need to write a story where the Weasleys are evil and Arthur is a rape victim, you're bad at writing. It's like all those retarded stories that have the Weasleys at King's Cross Station in Year 1 to shanghai Harry for the Leader of the Light TM, it's bad.

****** I mean, on one hand Amortentia is really damn potent and propably would qualify as a rape drug.

On the other hand, we know that a shitton of potion ingredients are considered 'controlled substances' (one of the reasons why Crouch had to steal them off of Snape instead of buying them in book 4) so i don't think many people would even get a chance to brew the stuff - and even if they did, potion's are hard so i doubt they'd succeed in that many cases - it's not meth where you can be happy with a mixture of suspicious chemicals and 30% meth, it's a tricky bit of magic where you either have the stuff or you blow your face up/melt the cauldron/poison somebody. It's not easy.

And, well, people aren't that evil (mostly) to just go raping each other for fun - and those that do can make do with sleeping agents or copious amount of alcohol anyway. Love potions are far worse option by a mile for that purpose since the victim will actually know and remember what happened - and from there you're a short way from getting your ass handed into prison.

** I mean, canonically she makes /large/ portions of food IIRC, so I could see her getting a potion ready to increase Harry's appetite if he doesn't clean his plate.

Although, I'd think nutrition/appetite potions wouldn't be such a big deal to /ask/ about as opposed to mickey-slipping someone with them - "Harry, I've noticed you don't seem to be eating a lot, do you need a potion to help with that? I could mix it into a drink, most potions taste awful on their own..."

** This... bears examining. Maybe from Ginny's perspective as she continues the task at Hogwarts at Molly's behest during fifth or sixth year?

I like Harry/Hermione for being a stable relationship and all but this looks like it could make a fun Harry/Ginny schoolyard romance.

Also Hermione noticing Ginny and confronting her in private with this massive head of steam that vanishes entirely once she explains.

***** That was specifically because that potion was banned from sporting events. If it wasn't against the rules, she'd probably not get as upset.
