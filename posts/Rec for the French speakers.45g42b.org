I just realized that one of my favourite book series growing up could legitimately be considered a Fanfiction of Harry Potter. My memories are a bit foggy, but it has everything to fit the bill, from the young wizard who discovers his powers around his 11th birthday, to time travel, to a murdering psychopath as a villain with "mor" in his name. It's called the Tom Cox series, and I loved it when I was younger.


** You should probably change this flair to a promotion, not a request.

*** Uh...will do, but I don't really understand why this is a Promotion and not a Recommendation. Could you explain the difference since I'm on Android I can't find the rules for flairs.

**** The 3 main tags in this subreddit:

1) Request: often titled with "looking for" or "LF", this type of post is meant to get recommendations from other users, or help finding a specific fic from what the original poster (OP) remembers.

Example 1: "LF time travel fics", I just finished reading Backwards with Purpose and want more fics like it! Any recommendations?

Example 2: "LF specific maruaders era fic", Sirius was the secret keeper, but got captured and didn't give up the location of the potters. It was a whole series but I'm blanking on the name

2) Discussion: any post meant to spark discussion, or posit an idea that others may want to weigh in on.

Example: "here's why i think the giant squid is the real protagonist of harry potter"

3) Promotion: this tag is a recommendation by the OP to the other subreddit users. Often used by authors to promote their new stories, or by readers to promote a new fic they came across that they have never seen recommended on the subreddit before. (This is what your post should be tagged as)

Example: "i came across this awesome new mentor!bill story, check it out!"

There is also the "misc" tag (short for miscellaneous), which is meant for any post that does not fit into the above categories.

Hope this helps!
