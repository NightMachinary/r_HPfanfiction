Maybe within a Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw spin-off story. (Even if Neville is a Gryffindor.) Whatcha think?


** Well, Neville married a hufflepuff girl post-canon. She was some minor character who was in dumbledore's army. I can't remember which one she was.

I want to hear about what they did during the sixth book. They didn't show up enough in that book.
