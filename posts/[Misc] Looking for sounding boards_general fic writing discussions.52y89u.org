Hi!

I'm looking for some people to talk ideas with! I'm working on my own story right now (Charlie/Pansy) and only about 10k words into it, but I'd really appreciate some feedback on some ideas and plot things. My irl friends either don't read fanfic or don't read HP fanfic, unfortunately, so I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

I'm really just looking to bounce some ideas off people and get fresh perspectives on both technical writing and Harry Potter fanfic writing. I'm also willing to be a sounding board for anyone else! I read het, slash, femslash, and pretty much any pairing or gen fics. I don't read dub-con, non-con, or sexual abuse, but mostly I'm pretty open to sharing ideas, helping others with plots, etc.

Let me know!


** I see [[/u/Freshenstein][u/Freshenstein]] has already pointed you in the direction of the IRC, but I would still like to encourage you to stop by. There are a goodly number of authors hanging out there, and the regular crowd is very helpful whether you are just after a sounding board or looking for someone to provide concrit.

I'll just mention when you first arrive you won't see any conversation prior to you arriving so don't panic and think the place is empty. Say G'day and give it a couple of minutes and you'll see there is generally about a dozen people there. We're from all over the globe so no matter the time you are on there are usually a few people about.

** Feel free to stop by the HPFanFiction IRC chat room! There's usually at least a few people in there at all times and they love to help discuss fics and such

*** RIGHT?

They have literally no interaction in canon, and seemingly nothing in common. I'm trying to make it work for them realistically!

** Agh! Love rarepairs. I think I've literally only seen Charlie/Pansy in Rebuilding. Honestly, the crew of people who write a whole bunch of rarepairs (and some not so rare pairs) on tumblr talk a lot about writing and give a lot of feedback. It's a pretty friendly community. PM and I can give you some names to follow if you're interested.

  She meets a pack of Australian muggles at a pub in Barcelona; they tell her that they're staying in a youth hostel with bunk beds and communal bathrooms and rat traps in the hallways---and she sneers in response, half-cocked and semi-automatic, but then a bottle of Absinthe is produced from an Army-issue canvas knapsack and she's being handed a fire-filled glass and told to â€˜say hi to the green fairy' and the lights spin and the room tilts and she smokes her first cigarette and kisses her first stranger and smears her pearl-pink lipstick on a cocktail napkin to wipe the sweat off her face and she hears herself laugh and laugh and laugh and there's music pulsing in bass-heavy shockwaves up the notches of her spine and there's salt on the insides of her thighs and the hollows of her hips and she isn't Pansy Parkinson anymore, no, she isn't a girl who hides or runs or escapes, no, she's someone else she's someone new she's someone who's breathing and fighting and alive---

  Because there's a word for what she's doing.

** This is a great idea!!! I love the idea of it-- and yes rare pairings are the way to go. Plus, so much characterization and development to play with!!

Shoot me a PM if you're still looking, I'd love to help out!

** I'm having a bit of an existential fanfiction crisis, is that the sort of thing to discuss here? I wrote a one-shot but now I feel strangely reluctant to post it. I don't know exactly why, as I've always been quite impatient to post stories in the past and I know not to expect too much. Perhaps I should listen to my inner voice. Hm.
