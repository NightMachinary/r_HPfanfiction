Am I the only one that has this issue? Its so hard for me to read the original series cause Harry is so weak and pathetic and stupid.


** Other way around, yes JKR is pretty bad with large scale stuff (and phases of the Moon), but whenever I read the original books I am reminded how much better author she is than most fanfiction authors in terms of normal conversation, little situations, flow of the story and such.

*** As unsatisfied as I am with the last leg of almost everyone's arc, their canon personalities are so much more enjoyable and multifaceted. Fan fiction makes them so boring.

Like, to me, Dumbledore, Fleur, and Harry are funny assholes. Snape has a dry wit and McGonagall has her own moments. And even the fans of those characters ignore all that.

**** Snape's sense of humour is dark and certainly not suited for kids but he's actually quite dry and funny.

Like:

#+begin_quote
  Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?”

  “Certainly not. You must kill me.”

  There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.

  “Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. “Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?”
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “Maybe he's ill!” said Ron hopefully. “Maybe he's left,” said Harry, “because he missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again!” “Or he might have been sacked!” said Ron enthusiastically. “I mean, everyone hates him ---”

  “Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.”
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "You are on probation!' shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. 'You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!'

  Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave.
#+end_quote

The way he's characterized in fanfics, you'd think if Snape bowed sarcastically at someone, it would be out of character. In fanfic, he's made out to be the angstiest person alive who did nothing but angst. But no, he has a sense of humour, like most of the characters in the series, and hardly anyone ever portrays this part of him in fanfic. It made me realize there's no one in fandom who can actually show how characters are multi-faceted as well as Rowling does.

Yes, I quite liked his and Ginny's relationship in 'The Changeling'. It felt like you were learning a few more layers of him than we were allowed in canon, while also being perfectly in character. I doubt he helped her out from true altruism (as it should be), but to elevate his own self-image. But still, he helped her, and his contributions mattered. Very well-done characterization despite the fact that he doesn't appear much in the fic.

***** Editors do a whole range of stuff. From changing the tone of a story, to rearraning the structural elements, all the way down to what I'm talking about, which is line-editing.

This is when an editor goes through, literally line by line, and makes lots of small adjustments to improve the overall story. See [[https://blog.reedsy.com/line-editing/][here]] for more details!

One common misunderstanding is people hear "editing" and they think of /copy-editing/, which is specifically fixing spelling, punctuation and grammar. Copy-editor tends to be a more junior position, and is not what people mean when they talk about the editor for a book.

Note: I say "editors change", but really editors suggest changes to authors. In general, authors always maintain creative control and final say over their own work. Although this tends to change over time - a more senior and experienced author is usually more free to ignore an editor, often to their own detriment.

Like "writing a story". I mean, we've all written stuff for our school work and we certainly didn't need editors (the maximum would probably be showing your work to +Hermione+ a classmate to proof-read and point out spelling errors). But not only is the art of writing so complex (there's stuff like narrative perspective, pacing and what not), now there are even people with full-time, proper, professional jobs solely dedicated to improving another person's written work. Blows my mind, honestly.

And yes, I still enjoy re-reading canon from time to time. Like I've said before there is a certain innocence to it. While I don't mind sex and violence they can be very easily overdone and lose their shock value. Also, canon was written over a period of 10 years and has been through professional editing. As much as I love fanfiction it is just a hobby for people who still have to go to school and/ or work. As such it will never be as finished and polished as canon.

I recently listened to the whole series and at the end of first book, my love for the series was renewed with vigor. At the end of three, I was rearing to start the fourth. At the end of fifth, I was treating it as an unending task. Not because of the angst or anyrhing2. But because, nothing ever happened because Harry made it happen. Everything happrnrd3 to him. Nothing he discovered was through hard work or quick mind. It was all happenstance. After third book, the series stops being adventure books and become dull drama.

Harry in canon is meant to be a self-insert of sorts - or at the least an audience surrogate, so I can understand why people gravitated towards him in that role (even if I dislike the lazy super!Harry aspects in a lot of fanfiction). But it doesn't help that in canon he's /literally/ the chosen one ><

I think there is a real complaint that canon Harry is too passive, and not focused enough on, well, preparing for his destiny. We see that he can get results /if/ he is focused enough (in Goblet of Fire, he prepares pretty assiduously for the third task), and that he's talented in Defense - but it doesn't really go further than that. A Harry that trains harder in preparation for Voldemort is something that I think people jump to a lot, because it makes a lot of sense.

**** The everyman surrogate exists in most fiction where the world is strange enough to need one. Watson in the original iteration of Sherlock Holmes, Luke Skywalker, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, Dorothy in /Wizard of Oz/, Bella Swan in Twilight, Peter Parker during his transition into Spiderman...

You refer to the "audience surrogate" as if it's an insult to the character, but it's the lens that allows us as the audience to watch as a person with roughly similar experiences or expectations of the world as our own experiences and learns about the fantastic or magical new rules of reality that they're suddenly facing. It's why we generally find those characters so engaging, because we identify with them as we both learn about the world around them.

Canon Harry isn't passive or lazy, he's fulfilling another archetype- the reluctant hero. He's a child who's entire life that he can remember has been abuse and neglect at the hands of his caregiver, and when he finally gets a glimmer of hope of "normalcy" and happiness, he quickly finds himself faced with a megalomaniac who is determined to murder him, and an impending civil war and /genocide/ that hinges entirely on whether or not he can kill the megalomaniac first. All canon Harry wants to do is be a child and learn magic, but there's the crushing weight of needing to commit murder in order to prevent the murders of hundreds to thousands of muggleborns on him, and he learns this /when he's fifteen/, right around the time he suffers an immensely tragic personal loss without time to grieve.

When I was fifteen, I was concerned about passing math, and getting my driving learner's permit, and exams. I can't imagine facing what he was without trying to hide from it. From my perspective it's totally understandable.

And as far as not training harder, in fifth year, even before he knew all this, he /was/ training. He was teaching defense spells to the DA and practicing them, and the one bit of training he was assigned by his mentor ended up turning into repeated assaults by a teacher who despised him. In sixth year, the only training he was assigned by Dumbledore was looking at old memories, this was on top of having to manage classes and his grief for Sirius.

His training harder makes sense from a logical perspective, but in the logic of the books, I think up until the moment Dumbledore was cursed, it was expected that Dumbledore would do most of the heavy fighting. Harry didn't know that the onus of the fight was on his shoulders until Dumbledore died, and then spent most of the next eleven months hiding in the woods trying not to starve or be found using a wand that he couldn't properly use.

Canon Harry is pretty passive on a lot of stuff, in my opinion. Yes, it's the reluctant hero, but at the end of book 4 he's confronted Voldemort 3 times (4 if we count when he was a baby) and has seen him come back to life. By that point, it's pretty obvious that he doesn't have a choice to sit out of it, and that Dumbledore has no real chance/ability to stop Harry from being in the thick of things.

The training to the DA is fine, but it's not that much on the whole, and doesn't really seem (to me) like Harry is putting that much energy into it. Hence why fanfiction that involves him working harder/more diligently is a popular one for many people. It doesn't make any approach wrong, from a storytelling perspective - but canon's approach isn't the only way to take it, and people have different tastes/preferences.

Just imagine if in 1938 someone in Germany was told "Hey, you're the only one that can save a whole race of people from genocide" and they were like "Yea, yea, that's pretty important, but my batting average has really gone up this year and I think I might be able to make it to the pros!"

Fuck canon Harry. JKR was a great children's author, but there are dozens (hundreds?) of fanfics that make for way better YA novels than OOTP/HBP/DH do.

Curiously, why do you say so? And what are some of the best fanfictions that you'd recommend?

And trying my luck here, but I am looking for that one fan fiction that was released just around the time that Deathly Hallows was released - and many people think it is better than Rowling's own novel. Do you know which one that is?

******* I think Harry's arc is unsatisfying because he follows the Hero's Journey of development, but his development sort of... looses the plot? Or maybe sputters? The important plot points that would define his character (besides Sirius) just happened around him, so it never felt like he developed consistently. And I feel like it wasn't intentional, like JKR meant to but didn't achieve a well-rounded Harry, or perhaps a good balance between your average teenager angst and a compelling plotty protagonist for a book. Like his backstory as an abuse victim is almost too subtle at times: Having it be reduced to the plot point for why Harry accepts death can demean the trauma of living people. If it had been acknowledged or grappled with then I'd be satisfied with another example of Harry's compassion which would reinforce some literary theme. Buuuut...

Maybe I've forgotten too much of the books...

  A Harry that trains harder in preparation for Voldemort is something that I think people jump to a lot, because it makes a lot of sense.
#+end_quote

I get this mindset but I'd argue it actually does make sense. Voldemort and Dumbledore are very clearly portrayed as being above and beyond anyone else in the series in terms of pure magical power and talent. They're S tier. Harry is like at best B tier. No amount of training is gonna make him be able hold his own toe to toe in a duel against Voldemort. Thats not the point. I see so many fics where they have Harry get mad that Dumbledore is wasting his time with useless memories instead of training him in advanced defensive magic, as if half a dozen training sessions would miraculously put him on Voldemort's level lmao. Remember Voldemort singlehandedly fended of not 1, not 2, but /3/ of the series' best wizards simultaneously and it wasn't like he was even struggling that much. People who expected Harry to take him down with brute force if only he'd trained more over the years are idiots. It was never gonna happen, never a realistic option

**** I want to add in linkffn(12924292) , which is an incredible fic that was started in February of 2018, and still being updated once every few weeks. It's very well written, there are 259 chapters so far, and unlike lots of crappy fics, the chapter are a good length. It's only been roughly 3 years, and every character Breanie (the author) has used has (IMO) stayed true to who they were in canon, and has molded realistically to the events she's outlined. Not to mention I've not found a single plot hole, and the story actually makes sense.

Edit: canon has roughly 1084k words, while this fic has around 2227k words, so at this point the fic is over twice as long as the entire series. It is a /very/ good fan fic.

****** I think it probably makes sense to look at it from the context of British grades - but I don't know how those distributions look like.

The reason I say that is because every country grades a little differently - the French system (that does out of 20) is not at all comparable to the American one if you were to simply adjust it to a 100 point scale, because an 18/20 (90%) is much much harder to get than a high B (7 point scale) or A (10 point scale) - it's probably comparable to an A+, and a perfect score can often be impossible depending on your teacher.

Since we don't get a good grade distribution from Hogwarts (far too small a sample size, and very inconsistent when getting told the past grades of former students) I'd expect the British grading system to give some indication of what to expect (since JKR did draw a lot from Britain, obviously)

Sure there might be some plot holes, some plots may be less interesting than those we may find in fics and some characters may act irrational on second thought. However keep in mind that JK had to do world building, character development and write a coherent plot. Most fanfic authors have the foundation laid down for them. Yet rarely had I seen a fanfic author being such a natural storyteller as JK. Her characters' conversations happen naturally and perfectly blend in with the action which is neither too fast paced nor dragged endlessly. Also I love her descriptions... you can clearly visualize her world without having to read countless pages about every little detail.

Harry - who has known Ginny for years and never shown anything beyond casual indifference - is suddenly consumed with jealousy and passion for the girl that is dating his roommate (?? did he want to have some 'guy-talk' with Dean?), while Hermione is all about the guy that publicly humiliated her at the biggest social event of their lives to that point?

Harry's inaction concerning Voldemort could be excused as psychological avoidance, but it is still pretty hard to believe, just out of a survival instinct. Young men fight wars because they're the only ones willing; Harry, rather, upon learning he is the only human able to save the world, decides quidditch and making it with his pal's little sister is more important.

They're meant to be heroic teenagers, but instead come off as socially inept grade schoolers (Ron pulling on Hermione's pigtails bc he likes her, Harry playing make-believe that if he doesn't pay attention to the Prophecy it will go away, and Hermione... well, lots of young women go for abusive guys, so that's fair).

A world I let myself sink into when sleep eludes me, one I couldn't possibly imagine living without getting to know.

Ginny's experience during the year of the Deathly Hallows and her subsequent efforts to deal with her trauma was excellent writing, and the story also showed Slytherin students in a much more positive light than the one-dimensional portrayal in the canon books. After all, if Slytherin House was just a hatchery for future death eaters, why was it allowed to remain at Hogwarts?

**** Annerb is one of the very, very few writers who is on a publishable level. But she's also heavily scaffolding off the canon plot, not writing an original one. Her sequels are noticeably weaker for the lack of that scaffolding.

Even her short stories, which are some of the best HP fanfictions out there, aren't very original in terms of plots. They are cliche romances (amnesia, forced to share a bed, etc). They are some of the best written versions of those cliches in the fanfiction world, but there is a pretty noticeable lack of originality that I think makes real comparison to JKR's writing impossible.

I'm ok with working off the canon plot. Rowling never bothered to write what happened between the Battle of Hogwarts and "19 years later", and in my opinion she missed a huge opportunity. The story of what happened after and how the wizarding world adapted and recovered would have been classic, so someone had to do it.

** It's always strange to go back to canon, but only because it's almost like having the famous Harry Potter become just Harry again.

Plus, in canon he's an insert for the audience, in fanfic he's most commonly an insert for the author.

The thing about fanfic is that it typically has a short half life- it feels dated very quickly as trends change. It depends on the niche the author falls into and it can either over-embroider canon to the point it stands on its own, or just use it as window dressing.

Most characters start to be written according to a rubric created by whatever is popular. Fan!Harry is as much a product of every fanfic an author has ever read, as much as he is a product of canon.

You have to respect what JKR achieved with Harry Potter- in the conceiving, writing and the publishing of it, even as you also have to respect fanfic authors and their achievements.

(The respect does not have to be wholehearted and universal. I personally feel that Harry Potter is a very late 90s early 00s thing and doesn't fit as well anymore because the world changed. Also, the books were written with children in mind, and that is reflected in the plot, wherein everyone is incompetent.)

**** Perhaps that's unfair. When I try to bear in mind that it's set in the early 90s- which was a very different time. 1997 and the Labour victory changed a LOT of things in the UK. It's not so much that everyone is incompetent, as that a goodly portion of characters are semi-satirical versions of ineffective archetypes, and the rest are serving the plot as much as anything else.

The plot must happen, so the characters must behave in such a way as to make Harry able to discover the Philosopher's stone and be able to defeat the obstacles to getting it. They may not be sensible/robust protections, but they serve the plot.

The plot must happen, so nobody who was aware of the opening of the Chamber of Secrets the first time was able to use that experience to help- aside from wondering how Voldemort did it, did Dumbledore take any actions which suggested he was treating this as Voldemort infiltrating the school?

Etc, etc. There is a general lack of concern for the safety, which, once again tracks with the early 90s setting. There's the lack of decisive action from any adult not on Voldemort's side.

I suppose I fall victim to the same thing as OP- I've read so many fix it fics that a)canon is cliche, b) when you aren't genre blind, like the characters have to be, then there are so many obvious courses of action, c) attitudes have changed massively over 20 years and I forget that, d) I want to help and power up Harry rather than creating an uneven conflict.

As for the plot - there are a lot of convolutions that happens in the novels, primarily the ones that keep Harry alive till the end and keep him on a level footing with Voldemort. The series fails there.

** The original series is fine - I still find the first 4 books to be very good, but a lot of that is nostalgia. Book 5 is fine, but 6-7 really aren't great in my opinion. I tend not to re-read past 4 when the intent strikes me.

JKR is great at a few things - conversations, setup/payoff of worldbuilding in a book (as in, in the early books she does a great job of setting up aspects of the world that are important for later in it as a payoff), a sense of wonder/expansiveness to her universe, etc. But she's really bad at some other stuff - numbers, consistency from book to book (since so much of the universe was expanded on in each book depending on the plot, it can make it hard to go back and try to justify things). Subjectively, I also did not find the romantic pairings to be particularly satisfying (they seemed rushed and forced), and the resolution to the conflict (as well as its course/scale) was not my favorite.

Fanfiction can often be similar in having strengths/weaknesses compared to the original, as long as there is a good writer doing it - but the universe is a very appealing one to imagine/change, and in my case the things I don't like about JKR's writing style and the plot is one that fanfiction often changes.

(Also, after the last year I think a lot of people are finding it hard to look at the original work the same way, as her views on certain issues (particularly her TERF views) have come out more prominently)

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/#post-23006877][Sword and Sorcery]] is a Fate/Stay Night crossover which kind of supposes you already know who Shirou Emiya is and like him as a character. Decent understanding of the Fate franchise is also recomended (though not anything crazy thankfully). Though if you have all that, the characters are /amazing/, their interaction sublime, the worldbuilding amazing, and the humor spot on. I'll stand on a rooftop to proclaim this fic's greatness to anyone that would listen, and it's also the only HP fanfic I've read more times than the originals.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], is purely Harry Potter, and I can probably say this one is even more directed towards me and my personality type. I know a lot of people doesn't like them, but I love this kind of story (rational, and focused on magical growth). Sure, the writing is not as good as the original, and the characters and interactions are not quite as compelling, but the worldbuilding is quite a few steps better from my perspective. This is the series I go back and forth on. Sometimes I will place it above the original, and sometimes I'll put it third on my list.

In comparison the Harry Potter books are probably the best mystery books I've read. And the characters and their interactions are just amazing. Their atmosphere and nostalgia factor is /really/ hard to beat, and they have very few flaws. Less than either of the fics above even, so I'd probably say the canon story is 'objectively' the best (if such a thing can even be applied to literature), but the two fics above is better aimed at my personal tastes so I prefer them.

Fanfiction also has the advantage of forgoing a lot of setup and investment compared to an original story, so the competition is not entirely fair.

So... yeah. Anything else you wanted to know?

And Shirou finding that no matter how many swords you have,/sometimes/ a problem just can't be fixed with a sword. (Although they can be quite versatile.) Having multiple Voldavatars promises to keep it challenging, too.

I can see why you would like White Squirrel's work.

******** Not every story needs to have a physical obstacle as the main source of conflict. Shirou's main problem is research based in nature, something he's never really been good at, and the thing that most opposes that is his own personality and inability to /not/ help people in need.

Shirou is indeed vastly overpowered, but that doesn't detract from anything. One of my favorite parts of the story was when he went out into the forbidden forest to make Iris's birthday present. It's just such a Shirou thing to do. He thinks nothing of spending an entire night non-stop fighting giant spiders and talk off centaurs to forge a single (admittedly awesome) knife. Given how exhausted he was at the end of that, he really pushed himself and risked life and limb to create it, but that's just how Shirou rolls. It's so in-character for him and creates some wonderful and natural interaction between characters that otherwise never would have met.

That story is flushed with things like that. It's character driven, not plot driven, something I appreciate a lot.

I'm glad I could get another person to read it. :)

** I had this issue a ways back but I started rereading every ~4 months and I feel like I have a sense of balance back.

For some reason, having read so much fanfiction has gotten me way more invested in the canon characters than I used to be. I loved the books when I first read them, but my anger at Draco when he insults Harry after Cedric's death makes me want to throw things now, whereas I barely remembered that happening the first time. When Harry thinks he's all alone and then Hermione brings him toast in GoF I go "aww", where at first I rushed through that because I wanted to know the mystery of why Harry is in the tournament / get to what the tournament is like. I have to put the book down for a while when Sirius dies, and I never have that experience with any other media.

I guess there's this feeling that in fanfiction I'm immersed in a lot of what if's, but canon is the "real people", so everything hits that much harder.

  Harry is just this eleven-year-old trying to cope when Hagrid shows up. Daphne Greengrass is smart, plain, hardworking and a pureblood witch from a family of very modest means. They aren't rich or prominent among the wizarding social set, but they are full of guile and learn fast. Of course they're underestimated, until it is too late.

*** Not trying to fight back against the guy that murdered your parents and was about to kill all of your friends is pretty much the definition of weak, pathetic and stupid.

JKR started the series as a pretty standard 'hero's journey', then abandoned that in book 6 when Harry and Hermione developed a ginger fetish, then dropped a deux ex machina in the form of the Deathly Hallows in an attempt to fix her mistake, and even THEN she still couldn't have Harry fire a lethal spell at the man that had brutally murdered his entire family/pseudo-family. I think the only reason I read HP fanfiction is to try and bleach my brain of how genuinely cowardly and unfeeling canon-Harry is.

**** Harry does fight back: the duel in the graveyard, the fight at the Ministry, and the quest for the Horcruxes are three good examples of many. I'll agree that he likely doesn't drive enough of the plot events with his own choices, but he's a kid for most of the books. With his childhood, it's a wonder that he turned out as well as he did. I understand some of your frustration, but not all of it. Harry Potter wouldn't have the popularity it does with a terrible protagonist.

And “unfeeling” really doesn't make sense. Just look at the graveyard duel, or the fifth book, or Harry's frustrations with Dumbledore in the seventh, or how much he cares about everyone who's fighting in the last battle. I really don't understand your problem with this part of his character.

** I suppose it depends on what fanfic I'm comparing it to.

If its the 99% of fanfics out there where Harry is one-dimensional character; good at everything he does, going around giving verbal smackdowns to everyone, Lord Hadrian of Too-Many-Houses, then quite frankly the books feel like I've finally reached the promised land after wading through the muck.

There is that 1% however that I think I probably enjoy more then the books. All the characters have great development, and have their strengths and flaws; both "good" and "bad" guys alike. Fantastic world building. Etc.

** I can still separate them quite easy even though I've never officially completed the whole series whether it be books or movies. I do know a lot of things that happened during the timeline for the last 3. But I do prefer fanfiction in most cases because they have more world building throughout the series and they make Harry more relatable by making him an actual teenage boy dealing with hormones and stuff like that. I get that it was geared towards kids but kids grow up too. Growing up I had plenty of guy friends and they were gross sometimes, would it have killed her to create that in some aspect. Teenagers are gross and inappropriate sometimes, it being in the 90s doesn't change that in the slightest.

** Short answer, no.

Longer answer, I do find it harder to read the books than I did initially though it's no fault of fanfiction. While I do have fanfics I prefer to canon (apparently a rarity here), really the issue is that I've learned more about world building, character development, and story telling. This combined with other things I've learned makes it so I do have more issues (I already had some in my initial read through) now and some of them do genuinely really bother me. My biggest issues are really with her Character development, and how she treats abuse (her inability to have a backstory that actually does characters justice(only Snape comes out a better character from backstories), literally everything about Voldemort, how Harry's abuse seemed closer to flavour than an actual thing). I will acknowledge she's very good at surface world building which is why there is so much fanfiction. All that being said, this problem isn't exclusive to Harry Potter for me. Whenever I consume media I have that voice in back of my mind analyzing it and if something weird happens it comes out in force wondering why something was done the way it was.
