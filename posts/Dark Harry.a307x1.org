He's not a Slytherin in this one but only because he specifically asked to not be in Slytherin so that people won't suspect him. He's definitely dark.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

**** I liked that story but for some reason the way they handled the whole Daphne situation where Harry has to be an outcast for stupid reason just bugs me. there seemed to be no reason for subterfuge yet it keep going on and on.

I have not read the last 2 or 3 chapters though

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
