I've been posting a fic on FFN and Ao3 since 03/18, and it has ~1400 views and ~300 hits, respectively. Yesterday I posted this same story on Harry Potter Fanfic Archive, and it already has ~650 reads.

I am a bit surprised by this, and wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this. I don't know HPFFA well, having just discovered the site, and by now I hypothesize that maybe my story is more in line with a particular niche (if such a thing exists on HPFFA), which could explain the numbers.

Thoughts?


** I am a frequent user on the HPFFA site. It mostly has 5-6 updates a week. So everyone who visits the site will definitely see your [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=2079][fic]] on the [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][front page]] with high probability. This is not the case with FFnet or Ao3.

That would answer why you got more views.

** HPFFA has a more active but smaller readerbase - less people use the site but they often end up reading a large proportion of stories due to the higher quality on HPFFA.

Also, HPFFA is a much better platform for smut/NSFW fics (if yours falls under that umbrella).

*** That makes sense. Odd that, I thought that the best platform for smut was Ao3. And my fic doesn't fall in that category.

** Well, there are many other fandoms on AO3, so perhaps a dedicated archive gets faster accumulation of hits.

** I agree with the comment that AO3 contains so many fandoms that HP fics won't receive the degree of readership found on ffn (much larger readership in general than most fanfic platforms). I wasn't familiar with the archive site you mentioned, but a quick scan showed many Harem fics which is a niche that I believe not everyone is into. That said, I checked out your story and I like the premise and plan to read it!

** I think it's odd it trumpets the fact that it accepts all ratings of smut, but forbids works featuring slash.

*** Coupled with their acceptance of femslash, it's not hard to guess why they forbid slash.

** I'm surprised you received so many on FFN. I haven't used that site in like 7 years.

**** Really? Huh. I had thought most of the fanfic readers moved over to archive of our own. Once I tried out that site I couldn't go back to ffn as I much prefer the tagging system on ao3. I find that it's so much easier to get just what you want to read, like ships or themes, and to remove anything you don't want to be bothered with. Maybe it's been too long but I couldn't be able to navigate ffn again I think. The filters were always rather confusing to me.

***** Other way around for me. There's too much tagging abuse on AO3, leading to a lot of mistagged junk. A character mentioned in all of 2 paragraphs (or who hasn't even appeared yet!) is often tagged. Especially in smaller fandoms, there might be one good fic in a page or more of mistagged ones. The relatively restricted character tags on FFN mean authors have to be a bit pickier.

The other part is many authors only publish on FFN, and of course I'll read where the fics are.

****** I agree. I generally like the author recs as the source to most of my reading. So it helps that I am reading from a cultivated list.
