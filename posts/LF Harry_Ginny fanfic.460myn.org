Hey guys I was wondering if you could help me find a fanfiction that focuses on Harry and Ginny as a couple and the advancement of their romance and love. Also I would LOVE it if anyone knows of any that focuses on this topic during the Hogwarts years. Thanks you guys have been awesome about helping and sharing different fanfictions!


** While not a specific recommendation, i hope this helps just as much. There is a site dedicated to harry/ginny stories, siye.co.uk

You can sort stories by many time frames (pre hogwarts, any of the hogwarts years, post hogwarts, etc). So if you want a harry ginny story that starts in 4th year, its easy to find a list of all those that fit the bill on siye.

Good luck searching!

*** Thanks for the plug. The list's a bit outdated now, though. In addition to those stories, I would recommend [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=12686&chapter=all#2][I Need a Hero]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5289764?view_full_work=true][Snow]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1693315/1/The-Garnet-Snitch][The Garnet Snitch]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5888864/1/Praying-to-the-Stars][Praying to the Stars]], [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129073][The Pros and Cons of Living]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/360374][your loss or your arrears]].

I am having tough luck finding good Ginny fics for the past month or so, though. Many of the recent ones have been rather disappointing. Any recs there?

**** I've been enjoying Abraxas by Brennus linkffn(Abraxas) but for some reason I remember you being anti-Brennus. (If it changes anything he's hasn't bashed anyone so far in this story since I know most people who dislike his stories do so for bashing Molly, Ron, or Dumbledore). I keep hoping Failsafe will update but that hasn't happened and most of Pottermum's stuff is pretty good.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

  Ginny's been taken by Voldemort in Harry's sixth year. But is everyone too protective of Harry to let him save her? Some OotP spoilers...in fact, just don't read my stories unless you've read OotP ;-) *Just updated*

** One I highly recommend is *Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), book 6 from Ginny's POV, quite enjoyable and very well written.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

*** Alright thanks for the heads up about that. I think I might try and write my own that would fit the slow progression criteria. Thanks for the suggestion I'll be sure to check it out!
