Now that there's an actual small following for the story, I wouldn't mind punching up the quality of it a bit.

If you're interested in being a beta reader, send me a PM and we'll see what we can do. I'm looking for a grammar checker as well as someone who can keep my pacing and flow in line.

Thanks for the interest!

#+begin_quote
  Set in the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter has a strange awakening after the demonstration of Unforgivable Curses in that fateful Defense Against the Dark Arts class. How different is a Harry Potter with one deviant obsession, a twisted kink? Perhaps not at all, or perhaps incredibly so in the most meaningful of ways. Multiple pairings all centered around Harry, more of a web really.

** I'd be willing to help out. Not sure what exactly you would want, or how much time I could dedicate to it with classes and all.

Word of warning I'm not the best at grammar and spelling. But I try my best.
