I swear if I read one more "adult" in HPFF bitch about Harry/Hermione/whomever wanting to read/study/better themselves during holiday I'm going to set something on fire. Is it a rule somewhere this bullshit has to be in EVERY story?

- Harry - I'm going to spend some time reading today, I want to learn <something>
- Adult - It's HOLIDAY! YOU HAVE TO HAVE FUN! NO READING OR LEARNING OMG!!

Maybe the most annoying thing from cannon was that other than Hermione everyone was an incredibly lazy fucker. Like the entire series. And not just during breaks, but school also. 24 hours a day for 10 months a year immersed in magic and they spent all of it jerking the pickle. The entire point of FanFic is to explore what would happen if things were different, yet the entire adult world is determined to be dicks about kids learning? Infuriating.

/endrant Thanks for listening.


** Ok Hermione. Settle down.

Maybe don't read Indy Harry trash

** It would be interesting if this happened but wasn't depicted in a positive light.

Like, yes, Hermione is a bookworm. But her parents are the sort of people for whom reading for leisure is an alien concept. They haven't cracked open a book since their school reading list decades ago and were always baffled by Hermione's proclivities and constantly telling her to "put down the books and go have fun".

** Regarding the summer thing perhaps bc I've read a few fics where Sirius or Remus rescues Harry from the Dursleys thejust want Harry to enjoy being a kid since he never did.

I do agree it's annoying how everyone but Hermione is capable.

** I can understand that characterisation. It's a fact that most children (and to be honest, probably most adults) spend their free time having fun instead of studying or self-improvement.

It's simply not realistic to have every character finish lessons and then start saying "right, now I'm going to finish all my homework immediately, work on my physical fitness, learn complicated obscure branches of magic that is not a specific requirement, meditate, learn a new language, and if there's time I'll work on that Renaissance watercolor I've been painting."

People simply aren't like that. There's the occasional overachiever like Hermione, but to most, they'd rather have fun.
