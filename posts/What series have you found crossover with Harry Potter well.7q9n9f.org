** Anything without fantasy or magic elements set in the time period you want to write as they can easily exist alongside it. You don't have to worry about the different rules of magic clashing. Also, Buffy, they are the same age and the idea of the Watcher's Council dealing with the Ministry of Magic amuses me.

*** I'd say GoT is a bad choice. I've read a few and it is either Rhaegar wank or magic is ridiculously weak. Fiendfyre alone would make Aegon I look like an amateur. Apparation, the Imperius curse, Veritaserum and unbreakable charms would be totally overpowered.

I'd love to read a crackfic where Harry is living the good life at Robert's court. "What, you want to throw an orgy with 100 whores? Let me get the Philosopher's stone and count me in."

Or alternatively, a fic where Bella goes full Dark Witch and just takes over Westeros before smacking the Night King hard enough that it'll never be winter again.

** I think the DC or Marvel universe works rather well, because they already have wizards and witches in them with various kinds of magic and HP would fit in as just another way of doing magic. Stargate can also work really well, but I don´t like it when the magic is explained as some Ancient thing. Mass effect can be interesting if you go full AU and have the statute of secrecy repealed for decades, maybe throw in magical alien societies. I already mentioned Marvel, but having Deadpool in a story is a great recipe for a crack fic. Star Wars can be integrated rather easily, if you just have the Empire or Rebels find Earth. If you just use the setting, without the main characters, Cowboy Bebop could also work, maybe you could throw Ed and Ein in it. FMA could be interesting, but you have to throw in dimensional travel for it to work, because Amestris existing in the real world is dumb. Torchwood can work, Dr. Who probably, Sherlock Holmes also.

** Honestly, not many. The problem is that the HP magic system is too OP for most crossovers to be truly compatible. However, if you're willing to do a fusion rather than a crossover (where you change the rules of both worlds to fit into a single system) then Buffy is a good match because it contains many mystical elements which are a thematic match for Harry Potter. It's just that without major adjustments they're not a functional match.

Let's see - linkffn(Reunited by mrsprobie) had like three chapters, but it's a slow exploration of the way Reid and Hermione could have met and developed a relationship. First chapter was written in 2011, but I've recently started updating again.

Some cute short ones: linkffn(Tiptoe That Little Line by mrsprobie) is a Hermione/Rossi two-shot I wrote when I first realized older men are hot.

Linkffn(The Game by mrsprobie) is ~700 words of Reid/Hermione office fluff. I went through a drabble phase and that happened.

I've also started a multi-chap in which Hotch is Hermione's uncle and the war goes slightly differently, but it's lost steam for a while now. I may update eventually, but Reunited is top priority right now. linkffn(On the Meaning of Family by mrsprobie)

** This one is a crossover series with the MCU' verse where the story is centered around Luna Lovegood. The series is extremely underrated. I just needed to at least attempt to spread it considering I absolutely adore the writing. It's like looking at a painting except with words.

The Under the Moon series starts off with a chronological series of one shots or two shots that eventually turns into a multi chaptered fic. This series is written by MerciaLachesis or on Ao3, Mercia. Here are the links to both sites. (I suggest reading this series on Ao3 so it's easier to keep track of what book you're one, but FFN works as well.)

** Hetalia works extremely well... specially if you use just arthur or a small amount of the countries. Is easy to mix the whole magical side of each character with HP Universe and it´s always interesting to think of almost immortal beings knowing old magic and remembering old events

** I think "The Mists of Avalon - Marion Zimmer Bradley" can be quite mixed, if you connect in some way this version of the Arthurian cycle with Harry Potter. I don't know if Marion Zimmer Bradley has explicitly forbidden the production of fan fiction based on her works.

** Even with the "The Gifted" series or in any case the X-Men in general, if in place of the mutants you put the magicians and the magic. The same xenophobic panorama can be reproduced in a world where the security status has completely fallen. (that's the name of the statute that hides the magical world? I have a lapsus) The order of the Phoenix can take on the role of the X-men, while the Death Eaters can assume the role of the Brotherhood. In this view, the Purifiers would not be stoned in a modern version of the witch hunt. And choose whether to leave the magic as such or give it a more scientific impression, a bit like what Lucas did in Star Wars with the Midi-chlorians and the Force in the prequel trilogy.

** What the others have said before is true. Shows or books that already have magical elements in them tend to have a better time "fitting into" the HP Universe. I've read some done with The Addams Family, Card Captor Sakura and XXXHolic.

One universe where I've read a few interesting stories is that of Sherlock Holmes. The connection lies in Mycroft Holmes being the "British Government" so he knows about the Wizarding World.

** Worst Witch is a really good crossover source; Cackle's Academy and its staff and students could fit pretty painlessly into the HP world; even the lack of wands in the WW universe can be explained away by the people at Cackle's just following a different school of magic (like how the students of Uagadu use gestures instead of wands).

Unfortunately there aren't many good Harry Potter/Worst Witch fics out there. I'm still hoping for that really good one, that isn't just an excuse to pair up Snape and Miss Hardbroom.
