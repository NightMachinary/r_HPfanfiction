So from time to time, I read the summary of a fem!Harry fic, and for some reason the get those ugly ass names all the time, so with that in mind what are the fem!Harry names that make you cringe? and what are the ones you like?

​

These are mine

Best ones: Iris (my favorite, for some reason, every time I imagine a fem!Harry is always an Iris), Rose

Worst ones: Calla, Harriet, Herakles (like yeah that's a thing... WTF... Why? I don't even remember the fic, I only remember not reading it because every time I read the name it made me cringe), Hella


** I like Rose and Holly, Iris is not that bad, true, I have personally nothing against Harriet, but on the low end of the scale nothing, I really believe nothing, can beat Brogan Snape in terms of ugliness. What in the world was the author thinking!

** My answer will always be Holly Potter.

It's close enough to Harry to remain familiar, as well as the connection to her wand. It sticks with the fanon Evans-Girls-Plants-Names thing. Finally, it was also fairly common the year Harry was born, so you can still work with Petunia's "nasty common name" thing.

I wouldn't mind Holly, Lily or Rose either I guess but anything else along those lines seems too unusual to fit with the themes of canon.

** I'm surprised at how unpopular Harriet is! It's not a name I like on its own, but it's one of my faves to read. It makes sense to me as the feminine version of "Harry," and it means the author can continue to use "Harry" as a nickname throughout the fic, which helps a lot with confusion.

I always get lost reading updates to a half-remembered fic if the name is something ridiculous---is "Rose" meant to be fem!Harry or Rose Weasley? Or some OC?

I also (personally) feel like a lot of flower names veer sharply into Mary Sue territory. To me, a solid name like Harriet means the author isn't getting distracted by how shiny and beautiful her fem!Harry is and is more interested in the plot.

A what-if where Harry was raised differently also doesn't necessarily makes him into OC. I can easily imagine fem!Harry having the same experience with the Dursleys and doing the same things as canon Harry.

***** If you don't consider your sexuality (no matter in which of the XYZ directions you lean) as a part of your identity and an integral part of your personality... Then you are pretty damm weird. But let me break it down for you.

A fem Harry would have probably been treated at least a little different by the Dursley, the perceived vulnerability of a female would probably have invited either some sympathy or even worse abuse

A female is viewed differently from the outside, the treatment of your surroundings affect how you develop so we can at least elucubrate that a fem Harry will have a different social behavior due to this

A fem Harry would have a totally different set of hormones influencing her growth, which leads to different strengths, weaknesses, and behaviors

A female Harry would have shared a dorm with the girl's side of Griffindor (If she goes to Gryffindor at all) and they would have been a different influence compared to the boys

These are just some of the points, you could make an entire book about the reasons as to why a fem!Harry SHOULD always be an OC but I think I made my point

I'm not a big fan of names that don't sound like Harry at all because then it mostly feels like an OC and not like fem Harry. When I read Iris Potter I don't think of fem Harry but of Harrys OC sister.

Honestly, if there is a fem Harry fic with a name that doesn't start with an H most of the time I won't even bother to read it.
