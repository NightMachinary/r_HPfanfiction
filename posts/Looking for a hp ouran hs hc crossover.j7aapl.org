:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a harry potter ouran highschool host club fanfiction I read a few years ago, can't find it.

It's a harry moves to Japan. Don't remember much about it, but later in the fic Hermione, Ron, Luna and Neville comes to be with him, also Hermione is missing an arm.


** Oh my god I'm looking for that one too! Wanted to give it a re-read and now can't find a trace of it anywhere! It's the one where Harry eventually sets up home with his friends and Mori has a crush on him, right? And then things happen (can't exactly recall what) and Harry and Co. become bodyguards of sorts for the Host Club. Think Hedwig was also still alive?

â€‹

Seriously, if ANYBODY knows where to find this fic PLEASE tell us! It was good and, even if it's been discontinued I would still like to re-read what's available.

** I don't have the one you're looking for but I thought I would recommend this one to you and anyone else interested here because it's not a super common crossover. Anyways overall a very unique fanfic. Snape is Harry's guardian---not a super big role. He forced Harry to go to Ouran because he's an international delinquent. Ends up with him dating Honey. I found it very amusing when I first found it so I thought I would share it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742721/chapters/1383336][here.]]
