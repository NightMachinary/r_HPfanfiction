Preferably 30ish chapters on ffn as that's the only app that works on my phone. I can't seem to get on with Ao3.

I never see drarry on this sub I wonder why that is?


** Your best bet for slash is to go over to the slash sub. Its called HPSlashFic, it should be mentioned at the side with other similar subs.

People here tend not to like slash, hence you not seeing much drarry or any slash on this sub.

** To use ao3 on my phone I do the following:

1. ao3 story page --> top right --> download --> epub
2. Open the epub in Play Books
3. After it uploads, you can then read the fic in Play Books

If you use kindle this will work as well, although kindle uses .mobi rather than .epub

** Linkffn(5961543) has a sub!Draco in it. I read most of it and it was okay, but I'm not the biggest fan of Drarry or Ginny bashing so it's probably much better than I think.
