They didn't have spells cast on them, they just took on the most prevalent aspects of the magic within. Thus a book on blood magic would either drip blood or seek your blood. The book of monsters becomes a monster itself. A book on spirits wails. And so on. Books with a less specialized view, like a textbook that flits across many types of magic, don't take on as much and thus are more booky than magicky. Thoughts?


** And now i cant help imagening a "dark" book about gaining followers getting loose and starting to convert other books to its cause.. xD

"Harry wasn't really sure why he felt drawn to the Library tonight, maybe he was just restless, maybe his subconscious wanted him to study in the middle of the night? Well, now he was here, the restricted section was just around the corner and he could get to study all the.. what in the name of merlin? Arrayed in a half circle around a big black and silver book was a scary amount of 'Monster Book of Monsters' it even looked like there was a divination text in the mix!

Ohh.. the book in the center growled at the others.. and now they looked in his direction.. perhaps he should run? Yup, running seemed like a grand idea!"

** That's a pretty clever idea. I think it's a little too abstract, too Pratchett-ish, to fit in the /Harry Potter/ universe wholesale... but with a little bit of tweaking it /could/ work.

*** But abstract, Pratchett-ish ideas work great in Harry Potter. The reality of HP magic is very Discworldy.

**** Not /quite/ to this extent, I think. There's symbolism in Potions ingredient and so on, but books /spontaneously/ taking on characteristics of their subject matter, with no additional spell cast upon them, seems a little too surreal.

Now if we assume that it's just the Hogwarts Library that is like that, we can talk. But while magic does a lot of wacky things, it rarely does so unprovoked, so to speak, as it would in /Discworld/; someone (or something) has to cast/release the magic to begin with. The universe doesn't /naturally/ start doing things like that. Enchant a Ford Anglia and release it into the Forbidden Forest, it /will/ turn into an animal with its own, independant will; but painting the Ford Anglia and pretending really hard that it's an animal before dropping it off in any old forest won't do the trick. And you could say, "but those are magic books!", yes, but name one time writing down magic had any inherently magical effect in the series?

***** But why would a book manufacturer think a book that will attack the buyer is a good idea? Or an invisible book on Invisibility?

****** Because wizards. All the power of the cosmos at their command, with not enough common sense to use it in an at all rational fashion. Someone thought that would be an interesting novelty, and with magic it was cheap enough to produce the stupid thing.

In the /Monster Book/'s case, for instance, if Hagrid thought it was a neat idea, then I'm perfectly willing to believe that so did whatever professional monster-tamer wrote it in the first place.

***** Well, I don't think that trivial things like the textbooks in the Monstrous Books of Monsters, etc. are weird because of something like that. But I wouldn't put the event itself out of the realm of possibility. Enchanted stuff can get sentience or start doing weird things with time. I suspect that tomes that hold great magical knowledge can become magical with time.

****** And you see, this is where we disagree. I do think enchanted items can evolve over time, and even gain sentience, as seen with the Ford Anglia among others. But I do not think that merely having magical knowledge written down on them makes things magical to any extent in the /Harry Potter/ universe.

********** I can't well force you to keep talking if you say so, but while what you say /sounds/ reasonable, I really think that whether magic is concept-based or only concept-shaped is irrelevant to my point, which is that never in canon does simply carrying passive magic knowledge make something magical. (To my knowledge.)

** That's a neat idea. I like it.

It reminded me of an movie I've seen once: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pagemaster#Plot][The Pagemaster]]. There the books also share the characteristics of their content.

** Who said no spells were cast on it? Nowhere (or I missed it) was it said anything about the way they were made so maybe there were actually spelled as a joke or something from the author just for the lol. And if you think it's too many books for one person, nothing says he has to do it alone. They surely have publishers with witches ans wizards enchanting the books following maybe some author's notes.

In fact even if not really explored in cannon I'm pretty sure there must be quite a bit of enchanters around for all the magical objects they have (for example the brooms) or maybe just to make objects (furniture) more resistant or something (like can't get easily burnt, broken or dirty).

** If I remember correctly, somewhere in canon there is a joke about misplacing invisible books about invisibility. Probably in PoA, when they buy the monster book of monsters
