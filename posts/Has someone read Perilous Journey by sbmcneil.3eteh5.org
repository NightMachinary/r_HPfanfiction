** I recognize the author's name and the title but don't remember anything of the story itself. That's probably a bad sign as I most likely passed. I looked through the other stories and didn't recognize them and I usually read all the works of good authors.

** I haven't read this one, but most of this author's works are bland and mediocre. There are far better Harry/Ginny stories out there.

** I've read it and I love it! It's not the best fic I've ever read, but it's solid nonetheless. I hope we get to see the rest of the story soon, because it's at a promising point at the moment.
