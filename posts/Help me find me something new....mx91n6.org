So I've read a lot of fanfiction over the years... I have my favorites and ones that I start and lose interest in about halfway through. Needless to say I'm having a hard time finding anything new and well written. I have a few stipulations:

-Absolutely no Ron/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Draco/Hermione, or Draco/Harry please. -It has to be rated Mature or above. -Idon't mind slash, but please see above and don't offer Remus/Sirius. -No femslash.

My favorite ships: -Hermione/Harry -Hermione/any Maurader that's not Peter -Hermione/Severus -Hermione/any Weasley that's not Ron, Molly, or Ginny -Harry/Luna -Harry/Daphne -Harry/Fleur

-I like longer fics so preferably 100k or longer and if possible something completed or regularly updated.

-I LOVE SIs, fix-it, and time travel fics. I'm a trope whore sorry.

-I tend to stick with Ao3 and ff(dot)net but I'm willing to go to other sites simply bc I don't what those other sites are.

PLEASE HELP!!!!


** A little self promo ðŸ¤­ If you don't mind Harry/Multi, then you might give this one a go. It is completely unique, I've never found anything else like it. I had been looking for a fic like this, but since I couldn't find any, I wrote one, myself.

Now, I'm just going to tell you about the most common criticism; Harry's reluctance to kill his enemies. It features Harry as a vigilante, but if you go into it, thinking he's going to be killing Death Eaters left and right immediately, you'll be disappointed.

I based my hero! Harry on Peter Parker and Clark Kent, so him going on a killing spree makes no sense. He does get over himself, becomes more ruthless, and evolves into a kind of mix between Pete, Clark, Bruce Wayne and Oliver Queen.

  A month after Dumbledore's death, Harry is depressed and wallowing in grief at Privet Drive. One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.

** I've recently read linkffn(Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus) and it's probably one of my favorite fics of all time. It has 117 posted chapters and 1M words and it gets another update every Wednesday. It's a great read and helped me get through having Covid.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.

** If you don't mind Hermione/Regulus i suggest reading this fanfiction.

There is background Harry/Ginny though so I apologise but you can ignore it since it's not the main ship

  Regulus flexed his feet, feeling the bite of his newish shoes and shaking his head. It was a bit of maudlin folly to be dressed as he was, in his best robes, his hair arranged just so. He doubted he would remain in such pristine condition by the end of the evening. More so, he doubted anyone would understand the significance even if he was found.

** So one of my all time favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) I highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

ttps://archiveofourown.org/works/25836640 This one is called "Of Gods and Men" and it's a Sirius/Harry fic In the future a disease called "magical consumption" devours wizards and witches, stealing their magic. And somehow the power get's tranfered to Harry, who tried to kill himself the release it but it doesn't work. So he intends to travel back in tim to let himself being killed by Voldemort during the battle, but somehow he ends up in the marauders era where he is forced to pretend to be a student. MoD Harry. Very good engaging story

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]]) Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil. Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus I highly rec it as I think you will enjoy this though I'm not quite sure if it's rated M

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521]]) Step back in time. This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]]) Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends up working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic! Highly rec

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]])

When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  HP/LV Slow Burn. Major AU. Orphaned and having no tolerance for Muggles, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by both the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. His loyalty, however, is not to the Ministry nor to the Death Eaters, but to the cause of bettering himself and becoming his own force in the Wizarding world. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
