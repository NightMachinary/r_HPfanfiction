Fics like "Growing Up Black," "A Necessary Gift," or "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" have quickly become my favorites and so I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions for fics that center on Harry being adopted/raised by a pureblood family with a storyline dealing with pureblood supremacy, politics, and etiquette.

Thanks!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth.

*** I really hope this gets updated still, I really enjoyed it. From the prologue it seemed like the author had a plan of where to go with it.

** linkffn(sleeper) is a Hermione centric fic where she is a "sleeper cell" within the Pureblood world. Finished it last night and loved it.

Edit: Sorry, i didn't read the end of your request - i got so excited to recommend this one that I didn't realise it was a Harry-centric fic you were looking for! My apologies... Still a good fic if you want to read it :)

It also has a counterpart set between HBP and DH that touches on pureblood courtship and the Black family's customs: Marked linkao3(6472354)
