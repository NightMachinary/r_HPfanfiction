Hey all! I was in a Theo/Mione mood and I went to look for Colubrina's amazing half a sorrow, but I couldn't find it :( Anybody have a link or save a copy?


** Have you tried the wayback machine? [[https://archive.org/web/]]

I don't have the particular fic you're looking for, but I've had success finding archived copies of deleted fics online.

** The fic was taken down due to personal reasons, I believe. You could ask her about it on her tumblr (@colubrina) and see if there's any way for you to finish the story. I'm very sad to see it go as well, since it was one of my favorites, but I respect her decision. It couldn't have been easy to make.

I'm sorry you didn't get to finish it.
