:END:
I remember reading this fic years ago but I can't find it for the life of me. I think it was supposed to be a crack fic. The students in the house were actually very smart and set up a secret organization to take down Voldemort and none of the other students or teachers knew except maybe McGonagall. The older students would mentor the younger ones. Percy was eventually obliviated so he wouldn't be able to reveal anything about Gryffindor when he joined the ministry. I read it on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] a long time ago and it might have been taken down but if anyone remembers it let me know.
