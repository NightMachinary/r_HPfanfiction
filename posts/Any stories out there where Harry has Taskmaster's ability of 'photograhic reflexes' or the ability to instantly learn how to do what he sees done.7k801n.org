** There's probably a bunch of Naruto crossovers where Harry has a Sharingan which does basically what you're asking for. I don't know if Naruto is your cup of tea though

**** This is one of those stories where Harry is super smart and super strong and super mature for his age. Eventually, he will have underage sex with a person or multiple persons and blah blah blah. I've seen this shit too many times to know the hints practically thrown in my face.

** I read a WIP fic where he can copy auras/abilities (dementor, werewolf, vampire) is that what you're were looking for? I am not sure if this fits your criteria though.

*** It might be interesting. I was thinking "harry watched remus demonstrate the wand movements. His subsequent cast attempt was flawless, his intonation perfect. But still no patronus. Even with his photographic reflexes, the magic didn't just flow. He knew it would take time." Link?
