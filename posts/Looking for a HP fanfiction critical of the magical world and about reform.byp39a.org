So basically anything that points out flaws of the society or schooling or understanding of magic thats not in the books.

So if you are talking about say bigotry against muggleborns the fic should talk about things that canon didnt talk about alot but could be interred or implied to exist from canon. Like muggleborns probably faced more bigotry in the past than they do in Harrys time in day to day life not just in death eater attack. So a fic where thats a major thing and a major focus is on how things improved like the main plot is that.

Or say problems with the schooling system that you can see in the books even if they weren't called out, Or ovbious bigotry towards magical creatures. Thats also great. But not something that makes no sense in the book canon. Those are just examples that come to mind. Fics about reforms on other aspects are fine too.

I don't care what the main ship is or the mc is for the most part. It can be m/m m/f f/f whatever I dont care. But it can't be relationship focused has to be plot focused romance if it exists has to be a side thing ( doesn't even have to have romance).

I would prefer one where Hermione isn't the MC because I've been reading alot with her as MC and would like to change it up. But if its perfect for a story like this and shes the MC I'll be fine with that too.

AUs are fine as long as the canon world is intact.


** A Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali

It not only covers the backwardsness of certain magical customs, it also addresses the iffy morality of magic itself (such as legilimancy and veritaserum) all while respecting 'magical culture' as a valid concept.

** Most of Starfox5's fics have the backwards government as a huge problem.

Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5) is pretty good political fic about peaceful reform.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) is about slightly less peaceful reform.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is about "let's plot to blow up the government" type of reform.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) is about reform in a dictatorship.

Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) is about reform in a society where pureblood traditions are turned up to 11.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) is about trying to reform, realizing that it's impossible as long as the rich pureblood elite holds all the power and wealth, and then robbing them.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** a lot of Colubrina's works include this! among her other works, i recommend:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10654712/1/Lady-of-the-Lake][Lady of the Lake]], a post-canon fic where Hermione fools a bunch of ex-Slytherins into thinking she's pureblooded and slowly takes over the world. super manipulative Hermione, well-developed canon Slytherin characters, Dramione, lots of Weasley bashing. heavy TWs for torture, miscarriage, trauma, and past abuse.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13116020/1/But-the-Darkness-Alters][But The Darkness Alters]], a post-war consequences fic in alternating viewpoints. eventual Neville/Theodore Nott and Dramione. not yet complete, but updates are regular.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11439594/1/Rebuilding][Rebuilding]]- after the war, Hermione goes back to Hogwarts to help fix the castle. Dramione. not nearly as dark as the above ones, but there's some stuff about mental illness and trauma. there's some mild bashing of Molly Weasley, but it's done quite well and is resolved; she's forgiven by the end of the fic. this fic is very long- 300 chapters- but the chapters aren't super long, and the writing is amazing. it is quite romance-driven, but the romance plays into the plot.

other authors:

- The Arithmancer series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]], starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]]. the basic premise is that, instead of a bookworm, Hermione grew up to be a math nerd and asked to test into Arithmancy her first year of Hogwarts. it is more AU than that, though, and the characters grow and change in ways not just influenced by Hermione's changes. eventual super!Hermione, lots of cool things about magic, politics. not a ton of what you're asking for in the first few chapters, but it's there.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]. this fic is rec'd a lot on here. premise: the Avada Kedavra struck Harry's eyes, not his forehead, leaving him blind. he's also a genius. he doesn't go to Hogwarts, because the magical world doesn't know how to deal with disability. Hermione, after the troll attack, leaves Hogwarts. they become friends and venture into academia, making a lot of important discoveries and whatnot. some of their level of success is unrealistic, but it's got what you're looking for and it's a fun read in general.
- the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/970896][huddled masses yearning to break free]] series. Muggle Britain in the 80s was not a good place for people of color; Harry and Hermione are both deported as children. at Hogwarts, they're both Sorted into Slytherin.
- the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/675791][Trinkets 'Verse]] series, in which it's now possible to quantifiably measure someone's magical ability and prove that magic does not equal blood. more of a friendship fic than anything else.

** Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18720031/chapters/44400358][*https://archiveofourown.org/works/18720031/chapters/44400358*]]

In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy.

​

Since I am a Swedish person I thought it would be fun to write a story that Swedish wizards and witches could attend and in canon that would be Durmstrang. This story will follows the current canon very closely and incorporates features from both books, movies, Pottermore and stageplays.
