Hey friends!

As the title says I am looking for Sirius' POV of at least Prisoner of Azkaban. I am open to if it starts before and includes after, I just think that would be an interesting read for that time period. Thanks in advance!!

P.S. I am a Lily/James addict, so if you have a good recommendation let me know! I may have read it though.


** This is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940338][Padfoot's Tale]] exactly. Only non- canon thing is that it's Remus/Sirius and even that could be canon. There's a sequel that's POA from Remus's POV that I loved too. Linkao3(940338)

  1981-94: From the unbearable torments of Azkaban to a life on the run, Sirius has known little peace in twelve years. But when he comes to Hogwarts looking for Harry and Peter, he finds Remus, the man who could break his heart or save his life. A retelling of Prisoner of Azkaban from Sirius's point of view. Heavy in Marauders-era and First Wizarding War flashbacks.Warning: This story has not been edited yet, and may contain unintended problematic elements and tropes.

** Looks like I may just need to write this myself if no one knows of any stories such as these. It seems like this could be compelling to explore Sirius' feelings about approaching Harry and Remus. As well as tracking Peter back down.

** I think I might have read something about this once. I didn't add it to my favourites so I guess I didn't love it, but I probably reviewed it so I might be able to find it again.

Adult, post-Azkaban Sirius is absolutely my favourite character and the only one I was ever really driven to write about, but my headcanon for him is so fixed that even when I was actively writing, I couldn't have handled writing this particular period. I tend to think that his state of mind would have been so unstable that any story would end up as an unreadably rambling angsty stream-of-consciousness. That said, he/Padfoot must have had a lot of adventures on his way back from wherever he came ashore (is that in canon? Peterhead maybe?) down to Little Whinging, so yes, I think that is definitely worth writing and it is something I would read.

Edit: this is the one I was thinking of and it seems to be just a first chapter so is probably not what you are looking for, but anyway [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11210889/1/Escape-from-Azkaban]]

And this is very good [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10066753/1/]] Starfishstar has several stories set in this period but they are mostly Remus-centric.
