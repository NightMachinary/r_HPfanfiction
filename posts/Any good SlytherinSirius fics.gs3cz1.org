** Depends on whether you mean Sirius in Slytherin, or Sirius acting like a Slytherin. For the later I recommend Siriusly Senor Firsty and it's sequel Siriusly Silly Plan. Both can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/161/Odd-Ideas][here]] as part of Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas.

Sirius finds himself back at 11 and set's out to fix the future... and prank everyone.

** There's a tag for this on AO3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Slytherin%20Sirius%20Black]]

One of the best things about this is the use of knowledge management and controlled vocabulary to combine like tags in the freeform category ([[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query%5Bname%5D=slytherin+sirius&query%5Btype%5D=Freeform]]) into a single preferred term "Slytherin Sirius Black".

Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations because I can't say I've read any in this category, although I am interested in different Sortings from canon.

** Touch of Grey: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22408996/chapters/53539420]]

A grownup Harry Potter falls into an alternate universe. He helps Dumbledore defeat Voldemort, and finds himself teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts to his parents and a Slytherin Sirius Black, whose magic strangely seems suited to his own.

Getting through the year may prove tougher than defeating the Dark Lord.
