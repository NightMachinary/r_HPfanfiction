I've read some amazing fics that have pretty much replaced canon for me, i'm rereading the series to kind of remind me of what the canon actually it - and its feeling pretty difficult.

*** For me, it was not so much a single fic as the accumulation of a bunch of issues which fanfics address. In canon, nothing is done about the Death Eaters after the war. In canon, there is no consequence from the Dursley abuse. In canon, the only relationship with no issue is Cho/Cedric because Rowling is not good at writing them and quite a few suffered from plot demands. On a similar note, in canon all "good" adults are useless at best and dangerously stupid at worst because the plot demands them to be. And canon is Dumbledore wank despite his action.

**** Never liked any fics with any of those tropes except the trials for death eaters after the war. I wouldn't want adults taking care of Harry all the time and shielding him from danger. His dangerous adventures are the reason I read the books. Too much babysitting by adults destroys the scrappy teenager vs larger than life villain dynamic.

They can still happen. After all, just because he has some emotional support and an adoptive family, that won't mean that Voldemort won't take over. And Voldemort is certainly dangerous enough that adults can't shield Harry from everything.

We don't know that. We see about 4 hours after Voldemort's death, then we see about half an hour 19 years later, where they don't talk about the war. The closest thing is that Draco is free, which is only a little sus.

Malfoy was not a child. He was way past the age of criminal responsibility and the UK has special laws so that you can tie teenagers as adults for crimes such as murder (or attempted murder). If he was 6, that would have been a valid defence. But not at 17.

********** except thats not fucking true you lying prick use of child soldiers have a very clearly defined status as a war crime for the recruiters.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_and_reintegration_of_child_soldiers]]

the paris principles covers the reintegration of child soldiers and to have them not be regarded as the perpetrators of war crimes.

this big attempt to circumvent that would go as follows as pasted directly out of the wiki.

In the wake of the Sierra Leone Civil War, the UN mandated the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) to try former combatants aged 15 and older for breaches of humanitarian law, including war crimes. However, the Paris Principles state that children who participate in armed conflict should be regarded first as victims, even if they may also be perpetrators:

... [those] who are accused of crimes under international law allegedly committed while they were associated with armed forces or armed groups should be considered primarily as victims of offenses against international law; not only as perpetrators. They must be treated by international law in a framework of restorative justice and social rehabilitation, consistent with international law which offers children special protection through numerous agreements and principles.[81]

This principle was reflected in the Court's statute, which did not rule out prosecution but emphasised the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former child soldiers. David Crane, the first Chief Prosecutor of the Sierra Leone tribunal, interpreted the statute in favour of prosecuting those who had recruited children, rather than the children themselves, no matter how heinous the crimes they had committed.[80]

jesus dude, their kids man. im sorry draco wasn't beaten to death for your amusement, his life and the lives of his parents being threatened would have given him pretty clear mitigating factors as well in just a normal court.

*********** The first ten or so treaties on the laws of warfare had no provisions for child soldiers because it was pretty common for teenagers to flock to the colours without coercion and they were held responsible just like an adult, not that they committed many crimes in the first place. And Malfoy was not ordered to commit most of his war crimes (assassination of a leader outside of a battlefield being the only one I can think of), he came up with those plans on his own.

Funnily enough you mention pressing child soldiers, that's what Malfoy did to Katie Bell.

Edit: Mitigating factors only apply if the threatened offence is worse than the committed. It is therefore not a valid defence for charges of attempted murder since there isn't something worse than death when it comes to threats. That kind of ruling is pretty common with gang related violence.

*** THE game changing fic for me is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1637290][evitative]] and the authors making it a 3 part series, she's writing the second currently. Harry is resorted into Slytherin but it doesn't follow the classic tropes or cliches of slytherin!harry.

**** Read this recently, and I can respect that it's competently written and /radically/ better than 99% of Slytherin Harry stories out there. But I didn't like it and don't care to read any follow-ups.

I just couldn't get over my disbelief that the 5th year Slytherins would so sharply and immediately turn around and be inclusive and respectful of Harry (not using the word "mudblood" in his presence, e.g.). 15 year old kids just aren't that thoughtful and respectful.

That and it almost immediately turns into "Harry Potter but Harry gets this extra super-awesome power!!!" where the power in question is Dark Magic.

Don't get me wrong - it's good, and by the standards of fanfic it's great. But it never clicked with me.

***** THANK YOU!

This has been my major problem with evitative!

Slytherins become even more mary sue than Gryffindor. Even in Gryffindor you have annoying and sometimes mean characters (Lavender, Comrick, etc), but suddenly in evitative, Slytherins are kind and friendly and misunderstood. All they needed was some love and understanding to change them. It's frankly weak writing.

You have the potential for a ton of conflict, and it is just ruined.

Secondly, Sirius as a dark wizard makes no sense as canon. It would have been better and more in character for Sirius to have rejected Dark magic (as he did in canon) and be against Harry's fascination with it. However, as a loving God father, he finds a good mentor for Harry (Andromeda) when he really wants to become one.

The author took the easy way out instead of developing good conflictual issues. She is even more black and white with the Slytherins than Rowling is with the Gryffindors.

******** Agreed, and even worse is the fact that I could /totally/ see the likes of Narcissa and Andromeda being *thrilled* at a "Dark Harry" and then there's finally conflict between Draco/Lucius and Narcissa.

She'd spent all this time coddling her little baby boy, but suddenly her son is failing when it comes to something so much more important that some upstart sociopath Dark Lord - he's neglecting The Dark and choosing the "Dark" Lord just because Potter turns out to be a Dark Wizard.

Where's the year-long tension between Draco and Harry, with Draco getting pushed further and further into self-recrimination and self-doubt until he finally snaps and has to make a choice - Father and Voldemort vs. Mother and Dark Magic (oh and by the way, if he chooses the latter, he'll have to be mature enough to surrender his hatred of Potter).

Where's the low-key "keep it in Slytherin" bullying that Potter has to endure from Nott and Parkinson (or maybe some 6th/7th years), because when Harry tries to talk about it with Ron and Hermione, Ron just acts like it's Harry's fault for being resorted into Slytherin and Hermione just wants to tell a teacher, and when Harry /finally/ talks to Snape about it, Snape laughs at him and asks him if he's too much of a baby to handle his own problems?

I mean fuck it, if we're going to go with "Harry Potter Except Harry has This Super Power" then where's the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome][Crowning Moment of Awesome]] where Harry busts out some fucking /terrifying/ Dark Magic to finally put Nott and Parkinson in their place, and establish himself as the indisputed co-leader of 5th year Slytherin with Draco.

I'm not a huge fan of slash, and I thought the slow-burn Draco/Harry romance was done reasonably well, but the author could've made it SO much better by contextualizing a bunch of other conflicts within that romance. Eventually Draco chooses Mother/The Dark over Father/Voldemort /because/ The Dark includes Harry rather than in spite of it. Eventually Slytherin could come to accept and follow Harry precisely because Harry is a Dark Wizard.

I mean just to take one tiny example - quidditch. Where's the tension between Marcus "I FUCKING WANNA WIN QUIDDITCH AT ANY COST FUCK YOU PUREBLOOD FUCKS I'D PLAY WITH A MERLIN-BE-DAMNED HOUSE ELF IF IT GETS THE W" Flint and the rest of the bigoted team? No, Harry just slides right into the Seeker position (there's not even jealousy from Draco b/c he'd rather be a chaser!!!) and all of Slytherin immediately loves him for winning the match! Where's the beaten-down Harry who has to deal with scorn from his old Gryffindor friends /and/ his new Slytherin teammates because neither one is actually happy with him, and how does he react to or resolve that tension?

Ultimately, Evitative is one of the most disappointing fics I've read because the author does SO MUCH right - they have a mastery of the mechanics of written English and have a ton of fantastic ideas about where to take a Slytherin!Harry story but seem unwilling to commit to building a story that properly builds and resolves the tension that any good narrative needs.

And here ladies and gentlemen, is the voice of tolerance speaking.

Having a differing opinion does not give you and excuse to start name calling and disrespecting someone.

Just because I am straight and don't really want to read about/watch gay couples enjoying themselves does not mean i dislike or am prejudiced against the LGBT(what the hell is the Q?) community. It means I'm straight and don't find reading about/watching that enjoyable.

Also, i understand your community feels under-represented in literature/media but that doesn't mean people who don't want to read about clearly straight characters being made gay are bad/homophobic/evil people.

I'm entitled to my opinion just as you are. MY feelings on the matter are just as relevant as yours. If I can accept this as fact why can't you?

*********** I'm pansexual, but I don't always want to read straight couples. Nor do I always want to read gay couples. I think it's healthy to show a more equal balance of each, regardless of any given author's sexual preference or any reader's sexuality.

I think you're a little biased in saying that the characters are "clearly straight". The obsession Harry has for Draco, and again I'm reinforcing that I don't really like the Drarry ship but I can see where they come from, can very easily be framed in the light of a misinterpreted crush. And if you can ship Hermione x Harry, then Ron x Harry isn't a stretch if you take gender out of the equation.

Being straight and not wanting to read anything other than straight couples /always/ is precisely what it means to be intolerant, even if you don't really realise it. If you can't even deal with it as a side thing, or as a minor romance/soft fluff (I can understand not wanting to read porn, lol), then you're projecting a bias against non-straight relationships onto what you read. I'd rather read Ron x Harry than see a single 'nother Snape x Hermione fanfic, personally.

Also: remarks like "what the hell is the Q?" don't really show you in a good light..? From my perspective, it feels derisive and like you didn't care enough to look it up. For the sake of education: LGBTQ = Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer. Queer's the umbrella term that encompasses everyone else, yeah? All the people who don't want to choose a specific label, who aren't mentioned directly, etc. Could do the longer acronym that goes to LGBTQIA+, which is Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer, Intersex, Asexual.

And I didn't insult the previous poster before; I did, however, go through their post history afterwards and noted that they have an absolutely abhorrent history of racist attacks and general asshattery. So, you know, homophobia is on trend for them.

Being biased in what i enjoy isn't a crime so long as i'm not censoring what others can enjoy. Everyone has their own bias. Yes, Harry's obssesion can be stretched to interest, and if people want to read that more power to them. I didn't specify anyone, but i guess since this is a sub for hp fanfic I wont hold assuming i meant Harry against me.

I think you took what i said wrong..probably because you were looking for "intolerance". I was talking about the erotic stuff. I have read stories labeled as slash. Even if it was the main pairing. And as hypocritical as it is femslash/lesbianism/bisexual females doesn't bother me at all. I find that beautiful(and not just in the erotic sense). Surprise slash(20 chapters in a guy who has been straight and had no homosexual thoughts is suddenly madly in love and making out with another guy type stuff.... if their was no romance before this i'm ok with it) usually makes me drop a story, but that's because i don't like being mislead.

Yeah i admitted in my other reply that was not the best way to word that. And thank you for explaining. I don't get out much and last I payed attention it was just LGBT(which before you make any more assumptions, my niece fits the T and while i will always call her my niece, i do love her to bits and she knows it.). I knew what all of them but the Q stood for.

And to be honest, that IS mostly because I don't care. What you do with your life only effects me when you make it. If you want to live your life in an "alternate" lifestyle(who came up with that term anyway?) then more power to you. Just don't try to force it on me.

When did queer become it's own category? Growing up for me that was a derogatory term for a homosexual. If it doesn't mean homosexual what is it? And if it does isn't it covered already in the LGBT group?

I'm actually getting fed up with the "tolerance or else" attitude people take on this matter. As if your opinion is more valid than mine just because you don't agree with mine. How does me not liking slash stories harm anyone? One less reader/view count? I wasn't the original person you were arguing with, but I felt the need to stand up for their rights to have an opinion. I don't bash, i don't hate, I argue with fellow Christians who try to use their religious beliefs to condemn LGBT people. Is being straight a crime now? Does being turned off by homosexual acts make me evil?

** I find it somewhat annoying, but it is the source material that originated all the fandom I love and also I remember how good the story seemed the first time.

The thing that actually makes it annoying is the contrary to many of my favorite fanfics the cannon focus on the characters interactions almost exclusively, so there is not much on world budding and the whole magical system is used more as something to advance the plot rather than an element of it (It isn't something bad per se, but even though it happens in the magical world it kind of takes some of the magic out of it when you are reading again, you know).

Plus when you re-read any book, even more when it's seven, you will remember the consequences of the characters actions and know beforehand more of the possible resources they could use to solve their problems, so you will naturally point it as plot-holes, the fact that with the fandom we read the plot-holes seen by hundreds or even thousands of other readers and their solutions to it makes us look at what actually happened at cannon and think it silly, kind of like when we remember some story from our childhoods and think about how dumb we used to be, even though at the time everything seemed logical and our actions justified.

Why didn't the Twins ever notice Peter Pettigrew hanging around Percy or especially /Ron/ on the Marauders' Map? And if they did see his name at either point, why didn't they ever ask "Blimey, who's this Peter fellow you're such great friends with? It's a bit strange to be sharing a kip in bed at your age, innit?"

Et cetera, et al, you get the picture. So many things are introduced that would have made earlier plot contrivances actually surmountable rather than simply unwinnable, but having Harry succeed wouldn't have made it easy for him to sacrifice himself our whatever, yeah? The fact that Dumbledore is the one who shares most of the new plot hole excavators is what makes it so easy to look at him as a manipulative dastard.

** I love canon. While I also like fics there is just so much... edgy teenager stuff. And rape-y stuff. After that canon is like a breath of fresh air. It's so much more innocent and nicer. Now don't get me wrong I don't mind sex and/ or violence. But they should be used sparingly and be integrated as much as possible with the plot. Lots of fanfics have sex and violence every other chapter and it just gets old. It loses its shock value. This is why George losing an ear or Molly shouting "Not my daughter, you bitch" has a greater impact in canon than Hermione and Draco getting it on for the third time in two chapters in a fanfic- for example.

Not to mention reading canon brings back childhood memories and the feeling of holding a book is altogether a different one to just staring in a screen. Reading fanfiction brings back memories of... being depressed and trying to fill the void with pointless pastimes.

Also canon was created (or at least published) over the span of 10 years and has gone through professional editing. It's more polished than any fic. And I'm sorry, but as much as I like fanfics they are usually a pastime for people who go to school and/ or work and simply cannot focus on writing all the time.

**** Like others have said, Cursed Child is not a canon book. My definition of the series proper is the 7 books that follow Harry Potter's journey as he comes of age and defeats Voldemort.

And so far, no, I have not come across a fic that can beat out canon. I've been through the favorites of FFN, I've sorted, filtered, and finally scoured through AO3. I've never come across a Harry Potter fanfic that I comes close to canon for me. Everyone's just too busy thinking about how clever they are for finding plot holes, or making their OTP work, or finding reasons to slam characters they hate. Sometimes I'll come across a fic I like. It's intriguing, the characters seem to be within canon range, and the story introduces new elements that fit well within the world; then I get to the end of the chapter and I realize that I'm at the end of what's written and the story hadn't been updated in 2 years..

The original series has just over 1,084,000 words, and it's all wrapped up in a relatively neat, clean cut package. You point out what you feel are flaws, but what about the overwhelming amount of positives for the main series? The sheer amount of intrigue and drama, the feeling of whismicality, the wonder of discovering a magical world, the rich characters with actual depth and realistic development over the course of the series.

People love to point out how broken Quidditch is as a sport, but to me, Harry finally winning the Quidditch Cup with the original Quidditch team is such an emotional high point of the series, and I can't think of a fic that has even attempted to replicate that, much less acknowledge how amazing that moment was. It was just a sportsball game, but it meant everything to that team. They put in so much effort to see it complete, and /finally/, Harry and the team got Oliver Wood his championship.

Nor have I seen a fic manage to match Harry's grief as he rages in Dumbledoe's office after Sirius died. His frustration and anger and hurt. It's a feeling that I know and understand better than when I last read it over 10 years ago.

A lot of fanfics just can't get me emotionally invested into their stories, whereas even after a decade since I last reread any of the original series for the 20th time, just thinking about those scenes invokes exactly how I felt reading the books back then, plus over the years, my own life experience has added even more emotional context to those scenes and other scenes in the book.

The original series is just so emotionally rich. I can't find a fic that matches it.

**** Cursed Child notwithstanding, the HP series as a whole is a proper published work while fanfiction is, well, fanfiction. Let's be honest, if someone has the time and skills to write something novel-quality they wouldn't be using said time and skills to write a fucking fanfiction, and even then it wouldn't have the professional proofreading/editing that a book would get. Don't even get me started on the fact that using a pre-established setting for your work is infinitely easier than working from a blank page (for the people complaining about the world-building and shit being unsatisfying). As a whole I'm not surprised that fanfictions are not as good as the books.

Granted I've haven't read as much fanfictions as some here but I've tried the ones recommended by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] and most of the well-received works on DLP so unless I've missed a looked a looked-over masterpiece I don't know where to 'find some better fics then'.

** Well... The thing is, that fanfictions are generally based on canon, right? That's the basis for it all. Since fanfictions expand on it so much, it's almost like you're narrowing your perceptions of the whole thing by going back and reading canon. It's like something I saw somewhere, Harry is the least observant person you'll ever meet. Since it's mainly from his point of view, there are so many parts of the wizarding world you'll never get to see in canon. In fanfiction however, creators are free to dream up more or less whatever they want. That's what makes it so great. Because of that, canon is just so /bland/. The world-building in some fics is absolutely insane. The fic that really did that for me was /Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches/. The pairings there are slightly icky but really not the focus at all. This fic expands so much on magical concepts and pureblood politics that it's impossible for me to ever look at canon the same way again. It's crazy, almost all of my headcanon comes from that fic.

Edit: I've gone back and reread some canon, and I was genuinely impressed by how /in depth/ it was. Maybe it's been too long since I've read an actual book, but I was really impressed. I learned a whole bunch of new things that I'm sure I glazed over the first time. Sure, fanon can be great and really fun, but looking again, I don't think I've seen anything better than canon. Sure, Harry's not that observant in canon, but he still gets told a /lot/ of stuff by other characters. For example, there was this massive paragraph focusing on how the Ministry organized the Quidditch World Cup. I don't know if it's just me, but I found that fascinating.

** I read book 6 for the first time since I was 11 a few weeks ago and yes, I found it slightly boring. I can reread books countless times, but for some reason whenever I pick up Harry Potter.... it's hard. I think because nothing really actually happens in the books. I mean, they go to class, have a few adventures, but basic philosophies aren't questioned. I can reread Dostoyevsky thousands of times because each time your brain is turned on and you're forced to think. With Harry Potter... well it's, to me, what Martin Scorsese described marvel films: entertainment. And the thing is with pure entertainment is that it's boring when you know what's going to happen. FanFictions often contradict basic plot lines or go out of their way to widen the horizons of the wizarding world, giving more context and depth to magical theory and so on.

** I've never read a single fic that matches up to canon. It's easy to say some fanfics are deeper than canon, but they're already built off canon in the first place. So praising them as better than JKR isn't fair, as they didn't create a million word original series.

Take away what's JKR's in the first place and what do most of these admittedly great fanfics have left? Probably not much. You can't dig a 5 ft hole inside a 10 ft hole and say you dug a 15 ft hole. Similarly, you can't give a built house a new paint and claim credit for building a great house.

It's very easy to take a work that's already been scrutinized by the millions, give your little "fixes," and then pretend it's better than the original. Well, sure, but only because you didn't even do most of the work.

** No. Even the best fanfiction doesn't come close to canon. Let's start with the story you say is better than canon, the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][game changing]]" fic for you.

In Evitative, the first half of the chapter is merely a recap of canon. Why do I need this? If I'm reading fanfic, do I need a reminder of the source material?

Harry is whinier than he is in canon OotP, which is saying something.

He finds a book which talks about Shadow Walking which to use you need to declare yourself to the Dark. New magic isn't necessarily a bad thing, but something called Shadow Walking is a definite red flag.

Even the author acknowledges that Harry should be wary about reading books on Dark Arts, but he isn't. This is the same Harry whose mind jumped to "dark magic" when Hermione asked him what he would think if he suddenly saw a doppelganger of himself walking around.

Every time something intelligent manages to come to the forefront, "something" makes him hesitate to do the smart thing.

Then Sirius tells him the story about James and how he got mad at him for teaching him Dark Arts. Harry feels guilty because James got mad at him for something "so small" which is just terrible writing. Just a couple of hours prior Harry could think of no worse magic than dark magic, yet suddenly it's not even a big deal.

And it just continues from there. Dark Arts isn't really bad, it's just misunderstood. Except we know that's false, as both the Cruciatus and Killing Curse need a certain mindset which is decidedly *not good*. So the author fixes it by calling those types of mind altering spells Black Arts, thereby creating a whole different type of magic system in order to push their bias about light/dark magic. And /of course/ these dark art books have the solution to healing curse scars, which light magic can't do. Because, of course, healers in the wizarding world would skip over an entire branch of magic that could help so many people because of whatever prejudices exist. What heals dark curses best? Dark magic! What do light magic users not use? Dark magic! Too bad for all those afflicted, I guess.

Harry isn't wary at all about these dark magic books. He jumps into them with enthusiasm. Decidedly not something Harry would do, being taught the last 4 years that dark magic was not something to be trifled with. It's not something anybody would do. There would need to be gradual acceptance, not just a switch turned on to make dark magic all of a sudden acceptable to him.

Then Harry gets to Hogwarts and is placed into Slytherin and all of a sudden everyone is nice to him... because Snape tells them to be. Snape, the man who enjoys making children cry because his feelings were hurt when Lily rejected him. The man who detested Harry from the moment he laid eyes on him.

This fic is bad, and that's without getting into the terrible pairing. I'm almost positive it's going to turn into a fic that glorifies the dark, bashes the light, makes Ron into the worst person alive, Malfoy into the best person alive, and Snape into a misunderstood saint. It's not original. It's full of excruciatingly bad tropes. The writing style is average at best, and doesn't hold a candle to Rowling's. The author's bias was immediately obvious from the very start. Events happen not in any sort of normal fashion, they just happen because the author wants them to happen.

You know what would have been good? Conflict when Harry goes into Slytherin House. No Snape telling them to treat him well, but conflict between Harry and a group of teens who have been at each other's throats for more than 4 years. That would have been somewhat interesting to read. But that doesn't exactly fit into the author's bias does it? Ron has to be bad, the Slytherins have to be friendly, and Malfoy has to tone down on being a massive dick in order to play Harry's love interest from here on out.

This is far from the best fic out there, and the best fic out there is far from an edited, cleaned up, published work from JKR. It's a bit weird that you're so aware of all the flaws canon supposedly has, but hype this fic up as something legendary when it's not even mediocre.

I don't really get emotionally attached to the characters or plot at all. The stories don't suck me in. They are good for what they are, but they literally only work by standing on the shoulders of canon - they /need/ you to care about the characters and world before starting to read them because the fics themselves rarely devote the time to make you do so.

There are stories, like The Prince of Slytherin (by The Sinister Man), which slamdunk the original works into the dirt. Sure, it is easy to write a story, based on an already established story, but what stops Rowling from rewriting her books? :O or maybe allow someone else to do it.

Yeah, that should be done someday. Not an entirely new story, but one where Harry wins because of smarts, hard work, and loyal friends (Hermione is ok, but Ron... well, he needs an improvement). Canon was mostly based on luck, luck, luck, luck, and even more... luck.

I wouldn't mind if there was an actual /'...power he knows no/t' That will definitely allow the chance to 'boost' Harry with something that increases his odds. Something like a /Mage Sight/, for example. Nothing too ridiculous, but believable.

Maybe Dumbles stops showing Harry his porn-collection of young Riddle and trains him instead into a powerful wizard.

To me the concept was amazing and I wanted to see what others did with it. That's why I found fanfiction, because I was disappointed with the canon execution of what I deemed an amazing setting.

A much more extreme example would be my relationship with SAO. It's easily the worst thing I've ever watched but the concept was so good I needed to look for similar things and found Log Horizon. To this day one of my favourite shows.

** Problem is that the actual canon is being ruined by its own creator. She should've stuck with the books and leave it at that not milk it. Had so much respect for Rowling, she lost all of it. Only sees money these days (the crap play and those two z-canon movies are just money cows). No-one considers that play canon and the movies well are just stupid and contradict established things.

** I actually was only interested in Harry Potter because A. A lot of Fanfiction. B. A friend was head over heels for it.

I decided to try to read the whole series first, but books don't fascinate me as much as Fan fiction anymore. I only got through The First book before I turned to Fan fiction. Even then I only read up to the Chamber of Secrets.

I doubt that I can ever read Harry Potter without pointing out flaws (In my Mind) or plotholes or just be angry at something. Canon just feels so wrong. Harry is a Gryfinndor. Not a Hufflepuff, a RAVENCLAW, or a Slytherin (though I want him to be.) Gryfinndor is always going to feel wrong to me, because that is not what I know him as.

Twilight is going to feel wrong to me, because of Fanfiction that has changed my views. And I dont even know if this answers your question sorry. I just can't connect with the story anymore.

** I haven't read canon for a very long time but I think it unfair to compare reading a single series to its entire fandom. Reading canon is not like reading a fanfic: it is the source of all. But it's still "only" the creation of only one mind. Fandom is created collectively. It is therefore much more rich and diverse. There is also not only one series to read but hundreds at least. Even a single fic is created comparatively to established creation and can therefore explore something else. Something new. But the thing is, canon is the initial step we all take to explore this universe. It creates thé universe when it was still totally New for everyone. I think rereading canon is like trying to come back to this first step: that's can either mean reviving the initial innocent marvelousness of it or remembering all the new ways of seeing things discovered as Fanfic reader. Either way, I believe it to be an interesting read.

** Same, I can't find it in myself to read canon after reading so much fanfiction.

Not sure it might be because of how overexposed I already am to the well concept at least, or how the 7 years of Harry Potter went as the basis of all the fanfics I've read. Such that it does get boring if it's just that.

Might change in the futurre though!

** You're not the only one. There are a bunch of little things that make me just sigh and shake my head sometimes. Most recently I was reading PoA and when Harry wants to tell Ron and Hermione about Sirius Black on the train, Ron immediately tells Ginny to go away.

I mean, it makes sense he would do that, and it's not out of character, but a big part of me wishes he would have just asked Harry if it was alright for Ginny to stay. Mostly because I'm a hardcore Hinny shipper, and if Ginny were in the compartment Harry would have remembered about the chamber happening instead of being solely distracted by the new murderer on the horizon.

** Well I have read quite a few and canon has become a distorted version. I love bits of canon but oh the fanons are incredibly amazing. Got in it with The Merging. Now that is a good story and the writer has used all the tools to keep the magic alive.
