Would they still work anchoring a soul if they don't exist in the current time?


** Depends on how transcendental the soul is, really. I mean, do we have any reason to believe time works the same on the other side? It seems vaguely linear, but is the bridge more flexible than would be possible in our universe?

Similarily, how temporally elastic is the soul, I mean, if you die in the past before being born, when do you enter the afterlife? What about the far future, or something like the philosopher's stone?

I think it's necessary for the afterlife's inhabitants to be and stay sane for it to do one of two things - one, death separates you from the limits of life, like the experience of time or various psychological needs, or two, time over there is non-linear, and works as a state of existence rather than a period, meaning you're just there and that's it, no past or future.

The second one seems more likely to me, really, because eternity is not good, period. To spend eternity doing anything would eventually turn into torture, it doesn't matter how long it takes, because the time is unending. Eventually, you will want to cease existing for good. Eternity is not a desirable state, even without delving into mathematics or ethics.

So I'm going to go with two, the notion that time as such doesn't exist in death, that the afterlife is simply a state of being rather than anything that actually runs along. Fits thematically too. In this interpretation, the horcrux would still work, and would in fact be perfectly safe, because nobody can get to it.

** I think you could die, but once time reached when the horcruxes were thrown to you would be resurrected.

** I think the soul would pass on if there's nothing left keeping them here ðŸ¤”

*** So it'd be possible to kill off main Voldie while keeping Horcruxes intact. Very interesting for a good diary Tom!
