I don't subscribe to pairings generally, but I've been on a romance kick lately and this seems like it could be an interesting catalyst for a story. The Ice Queen thing is ruining things fast though.


** linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement) Try this; She's like Luna, but without the etherealness.

*** +It's alright but she seems pretty out of character for a Slytherin.+ There's also some spelling and grammar mistake but nothing too serious. Overall it's a decent fic.

Edit: If constantly reoccurring and totally unnecessary spelling mistakes bother you, this isn't the fic for you.

***** Yeah I realized since I wrote that her character didn't have to be defined by her house. I read most of the fic and I liked her characterization. What I didn't like (actually could not stand it) was the constant use of "cos" and "cuz" instead of writing "because."

*** While it fits the request perfectly, I deleted it from my library. The authors are very brusque in response to anyone who gives suggestions on their writing.

The story itself is okay, there isn't a lot of character development and the plot progression is minimal. They say that they are writing within canon boundaries, however Harry just comes across as a raging type-A personality with virtually nothing of his canon personality.

Daphne is a blank slate, the ice queen is fanon creation. They however made her into a character who is so socially inept and incompetent that I sincerely believe that if they were a real person who fall on the autism spectrum. (I have no problem with the concept and it's vastly unexplored) but they claim she is completely within the realm of canon. She's made out to be more of a muggle-lover than Arthur, comic books, converse, etc... There are absolutely no personality traits that stand out to place her in Slytherin; no cunning, no ambition, nothing... If she were in sytherin she would have been an established pariah and labeled as a blood-traitor.

The authors in their most recent chapter essentially told readers that their place was to just read the story and not to guide the author. They have changed it since uploading it.

Overall the story is supposed to be unique and fresh, but the plot falls flat and quite honestly feels like awkward self-insert wish fulfillment.

**** Pretty much this. You just dub a character "ice whatever" and then use them - characterization becomes so much easier.

As with most cliches, there are notable exceptions of good stories with such tropes, but the majority of authors use this stuff as a crutch of laziness.

*** This is story a Theo/Daphne instead of Harry, but it's a good example of a non-Ice Queen Daphne and is also freaking adorable. I'd love to see a characterisation of Daphne in a Harry/Daphne story that is closer to this.
