I remember reading a very interesting Harry x Rowena story where Harry was sent back in time to the Founders Era, and it did a really good job of detailing the Magical World during Medieval times, before the Statute of Secrecy, and it's making me want to read some good fics like it.

I just ask that there's no slash, it's my only request. (I've seen enough Salazar x Harry for a lifetime)


** I rather enjoy linkffn(Strange Visitors from Another Century) where Harry, Ron and Hermione travel back to the Founders because of an accident involving time turners during the DoM fiasco. No HarryXRowena, but Harry's got the hots for Helena.

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.

** Sword of Slytherin has this, though Draco tags along and I never got far enough to see if it became slash or not, so be wary going into later chapters I suppose. Writing is solid, and it gives a fun premise of Harry and Draco having to pretend to be Salazar and Godric (in that order).

At the very least, the idea of it was fun. linkffn(10142174)

  AU after CS17. Harry pulls a very different sword out of the Sorting Hat, and that changes everything. The Sword of Slytherin has powers that go far beyond just killing legendary monsters, and soon Harry finds himself caught up in an improbable adventure and a bizarre case of mistaken identity. It just goes to show that strange things can happen when time meddles with wizards...

** linkffn(Birth of a Nightmare Man)

It's /ah/ well...

Harry is an insane, cruel, BAMF!bastard. Really entertaining and I don't think you have to read the sequel linkffn(The Nightmare Man) to understand it.
