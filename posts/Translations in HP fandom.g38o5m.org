How does the original writer feel when their work is being translated?Do they usually check out the translated version?Does the translator ask the original writer any questions in the process of translation?


** From what I've seen, the writers appear to be asked and generally accept. They even tell us that person x is translating their work. If my work were to be translated into a language I understand then sure I would look. But if someone were to translate my work in Japanese, than I wouldn't see the point of doing so since I wouldn't understand a single thing and wouldn't even know when a word or sentence ends (assuming they write in their own alpahabet and not in the latin one).

** Ask, unless there is a note by the author that indicates a preference.
