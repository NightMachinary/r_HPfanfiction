/Tonks jumped in her chair and suddenly turned around to face her aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange... except it wasn't the case. During the DoM event, something happened and she was now so... normal. With legilimency, Dumbledore said that an innocent soul from another world now inhabited her body and after a few awkward moments, Sirius and her were thick as thieves but Tonks clearly had more trouble. She grew up with the image of her murderer of aunt in her mind, like a boogeyman ready to take her away, so she could not help but be clearly nervous seeing the subject of may of her nightmares living in the 12 Square Grimmauld without any kind of restraint beside a wand taken away with just a "okay"/

"Y-yes, something like that. I'm a metamorphomagus, I can change my appearance at will." /she sighed nervously as she turned her hair from brown to bright red and lengthened them. This was a nerve-wracking moment for her. When her aunt was still her old-self, the reason she wanted to kill Tonks, beside the fact that her mother was a blood traitor, was that her morphing abilities made her less than human and more like a freak that should purged from a pureblood society./

/The silence stretched for a few seconds before Bellatrix's face split in a giant smile./

"Seriously? Damn girl, that's awesome !"


** A (sort-of) SI fic from the POV of another character sounds brilliant
