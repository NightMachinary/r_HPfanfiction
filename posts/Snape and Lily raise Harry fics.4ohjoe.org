  13-year-old Harry is dragged into another world where he was adopted by Snape. Where his mother is still alive. Where he can't stop feeling like a stranger. And Snape discovers that a new Potter has appeared. One who won't leave him alone. Who knows Snape's deepest secret. As both Harrys search for a way home, they begin to question what home really is.
