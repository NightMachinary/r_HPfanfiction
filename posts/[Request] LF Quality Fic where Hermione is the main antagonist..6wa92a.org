After reading The Red Knight, I'm inspired to find a fic with an antagonist Hermione. Note this does not necessarily mean dark, just the antagonist. Even evil protagonist(s) vs. good Hermione antagonist would fit this request. A Gringotts bank heist by Ron and Harry with Hermione greatly helping out Gringotts security would be an example.

I read some of Aspirations, but the writing wasn't very good and Voldy still became the main antagonist midway through.

Complete or dark Hermione fics are preferred, but not required.

I have read both Caveat Inimici and And She Shall Reign.
