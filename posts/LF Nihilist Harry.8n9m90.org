Make him as Cynical and Nihilistiic as Archer from FSN, even, whilst keeping the sarcastic trait alive. A lot of fics abandon Harry's kickass Sarcasm and Snark "There's no need to call me sir, Professor" being one of the best lines in the entire canon series, so often gets discarded in fanfiction.


** .....but why.

That is a huge tone of hp fanfiction where many stories fall flat.

I garuntee you'll find some if you sort by <yourlanguagehere> - Reviews - M rated on FFN

Nihilism is fine and all but if that is all your character is, then it's not a character - it's a trope personified that does not change as life events should change someone.

*** I basically want Harry with Archer from FSN's personality. He's not JUST Nihilistic, but it is a HUGE part of who he is.

** I think you have missed what nihilism is. Its when you believe that nothing at all matters: you, your family, the trees, the universe, etc. Wizards almost by necessity have to be the exact opposite. They live in a world of near-infinite possibilities, and are probably MORE open to believing anything than say muggles. Sounds like what you are looking for is apathetic!Harry. As for cynical Harry, check any number of indy!Harry stories for this, its kinda of there backbone.

Anyway, its hard to be nihilistic or apathetic when you have a sociopath trying to play pin-the-spell-on-the-Harry and a society of near-demigods but with the sense of dodo birds.

*** I'm being quite literal, i want Harry with Archer's personality Archer is a partial nihilist, it's who he is after living as a Counter Guardian. Nihilistic to the world, mostly set on one goal, but caring about the odd 1 or 2

Indy Harry usually deviates into Lord Everything who ends up with Perfect Hermione and does what she says. I don't care about the Lord Everything so much, though if you want to give him money, the Basilisk is a better way to do it, i just hate the idea of Hermione being written as Emma Watson, and not Hermione.

Heck, even a Timetravel Counter Guardian POTTER finds a way to go back and kill his past self, whilst also taking care of Voldemort would be an interesting read.

**** Well, the closest I can come up with is probably something like Realignment linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB).

Its never stated, but Harry comes back essentially kill Tom Riddle in 1943, and makes it his primary goal. He keeps trying but Dumbledore and Grindelwald interfere (think if the T-700 got sent back to kill John Connor but he had the T-1000 to protect him). He cares enough to help the people in Europe during World War 2, but he drops everything to take out Tom when the opportunity comes up (actually thats a lot like Archer now that I think about it).

Also, I think you might want to clarify that you mean Archer from FSN, and not Sterling Archer "the world's greatest secret agent." They both kind of don't give a damn.

****** Then definitely The Unforgving Minute by Voice of the Nephilim linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute). Harry does not care who gets in his way, he will make all his sacrifices worth it.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

*** Having written that I just had an epiphany.

Its no wonder wizards like Dumbledore, Voldemort and even Snape can lead the wizarding-world around by its nose. Anybody with even a bit of logical thinking and tactical planning skills can gather entire armies or overthrow governments with ease. Hell, Grindelwald may have had a hand in creating the Nazi rise to power, and somehow getting his magical allies to align with these people, despite his professed belief in magical superiority.

That could be why Dumbledore never took the Minister's position: it was so easy to convince people of anything, he could manipulate them however he wanted.
