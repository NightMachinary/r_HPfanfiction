Thanks!


** Dunno what you mean by creature inheritance, but there's the one where Harry is convinced that he's an elf and Draco is the only one who somewhat manages to deal with his crazyness so they're friends.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Erm... This is not something that is regularly asked for on this sub. HOWEVER, in the distant past, a decent fic was written with a premise similar to this. Rather unlike most of the other trash that shares this premise, this fic is readable, and sort of makes sense maybe almost. Regardless, cheers.

Edit: It should be noted that this is, quite literally, the only Harry/Draco I've ever read all the way through and also the only one I bothered to add to my list. I came across it by accident, else I likely would never have touched it (slash just isn't my cup of tea)

** If you're in the mood for dubious consent and /patricularly/ creature feel, I recommend [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=8094][Indago by LdDurham]] There are 2 sequels and it 100% deserves its explicit rating

I also found [[https://blinded-hp.livejournal.com/5385.html][this list]] while looking for Indago. It's on Livejournal, so I don't know if the links still work.
