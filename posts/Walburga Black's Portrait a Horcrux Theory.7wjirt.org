So I was thinking about Harry Potter, as I often do, and I started to think about Walburga Black's portrait, and my crazy thought was, what if it was a Horcrux.

Now here me out, as we saw in the series your attitude changes the longer you are around a Horcrux, and yes while there was a Horcrux at the house (the one in Regulus' bedroom) it was in one room secluded from others. While the Portrait of Sirius and Regulus' mother was right by the door, surrounded by people.

Everyone's attitude seemed to change the longer they were there. Molly was just absolutely awful to Sirius, making it seem like he had gone on vacation instead of being in a prison. And the longer that Sirius stayed, he was just a emotional wreck. Everyone seemed to harp on each other more, and Walburga's portrait just seemed different than others, plus the Black family is known for being dark, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to imagine Walburga doing something like that.

So what does everyone thing? Could you see that being possible?


** Good god, that means there's a shade of Walburga floating around somewhere.

Of course, on the same token, the Locket was in the house at the same time, so it may have been exerting some influence, when coupled with the general awfulness of the Black Family cursed artifacts.

** It's a fun idea, especially given the damn thing's apparent indestructibility. Perhaps a failed horcrux, given the absence of a shade? Would make Voldemort's creation of multiple horcruxes all the more impressive if it's dangerous to even make one.

****** that would defeat the purpose of having a horcrux, you wouldn't become immortal instead you'd have a backup copy replacing you.

It may have to fo with the fact that the Slytherin Locket an *actual* Horcruxe was there. But if you think that's it's something else then let's say that it's the troll leg, or the chair. Or even Kreacher.

** It is a horcrux in the sum of our parts by holdmybeer. Which annoyed the crap out of me because we never find out what happened to the bitch if it was even her horcrux.
