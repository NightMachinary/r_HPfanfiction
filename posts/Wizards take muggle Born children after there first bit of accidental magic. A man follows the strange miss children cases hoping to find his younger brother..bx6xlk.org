A man had his younger brother stolen when he 15. Becoming obsessed with strange missing children cases hoping to find his brother.

Years later he notices a child that looks just like what his brother should look like in strange clothes with odd people and he assume his brother got stolen by a cult.


** From my perch on top of the crag, I could see the valley spread out before me. Bracken covered the slopes, giving way to low-lying trees and bog plants near the middle. There was not a single sign of man. If not for the distant roar of the extraction plant, I may as well have imagined myself transported into the past, when the sprawl of civilization had still been embraced by nature.

Taking a tired breath, I shook my head and then glanced down to the display on the back of my hand. The screen helpfully informed me that there was only an hour of oxygen left, but that the air outside was breathable. The computer didn't seem burdened by the apparent impossibility of such an event. It didn't ask questions; merely delivered the results of sensor data.

But even if these results were wrong and my suit was malfunctioning, I didn't have any choice. An hour of oxygen wasn't enough to sustain me back to the glider, and an SOS signal would get lost in the quagmire of radiation. The closest facility was the extraction plant, but it wasn't equipped for rescue operations. Like most facilities on the surface of the Earth, it was fully automated. The robots there suffered a monthly inspection; the rest of the time, they bit and ground into the depths of the planet, extracting precious resources that were then delivered to massive underground settlements for refinement.

The hag had told me this would happen. She'd warned that I would confront the impossible...right before she'd snagged the vial of X from my hands and then became lost in a druggy haze.

I would have to believe, she'd babbled, with spittle falling down her chin. I'd stayed with her all of that night, recording, cataloguing, trying to part fact from her drug-induced fantasy. And two years later, it had led me here. To this garden of Eden.

Reaching up, I slowly unfastened the clamps on my helmet and then tugged it off. The air that rushed into my lungs was cool and fresh. It was filled with the smells of living things, not the recycled staleness of faulty CO2 scrubbers. I breathed it in slowly, tasting it the way a connoisseur tastes his wine. Abruptly, I felt a tightness in my throat. Not from radiation or the poisonous concoction Earth's atmosphere had become in the late 21'st century, but from an acute sense of wonder.

After years of searching, I was that much closer to my goal. It had started over two decades ago, when my brother had gone missing. As settlement interiors are consistently monitored, finding his trace should have been only a matter of routine inquiry, but somehow, the datacenters that served as surveillance storage had malfunctioned. At least, that's what the Setsec officers had claimed at the time. Later, when I'd joined Setsec myself, I discovered that to be a half-truth: the equipment hadn't been compromised, but all traces of my brother were gone. He'd simply vanished. Like magic.

His search had gone on for a time, gradually fizzling out as days became months. Despite the overwhelming odds against us, my mother never gave up hope. She turned to prayer, and later, to the drugs that never had a chance to take root in her, as a CO leak in the factory she worked at claimed her life along with twelve others.

I still remember her, sometimes.

And it was her I thought about, when I saw my brother's face in a transport car ten years later. He was older, in his early twenties, with a scar crossing down his cheek, but I recognized him instantly. He was wearing strange clothes and holding the hand of a young boy, eleven, or maybe twelve years old, who had a dazed look in his eyes. I tried to call out to him. Tried to reach him. But the doors had opened, and a rush of passengers on their way to third shift came between us, tugging me away like debris in one of those super tornadoes that daily scour the North American continent.

I hadn't seen him again. Surveillance--just like in his original disappearance--proved just as useless. But my memory was enough. It sparked my obsession, leading me down a path I never would have imagined possible. A path of missing children and technology failures that defied physics, and finally, to an old woman, half out of her mind from her drug habit, who claimed that many years ago, a woman with odd clothes had taken her to a magical place where there was grass and trees and a large castle that stood on the shores of a misty lake.

Hogwarts, the old crone had called it, crying about how it was unfair. How she'd been just a girl, and she'd made a mistake, and expelling her was so, so cruel.

Her words had proved to be the linchpin in my case. Two years later, I was here, breathing in air that shouldn't even exist, seeing vegetation instead of lifeless ground.

Taking another breath, I started my descent into the valley.

** I have actually had this thought that when either when the Statute happened or when Spy satellites started becoming a thing Wizardkind pulled a plane shift and took all remaining magic out of the world. The downside is it took them right to the world the Sidhe had previously fled to along with other thought extinct magical races.

Now any muggleborn are taken to this world, where not only are humans fighting among themselves, but the fey and other more terrible things must also be contended with. Harry or the OC was taken to the normie world to keep them safe for reasons only to come back now.

Might work as its own original world too.... hmm....

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
