I want to write a fanfiction for Harry Potter that takes place in fourth year. But here's the thing, I really want Hermione in Ravenclaw and Neville in Hufflepuff. The first three books still happen exactly the same but deviates greatly in book four. So how can I plausibly put those two characters into a different house and have it make sense yet keep the first three years the same other than that? Should I have it be that everyone gets re-sorted in their fourth year or what?

Suggestions are welcome!


** If you are starting in fourth year, just slap em in Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw from the beginning. No need to justify.

If you want a reason to re sort them in fourth year, try this one.

Have H/N be with Harry at the World Cup. They stand up to the death eaters with Harry/Ron witnessing but not firing spells (Harry has no wand per Barty and Ron is worried about the Trace) and accidentally injure one severely. Make the injured death eater, say, Cormac McClaggen's dad, or the father of some OC Griff. Said antagonist then assaults both of them for revenge in the common room, while Harry/Ron are in a class that H/N don't take, like divination. They are re-sorted afterward due to the trauma and the OC is expelled, which also provides an antagonist for your minor characters as well.

Edit: remembered Neville takes Divination. Harry and Ron went for a fly, then. Problem solved.

** Honestly, it makes no sense that the entire course of your life is plotted out at 11 years old. The connections you'll make, the friendships you'll forge, even the prejudices others will have of you, all determined before puberty.

Obviously, in universe, this is hand-waved by the hat being magic, and created by the founders, thus beyond what modern wizards are capable of doing.

That said, there are a few ways you can handle it for your story. Redesign the nature of sorting - have it so that everyone is sorted again at age 14, to "check" they are developing well along their path. Make adjustments to the characters as you like.

Another alternative is to remove the houses altogether for the first few years. Make it "random" and put characters in what amounts to freshmen groups, and then have the "proper" sorting find later. This way you can group up the main trio and call it fate or coincidence or whatever, but break up the group later because a "true sorting" showed them where their talents lay.

I'm sure you could come up with more. That's just what popped into my head at first look.

** You'll probably get the least grief if you make them 'honorary' House members. I can easily see Hufflepuff adopting Neville for his gentle and cooperative nature and his affinity to their Housemaster's field of study.

Similar case with Hermione -- if she were regularly collaborating with Padma or others, I'm sure she'd be accepted as a non-offensive presence in their tower, often past curfew.

*** I know that a lot of fanfictions do that. To me, it seems sort of cliche of independent Harry fanfics.
