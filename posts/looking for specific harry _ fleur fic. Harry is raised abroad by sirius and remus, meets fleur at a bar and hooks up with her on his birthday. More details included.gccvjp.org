** It's called Ingenio ab Artifex (formerly flowers for your grave). It's by JaimeJabs on FFNet. I'm not sure if it technically violates rule 8, so I won't link directly, but that's the fic you're looking for, definitely.

  They always say love can be dangerous, but it's always worth it right? 17 year old Harry, Goblet of Fire saga moved up to Harry's 7th year with different scenarios before that. Story set in modern times with modern technology. Hp/F, A/U (Revamped and Reborn)
