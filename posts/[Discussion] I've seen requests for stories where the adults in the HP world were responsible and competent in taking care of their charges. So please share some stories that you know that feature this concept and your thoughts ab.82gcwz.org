Linking this story which shows a competent Hogwarts Staff linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11497117/1/A-Competent-Staff]])


** linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) is often recommended.

Overall, while it can make for a fun feel-good story like the above, I don't find myself particularly drawn to the concept. Being devoid of common sense is part and parcel of the Wizarding World, and if you start taking away Snape, you might as well take away the Ministry, and the Dark Lord, and the Goblins bankers keeping literal piles of gold behind literal dragons, and at some point it's just not /Harry Potter/ anymore, nor fun.

*** Eh, I was never a fan of the takeaway that wizards lack common sense. Most instances where the series seems to suggest this really seem to show they lack experience with non-magical things, since magic lets you shortcut a lot of issues. They don't do things like walk into fire (Floo excluded!) because they can't get that fire burns, or any number of other things you might associate with lacking common sense.

I mean, even the whole "Wizards can't logic" bit from PS was a bit silly since I wager most of the readers didn't solve Snape's riddle. Riddles are just hard by nature, wizard or not. And seeing as education itself presumes you can reason to some extent, it would nix the idea of a magic school or a magic curriculum if we took Hermione's words literally.

**** I don't believe it as /literally/ as walking into a fire because they forget fire burns (unless they're Xenophilius Lovegood). However, the way I look at is that wizards don't think /straight/. They tend to have a sort of warped view of things that will accept just about anything as sensical if it is so presented, because magic itself is so strange and arbitrary at times that it's just how they see the world.

It starts with "little" things that are needed if the wizarding world is to function: "sure, the magical singing hat will decide our kids' future! Why not? It works!" But with that sort of thinking, pretty soon, you start to get things like, "how do you solve a scheduling problem? /Time-Travel!/ That's the obvious solution!" Such things, well, yes, they /work/, but are really overkill and much more convoluted than was ever needed.

And from that point, it's just a tiny step away from "let's make our tournament to encourage international friendship a rivalry-based contest with possibly lethal consequences!", or even Voldemort's "say, Dumbledore's protections on the Stone look like a First-Year could beat them, could there possibly be something fishy about thOH DAMN".

***** I don't think that's quite right. You bring up Xeno, which makes me think of Luna, and everyone sees her as rather /off/ soon after meeting her, even the purebloods.

Well yes the Time-Tuner solution was extremely wacky, you got me there. Points taken. Althought the Vodlemort is a bit odder than I first thought, seeing as he lived in the Muggle world as well so you'd think he'd be more circumspect about the whole thing. I mean heck, he even solved the silly logic puzzle Snape set up.

****** True, but while raised in the Muggle world Voldemort was never really a part of it; really, all he ever saw of the Muggle world was the orphan, when you get right down to it. And there, from a very young age, he saw himself as someone special with inexplicable powers that made him superior to his bullies --- such an upbringing doesn't sound conductive to rational thought.

Whatever the case may be, it's clear that Voldemort thinks in those warped wizard terms. See: the protections on his Horcruxes and his fixation on making them from 'significant' items; his utterly ridiculous Goblet of Fire scheme; his general "raw power doesn't work? Answer: /apply more raw power/" philsophy when it came to fighting Harry.

And in /Cursed Child/, even Hermione (who started out pretty damn rational) has seemingly been contaminated by wizards' peculiar inability to process the idea that /if you want something protected, you protect it with protections, not with riddles/. So it would appear spending too long in the magical world can corrupt even the best.

******* What I mean is he was an exception to Hermione's "wizards can't logic" thing since he solved the puzzle too, so you'd think he would have a better nose for this.

Eh, I actually thought that making the Horcruxes significant items was a good idea since then people who, somehow, get a hold of them are less likely to try the few things that can actually destroy them. What never made sense to me was making Nagini a Horcrux. Just how long would a snake live, magical or not???

I try to ignore /Cursed Child/ as much as possible. :-)

Could be pretty damn long, actually, going by the Basilisk, if she is indeed magical. But either way, my headcanon was always that Voldemort intended to devote some time to making a Philosopher's Stone of his own once his power was secure, which he would use for Nagini, himself, and also possibly some select followers (Bellatrix, Delphini, Snape if he hadn't turned traitor). After all, the Horcruxes prevent his /soul/ from passing on, but his body would still age, and it would just be troublesome to go through the "Bone-Blood-Flesh" ritual every century (not to mention he'd eventually run out of father's bone).

********* Well the Basilisks are said to have long lives anyway. But for any of this to make sense I suppose Nagini would have to have a longer lifespan than the average snake, lol.

I always thought it'd be cool if Voldemort made the Stone a Horcrux and put it back where it was. Considering having him do just that in my HP fanfic (undecided). Despite what Dumbledore said, it felt odd the Flamel would be agree to destroy his Stone because they had a chat. Well, maybe he was feeling especially noble that day. Wouldn't be surprised if there was an FF was Dumbledore Confunded Flamel into agreeing or something, lol.

********** The way Dumbledore says it, it sounds like Flamel and Pernelle had gotten all they could out of life at this point, were very bored and jaded, and were only clinging to life out of habit. Destroying the Stone becoming a deed of honor rather than outright suicide was a welcome opportunity to do what they wanted, but had not the courage, to do for years now.

** I am writing a story where Harry ends up adopted by the Tonks family after Sirius fails to clear his name. And instead of letting Sirius mend his trauma with cocktails and women on a Caribean Island, he is sent to a Mind Healer by his cousin. While most of the Hogwarts adults remain incompetent, I have Penelope Clearwater teach Muggle Studies (which Harry is taking after ditching Divination) and as a Muggleborn herself she knows her subject. Also, Voldemort is not completely braindead so the whole "let's wait a year for Harry to complete the tournament while I do nothing" thing is a no-go in that story. The Death Eaters also are slightly more competent, actually managing to kill civilians when there is a huge, panicking crowd right in front of their wands. The Ministry, with the exception of Bagman, is also competent, although they are still the very definition of corruption and nepotism. Lastly, Dumbledore is a competent, Machiavellian politician who does not get outwitted by an angry boy but generally stays in the background (as he does in canon).

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: The Ministry is not incompetent, but large numbers of Ministry people actively supports Riddle, and Dumbledore's gang is facing numerical disadvantages. On the other hand, Hogwarts students are significantly more scary in this story than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Adults are definitely not incompetent here, especially not the Ministry and the bad guys. Dumbledore is just outmaneuvered by the two sides who are far more cunning and ruthless than him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Adults are not incompetent here, neither are Purebloods ignorant of Muggle matters, as Death Eater Nott's rant against Muggle environmental destruction shows. They got Sirius out and exonerated early, but Voldemort and Barty Jr have decent plans too. Dumbledore kicks ass in East Africa, and both Malfoys are plotting and thinking.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Time traveling Hermione just tells Dumbledore all the info, he gets down to work, and cleans up things real good together with the Ministry.

** linkffn(4912291) has competent adults. It's a Snape-mentors-Harry story where the Hogwarts staff work together to thwart Quirrel. It's a feel-good, fluffy kind of story and a bit boring at times. Although there are some OOC characterizations, it's not very far off from canon. I enjoyed it.
