Basically she gave mortals magic and now she's using them to over throw the gods


** How does she do this?

Persuade humans by revealing herself and showing them how evil zeus is?

Blackmail them by threatening to take away their magic unless they attack zeus?

Control them through a spell embedded in the blessing that gave them magic, a spell that the imperius curse is able to activate?

As for zeus, is he evil? In his mythos, he's a right bastard basically all the time, but maybe he's the lesser of two evils - Perhaps his power is the only thing keeping Tartaros sealed and the Titans imprisoned?

This story would probably be best set after the hogwarts years, with Harry + Main Cast being tired of fighting. Not sure a story like this would be fun to read with a child protagonist.

*** Good questions! I would like to add another, how would Hecate managed to grant magic to mortals without having Zeus smiting them for that? Would other gods support her?

I can imagine a concept world where Wizarding folk was born out of demigods originaly and then Hecate started her longshot project of amassing her "secret army" while feigning innocence to Zeus, her endgame? Take His ultimate Life giving/taking power (Lightning) and trapping him on the Tartarus while she assumes as the new warden. She Is accompanied by Hephaestus, Hades and Poseidon who want rulership over the earth/sky too and have felt wronged by Zeus in the past.

*** Another question, what's Zeus control zone? Are there other pantheons out there? How do they coexist?

Even if Zeus controls only the mediterranean europe that's quite big magically speaking, also what if Pantheons are like muggle nations competing with each others?

** She comes back after a thousand years to rally her troops to battle. She discovers that almost all of them are lazy and content with learning and doing the minimum needed to get by in reasonable comfort. Most of those with a modicum of ambition either are either not interested in risking their lives (Slytherins) or are constantly questioning whether her cause is just (Gryffindors).

** "So gods exist"

"Yes"

"All of that mythology. All of those stories, are they true? All of them?"

"Yes"

"Then there really is no other choice. Zeus will die."

Hecate smiled, then left, satisfied that her goal was in reach.

As soon as she left, Harry cast several detection charms. Satisfied with the result, he conjured a patronus.

"Hermione, prepare for war. The Greek gods are real, in all their rapist, murderous glory."

Well, he did say Zeus would die. He made no promises about the rest. After all, he'd already fought a war to overthrow a corrupt elitist government who decided that whatever you were born as dictated your status in life. What was one more?

** "Zeus is evil" Said Hecate.

"That goes without saying. I mean, at least a quater of the population is evil, 'cos they're slimy slytherins." Harry paused and thought for a moment. "Including my wife, and she's very evil... especially when we get pink bedsheets..." Potter looked out the window, staring at the pidgeons flying past.

"You will lead this army for me." Hecate was blustering at this meer mortal who sat, calmly, looking out the window, as if she hadn't just killed every single person in the entire building as a show of power.

"No." The answer was simple, complete.

But Hecate needed a leader, a general, a master-and-commander. She snarled saying "Then you will die." The cold finality seemed to seep into the walls of Harry's office.

"Then I have a last request Hecate. Sureley you can grant me that wish." The pleading was in his eyes, and Hecate felt pity.

"Ok."

"A phone call."

"Ok."

"This is Harry to fire control. Fire on my position." The phone went quite, and there was a hiss of static. Damn, but magic played up even with good old fashioned, copper wire landline.

Not that Harry would be around to bitch about that for much longer. Harry sighed.

"You are going to die mortal." Harry smiled sadly at Hecate. So, he was back to mortal now. Like mudblood, blood-traitor, etc et al, it was just names. "Nothing, nothing that you could do could ever kill me."

"Hecate." Harry wasn't sure why he used her first name, but he did anyways. "For the next millenia, my name shall be cursed. For as we speak, the armouries of the west, the armouries of the east, the armoury of New Zealand (God (Christian, not you Hecate) knows why New Zealand had a ICBM) has been opened. The dark vaults that have and should never have known light are broad open as day." Harry took a breath before continueing to speak. "And while you murdered my guards, they were fueling.

"So Potter, you will become a God and take my place?" Harry smirked, he, Harry, was back to Potter in the time before he died.

"No. I don't kill you. Humanity does. From the scientist who split the atom, to the baker, who made his lunch, everything humanity has done will contribute to killing you. We will nearly all die. But." Harry paused for emphasis here. "When we rise, we will not be mere mortals. We will be mortal Gods."

Harry laughed, and laughter was the last thing that was heard, as the Gulf of London was created in the largest mass extinction event ever.

Humanity would not bend it's knee. Not to a God (Deceased). Not on Potter (Deceased)'s watch.

** I mean she can just get the other elder gods together and trap Zeus somewhere so that he can't be freed by a passing nymph. Again.

Has that theme as flavour text, except it's a cross with Supernatural and Hecate used wizards as backup in the age when Christianity extinguished pagan faiths en masse. By condemning magic, Christians allowed Hecate to draw on a steady source of faith by giving magic to people.
