After reading A Cadmean Victory (minor spoilers) I feel like I need to read something where Katie gets the guy. Any help getting over the ending would be greatly appreciated.


** (Spoiler) I think Katie in Cadmean Victory is the most well written Katie Bell in fandom. It broke my heart when she died, she really was gone forever, she rarely even gets mentioned in most fics.

*** I wanted something good to happen for her the whole time. She was such a good friend despite everything. I'm still crying thinking about her death. And then the ending of the fic itself I am straight up broken up.

** [[/u/CryptidGrimnoir][u/CryptidGrimnoir]] wrote my favorite Harry/Katie story as a response to the Katie the Cultist thread awhile back.

I'm not sure if they've followed through w/ putting it on Ao3, but it's the top post in here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f50myv/katie_the_cultist/]]

*** I do intend to go back to it soon.

Once I finish my week of one-shots for a theme for Kingdom Hearts, I intend to write Chapter 30 in "Kingdom Hearts: Rise Above the X."

After that, I'll go back to Katie the Cultist.

Great plot and great romantic interest. Better than Cadmean Victory, in my opinion.

** There's a good Katie romance in linkffn(guardian of azkaban)

Probably one of the weirder things I've read but I thought it was written pretty well.

  PoA rewrite, character insert, first in series. With Sirius Black on the loose, a special breed of guardian must be called upon. Follow Captain Esdras Demnin of the Azkaban Guard as he protects Hogwarts...from the inside. Reviews appreciated. KBOC

When Harry receives a letter from four of his "friends" saying he was too dangerous to be associated with, having gone for a walk, he didn't expect to find Hermione Granger and Katie Bell in trouble from a Death Eater attack. With friends like Ron and Neville, who needs enemies. HP/HG/KB
