"So... Harry Potter is now living with Muggles." Voldemort quietly murmured as he paced in his dark lair. His followers had come to check once or twice and that was it. He came to know that most of them just went back to being Purebloods that he knew and despised. The ones who plead guilty were a bit off in the head. All in all, not a good revelation for Lord V.

"You there!" Voldemort apparated to a fast food restaurant. "I wish to know more about this world." Lord Voldemort knew that Albus Dumbledore personally placed the boy with muggles. These muggles as powerless they are must know something about raising children. After all, there were so many of them around. Prophecy fresh in his mind, Lord Voldemort would explore every avenue, every nook, every -

"Ummm. Do you mean you want to know about this restaurant or the business?" The restaurant manager who was filling in for a sick employee recovered at the demand made.

"Yessss." Lord V said as he looked at this person, who had interrupted his thought process. His eyes peered the person accusingly, as if he was the reason why Lord Voldemort required to have a job.

"Well, great!" The person faked enthusiasm. "A job at Dominoes will provide you with both!" The manager replied and decided to fire the sick employee.

That's when Lord Voldemort came to know Capitalism.

~Few Weeks Later~

"This is unbelievable." Lord Voldemort spoke to no one in particular. "Its like the system rewards selfishness, ruthlessness and general bad behavior. As long as you are efficient."

Just a day after working, Lord Voldemort decided that serving customer was never his forte. His forte was in controlling people - manipulate them, intimidate them to get what he wanted out of them. So, he schemed while preparing pizzas for people. Getting the branch manager fired was easy and so speaking to the higher-ups. Lord Voldemort spoke exactly what the higher-ups wanted and promised greater profits from this branch. He was now the branch manager.

~Few Months Later~

"Its like I've cast a mass Imperio!" Voldemort had discovered the wonders of advertisement.

He had suggested a few new recipes because the customers were always whining about having something new. He had decided to create grotesque pizza variants that no human should consume. He then put his best smile forward and promote the new dishes.

This restaurant posted record profits and the higher-ups noticed. He was promoted to Area-Manager. A couple of months down the line, he was managing Pizza delivery for the whole region.

~Few Years Later~

"Harry Potter doesn't seem to like pizza." Lord Voldemort said curiously. He had tracked every household with Pizza delivery and had found the house. The said house had four individuals but they always ordered two large pizza. He knew that the man ate one for himself, but he could not fathom three people eating a large pizza all by themselves.

"But he has bought glasses." Voldemort paced in his plush office trying to see how to move forward. "Maybe I should switch industries?"

And Voldemort decided to join a foreign company which was trying to make inroads in British Market. The company's name was Luxottica.

~3 Years before 1st Year at Hogwarts~

"Yessss." Lord Voldemort said as he admired his power to influence his followers...er... logistical chain. Harry Potter had recently bought a new pair of glasses. A pair of glasses recently delivered at the boy's house by his delivery person. With a written order, Lord Voldemort found he could enforce his will on all employees of the company.

All the eye-wear products had miniature runes inscribed, courtesy of laser etching. He should now know what the boy does everyday.

** See, the idea of Voldemort getting a taste of actually living life and being successful is exactly what makes an interesting, and unique direction. Eventually, LV works his way into a CEO position with a genetics corporation(creating himself hair, a new nose, a tan, and a Bugatti sports car. Realizing that if he buddies up with Harry, they will both effectively be immortal, so he has his staff take blood samples from them both to generate a true immortality serum which he charges through the, ahem, nose for.
