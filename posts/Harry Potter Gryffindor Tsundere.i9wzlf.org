Emotionally immature, forced to conform to the Dursley's warped idea of normal, alongside being punished for showing any emotion that they didn't want to see, left Harry defensive, untrusting, fiercly independent and easily irritable in canon.

Perfect groundwork for a tsundere with a little exaggeration...

Harry's friends have had years to pick up on his social cues, though: Hermione just thinks he's being immature, the twins find it funny, Neville is still a bit wary around Harry, Ginny never quite knows where she stands and Ron takes his comments way too personally... But they still love Harry James "It's Not Like We're Friends or Anything" Potter.

He huffs, he was quick to learn hexes in first and second so he didn't have to resort to decking the Snake's that wound him up.

Quick to anger but even quicker to blush and blubber his way through denying that he feels all gooey and warm when his friends look out for him and let him know they love him.

When he isn't violent, as he grew older and matured somewhat, he became sickly sweet and polite to those he doesn't like. Giving condescending responses and cutting remarks delivered with so much faux sincerity that you can't argue that it is anything other than sincerity without coming off as a madman. Though, within these veiled insults are comments that target deep insecurities that he has no business knowing.

Snape now refuses to supervise his detentions and Hannah Abbot refuses to make eye contact (after she made a comment during the COS incident that Harry refused to ignore).

However, there are those who transcend even that. Coming to light when Sirius escaped before transitioning to Wormtail and Voldemort. It's hard to belittle, tease and antagonise a boy who refuses to respond past blowing off one of his new hands, crushing Wormtail's sternum with a misfired Reducto and didn't stop his icy, silent, near-mindless rage until he was left in a ruined, empty graveyard.

For if Harry TRULY hates you, he'd just get rid of you...

*** Straight from wiki

Tsundere (ツンデレ, pronounced [tsɯndeɾe]) is a Japanese term for a character development process that depicts a person who is initially cold (and sometimes even hostile) before gradually showing a warmer, friendlier side over time. Hope this helps.
