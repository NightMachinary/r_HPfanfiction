I've been getting nostalgic lately for all of the 2010s next gen romcom fics that were everywhere on HPFF and I wanted to reread some of dream_BIG's stuff but it's all gone!

I particularly wanted to read Welcome to the Chase which has a webarchive page here ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20180418110647/http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=281029]]) but most of the chapters and the printer friendly version of the story aren't saved cri.

Does anyone have it or any of dream_BIG's other fics saved?

P.S. if anyone has any recommendations for other trashy romcom fics that easily entertain and are easily accessible, I'll take them!!


** I miss her so much!! I used to be obsessed with her fics. I wish I could help. I actually just googled her because I was struck by the urge to read her “Anatomy of a Bromance” one-shot about Harry and Hermione, and found this post. I miss the golden age of hpff!
