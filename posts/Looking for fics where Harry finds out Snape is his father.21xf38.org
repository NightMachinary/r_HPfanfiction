[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1963825/1/][Mine]] by Gillian Anderson, which has several sequels.

#+begin_quote
  Against his better judgement Severus Snape let a part of himself be used in a spell six years earlier. Now the consequences of his actions cannot be avoided any longer and Snape finds himself the father of a five year old boy---Harry Potter!

*** I second "Mine." That series was one of the best I've read in fanfic, particularly relating to Snape and Harry.

** My favorite Severitus fic is [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1284][The Year Like None Other]]. Edit to add: TYLNO one is actually a Snape is Harry's Guardian, not father fic. So instead of that, I would say [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1444][Lily's Charm]].

Potions and Snitches (the site purpleyuan mentioned earlier) has a section for [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=7][Parental Snape]]. You can find hundreds of Snape is Harry's dad fics there.
