***** Most Harry/Voldermort stories (that I know) have time travel, though, so either Harry is really old (often hundred of years old, in which case the age difference is a whole /other/ issue) or he goes back to the past and they're both young.

Still, the only way for this ship to work is if either of them is extremely ooc. Either a dark(often edgy)!Harry or Misunderstood!Voldemort.

I don't like that pairing at all, but I am surprised just how much hate the Snape, Voldemort and other death eater pairings get while the same people are perfectly fine with Harry x hot fem!Voldemort or Harry x Bellatrix. They are both still terrorists and horrible people, (and not to mention the age difference) but for some reason it's perfectly fine in those cases since they are totally hot women.

***** Is Harry x fem!Voldemort any different than Harry x Voldemort/Tom Riddle or Harry/Hermione x (sexy) Snape or other death eaters. I can't say I like those pairings, but why bash them and then go around and say that if the evil murderer is a hot woman then it's perfectly fine?

I guess the age difference or the fact that she is the head of a terrorist group who wants to kill all muggleborns is perfectly okay in that case since she is attractive. I really think that people should be free to like whatever pairings that they want. I don't think its fair to bash not necessarily morally good characters that other people like and then be perfectly okay with other just as evil if not more evil characters only as long as it's someone you think is attractive.

*** This entire thread is just one big Snape hate circlejerk. The title may not be hate speech, but a lot of posts on here are just Snape bashing and seem hostile to anyone who doesn't agree that Snape is the worst person ever. Although just about every "discussion" post about Snape devolves into a debate split between people who absolutely hate or love him so I guess that's to be expected.

As someone who likes him not because he is a good person, but because he is an interesting complex character that I find entertaining to read about, it does make me kind of sad. I know he is terrible, but what can I say? I love some good sarcasm, dry humour, cynism and characters who are kind of bad doing good things for all the wrong reasons. I find his insults and comments hilarious and his speeches passionate and interesting. He is terrible with people, has serious problems and is generally all around messed up, but there are some underlying circumstances both of his own doing and upbringing that led to that.

It's not just movie Snape either. That speech in potions about stopping death in first book? Just wow. He is obviously exaggerating but the way he talks is poetic, his character voice has presence even when written and it's awesome. I can't help but love it even if he follows it up with some horrible insults to Harry.

I like reading fics that explore all those aspects of his character. They are more interesting to me than edgy, independent Harry bashing everyone that the author doesn't like or morally entirely good characters that battle evil. Fanon! misunderstood! Snape that has no flaws or issues definitely annoys me though.

***** Sure! I have quite a lot that meet that criteria though, any specific themes or characters that you like? Here are my favorites:

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Big time AU where Voldemort won the first war. Amazing character portrayals and lots of morally ambiguous characters. Also some good twists on who is a "good" guy or "bad" guy while keeping everyone in character.

linkffn(In blood only) A take on the Snape is Harry's father trope. The fic was written before half blood prince so it's not completely canon, but Snape is quite in character personality wise and the end result of his and Harry's relationship is hilariously disastrous.

linkffn(Stronger than hope) Snape mentors Harry fic where Snape is not a particularly good person. Lots of focus on occlumency and legilimency.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux) Voldemorts horcrux awakens in Harry's head and starts talking to him. A good portrayal of him influencing Harry's personality and his thought processes while being influenced by him as well.

linkffn(Rectifier) Sadly abandoned, but quite good. A Tom Riddle researcher who never turned into an evil murderer from another universe travels to the canon universe and becomes a professor at Hogwarts. Has a good explanation for how he could have possibly turned out "good" while keeping him consistent with Voldemorts character.

linkao3(Keep Your Enemies Closer by Riddletobien) A Voldemort won at some point during Harry's Hogwarts years. Quite dark at times.

But no, movie!Snape is almost nothing like book!Snape. In the books, he is an unrepentant asshole, a greasy and mean spirited man with almost no redeeming qualities outside that he happens to work for the good guys to get his revenge. In the movies, Snape is Alan Rickman in a black wig. He's funny, charismatic, and has a commanding presence. That makes for a good movie character. But he is everything the Snape isn't.

Alan Rickman was frankly too good a guy to be anything but a lousy choice for Snape.

** Here's my response from the last time this was discussed:

Ugh, I hate giving possible explanations for Snape's deplorable behavior because everyone always assumes it means I condone it, which I don't, I'm just good at empathizing with people, but here goes:

This happened during GoF right? So for, what 13 years or so, he's been sort of hanging out at Hogwarts, to protect Harry, just in case Voldemort comes back. You're a good guy now, but you can't be too good, have to keep up appearances. Everyone knows you're an asshole anyway, that's not hard to maintain. After all, you are an asshole, no use pretending. So just, keep your eyes open, keep up the status quo.There was that Quirrel thing. That was scary. And the ghost-ish thing in the chamber of secrets... But this year, it's different. Your mark is getting darker. Voldemort is coming back. Like really coming back. SOON. This is no longer an academic exercise. You're going to have to go back. For real. To him. And be fucking convincing about it. And not just when you're there, at DE meetings, but all the damn time. There is no relaxing your guard anymore. No letting things go. You have to be a full time bad guy now. Because you're being watched. Hell, half the students in your house are the children of DE's and nothing wins mommy's and daddy's approval like juicy gossip. "Draco and Harry got in a fight and Master Snape gave Draco detention!" "Draco put a really sweet hex on that mudblood bitch, but you'll never believe it, Snape yelled at him for it and took it back off! I thought he hated mudbloods just like us?" shudder No. When Voldemort comes back, (and he IS coming back this time, and soon, you know it, Karkaroff knows it, just look at your bloody arm!) he has to believe that you've been his this whole time. Can't have any questions or doubts to try and explain away. Maybe later you can back off a bit, but not now, not now. So Draco is smirking and Pansy and the rest of your Slytherins are behind you Iaughing their heads off and you better just sneer and say "I see no difference." if you want to live to follow Dumbledore's orders.

Again. A truly truly perfectly good person would not be able to talk themselves into any excuse for bullying children. But Snape was not. He was a messed up dysfunctional human being in an impossible situation that Dumbledore was able to use precisely because he was so messed up. Which I have issues with, but that's a whole nother thing 😉

He gives the appearance of being part of the dueling club to favor his house, but he's looking at the bigger threat, when no one else is.

Book 3 he damn well knew Lupin was with kids when he ran after him.

Book 4 he is investigating Karkaroff and Moody the whole time.

i mean, what significance does him being shitty have? him being mean to children doesn't have any lasting consequence on...anything. he's even forgiven by the child he was primarily mean to. hermione doesn't even hate him for the act above

he agreed to murder dumbledore and then protected draco against voldemort to spare his soul, and let the wizarding world hate him for a crime he didn't commit. that's...extremely significant. he's the one who told harry about the horcrux inside him, gave him the sword, protected the kids at hogwarts where he could, saved dumbledore, tried to save lupin. he himself says he's saved people when it was possible

Seriously? So as long as you're doing good stuff, you can also do a bunch of shitty things too and be all good? We're talking about redemption here. You don't get to do a bunch of bad shit, and then more bad shit with some good sprinkled in there and call yourself redeemed.

#+begin_quote
  him being mean to children doesn't have any lasting consequence on...anything
#+end_quote

He was a straight up horrible bully to children, worse than whatever James did to him. He made children cry. What lasting effects could there to bullying children? Is this a real question? Just because JK Rowling jumped right over psychological issues doesn't mean that what he did wasn't completely horrible.

#+begin_quote
  he agreed to murder dumbledore and then protected draco against voldemort to spare his soul

Draco was never going to kill Dumbledore. Harry thought so, Dumbledore thought so, and Snape only did it because Dumbledore asked him to and because he made a vow.

#+begin_quote

This wasn't heroic or some great deed. He passed on information. Wow, so redeeming. Wow, he put a sword at the bottom of a pond because Dumbledore told him to. So worthy of redemption.

#+begin_quote
  tried to save lupin
#+end_quote

What? When? I remember him trying to give Lupin a fate worse than death, but certainly not trying to save him.

Listen, the only reason he even switched sides was because Voldemort was going to hunt Lily down. That's fucking it. Dumbledore even points out this, that Snape only cared for Lily and didn't give a shit for what happened to James and Harry.

Yes, he did good things. But he also did a lot of shitty things. He was willing to give two people a fate worse than death in PoA even when he /knew/ there was more to the story. JK Rowling herself has said that he's a /very/ sadistic person.

*TL;DR: He's a sack of shit that attempted to redeem himself but ultimately let his bitterness and immaturity lead him to failure in that regard.*

** If I may: jerk =/= evil. Professor Snape was a man with a bitter temper and rather mean sense of humor. He was (utterly) lacking in basic human decency when it came to day-to-day dealings, but if we're being honest, this is a trait he shared with young James. I see both of them as essentially the same unlikable-but-not-evil people when they were young, two merciless bullies each very convinced they were sufficiently above everyone else they were allowed to pick on others for fun. James grew out of it, Snape didn't.

But again, I see Snape as /mean/, but not /evil/, those being two different things. Teacher is clearly not the profession he was meant for, but people don't deserve to go to Azkaban just because they tease and mock in a rather cruel fashion. Snape /was/ in the end a good character, just not one any of us would want to socialize with.

About this particular moment, again, I think it's not so much that he "enjoyed making kids cry" as that he enjoyed being mean and sarcastic about life in general, and didn't give a damn if it upset other people' feelings.

Come on now, /you're completely ignoring the fact that he was a Death Eater/, and a loyal one. He knew that telling Voldemort about the prophecy would condemn an entire family to death, and he did it anyway. Not only was he a Death Eater, he was a highly ranked, and highly trusted one as well - he asked Voldemort to spare Lily's life, and Voldemort /complied/. Voldemort was willing to spare the life of a muggleborn because Snape asked him to! What kinds of atrocities does someone have to commit in order to get on Voldemorts good side to that extent?

So in my opinion, Snape is far beyond "/mean/", and well into "evil" territory not for his inexcusable actions as a teacher, but for his conduct as a terrorist.

***** I never said that he was "one of the most trusted" Death Eaters, just highly trusted, I believe that's an important distinction to make.

My reasoning is based on Voldemort's instability and casual cruelty - we see it in GoF when he's freshly resurrected; Pettigrew had just gone 'to hell and back' to return Voldemort to a body, and yet he was left to suffer and bleed until Voldemort felt like healing his arm.

If /that/ is how Voldemort rewards a servant who brings him back to life, telling him about a prophecy is small potatoes in comparison. So it stands to reason that Snape was held in very high esteem to even /dare/ ask for that kind of favor, and even higher esteem that the favor was granted.

After all, Voldemort hated muggles and muggleborns, it was trying to murder them all, so sparing Lily went /completely/ against his ideology, and people (especially madmen like Voldemort) don't like going against their personal ideologies.

As for wanting to kill all muggleborns. It's always been my theory that while he absolutely despises muggles, he doesn't really care about blood purity that much and mostly preaches it so much to court all the purebloods. Why would he hold Snape, a half blood in such high regard if blood purity was so important to him.

I think there's room for interpretation on just how awful what Snape did was (I think it's conceivable Voldemort just thought well of him thanks to his Potion and Duelling skills, and how useful they made him, as opposed to any /particularly/ horrible deeds), and with that in mind I think his years of atonement, spywork and eventual death are enough to redeem him at the end of the day. But if you're arguing /that/ way, I can respect your opinion.

/However/, that is not what OP was doing. The original post took his /jeering at Hermione/ as a counter to "Snape was only a human, and a forgivable person". Regardless of his Death Eaterism, I think you can agree that OP's argument was rather lame.

What makes you so sure? At the least, the way I've seen TrueDeathEater!Snape written, and the way Rowling seems to present him before the reveal, is that like Voldemort he used the Death Eater movement as an excuse to let loose and practice dark magic. I don't think there's any substancial evidence that he "truly believed" in blood purity, except his using the word "mudblood" which I think had more to do with fitting in with Mucliber and Co. than with his true beliefs.

As for enjoying people's suffering... again, I don't know if we can safely conclude he was sadistic in the same way as someone like Bellatrix. He enjoyed /winning/, he enjoyed defeating people, he was a vengeful man; but would he be the kind of man to use the Cruciatus, I don't know. As I wrote above, I see his jabs more as extreme cynism and misanthropy ("I'm going to do what /I/ think is funny and/or liberating, and to hell with what the other pathetic apes think").

But whatever the case may be, you're kind of answering besides my comment. OP was trying to use his teasing Hermione as evidence that he was an evil unredeemable scumbag, which I think it's a wrong, lame argument, regardless of whether he really was evil or not.

** I'm ready for the downvotes. Here goes.

Snape didn't turn out to be a great person. However, shallow posts never ask why. They never look into Snape's past; instead, they turn into the equivalent of judging a book by its cover.

So, let's take a look at Snape.

Snape had a miserable childhood. His only positive friend that we know off was Lily Evans. Who were the others? Sons of Death Eaters. Now, most children strive to conform to the ideology of their peer group -- that's just basic psychology. In Snape's case, this would be reinforced by the actions of the more egalitarian clique, aka, the Marauders. Now, if there is any person in here that thinks a child would go, “Well, Sirius Black and James Potter have bullied me mercilessly for years and almost murdered me on one occasion, but they sure have some swell ideas about muggleborns,” please, realize you are deluding yourself. Snape would have been pushed towards the only people that showed him any consideration -- the Death Eaters.

Now, let's take a look at Snape's adolescence. Maybe he had a happy life here, right? I mean, otherwise the “Snape-hate” narrative becomes a little narrow-minded. Oh, but wait. Snape was a child soldier. That doesn't sound so good, does it? Now, some of you may say at this point: But he chose this life! It was his decision! And, once again, you're missing the point. No, Snape really didn't have any other options available to him. He was a bullied teenager, reviled for his looks (he's an ugly git with sallow skin and greasy hair -- EVIL, amiright?) and his poor clothes by the people regarded as the “heroes.” It's natural he would have joined the group opposing them.

As a side note, how many school shootings in America are perpetrated by bullied, outcast students -- just like Snape was?

Now, let's move on. Lily dies. Snape is overcome by feelings -- some of them not very positive. Again, given his history, an expected reaction. What does he do? Does he ignore her death? Carry on as a soldier in Voldemort's army? No, he betrays Voldemort. That's right, he betrays the homicidal megalomaniac that will torture him to death if he finds out. Oh, and let's not forget that Voldemort can READ MINDS. Snape defies Voldemort for years -- how many of you would have done the same? Hmm? Any volunteers to risk torture and death for no other reason than guilt?

Somehow -- and I'm still flabbergasted as to why -- people overlook all this. They get hung up on his oily hair, proving, that even in books characters can be judged by their appearance. They get offended by his treatment of children. Go be bullied all your childhood, join a gang, fight a war while risking death from BOTH sides of the conflict -- see if you turn out any better.

In all his life, Snape probably could count on his fingers the number of times he was happy. To put it plainly, his life sucked. He needed therapy. But, despite everything, he managed to turn away from Voldemort. I would argue that 99.9% of people wouldn't have had the courage or the conviction or the strength of character to do what he did: to risk it all and lose it all for...what? A memory?

But, no. Let's all hate Snape. He bullied children, and was a greasy-haired git.

In addition, Death Eaters were probably getting progressively worse as the war went on, just like the Nazis, who didn't appear nearly as bad in 1936 vs in 1942. In fact, as late as in 1938, there were huge rallies in America supporting the Nazis, and American industrialists such as Henry Ford were still very busy kissing Hitler's ass.

There was no quitting from the Death Eaters. Regulus was another example who found out the hard way.

*** This 'shitty life, no options' thing actually makes me think of Sirius. At 11, he decided he didn't want to be like his psycho family. At 16, he ran away from them entirely instead of falling in line. Despite this, he gets thrown into Azkaban by his own side with no trial and apparently not a one of the people he fought with speaking with him. Instead of that turning him, all of his anger and his hate remain directed at Voldemort and his followers, and he dies fighting against his own family. (Note that Regulus also dies at 18 defying Voldemort. No matter what side they were on, the Black's were freaking hardcore.)

Now, I've heard the argument that 'Sirius had friends. Snape didn't.' However, Snape did have a friend. He had Lily. He ended up in a different house from her, but remember that he wanted Slytherin despite Slytherin seemingly having a pretty crappy reputation that wouldn't be good to or accepting of Lily. He still wanted that. He still made friends with people that hated people like her. We also don't know if his looks were the sole reason he had no friends outside of that or if it was his sullen attitude that made it so that Lily couldn't even convince her friends he was decent. You're placing a lot of emphasis on his looks here when, really, Snape had a shitty, unpleasant attitude and that's documented in the books. Slughorn was ugly but he knew how to get in with people. Narcissa was pretty but her attitude and accompanying facial expressions made her unattractive. You're the one placing so much importance on his looks by arguing that's all people saw in him.

I'm not saying there wasn't tragedy in his life. I just call BS on the 'no options' line of thinking, He did make choices. He made them because he was young and foolish and bitter, but he still made them. You can say it would have been hard for him to choose differently but so what? "We must all face the choice of what is right and what is easy," remember? He wanted power and he went for it in the shittiest way, a way that lost him a good friend and then got her murdered.

**** Honestly, I like this argument. Sirius is a good example of how Snape could have made different choice as a kid. Several points, however.

One: Like I pointed out in my original post, your social circle usually determined your outlook on life, on what is right and what is wrong. Sirius did have friends -- and those friends held opposite values compared to Snape's associates.

Two: As I understand, Snape really dove into the DE camp after Lily's rejection. I don't know about about you, but I find that throwing away a friend over a word thrown in anger and despair is not very friend-like. And, sure, there were things leading up to that, but, point is: Lily was his sole tether to anything good in the world. With it gone, he made the worst choices.

And, yes, those were his choices. You're right. But, as you point out yourself, they were made as a kid. And kids make terrible choices all the time. That's why, when we judge them, we factor in age as a mitigating factor.

Snape paid for his choices -- those done at a young age, when he was bitter and full of resentment -- all his life. He paid most heavily for them, but pay he did, despite the fact that nothing forced him to, except his own guilt and conscience -- and when most people probably wouldn't have, and that's why I find him a hero.

And I'll have to say that racial slurs is at least a notch higher than your usual swear word. And why is Snape given leeway for his misdeeds as a kid but not Lily or James or Sirius.

There always seems to be an either or in this discussions that I quite frankly am tired of. No mater what is discussed it is an either or scenario for people.

***** You don't just look up to positive adult influences because they exist. You make a choice to look to them and emulate them instead of the other crappy influences in your life. Sirius made that choice, with his uncle and with James' parents. Snape was at a school with decent adults and Lily's parents seemed to be decent adults. He wasn't just surrounded by shit influences.

Sure, Snape was bullied. Sirius wasn't. Sirius was combating an upbringing that promoted prejudice and supported murder as a way to achieve purity and had to cut himself off from his parents and sibling to be somebody good. Snape wasn't in Sirius' situation any more than Sirius is in his. Their situations aren't identical. I never said they were. I was using Sirius as an example of someone who, at the age of 11, was already making choices about what life he wanted even though following in his parent's footsteps and supporting Voldemort would have seemed "natural". (And he probably would have gotten similar "but his life sucked" defenses on here if he'd been the reformed death eater.)

I don't know what that comment about him being abused has to do with Snape maybe not having friends because he had a shitty attitude. It's a reason for his attitude but it comes down to the same thing with classmates. He treated people like shit and nobody was obligated to put up with that.

i mean, many children look up to the adults in their life because they take an active, ~positive interest in /them/. the onus is on the /adult/ to seek out and mentor the child

the point i'm making is that choices aren't made in a vacuum. hence bringing up sirius at all is pointless, because he doesn't have snape's experiences. you might as well bring up anybody else. and you're making a lot of assumptions about sirius and the context in which he made his choices. his disentangling from his family could easily be seen as an intuitive split from people that were neglectful, pressuring, abusive then he was exposed to james and gryffindor, etc. just like snape going against his father and extending that to all muggles can also be understood intuitively, then being exposed to lucius, bullied by james and sirius and needing protection and security from an opposed group, etc.

as for snape having friends. eh, i'm saying we have no proof he struck first, that he was mean to random people etc. we only see that as an adult. as a kid, he's mostly mean to people that are mean to him

******* Except the child does not have to accept the adult in their life. That's my point. It's not as simple as 'positive adult influence = better life'. Even kids have parts to play and choices to make.

And of course I'm making assumptions about Sirius because we didn't have a marauders story. We got glimpses of their past. Even talk about Snape is based on a lot of assumptions (that nobody else tried to reach out to him, that people disliked him all because of his looks, that he was seeking security from people like Lucius instead of seeking power, that Snape was some kind of death eater that didn't kill/torture as I see some claiming.) We have to assume a lot because we actually know very little about any of their lives.

And, if bringing up examples is pointless, we can't have this discussion at all. Everything we think we know about abused and bullied children is based on studies of other abused and/or bullied children who don't have Snape's experiences. Every time we try to examine a character's motivations, it's based off personal knowledge or experiences. That's why people can see one character's actions in a dozen different ways. The post I responded to was even using school shooters as an example of victim response. There's no such things as choices made in a vacuum, but there's also no such thing as judgements or character analysis made in a vacuum.

eh, the 'assumptions' i'm making are taking cues from things jkr has said, because she created the characters and designed their arcs. i haven't read much or anything to support your claims about sirius, whereas she has directly said and supported a lot of statements about snape, why he is the way he is, why he joined the DEs, etc. that he was vulnerable, that he was an outcast, that he should have been treated more kindly, that he was bullied and thus became a bully, that he values goodness. she even partially condemns ootp sirius for not looking to see the positives in snape, which is a lot, even for me. if the only way we could know their backstory and minds is if she wrote about it, then what she thinks is relevant, and we know what she thinks. i don't it's a claim to make that she's a 'snape apologist', because she is. she has her protag forgive him even though he never even apologises to him. she's always going to characterise his bad actions with an element of sympathy, because he's a main character and she cares about him in a way she just doesn't for a lot of other characters

********* What claims about Sirius are unsupported? We know he made a choice to travel a different path at 11 because he remarks on how his whole family was Slytherin and then happily talks about breaking this tradition. We know his family is against muggles and muggleborns because we met his dear old mother in the photograph. We know they were okay with murder to purify the wizarding world because Sirius says so, that they thought Voldemort had the right idea and their views are what led to his brother becoming a death eater. We know he defied them throughout his teenage years because Harry remarks on how he stuck muggle banners and Gryffindor banners on his wall with a permanent sticking charm. We know him leaving them at 16 was a big matter because he was blasted off the family tree for it and he thinks his uncle was blasted off for supporting him. We know he went to the Potters himself because he remarks that they took him as a second son after he ran away. We know why he left because Harry asked him and he says he had enough of their beliefs about blood purity and the superiority of their family. We know he had to be cut off from the family to be something good because he says himself that anyone halfway decent in his family has to be disowned. The books themselves say a good amount about Sirius.

The most relevant comment from Rowling about Snape is probably: "He was all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world." Snape was both a victim and an aggressor. She says he valued goodness but couldn't emulate it.

As for Merope being a better example, I completely disagree. The original post I responded to was talking about how Snape's choice to associate and become a death eater was natural given his situation. That's what my example was about, another situation in which it would have been easy for someone to make all the wrong choices and end up a death eater. Whether their situations were identical isn't the point. The relevant similarity is that both of their situations could have easily led them to the same endpoint (being a death eater). Or, to summarize my point in all of this: Snape made crappy choices when he was younger.

I'm not sure what that end part means. Yes, they behave and act in the context of their arcs. However, characters actions and their arcs still need to be interpreted by the reader. It's why people can view Snape/Lily so very differently. For some, it's sweet and enduring. For others, it's obsessive and selfish. These two ideas are created from personal beliefs and experiences and create judgements and analysis that can be wildly different. That's what I mean about it not happening in a vacuum.

We don't have Sirius' POV so using the facts to support it is the only thing we can do. And nothing about Snape invalidates what many say about him. He made crappy choices that put him in the situation he was in. Tragic reasons and bad influences don't invalidate that. Agree to disagree on that, I guess.

Not all interpretations have the same merit unless they're all based on logic and facts from the books. If someone can support their argument with logic and facts, it has merit, and the logic and facts can still result in very different interpretations.

As for choices not being made in a vacuum I'll point to you that Sirius most likely was pressured to joining Slytherin by his family. But he didn't, and he still had to live there for 5 years. You don't think that they'd try to 'convert' him back to their point of view.

As for Snape only turning bad when exposed to the Slytherins I'll have to call bullshit. As I've already said he knew more hexes and curses than most seventh years when he started. That does not point towards him being a happy go lucky kind of kid. He was troubled and that shows, but that does not excuse his behavior. Did Harry turn out as bad as Snape? No, he didn't, and they had more or less the same formative years. The only difference is that one chose to rise above his upbringing and one chose to want revenge for it.

snape was relentlessly abused by james and sirius. we know that because jkr said it. and the only proof for that 'knows more curses' quote is sirius, who isn't an objective source. only jkr is, really

***** You can still hold people morally culpable where other people in the same circumstances would likely have done the same. This idea is the foundation of the principle that necessity is not a defence for murder.

It's an interesting historical public debate - the case of R v Dudley and Stephens (1884). Essentially a group of four sailors had become shipwrecked and escaped in a lifeboat. Three of them killed and ate the fourth in what was at the time an accepted "Custom of the Sea" - the idea that it was necessary that one should die, rather than four.

The case caused a huge public debate and resulted in a judicial decision that stands as good law to this day, not only in England and Wales but also in the USA, Canada, Australia, India, etc.

Some excerpts:

#+begin_quote
  To preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of instances in which it is a man's duty not to live, but to die. The duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the passengers, of soldiers to women and children, as in the noble case of the Birkenhead; these duties impose on men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives for others, from which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk.

  ...

  We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it, nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the crime.

Snape's moral duty remained to be a good person, notwithstanding that he had a troubled upbringing. If moral duties disappeared simply because they were difficult to achieve, it wouldn't really be morality anymore - merely convenience.

****** That's a very good point, but it stresses the legal culpability of actions, not the moral ones. A court of law found the survivors on the boat guilty due to specific details pertaining to the case (like their inability to predict the future, which removed the justification for murder), but we're not a court of law, and we're judging a character based on an entirely different set of principles.

But let's say that it was Snape's moral duty to act like a “good” person. At its core, that's a decent a decent argument. I will be the first to admit that Snape was generally an unpleasant and downright mean individual. However, this view is often taken to an extreme by a variety of Snape-haters; they perceive him through a rigid set of Boolean principles: If bullied children, then EVIL, everything else -- doesn't matter. My post was an attempt to explain why that's a narrow-minded view; that not everything in this world is strictly black or white.

You don't have to like Snape. But there is so much more to him than a mean teacher. And to deny that is a butchery of his character.

This fundamentally misunderstands the kind of spy Snape is. Both sides know he is a spy, there's no secret to it. If the Death Eaters question his actions, he can point towards needing to convince Dumbledore that he is loyal to the Order (as he did to Bellatrix in HBP). If the Order questions his actions, he can point towards needing to convince Voldemort that he is loyal to the Death Eaters.

The result is that there is no burden on Snape to behave in accordance with any particular side. He can just do what he wants - which he does.

** I don't mind Snape, I think he's one of the more interesting characters to explore in fanfiction.

But what I can't stand is when apologists make out James Potter as the worst human being alive because he was a bully as a teenager. Some are even deluded enough to portray this as being morally equivalent to joining Voldemort, which is /absurd/.

I mean look, I was plenty bullied as a kid, I've been publically embarrassed and whatnot, but what you come to realise is that bullies are not usually terrible people. If you spend your school years being mean to kids usually it's caused by all sorts of personal issues, coming from abusive families themselves etc. A lot of people stop doing it when they grow up, some don't - I also bullied some kids once I became pissed enough at my own circumstances, and before I sorted myself out. It's a vicious cycle that's hard to break, but it doesn't make you a VILLAIN.

From the information we're given, Snape clearly wasn't a darling in Hogwarts. Everyone knew he was into the Dark Arts, he hanged out with the worst blood purists etc. Bullying him, as much as some people can't seem to get over it, is not surprising or uniquely horrible. Kids get bullied for being slightly different, let alone being creepy and surly Slytherins. The Marauders had their own issues but it doesn't compare to what Snape did during his life.

** I'm on the fence with Snape - don't like nor dislike him, but I respect him for the choices he made in the end.

** I hope every snape guzzler meets and falls in love with a real life version of him so we can all laugh when they find out he's not a mysterious and complicated lover hes just a creepy piece of shit.

Am I always this caustic?

*** You can like the character and have no desire to ever meet anyone like them in real life. Its fiction, these people don't actually exist so I don't see why it matters whether someone likes to read fiction with them or not. Lots of people like villains in books and movies (another poster on here mentioned the Joker as an example of terrible and yet very popular character.) and yet no one accuses Joker fans to want to be best friends with a serial killer/murderer in real life.
