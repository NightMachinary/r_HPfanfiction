I don't know the exact word for it but, I am willing to look over anyone's fic that they want to fix grammar, potential plotholes, etc.

**** Go for it! Like I said, there's never enough Beta Readers, we could always use more. Just don't be afraid to be picky and only take on projects you're interested in/have time for because there's a good chance you'll get flooded. Oh, and be realistic about what you can and cannot do. Clear communication is the basis of a good relationship, after all.

** There are various words; proofread, beta, SPAG checking (SPelling And Grammar).

I don't have my own story for you, but I'm actually doing a proofread of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series at the moment, if you want to cooperate. It's about 1.5 million words in four books (book five will likely begin in a few months), so it's on the larger end of beta projects I've done; I expect I'll be working on it for a while.

*** I've heard Pureblood Pretense series is extremely good from different sources and I really enjoyed it so far. I should be able to cooperate with you if you want after I complete finishing reading the end of book 4. If you are sure you want me to help out can you please chat me in the chat bar?

** I just read a fic that I REALLY enjoyed, but it is borderline Engrish. I was sorely tempted to reach out to the author and offer to beta the thing. Then I thought that might be a bit arrogant considering my resume is "reading everything that I can get my hands on for ~40 years" and not much else. Not like my degree is in English or anything. Though I AM a "grammar nazi" by all accounts. Maybe some day.

** I have a fanfiction I could use some help with. It's not very far along and I already have a beta, but I've been looking for someone else to help out. It s called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13805266/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Way-of-Things][Harry Potter and the Way of Things]]. If you read the chapters I have posted, and you like it, you could start helping whenever.

*** The term OP is looking for is beta read. To adopt a fic is to take over the fic from the original author and continue it without their input.
