Dumbledore hires a Dada artist to teach DADA.


** "And so with no further ado, I'd like to introduce Professor Duchamp!" Dumbledore looked out at the Great Hall over the rim of his spectacles, eyes twinkling, and made a sweeping gesture towards the newest occupant of the head table.

The students craned their necks to have a look at the unassuming Frenchman who sat there, cleaning his out his smoking pipe. He was seated next to Professor Snape.

Curisouly, and for the first time in many years, Snape appeared to be unbothered by the presence of the latest person appointed to the DADA position instead of him. And, though no one would dare say it, he also appeared to be amused.

There were many reasons for this--- among them, Duchamp's resolute silence. Or the fact that a dozen chess pieces had fallen from the folds of his cloak when he'd sat down. Or, as the students would have noticed had they been able to see from a higher vantage point, that throughout diner he drank his pumpkin juice with a spoon, saved sugar cubes in his pockets, and ate off of the underside of his plate.

It was no matter.

Nothing prepared his first class of term for what they saw when they walked into the defense classroom.

All of the desks and chairs, save for a stool with a bicycle wheel attached to the seat, were standing on the ceiling. A snow shovel hung among them, suspended from a rafter. Nearer the front of the classroom sat a cage full of sugar cubes as well as a cup and teaspoon placed upon a small saucer--- each item covered in fur.

Silence only reigned for a moment.

Before half the students could orient themselves, the professor turned towards them and asked, "Why Not Sneeze, Rose SÃ©lavy?"

When he was met with odd looks and confused silence, he merely laughed and waved questions away with a dismissive gesture. "It's alright," he huffed, "I wasn't really asking. Now come, come. Here's something you should see. My freind Meret made it years ago---remarkable object. Just remarkable."

It took a moment but the stunned, and tremendously cautious, students gathered around his desk. Unprompted, they followed his lead and began to stare at the teacup.

He let them contemplate it in silence for fifteen full minutes before a student, who'd spent half the time gathering up the courage to interrupt their class' impromptu meditation, spoke up.

"Sir?"

Professor Duchamp looked up as though awfully startled, his unlit pipe bobbing along with his head, but responded with a polite, quizzical look.

When he said nothing the student went on. "Erm... Sir. Sir, I was wondering what exactly that is and what exactly we are doing."

"Ah, yes." Duchamp sighed, taking his pipe in one hand and rubbing his chin with the other. " Yes. I was wondering the very same thing."

** The canon curse on the DADA Professor position is, itself, a dadaist installation. It subverts the dominant paradigm of defending against the Dark Arts---learn some spells here, learn about some creatures and countermeasures there---and makes one question what /is/ "defence", ultimately?

In Year 1, we get Quirrelmort, whose (apparent) speech impediment prevents him from actually teaching. Thus, we are asked to ask, is the class about the teacher teaching or about the students learning?

In Year 2, we get Gilderoy Lockhart. He is, in the conventional sense, defenceless, yet also practices his own form of defence, both by cultivating being loved so that no one wants to harm him in the first place and by cultivating a reputation of being powerful so that those who do want to harm him are afraid to. We are asked to consider, does this defence-by-reputation count as "DADA"?

In Year 3, we get Remus Lupin, a dangerous creature, teaching the students about dangerous creatures. The self-referential nature of his class is further underscored by students having to face a Boggart, because ultimately, the boggart represents one's own worst fears, as opposed to an external opponent. Remus Lupin makes us ask, is learning to defend against the Dark Arts first and foremost about learning to defend against oneself?

In Year 4, Barty Crouch Jr, posing as Alastor Moody, raises the classic question of whether one can learn to fight monsters without becoming a monster. In a true dada spirit, the answer is left ambiguous. Here we also link the theme of Year 3 and the theme of Years 6 and 7: Viktor Krum, the representative of the Durmstrang Institute, which actually teaches Dark Arts from which DADA is supposed to defend, is himself brought low by a Dark curse (the Imperius). We are thus reminded that even becoming a monster does not defend one against monsters.

This duality is further explored in Year 5, when there are effectively two DADA teachers, Dolores Umbridge and Harry Potter. Dolores Umbridge represents defence by recourse to law: the students are asked to surrender their personal capacity for violence in order to benefit from the protection of the state. Harry Potter's clandestine lessons then represent anarchic principles of self-reliance and mutual aid. Ultimately, we are shown the flaws of both approaches: Dolores Umbridge forcibly shuts down Harry Potter's project, but her own project is then itself undone by its internal contradictions and found fragile when confronted with the state of nature (the centaurs). As with the other years, this part of the installation leaves us with more questions than answers.

Years 6 and 7 should be viewed as a single unit. Year 6 taunts us by offering to supposedly reconstruct the traditional notion of DADA by appointing a teacher who is competent, experienced, and highly motivated to teach: Severus Snape is the perfect teacher. And, indeed, everything seems to go well. Indeed, instead of being removed, this "perfect teacher" is in fact /promoted/ in Year 7 to be the headmaster (an allusion to Peter's Principle?), able to expand his traditional DADA paradigm to the rest of the school. And, it is here that we see the climax of the installation, as Defence Against the Dark Arts class itself is destroyed (reduced?) and becomes the Dark Arts class.

Some may interpret this as answering the question posed by Year 4: that no, one cannot learn to fight monsters without becoming a monster: that there is ultimately no difference between Defence Against the Dark Arts and the Dark Arts themselves. Others argue that the point being made by the artist is far more subtle and nuanced: that the line between the Dark Arts and Defence Against the Dark Arts has /always/ been a fine one; more broadly, that legitimatised state violence must always walk a fine line, and that even if a particular teacher (leader, governor, etc.) may be perfect, they are always one step from descending into tyranny, and, furthermore, that having a perfect representative of legitimatised violence (Severus Snape) given more power will not solve this problem but will in fact exacerbate it.

In the proud tradition of dada, this installation makes us to confront our assumptions about dominant paradigms of defence and does not provide us with simple answers. As with many dadaist works, this is by far not the only valid interpretation, and the reader is encouraged to offer their own.

** Fred and George knew the exact moment they would dedicate their lives to absurdity. Professor Hugo Ball had not even lasted a full school term before he had tenured his resignation on the grounds that he was obliged to shake up the establishment. And so for the next several weeks that followed many bizarre events occurred. Three dinners in a row the gravy boats serenaded their potatoes, much to Snape's ire and Dumbledore's humor. Every prefect had reported furniture flipped up onto the ceiling of their respective house's common room. Portraits squeaked angrily from their frames, their canvases charmed to turn their voices into unintelligible sighs, ahhs, and groans. Luckily, the Ravenclaw Common Room was not guarded by a portrait but an enchanted and unscathed knocker. The other house prefects had been tasked with standing watch at the portrait entrances of Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Slytherin to permit students entry.

"Brilliant... even genius!" George whispered while his twin nodded in agreement as they studied Professor Ball's latest found demonstration. One of Hogwarts many suits of armor had been dramatically altered. In place of the helmet was an old leather boot split off from the sole with a rather realistic tongue lolling out. The left arm was aloft with a set of scales precariously dangled with an ever unbalanced load that rocked up and down at alternating speeds and depths. Lastly but not least were the feet, the right foot now sported a muggle roller skate while the left was planted firmly into an aquarium filled with live tadpoles.

"What does it even mean!?" Their brother Percy whisper-shrieked his face taught and so white his freckles were visibly paled.

"What does it mean?" Fred yelled incredulously "Gred, he doesn't know what it means!" George tutted his tongue and shook his head in disappointment.

"It's quite obvious, innit?" George taunted back and the twins were certain they could hear the grinding of their uptight brother's teeth.

"Covered it in our first class, we did." Fred nodded sagely.

"It's a protest against convention." A Ravenclaw student observed. Percy's eyes narrowed in speculation or perhaps suspicion.

"How so?"

"Well it's really up to interpretation, for example, traditionalism and judicialism." The Ravenclaw gestured from the roller skate to the scales.

"That is ABSURD!" Percy shouted, his face almost as scarlet as their house ties. In a flurry of movement an arrhythmic gong clanged as their previously departed Professor Ball appeared in a flurry of tissue streamers. "Yes! 50 points to Gryffindor!" He bellowed through a funnel while Gred and Forge cheered flourishing confetti from their wands in celebration. Percy's shoulders slumped in defeat.
