** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series has alchemy, healing and magical theory courses mentioned, though not till later in the series than the first book.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) is the same.

*** Seconding for The Pureblood Pretense. The story contains magical cores, though, which I know is instant anathema to some on this sub. The Alchemy course in question, while based in part on the author's explanation of magic as her wizards know it, is really neat imo. She does a great job explaining this and other aspects of Rigel/Harry's magical education within the narrative without donning a dry voice or losing the plot.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** I've always wanted to see an Argus Filch insert where they don't let being a squib stop them from being a Wizard.

You don't need a wand to make several potions, rune arrays, rituals, divination, etc...

Bonus points if the character invents something extra controversial like a Gas Powered Wand that uses mana potion capsules but works for squibs and muggles.
