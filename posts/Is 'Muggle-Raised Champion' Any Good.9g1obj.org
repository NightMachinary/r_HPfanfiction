Thoughts on 'Muggle-Raised Champion' for those who've read it? Summary sounds interesting, but I can't decide whether I want to invest time into reading it or not.


** It's very 'trope-y' from what I remember. Some slight 'Lord Potter/Peverell' malarkey at the beginning, complete with cliche goblins. Also Harry was quite unlikable, and it was Harry/Daphne romance so it depends on if you're into that

** I mean, its not terrible if that is what you are wondering. Its technically sound, all things considered.

But the story just never really goes anywhere, and (to insert my own opinion) when I finished reading it I felt like I had to struggle to think of why I had even bothered.

Its the vanilla ice cream of HP fanfiction. Serviceable and not really atrocious in any way but never bothering to do anything interesting. Also more than a little 'muggle-are-awesome' going on.

** It has a decent premise that is written technically well. Nothing special, and you will forget about mostly of it in a week. It's okay.

** Yes, it is quite worth the read. Beyond the generally obvious plot, it is well written, and does an excellent job of twisting canon to support the premise. Stargon1 receives a bit of dislike here (although nothing compared to the rage generated by Robst), and I'm not sure why. His cupboard series is also outstanding.
