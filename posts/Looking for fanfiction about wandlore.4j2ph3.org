I'm looking for a fanfiction that delves deeper into wandlore, and maybe even has Harry become a wandmaker. It MUST be over 70k words, and no slash whatsoever.


** Nothing comes to mine but I would also be interested in wand maker Harry.

** My darkness!harry story has a fair amount of focuslore in it but harry isn't a wandmaker or to become one nor is it that long yet. Linkffn(darkness ascendant by cole pascal) you can go to my drabbles to read the free-written precursor story which is near 70k I think.

** Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. By Aaran St Vines

#+begin_quote
  How did magic in Harry Potter's world come into existence? The first witches and wizards weren't just born with wands in their hands, were they?

  Extensive Muggle and magical historical and anthropological research has revealed much, but not the whole story. In 2023, ten years after the master wandmaker's death, a provision of Mr. Ollivander's last will and testament allowed Harry Potter to give several exhaustive interviews telling the wizarding world the Ollivander family history - the founding of the oldest wizarding business in the world. Finally, the StoryTeller can chronicle this in a readable manner -- from Harry's eyes the summer before his third year.

  A/N - One reader commented that my "382 B.C." is the definitive history of the beginning of magic. However, most readers don't review at all, so don't be that impressed with his kind words.

** linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs) Very, very AU story where wizards and witches are different from humans.

There is also a big disparity in the numbers of wizards and witches. Wand lore comes into it in the second 'book' of the trilogy where it plays a very important role.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
