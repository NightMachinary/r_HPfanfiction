Just a random idea I had. At some point harry finds maybe a baby dementor and it bonds with him and its happiness sucking powers dont work on him or anyone he actually likes or isnt a threat and it protects him from stuff like the other dementors in 3rd year or defects Voldemort in Quirrel 1st year and eats the soul or something. I'm bad at prompts but I figure this would be a fun crack thing


** Maybe the easy way to kill Voldemort is to suck the souls out of the horcruxes and himself
