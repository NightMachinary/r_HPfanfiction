Is there any fics that utilize the space expansion charms? I know most fics feature a magical trunk or something like that, is there anything other than that?


** Most super!Harry fics include a scene where he supersizes a train compartment. The ones where he converts random barren islands into unplottable self-sustaining nations is a guilty pleasure of mine.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads]] he expands everything he can get his hands on.

**** Meh, you can pretty much just type 'island' in the search bar and get a whole host of similar fics. Aside from CT, off the top of my head, and disregarding the ones where he takes over Azkaban or uses Trunk-space or a space station or something and the rather lackluster exodus to another universe ones: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041][Island of Fire]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9279255/1/On-An-Island-In-The-Sun][On An Island In The Sun]], are probably the most popular. There's one I can't remember the name of where he and Sirius leave and start an island community and families join them as the British scene deteriorates.

Then there's a whole other trend of stories like [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harrys-island-home-harry-potter-that-flies-off-the-rails-quickly.325447/reader][Harry's Island Home]] where it's not so much an independent group so much as Harry just carving out a nook for himself.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): Harry created a massive space using the Elder Wand inside a metal sphere of 20 meters in diameter. It was named the Starship Hedwig, and used to evacuate the remaining few thousands Magicals from the Earth. Space expansion charms became a key magic throughout the story.

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.

That one has tents, boxes, trunks, workshops, archives.. The story itself is quite refreshing.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.
