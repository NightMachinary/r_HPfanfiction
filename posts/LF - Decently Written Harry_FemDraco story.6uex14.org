** Female Draco would be most likely named after a constellation, according to the Black family tradition Narcissa brought over.

That's why I greatly appreciate the name Virgo in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]]. It shows that the author paid attention to details in the HP world.

*** tbh pretty much any fanfic reader should be immersed in lore enough to know that blacks are named after stars/constellations.

**** That should be pretty obvious, and yet most fem!Draco was named in some nonsense such as Draconica.
