So I read a while back some stories where a femharry MOD basically walks all over the avengers. I can't remember more about it. If you know of any story similar I'll read that too. It's something I'm in the mood for


** Are you only wanting FemHarry crossovers or would regular Harry crossovers be ok as well?

**** All of my suggestions are complete unless otherwise noted.

linkffn(Child of the Storm) has Harry as Thor's child and is a massive crossover with mostly Marvel Comics people. The sequel is in progress.

linkffn(Vengeance No Avenger) has Harry getting some Super Soldier Serum and Hermione becoming the She Hulk.

linkffn(The Death of Natasha Romanoff) and it's sequels do have a Fem Harry and Hermione is in there too. This /might/ be what you read but I'm not sure.

There's a couple Hermione/Avengers crossovers as well.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
