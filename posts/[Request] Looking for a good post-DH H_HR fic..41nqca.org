Be it EWE, epilogue-compliant or just plain off-yer-face crazy, I really want to read more of those two together as adults. Preferably without any bashing, but eh, I know that that one's a bit hard to come by.


** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7460&chapterid=&agree=1][Love Lost Love Found by Harry's Mistress]] is fully canon compliant.

It's /really/ fluffy, the conflict is pretty angsty, and the characters are Sue-ish so it's a total guilty pleasure. There's no bashing, though, and I like that the author didn't wave a magic wand over their canon personalities to make them more compatible.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

"He has no idea that she wasn't crying for Ron. Well, she was, but mainly she was crying for herself. Because she knows that if it came to it? She couldn't choose."

If you like that one, there are several well-written post DH H/HR pieces and authors to be found here: [[http://botherandbother.livejournal.com/910.html]]
