Coming off of a break from fanfiction and I really want to get back into what I started reading. It's difficult to find the old original ideas from before JK Rowling finished the series. I'm fine with the cliches, most ships are fine just please no slash.


** Linkffn(Resonance)

This is pre-HBP even, although some concepts from both HBP and DH are utilized in the sequels. Covers Harry's 7th year and auror training.
