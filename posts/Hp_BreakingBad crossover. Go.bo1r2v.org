** "Yeah, Mr. Snape! Potions!" Said Harry to his professor whilst aforementioned was cooking blue beozars.

** "Yes, these whiskers aren't just whiskers. Within five years but in as soon as six months, you're going to be a weasel."

Percy looked at the healer blankly. He had never considered where exactly his surname had come from. It wasn't unheard of for a maledictus to skip several generations, but he had never even heard of a Weasley becoming a Weasel.

But he hadn't risen to the top of the department of magical cooperation and come in second on three separate elections for minister of magic by stopping and giving up when he came upon a problem. He also hadn't ran three separate campaigns for minister of magic without going deep into debt, and he had no intention of letting Audrey, Molly, and Lucy be affected by that debt after his mind was lost to the weasel.

"Uncle Perce? Please tell me you're here because you heard this is where you buy Billyrox and not because you caught me and you're going to tell me to stop or you'll tell my parents."

"Not exactly either one. I find myself in need of some extra income and I expect you understand that having a consistent supply of authentic Australian Billywigs will give you a significant advantage over your competitors. No one's going to choose euphoria elixir over billywig extract if you get access to the real deal."

Roxanne stared intently at her uncle Percy, looking for a tell. He was unlikely to pull a prank like this, but he was even less likely to get into the illegal recreational potions trade. There was a third option.

"And what if I think you've decided that blood is thinner than politics and you're just trying to use me to finger my suppliers, get the lot of us sent to Azkaban?"

"There's a greenhouse in a location thirty kilometers north of here containing a blue silk oak infested with billywig nests, ready to give birth in three days. If you tell the ministry about this conversation, I would go to Azkaban with you."

This gave Roxy pause. The Australians were notoriously protective of their magical flora and fauna, and if this were exposed there was a serious risk of their declaring war on the British ministry. No investigation was worth that kind of risk.

"Uncle Perce... I don't... I mean... why?"

"Never ask me that again, never say a word of this to anyone, and we'll make a lot of money together."

** This is a repost of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3h10vo/harry_potter_the_yob_who_lived/cu3qxep/][my plot bunny from a while ago]].

Harry is Sorted into Slytherin, but he doesn't really fit in, because Slytherins think of themselves as a wizarding aristocracy and vassals of sorts (e.g., Draco and Crabbe and Goyle), and Harry doesn't fit in to that; but, over time, he finds his place in Slytherin as this scrappy wheeler-and-dealer. Meanwhile, Hermione is sorted into Ravenclaw and has a generally pleasant if uninteresting time there, but, due to a lack of active discouragement from Snape (because not she is not a Gryffindor or Harry's friend) and a few other divergences finds herself excelling in Potions in particular.

Fast forward four years. Voldemort is back (somehow), and Slytherin is becoming increasingly uncomfortable for Harry. Money would help, because protective magics and paying people off is expensive. Harry's done recreational (and other) Potions dealing, but his brewing efforts tend not to work out very well (he did minimum necessary in Snape's class). Several times, he almost gets caught. Meanwhile, Hermione, the Potions prodigy, also finds herself in desperate need of money, after her home was targeted by a Death Eater raid. Her parents survived, but they required very expensive magical treatment, because much of the regular magical medicine doesn't work on Muggles.

She approaches Harry with an offer to partner up, with Hermione managing the brewing while continuing to live a respectable life and Harry managing the distribution. Harry agrees for the money, the thrills, and, yes, the product. They set up in the Chamber of Secrets, sneaking ingredients past Filch, with Harry bailing out his distributors when they're caught and trying to not have their product stolen. Eventually, Hermione decides that the money to cure her parents isn't enough, because she must also get enough to set herself and her parents up in France. They grow their operation, clashing with the Weasley Crew (because The Twins also brew to raise startup funds for their joke shop, Ron got involved because he's got nothing better to do, and Ginny wants to emulate Harry Potter), then expanding out of Hogwarts when their product's reputation reaches the Knockturn Alley, bringing new threats and new opportunities.

The whole thing culminates in Harry Potter and the mysterious "Madame Curie" taking out Voldemort because he's in the way of their drug operation, leading to the following epigram:

*Dumbledore:* This is not at all how I had thought the Prophecy would play out, but, very well... As long as they don't try to poison my lemon drops again.

â€‹

Furthermore, this would not be a Harmony 'ship. In a nutshell,

*Hermione "Madame Curie" Granger:* It's arrogant of me, perhaps classist, I know, but, well, I could just do /so much better/ than Harry, even if I didn't have Viktor. People look at him and see a Quiddich player, but the Goblet didn't select him just for his flying skills, you know. I have a dilemma, though: I've developed a most wonderful reflex enhancer, completely undetectable using available techniques, with only a few minor side-effects not worth mentioning. Quiddich captains would pay good galleons for a dose, but I don't want my Viktor to get addicted, and I don't want him to lose because of what I sold to his competitors, you know? Am I being too moralistic?

*Harry "Boy-Who-Cooked" Potter:* Hermione? Are you mental?! She's probably got a bloody checklist for shagging, and two more for what to do before and after! Me, I've got me a Muggle girl back home. Probably gonna marry her some day: you can't really /relax/ around the witches, you know? Rest of the year, what can I say? Gryffindor girls are daring, Ravenclaw girls are curious, Hufflepuff girls are eager to please, Slytherin girls are flexible, and none of them can resist the Potter charm.
