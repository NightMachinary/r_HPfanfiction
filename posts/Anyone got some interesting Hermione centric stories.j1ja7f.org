  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** I mean, the Arithmancer is kind of the obvious rec, so I'll start with that. Hermione likes to do maths (and the fic even properly calls it 'maths' instead of 'math'!) and a lot of problems happen where arithmancy is the solution. Also, Hogwarts is a bit weirder than usual.

linkffn(10070079)

A personal favourite is the Confectionary Chronicles. It's a supernatural crossover, but you don't have to know anything or enjoy Supernatural in any way to like the fic. I literally haven't seen a single episode and know literally nothing more than 'there's a gay angel and they go to hell a couple times' and I've enjoyed the fic considerably.

Trigger warning, the story starts out with a suicide warning for a reason. It's not Hermione, and it's not graphic at all, but it is... vivid. If you don't want to read that, skip forward in the first chapter to a paragraph starting with 'After the funeral, Helen and Richard decide to move away from the area.' You can control+F to search the page, if you're on PC. Phone page searches vary, so I can't help there.

** The rest were recommending the famous long fics, so I figure I'd stick to the relatively shorter ones for now.

- Love Without Questions by teatales - linkao3(22734682)

  - It's a pretty amazing fic. It explores Hermione coming to terms with being aromantic while also delving deep into her insecurities and feelings of loneliness.

- Grateful. - linkao3(3294857)

  - This one is really /really/ short, but it's also very good. It explores the expectations on Hermione's shoulders.

- Set in Stone by bluehasnoclues - linkao3(17396063)

  - This one focuses on Hermione recovering from being Petrified in second year. It's a very good canon divergence, and it really digs deep into the consequences for Hermione.

- Madam Longbottom's Appointment Book by seekeronthepath - link(17868182)

  - Here Hermione is Augusta Longbottom's secretary. It's incomplete, but it updates pretty regularly.

- In Bocca Al Lupo: When Innocence Changed Into Experience by morpholomeg - linkao3(24594295)

  - This is much longer than the previous ones, but it's an amazing take on Werewolf!Hermione. Lupin is prominent here too, but the main focus is Hermione. It's got amazing takes on disability, politics and world-building.

I think this is what I've got or now. I hope you enjoy your reading!
