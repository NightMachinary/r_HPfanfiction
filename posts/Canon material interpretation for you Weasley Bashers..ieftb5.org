So, Mr. Weasley, you say you have some knowledge of a hidden stash in my house? Nonsense, nonsense. But still, it won't do for people to hear someone searched my mansion. How about seven hundred Galleons? I'm sure we can claim it to be some kind of legitimate income. Inheritance or lottery winnings, perhaps?


** The lottery! That's actually a cool prompt (if you really want Weasley bashing), if the lottery prize was Malfoy bribing Mr. Weasney (never mind how out of character it would be for Mr Weasley to be corrupt, but that's what Weasley bashing is anyway, right?)

*** Exactly! Oh, and the Weasleys should still top off their vaults with Harry's money that year too just to be on the safe side.

**** I love a good Weasley bashing but it is canon that the Weasleys are financially irresponsible.

1. They can't afford to buy Ron a wand but they run off to Romania for Christmas.
2. They win the lottery and blow the money going on holiday to Egypt.
3. They only have 1 Galleon and 58 Sickles (approx. 21 pounds) in their Gringotts vault.

***** I agree, I was just poking fun at fanon tropes
