** Fanatical Fics and Where to Find Them is a great one - the presenters take turns reading fanfic gems to each other as well as recommending some good stuff. #trickyourfriends2019

** Potterfic weekly is also one although I didn't like it much. Figured I'd throw it out there in case it's your cup of tea.
