Harry fleur pairing Preferably m and over 50k words


** The propably best fic featuring Harry/Fleur is linkffn(Wastelands of Time) and its sequel heartlands, BUT it is not the best Harry/Fleur out there imo. What I mean here is while the story if exceptional it is not a romance story.

The best recent one is most likely linkffn(Euphoria) (dont get scared by the summary), it is a good rehash and a beliveable story, something so many other storys miss... And here we already are with the best.

Many people enjoyed linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) though I personally wouldnt recomment it, Last but not least I would keep an eye on linkffn(What you leave behind) which is an amazing story which promised Harry/Fleur in the future but have not yet reach that point (and hasnt been updated in quite a while).

Is it even a Harry Potter story? It's well written, but it seems like Harry Potter in name only.

**** It is an massive AU, and with that comes a great many changes. I would agree that one could say it is not really Harry Potter, but that depends on how you define it. While the characters are changed, some more (like Harry) and some less, the story still plays in the Harry Potter universe.

If you search for fics that stay as true to the chars as possible it propably is nothing for you (and in that case dont get me startet on the Alexandra Quick series).

Well that describes "Harry Potter in Name only" perfectly, doesn't it? It has all the names and places of the Harry Potter universe, but the characters are entirely different, the theme is entirely different (dark-edgy travelogue) and the magic is also entirely different (Gods and Demons, Magical swords, etc).

I love AU stories, but there has to be something besides names that ties it back to Harry Potter to be interesting for me.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

My personal favorite is linkffn(Deprived). It was abandoned a while ago, but what's there is very enjoyable.
