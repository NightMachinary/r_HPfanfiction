*** Genuine question, just how good is this? I tend to not read H/Hr unless the writing is like WhiteSquirrel or Starfox level good at least. Thanks.

**** Uh... how to put this? It's like discount White Squirrel. Not quite as good, but same general feel, and some of the ideas are just as good. (For instance, Chapter 3's conversation with Dumbledore which gives additional reasons why Harry had to stay at the Dursleys'.) Besides, it's abandoned and thus rather short. I'd definitely give it a read, especially since, as it stops in Second Year, there's not that much romance at all.

**** Some of the best world building I've seen. Ever. But the writing is a slightly helter skelter. There is very little romance so your dislike of HHr won't really affect enjoyment of this fic.
