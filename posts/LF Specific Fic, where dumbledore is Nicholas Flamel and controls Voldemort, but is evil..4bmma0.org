A fix I read a while ago but it feature an immortal dumbledore who orchestrated the entire war for his own ammusment and is planning on turning Harry into a dark lord.


** Isn't that the one where as part of Dumbledore's dark lord control plan he has Harry marry four women, and it turns out he did the same thing to Voldemort? And Bellatrix was one of Voldemort's wives? Dumbledore died at the end, hit by a bus off-screen, and it was a one-shot?

I cannot for the life of me remember the name or the author.

*** Dammit. I was thinking one-shot.

No wonder I didn't notice when I checked Clell's fics.
