Hello, all,

I had planned to spend the entirety of Thursday recording, however, my iPad (which I use to read aloud on while I am recording) cracked rather badly on Wednesday night and I will be taking it to the Apple Store this afternoon.

I'm afraid I will have to delay this another week.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Happy New Year, (and may 2016 burn in hell)
