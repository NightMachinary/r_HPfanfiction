** It's by Nonjon who I know is recommended frequently, however his older trilogy is fantastic still.

linkffn(2354771)

You've probably already read it, but if not Oh God, Not Again is a classic.

And lastly, I really enjoyed On a Train, Switching Tracks.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  - At 14 years old, Harry wasn't really ready for the Triwizard. If not for Hermione and Barty Crouch Jr, the poor boy would likely have done himself a whole lot of damage if left to his own devices... Of course, if not for Crouch he wouldn't have been IN the tourney, but that's another story. So, I asked myself what if things had gone a bit differently? What if his broom hadn't shown up? What if other... opportunities presented themselves?- There are those who say, if you're not cheating, you're not trying.
