Hi! So for all of the wonderful fanfic writers who give me something to read... how do you do it? I enjoy writing but quickly lose interest after the first few thousand words.

I've started writing at least a dozen fanfics and one or two original books, and never get past the first few thousand words. I think up an amazing plot and want to write it but I just get bored. I'd love to be able to actually stick it out for once though. Last night I thought of a totally original plot idea that I think would make an amazing fanfic. I've never read anything like it in the 15 or so years I've been reading harry potter fanfic. So I'd love to actually try and write it, but I know I'll get a chapter in and just stop.

So any tips or hints or tricks or whatever that you can think of that keep you engaged and motivated?


** I write like three words a day and post a chapter every six months. Easy peasy.

** First and foremost don't feel obligated. /Write because you want to/. If you force yourself to write something you don't want to or aren't interest in it won't end well.

Don't feel like you have to write in a linear fashion. This may be a bit controversial, but you do not have to write chapter 5 after chapter 6. Hell I wrote 4th year before I wrote 2nd year. If you have an idea let yourself explore it. If you have a great ending write it! You can always fix inconsistencies while editing.

Find someone to talk to it about. Whether it be a beta or a fellow writer, or even a friend it helps a lot to talk about what you are writing, and state clearly what your vision is.

Outlining can help a lot I've found. I was in a similar place as you before I started mapping things out. After completing that first chapter sometimes you don't know where to go, if you have some sort of plan you are able to continue.

I will reiterate it again because I feel it is super important. Writing should be fun, not a chore. If you don't find it fun, don't write. Your writing will suffer and it will not be fulfilling. Best of luck to you!

** Outline. Fill in the gaps, even if it's a sentence. I'd start with the exciting parts and then fill in the rest later. For me, I am inspired by other fiction writing, TV, movies etc so even taking a break in writing and watching some TV can help go back and write more. It also helps (me at least) if you can get feedback from someone. Also remember that you don't have to write from start to finish, write from wherever interests you and then go back or forwards. Worst case scenario you can always put your work up for adoption.

#+end_quote

Writing is work. It is not some whimsical easy-breezy thing that just happens because. Think of it more like exercising than anything else. Do most people want to go on a five mile run? There are times when you have to make yourself do it. Motivation and what not is bullshit.

You seem to have some issues with scale too. I don't mean to sound more dickish than I usually do. But a few thousand words is nothing. I can write a few thousand words in an hour. But that's not really relevant. I've often said that it takes me about 40-50 'work hours' to plan/write/edit a 7500-10k word chapter. Of that, probably half of it is the 'writing' portion.

Writing is a process. It takes a great deal of time and effort. Yes, there are parts that are easy and I breeze through, but there are also parts that are hard and the only reason they get completed is because I sit down and do the work.

As a whole I like the effort. I like the feeling of working through it and the accomplishment of completing it. But what most people don't ever realize is the true amount of effort that it takes.

Ideas are a dime a dozen. I have hundreds I'll never pen to paper because i find them less interesting than what I'm currently working on. ideas are utterly irrelevant without the effort.

** It sounds as if you want to be writing oneshots rather than multichapter stories.

But:

It's hard work. Fanfiction is easier than original fiction but it will still reflect the effort you put in. And the effort isn't in starting a story; that's the easy bit. It isn't always in finishing it. It's in getting through the middle. You have to be persistent.

I don't start posting a story until it's finished. My first story (which I now see isn't all that good and is being rewritten) took me about six months to write and it's about 45k words. My last one was about 85k words and took eight months. The one I'm on now has been dragging on for nearly two years though I didn't work on it for about a year and it's now being betaed but probably won't be posted for another three months. So you have to be patient as well.

It's seriously character building stuff.

** If you're losing interest, then you're not writing about something that you're very interested in. Find something that really gets you excited and write about that. Race cars, capybaras, the mating habits of blue-footed boobies--find something that turns your crank. For me, that happens to be Harry Potter. It might not be for you and that's okay. There's a lot going on in the HP fic-a-verse and it's easy to be overwhelmed by thoughts of "Am I doing it right?" rather than focusing on telling the story you want to tell.

Before writing HP fic, I wrote a few in a couple of different anime fandoms and completely abandoned two multi-chapter stories. I didn't want the same thing to happen to HP, so I consciously limited myself to one-shots that I would finish. That might be something to consider. You can also start off small with maybe a 100-200 word drabble where you explore a single concept or a conversation between two characters.

Don't feel like you have to dive in with this enormous, LOTR-type epic. A well-done character study can be just as satisfying to read and write. Before you know it, you'll have all sorts of little building blocks that you can stick together and turn into a satisfying, cohesive story.

** 750words.com

Its a wonderful little site to try to get people to write 750 words a day. It tracks how long it takes you to reach the goal, how many distractions, words per minute as well as how many days can you go without stopping. There are wonderful little badges to reward you on goals. All your writing is private as well.

Try it.

I've learned that sometimes your best ideas come after you have written thousands of words of crap. Just by forcing myself to write everyday, I have come up with so many ideas for my current story. It took me almost two years to write 16k words in the past and then I abandoned it. Since I started writing daily in February of this year, I have written over 50k. It's incredible.

The second advice I have for you is open a Google doc to plan out your fic. How many chapters do you think it would take? What are some unanswered questions you still have? Then start plotting individual chapters.

Personally. I recommend publishing after your fic is finished as it allows you to jump from chapter to chapter if you get bored/have a great idea. This is what I am doing now. 50k into a 150k fic.

Good luck!

** Planning, Plotting, Discipline

I never finished a story either, but I am determined to finish the original story I write now. These are the three main points that got me over the same issue you have.

I *planned* the story. I have character sheets, voice examples, moodboards, and so on and so forth. I have a whole repository of things to grab onto for my descriptions, my dialogues, my characters.

I *plotted* the story out to miniscule detail. Why does something happen? What are its consequences? What do the characters feel through that? How do the characters grow or devolve from that event?

And I *disciplined* myself to write every day. Sometimes its just useless drivel. Sometimes its great stuff. But I write at least 500 words every day that should be satisfactory.

** Music definitely helps with me. It puts me in a creative mood and can help me express emotion through writing a lot better. I always try to write my goals down for what I want out of a chapter before writing it as well. Then, I fill in the details. Writing comes in ebbs and flows. Write two hundred words here or there whenever the creative inspiration hits you. Eventually, you have a chapter, then two, then three etc.

** If you quickly lose interest after the first few thousand words, I wonder if you have an endgame and if you do, how satisfied are you with it? I'll list some of Stephen King's advice on writing (he's one of my favorite authors):

- Write every single day
- Take your writing seriously
- Write primarily for yourself
- Take risks; don't play it safe
- When writing, disconnect from the rest of the world

** Great question! I struggled with the same thing for more than 2 years until I finished a 10k one-shot, and I've finished a few 20k fics in the year after that. Although I definitely still struggle with motivation sometimes, I've also found what works for me:

- Education. I follow multiple writing blogs and YT channels to learn as much about writing as I possibly can. Part of my motivation issues had to do with nerves, because I was afraid I wasn't a good writer. Learning about the craft of writing helped me feel more confident, because I had at least an inkling of what I was doing.

- Plotting/ outlining before writing, because you can then focus on making the sentences flow well during the actual writing, rather than wondering what's going to happen next. Which makes the whole process a lot less stressful. It also helps me feeling more motivated when I know I'll get to write an exciting scene tomorrow.

- Deadlines. Giving yourself a deadline is awesome, but it's even better when someone else gives you one, because you /have/ to finish the work then. I always get stuck in the middle of a story and I haven't been able to get past that for the fics I didn't have a deadline for. All the ones that I finished were written for fests, so I had a very clear end date. I probably still wouldn't have finished anything if I hadn't. Signing up for a fest may be nerve-wracking, but it's so worth it!

- Finish something, no matter how short. This probably sounds strange, because finishing fics was your problem. However, let me tell you, there's nothing that gives you a bigger adrenaline rush than finishing a story. That alone is worth all the struggles beforehand. I'm never as excited about writing as when I've just finished a fic. I usually start on the next one immediately, because the feeling is just so awesome and I want to experience it again and again and again. Give it a try!

Hope this helps you!

** Plan your writing. Have notes, scene-by-scene, of how the story is going to go. You don't have to set it in stone, if you come up with a good idea mid-work, take a moment to revise your plan accordingly. (Backward as well as forward: sometimes the good idea you have now invalidates something you wrote fourteen chapters before.)

And don't depend on motivation. Motivation is a fickle and flighty thing, no more to be depended on than a cat's good opinion of you. Discipline gets you to the end of the book you're writing.

I use the [[http://www.iulianionescu.com/blog/master-outlining-and-tracking-tool-for-novels-v2-0/][MOTT]], which is a good tool to use I think. But for Harry Potter fanfiction I'd probably like to dedicate an arc for each season + 1 for the summer holidays and probably just make secondary notes for any potential Christmas holiday mini-arc. Some secondary changes to it could probably also be done though if you want.

When you've filled it out it should be easy enough to look at it as if you're checking off some boxes. A scene here, a chapter there. Etc.

** Make sure you write all these ideas down! I'd recommend carrying a pocket notebook or using a note/writing app.

1. Now, if you've never written anything long before I would recommend starting out small. Yes, that big huge idea with lots of chapter/plot potential looks cool now, but it will quickly get overwhelming if you've never completed a project. So I would say try to stick to oneshots and get a few stories out. That feeling of finishing a piece is really satisfying and can be a great boost in your confidence and motivation!

2. Get in the habit of writing everyday. It doesn't have to be long, or relevant to any WIPs you have. But just having that discipline of consistent writing will help you in the long run. The only way to get good at writing is to do it- and do a lot of it. /Personally, I spend 15 minutes a day, on prompt(s)./ [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] currently has prompts for short stories everyday this month and is worth checking out! There's also plenty of prompts on [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]]! If you don't want to do prompts then take one of those ideas churning in your head and just get something small written.

3. Planning: I know others have probably mentioned this but planning is optional with long stories. You need to have an outline of some kind. Some people do better detailing it down to the chapters, others do better with just having plot points. It is essential to have a beginning and end figured out. This way you have a clear view of where you are starting and where you need to end up. Next up, figure out a few key points you definitely must have, climax should also be planned. Now you can add more plot around these key points or begin going chapter by chapter in terms of planning. The more details you have before hand, the fewer plotholes you'll have and it'll be a great reference if you ever get stumped during the writing phase. This is also the best time to do any research. /If you can't power through getting an outline done, there's a good chance you won't be able to finish a long story./.

4. Know that masterpieces don't happen on the first draft. First draft is just writing so try not to stop or take few breaks. You will then need to edit...and edit... and edit again. A lot of your time will be spent rereading your chapters and revising. On one read through, I would recommend printing it out or reading it out loud to make sure the story and dialogue flow naturally. You can also get a beta if you want, who will read over each chapter and advise on grammar, formatting, etc. Depending on the beta, you may also be able to bounce ideas off them! They can also be a great source of motivation. Betas aren't for everyone though, so don't feel like it's a requirement!

5. Environment: I would also recommend having a quiet place you can go or be when you're writing. Make sure you're comfortable, and there aren't a lot of distractions- people, tv, etc. Some people even turn the internet off on their computers so they aren't tempted to web surf instead of write. Music is optional- most writers I know prefer background music, but it's always instrumental, and either nature noises or movie soundtracks. It's whatever works for you, without taking away from what you need to focus on.

6. The most important thing is to write what /you/ want. Not what others expect or demand. If you lose sight of what you want, the story will suffer and it will become more of a chore than a hobby. Writing can be a lot of fun- but good/complete writing takes time, a lot of effort, and as corny as it sounds- love.

7. If you do have a big WIP to work on, I'd recommend having another small project you can go to when you need a break from your main story. This gives you a chance to take a step back, relax, and clear your mind.
