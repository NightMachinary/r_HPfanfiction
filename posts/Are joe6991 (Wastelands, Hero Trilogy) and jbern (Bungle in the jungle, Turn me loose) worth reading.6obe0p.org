** Wastelands - yes. Hero Trilogy is very outdated. Bungle in the Jungle is almost entirely filler interspersed with a handful of cool moments. Turn me loose is the sequel, and doesn't really go anywhere (other than back to Hogwarts).

** Bungle in the Jungle was a good read from what I remember. It takes a bit of sticking with it to get past the second person POV, but you get used to it.

** I like what Bungle and Turn Me Loose attempted to accomplish, and they're well worth reading for the attempt. They definitely do not feature "wimpy shy" Harry (almost the exact opposite actually). The problem with both of them is that at the end of both of them you're left with a...'so that happened' feeling.

The magic is fun, there's some awesome sequences, but like most jbern stories he spends too much time priming for sequels that never actually materialize. Sure, a lot of pennies drop all over the place but the resolution isn't the greatest. If you know what you're getting into with a jbern story they're definitely a fun ride. They just leave you with the feeling that the roller coaster stopped too soon.

** Go on and read them, Harry being a badass is exactly what those fics are about.

** Wastelands and hits sequel are two of the best fan fictions on the site. Without spoilers Harry is very outgoing and confident, but not in a random unexplained way. Well worth a shot try reading the first couple of chapters

** I'm going to play devil's advocate with everyone else and say no. Joe is good at writing 'original' fiction and that shows in his HP stories to the point where it feels so far off from where it started that you don't know how it got there anymore. Magic isn't Magical is just about the only thing you need to know about his fics.

Jbern is the opposite side of the spectrum. He seems to always try to do something different but falls into the sanctions of canon every single time to the point where if you've read one, you've basically read them all.

** I had a couple of false starts trying to do Bungle in the Jungle, but eventually I made it past the first few chapters and ended up really enjoying it.

** Hero Trilogy - definitely no, I wrote a rant about first parts' problems but it mainly touched on plot, so was 90% spoilers. Suffice to say, that while writing style was pretty good, the story was terribly stupid and the pacing was way too slow.
