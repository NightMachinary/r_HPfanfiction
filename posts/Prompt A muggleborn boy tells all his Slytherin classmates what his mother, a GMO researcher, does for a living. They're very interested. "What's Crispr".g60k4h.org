**** Then one of two responses

1) Muggles have some cool things, I've taken Muggle Studies, you know, but they can't do that. Not even Dark wizards can!

or

2) Muggles can play with our blood? They're more dangerous than I thought!

***** I think a lot of people's opinions changed during the war. Talking about how you'd like to get rid of mudbloods is one thing, witnessing a curse turning a human being into a pile of goo right in front of your eyes is another.

****** Not so much as their opinion changed, but that they realized blood really wasn't it. If you see someone get shot or brutally murdered, you're not going to think, "Luckily I'm not ______." No, you're going to think that you wouldn't want that to happen to you. So you realize that really everyone spills the same blood at the end of the day, giving racial prejudices no power.

** "Is it true?", Catherine whispered, "your mother can grant Parseltongue to anyone?"

"Err, not really. My mum only deals with animals, and I'm not sure it's even possible to just add Parseltongue", replied Oscar. The rumors about his mother's abilities seem to keep gaining new additions. The consensus seems to be it's possible to figure out and enable squibs at least to perform magic, /if/ sufficient research were made. In fact, the Slug Club has decided they're going to get as much information about this "almost magical muggle's invention". A Ravenclaw's half-blood's relative is busy printing as much information she can get so they can get it all mailed to the school this weekend. The Owlery is nearly deserted since after all the school owls are busy delivering the printed materials, the club members start borrowing their friend's owl to help. Oscar Brown doesn't really have the time to consider the ramification right now, he's almost late to meet the Senior Minister.

...

The Headmistress office felt much warmer than the dungeon. Professor Slughorn is talking animatedly with the Headmistress, and sitting beside him is clearly the Senior Minister Granger. On Oscar's arrival, he immediately stands and ushers Oscar to the recently vacated seat. Oscar can't help but be awed. He's sitting right now to the muggleborn who everyone predicted is soon going to be the Minister of Magic. Having ambition is one thing, but to see the very proof of what a muggleborn can achieve...

After the customary greeting, Granger reveals her reason for meeting Oscar directly. She has been following the muggle-world technology development but with the Statue of Secrecy only allowing relatives of wizards and witches to even know the existence of magic in the first place, she never gets to talk with the people in the bleeding edge about the implication of magic-assisted CRISPR. Slughorn has allowed the rumor mill and the Slug Club to go wild chasing their theories, but he and Granger have fixed their eyes on one thing only. Just a quick chat with Angela Brown should confirm if what they're looking for is achievable.

...

Angela Brown rubbed her head. It's one thing to have a stranger coming to her doorstep claiming her son "strange accidents" are actually something so common there are entire hidden societies of the practitioner across the world, but now not only the woman her son always talk about after he bought the books about the wizarding world are in her living room, but she also claimed she can literally change the entire world if Angela don't mind verifying what she's doing. By the fourth successful attempt, it's clear she might actually prove her words. Not only the cat in front of her is glowing, just like the other cat she worked on her lab to prove the method works, this one also said to have higher intelligence than the average Briton. Angela tends to believe it since the cat actually says it himself while having Granger excitedly pushing silvery threads she claimed to worth years of academic study to his head.

"So.. right now you are extremely smart, capable of wielding magic, and, travel back in time?", Angela stops feeling ridiculous on saying that after the cat, apparently named Crookshanks proved he's managed to travel about 4 hours ago and slip a paw-shaped cookie into her cupboard. "I do, but only mentally. It's rather disappointing that I can only travel up to the day I was born since it means I can't cancel all the unpleasantness from the Wizarding War, but at least I can help cancel a very terrible event", he answered. "But, even if you reached the past, you'll no longer capable of wielding magic since the alteration wasn't there, and at most, you can only impress on yourself a single strong emotion", countered Angela. She doesn't think to send a cat in the past a powerful affection, or maybe hatred, to be productive. It's clear all the other projects his son's schoolmates are pursuing better achievements. Stopping cancer once for all, enabling families ripped apart by magic to become together again.

"I know what you thinking, I'm sorry I read your mind previously. But rest assured, I do have a worthy mission that is comparable to everyone else. I'm sorry for taking your time, I'll leave now", Crookshanks closed his eyes and but for his incessant glow, he almost seemed to disappear. He doesn't though, only his brain electrical pattern was sent, carrying a message to the past. Crookshanks shuddered and said, "It's done, I did it. Thank you, Angela Brown". He seems to almost retch.

...

Tom Riddle grabbed to take Bellatrix away from the Ministry. A black blur went right to him. Thinking it to be an animagus member of the Order, he absentmindedly fired the reversal spell. But today is not his lucky day. Crookshanks has managed to travel to the past, hitched a ride to the Ministry, and finally accomplished his mission. The pain was blinding, Riddle's reflect was to protect his neck, but Crookshanks's jaws and claws target something much, much lower. Banishing the half-kneazle away, Riddle managed to disapparate without losing his grip on Bellatrix.

...

"Ah, Severus, how's Riddle?", Albus welcomed Snape to his office. "The Dark Lord has suffered a rather low-blow attack. I'm not sure why Granger's cat is doing it, but it's rather ineffective. His magic is still as strong as ever, and by the end of the week he'll be able to walk normally", Snape sighed. Why didn't the cat target Voldemort's neck? "So, there's nothing gained from the unexplainable attack?", asked Dumbledore. "Well, there is one", answered Snape, "the cat chewed... The Dark Lord's testicles so he'll never sire a kid, but it's not like he planned to have one anyway". "Why indeed", Albus wondered, "having a child right now will just trigger a series of disaster that might need a liberal application of time travel to fix with badly thought of +plot+ plan"

*** I once heard that any child who does not inherit magic from even just one magic parent is a sqib, so even if it's a muggleborn having kids with a muggle, their children are generally expected to inherit magic, but if any of their children don't inherit magic, then that child is called a squib.

If I recall correctly, Umbridge's backstory on Pottermore mentioned a brother who was technically a squib, even though their parents were a magical and a muggle.

So no, it's not just inbred purebloods who have squib kids.

** One interesting thing is that Slughorn a blood purist is aware of genes and attributes Harry's talent in potions as having inherited it from Lily.

  "Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful," said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry's cauldron. "Euphoria, I take it? And what's that I smell? Mmmm . . . you've added just a sprig of peppermint, haven't you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. ... *I really don't know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless ---"*

  Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince's book deeper into his bag with his foot.

  *"--- it's just your mother's genes coming out in you!"*

  "Oh . . . yeah, maybe," said Harry, relieved.
