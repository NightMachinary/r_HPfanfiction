I've been reading some of the reviews people write on popular stories and one thing that really grinds my gear is when people bring up Harry's characterization.

It's as if some people are asking for the same JK Rowling writing style and sense of feel (if that makes sense). Some people outright criticize the author for failing to capture canon Harry's persona and characterization perfectly...

Like c'mon! Fanficiton is more than that.. Fan fiction author shouldn't be outright copying the characters but rather change them and make them their own. Like people complain about Fleur's characterization not being similar to canon.. however, they don't realize authors don't really have much to go on.

It's like when someone collects a few phrases a character said in a book and tries to justify how that character should act in canon. Afterwards, they criticize fan fiction authors for not writing that character like canon.

Hope this makes sense. Figure I'd start a little discussion.


** I don't usually leave reviews for stories that turned out to just not be my style---as opposed to stories that just weren't very good---but "JK Rowling writing style and feel" /is/ usually what I'm looking for in fanfic, if I'm being honest.

It doesn't bother me that a lot of (or most?) people prefer a different Harry---more independent, badass, etc.---but when I read fanfic I do like to feel a strong connection to the world that made me want to read the fanfic in the first place.

So I guess what this comes down to for me is more a matter of review etiquette---if a story is /intentionally/ doing something other than what you like, it doesn't make sense to me to complain about it. "Hey, why is Harry suddenly a shades-wearin' badass/suddenly exactly like Hermione/suddenly in love with Draco?" Well, because that's the kind of story this is, and they probably warned you about it in the summary.

If, on the other hand, it seems like the author's trying to be strongly in-character but there's suddenly a weird, unexplained distance between Harry and the Weasleys, or whatever, that might be worth bringing up.

*** Thanks for the honest opinion. Haha, we're so different. Personally I hate JKR's Harry. In my opinion, JKR seemed to prove that with a bit of luck and a lot of help, an average wizard with some upside can stop the greatest dark wizard of all time... which is pretty bs to me.

******* I would give England more credit than "a bit of luck, a bit of help and a lot of bravery." Politically, economically, and militarily England was no slouch. The sun hadn't yet sunk on the British Empire! Even with Germany conquering a large portion of Europe, England was still a world power.

*********** Ah, it was a big vague to understand, mostly because I wouldn't consider Harry in the war with Voldermort to be even close to England against Germany in WWII, so the comparison fell flat for me.

Harry was a powerful wizard, but he could only beat Voldermort based on a strange set of coincidences that had little to do with his power, strength, and smarts. A lot of his victory was luck, namely the fact that he disarmed Draco, allowing him to "defeat" Voldemort in the end. There were far more capable and powerful wizards than Harry. What essentially made Harry special in the grand scheme of things was the prophecy, Voldermort's choice, and wandlore.

** Mmm, I would have to disagree with your main points for a couple of reasons.

I don't think keeping characters to their canon interpretations is the same as writing style. Fanfiction, for the most part, does not exist to derive off of an author's style, it mostly exists to derive off of characters and setting. So, with characters and setting being more important than not, people have more expectations for that to be similar to the source material.

That being said, I don't think people are wrong to characterize Harry, or different characters, differently from what's presented in canon. Fan fiction is derivative, and frequently makes changes to what's presented in canon as an act of criticism, or to better fit their interpretations, or just to suit their own story or ideas. There isn't anything inherently wrong with altering how canon presents things.

However, readers can go in with an expectation based off of how things are presented in canon. For more developed characters, like Harry, it can lead to a lot of dissonance when a reader's interpretation of a character (established by canon) is different than the author's. Less developed ones, like your example of Fleur, have more leeway because of their lack of canon presented, but still can present a problem.

Like, say if you enjoy Harry as a character because of his sense of humor, you're not going to enjoy something that ignores that aspect of his character. For another example, I like particular themes associated with Remus- I like the fact that his loyalty to his friends is presented as a fault, as brushes off his friends' bullying in Hogwarts. I have the expectation that this will be kept intact in something I read, and when it's not, I would criticize it as characterization problems.

At the end of the day, most people aren't reading fic for style, they're reading for characters or setting. And while a lot of characterization is up to interpretation, it's pretty valid to not enjoy something because it doesn't match up with canon (and potentially, why a reader would seek out an expansion from canon.)

** The problem is that it's not good writing to just have characters change. Good writing has characters develop naturally in response to experiences. I would be very happy to read a story in which Harry was OOC, if there was a strong arc of character development to get him there (something that's significantly easier the earlier you start the story) But just completely changing Harry's character by authorial fiat is bad writing.

Many good authors do this though. Sesc's /Traitor's Son/ comes to mind as the most recent example. Authors like Joe, Santi and Nonjon do this as well.

I agree with you for most part though. I have a preference for canon Harry and canon skill levels, but I can overlook OOCness by authorial fiat if the story is very good. The best stories do keep him in character though.

*** I think I disagree. Probably.

If a fanfiction author wants to have their characters start out in the story as significantly different from canon then that's fine. There's obviously stumbling blocks they need to avoid but simply changing a character is in no way qualitatively different from changing the setting of the story.

That is not to say that the changes don't have to make /sense/. A story that starts in third year with a racist, anti-muggleborn Harry should probably not state that all events up until that point were exactly as in canon.

There is nothing fundamentally wrong with altering the personality of the characters in a piece of fanfiction, just as there is nothing wrong with altering the setting or background. I mean honestly, if changing Harry's gender for the purpose of the story premise is okay then surely adding some fluff to your backstory to explain why he's more ambitious or intelligent is no great problem.

The problem comes from shallowness or ill-consideration. When creating a story the most important thing is that it be internally consistent. If your character changes are made with the applicable parts of canon in mind then everything will probably be fine. If you just dump random character traits into the mix half-way through then obviously that's a problem. But the problem is inherent in the dumping of half-thought out ideas, not in the changing of the character.

Do it properly, like so many things in writing, and it's fine.

**** I think you're making the same point as me, actually.

My point was that characters have to have reasons for being the way they are. This is in stark contrast to arbitrarily declaring the character to be like X. "Harry is studious now" is not the same thing as writing an AU in which events take place differently so as to result in a more studious Harry.

If you're writing a 3rd year AU with different background events, then you've done as I've said above: your character has been developed into being the way they are, rather than declared that way. You're simply using the common writing technique of in medias res, or starting in the middle. The events which forged the character into their current state will be unveiled as the story progresses. This is a perfectly valid way to show your character's development.

** I don't think there's any problem with an OOC Harry so long as there's a reason for it. Say Harry is raised by Sirius in a fic you're writing; it's perfectly acceptable for him not to act like canon Harry.

But if you're doing a fic that starts directly after a canon plot-point and suddenly make Harry's character do a complete 180, that's when I get annoyed. Like if you're doing a directly post-HBP where Harry suddenly decides after Dumbledore's funeral, "I've always loved Hermione, fuck Ginny, the bint!", or goes up to Ron post-OOTP and tells him to fuck off because "Draco and I are besties for realsies, doe".

I mean, you could probably see why people would get a little brassed at that.

** For me, I believe that canon Harry should be followed properly. However, i do not want to reread canon as that is not why I am on fanfiction. If I wanted a replica of JK Rowling's story, I would reread hers. To me, the characters should still be the same character (if i wanted to read James Bond, then i would hope over to that fanfiction) but the different aspects of their personalities can be emphasized over another. But as in real life, people change so it is perfectly okay for Harry to become James Bond esque but there had better be some great plot points that caused him to become like that. This is where fanfiction is so great. Your character can be influenced to become anything by the plot. But I greatly dislike when the character (Harry in this instance) is drastically changed without proper events causing such a change. Show me (don't tell me) the reasons for a certain change. A Fanfic should change one or two major plot points/events and then every other change that occurs in your story should be a ripple effect caused by the one or two changes you made to the story to begin with. This is why choosing the proper point in the timeline to start is so vital. You want a powerful, independant Harry? Thats okay, but I want to see him BECOME that, not just be able to take down Voldemort with a sneeze out of nowhere. As i said, the PLOT should influence the character, not the character influencing the plot. Edit: just reworded a sentence

** Personally, I prefer reading stories that have the canon characterisations, but placed in different settings or telling different stories. I think some of the complaints come from stories that give the impression that they will use the canon characterisation of Harry, only to characterise him differently.

I am personally a big fan of Harry in canon, but I think it is very difficult for authors to make their character feel like the canon character. If there is a story that seems like it will have the canon characterisation, and then doesn't live up to the readers' expectations, they complain. It isn't really fair to expect the character in a fanfiction to be the same as in canon, but many people read fanfiction to see the same characters presented in different ways and expect to see the canon characterisations in most stories.
