I've got a bit of an idea for a story to redeem the Dursley's, Vernon included (if Snape and Draco can be redeemed, Vernon should be as well) and him being a car enthusiast is part of the idea.

I'd also like his dream car to be different from a typical British man's dream car. My initial idea was to go for some kind of American muscle car from around the 70's- like a GTO, Firebird or whatever John Wick drives, but I don't know if American card are/were well known in that period or if they were even street legal.

If anyone can give me ideas for a good car for Vernon I would appreciate it.


** For nice, tory-voting Surrey businessman, Vernon Dursley, he's not going to drive a Dodge Challenger. It'd be an american ‘yob car' and thats even if he's heard of it. American Cars (except Ford) only really came to the UK in the past decade and the only time I've seen an ‘muscle car' here was when I was on D of E in the Arrochar Alps because they were filming the introductory advert for the Mustang (c.2015) which had just been imported.

We can estimate Vernon's net worth roughly. A four bed house in Surrey at today's prices goes for between £500k - £1 million depending on the type. So we can roughly say he probably drives a new-ish mercedes, Jaguar, Bentley Continental or maybe a Rolls Royce Corniche. He appears to have a lot of money to throw around, but I can't decide if he's new money or old money (Yes, Class dictates the type of car you drive). I'd bet on the former, which means he's more likely to have flashier cars and visible wealth.

*** Except the Dursleys would have bought their house in or before 1981, when the average house price was around £24k (so say 30 in the London commuter belt) and the average wage was around £8k- so let's say Vernon earned 10 or 11 as a junior management person. Three times your wage was the average mortgage loan back then, so he will have comfortably been able to afford Number 4, yes, but that doesn't sound like "a lot of money to throw around." Surrey and even London were affordable to the middle classes up until the 90s. Even ten years on, at the start of the series, the Dursleys are comfortable but not "rich." Vernon has a higher wage as he's now quite senior, but the cost of living has gone up.

The Dursleys are, I wouldn't even say "new money." New money indicates lottery win or got lucky with setting up your own business. Richard Branson is new money. Alan Sugar is new money. The Dursleys aren't "monied." Vernon still has to work- even though his income is clearly high enough to have a comfortable standard of living on one wage. They're middle-middle class- Vernon clearly comes from a better off background than Petunia (and Aunt Marge with her tweed, brandy, and dogs seems somewhat upper-middle)- him being a public school almunus and wanting his son to go to the same institution screams upper-middle; but the obsession with "normality", the constant car washing/polishing, the perfect lawn, the overly fussy decor and matching suite and all that says more middle-middle, or even aspirational lower-middle mindset.

So, that said, I'd agree with you the best car for OPs idea is a Jag. A Merc would be something Vernon would want, but also it wouldn't stand out. For someone of Vernon's class status and social attitudes, especially at the time, a sporty Jag would be the one- it's luxury but it's not gauche, it's British, and everyone knows the value of it. It shows you have more disposable income than the average but it isn't in-your-face. The neighbours would be jealous, but they'd also find nothing to criticise.

**** True true, i couldn't think of the stats for the 80s. My assertion that Vernon had money to throw around was purely based on the rather lavish gifts he showers on Dudley, the ability to buy his affection for Marge and his being the Director of Grunnings (how big that is or whether he founded it are not known) either way it hypothetically a lot.

***** I always reckoned he wasn't the CEO, he was the sales director or something, which explains why he was high up enough to have to entertain clients at home and so on but he's still answerable to a superior.

He definitely has a ton of disposable income from a large salary, but he in no way has independent wealth. Vernon is from a posher background than Petunia though, there's some very clear "class indicators" for the two of them in the first three books if readers look hard enough!

****** Hmmm in PS, it's stated as ‘Mr Dursley was the Director of a firm called Grunnings which sold drills' Now unless I've had a very strange experience, through school and such but whenever I've someone be referred to as The Director it has almost always meant the Head of the Company and/or the owner, at least up here where I live. In the Scots translation, he is referred to as the ‘Heid-bummer', which translates as the Head or Boss.

It could also be likely that Vernon's parents may still be alive and holding most of the family money but this is entirely suppositional.

******* True, "the director" would imply that he's the boss. But then there are other types of directors especially in a big company- you can be the financial director or the sales director or the director of HR (not that I can see Vernon in HR, he is very much not a people person!) Plus even if he is the head honcho, being CEO isn't synonymous with owning the company, if it's not a family business CEO/director is still very much a salaried position and you're answerable to the owners and or shareholders.

I feel like he's worked his way up to Director from starting as like Sales Manager or something, but it's very much not his company. He's the boss but not the owner, idk why but something about the Dursleys lifestyle makes me think he's still beholden to /someone/ in his working life.

** Triumph [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_Stag][Stag]] or Jaguar [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_E-Type][E-Type]] would be good, plausible choices. But might not be as inspiring as what you're looking for.

Less plausible, but awesome would be a Jag [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XK120][XK120]]

*** The Jag XK120 might be just what I was looking for. My idea was that the car would be a gift from James as a way of apologizing for embarrassing Vernon, so it being a hard to come by model would be part of the package.

Thanks for the help.

** At the time IIRC a lot of companies gave their employees cars as a benefit to get around income taxes.

For a big executive car, maybe the Ford Granada? Alternatively, a Ford Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth for a fairly hot mid-size family car? These were both Ford UK cars, Ford Sierra was very well selling and the Cosworth had high performance and racing pedigree, and probably wouldn't have been too expensive?

** thundercougarfalconbird

For reality, I'd say a Dodge Challenger or something like that. Just because he likes being considered normal, and that would be a car that, while not exactly normal, can still flaunt that he's good at his normal job and has been promoted or something along those lines

*** Yeah that absolutely wouldn't have been a "normal" car on the roads of Southern England in the 80s and 90s- it would have stuck out like a sore thumb.

People just didn't have American cars here back then. For his regular car he'd have had a top of the range Rover. No way is he anything but a Rover guy- middle class and British. And if he wanted an expensive "weekend car"- a classic Jaguar. Still middle class and British, but not affordable to the majority and the epitome of luxury.

If he was going to go for something really really flash, like OP says if James bought him something super expensive to build bridges, then an Aston Martin. DB5 or 6. James Bonds car.

***** Nah. Buying American cars wasn't done back then and tbh it still isn't really. We drive on opposite sides of the road so it's not the safest thing in the world for a start, unless you can afford to have it reworked to be right hand drive, and in all honesty American cars don't have the best rep over here, unless you're a collector.

******* Popular to look at/talk about? Yeah deffo. But the logistics of actually having an imported US car is so complicated that ownership never really took off. Even today you'd turn your head if you saw an American car on the streets of Surrey.

*** See, my idea is that the car is/was a gift from James Potter, kind of a “I'm sorry I was a jackass” peace offering combined with a wedding gift. I had read that Rowling says James embarrassed Vernon during a double date/meeting and the car was a way to make amends.

I'm viewing James as someone who has thinks that words alone aren't enough to properly apologize, and he intended to hand the car over in person but the whole Voldemort thing forced them into hiding.
