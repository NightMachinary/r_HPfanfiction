I know this sounds kinda stupid xD but I like the HP characters, and have been in a bit if an Isekai mode recently lol.

My main hope is for something where he gets abducted for a dungeon crawler type story. Like where he can level up, kill monsters, has a game interface, etc.

But I am open to other recommendations as well.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game) is probably a great bet for this.

  With his life turned into a Game, Harry now has to raise a Phoenix, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, deal with political manipulations and live through Hogwarts all while trying desperately to not swear too much.
