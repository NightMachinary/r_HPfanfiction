**** Lol... I'm Now I'm picturing Sirius Black in his forties Riding across America with Harry in a side car accompanied by a gang of retired dentists and old hells angels all his this new "biker gang"... The barking schnauzers..... I'm also picturing little at like 8 learning to play pool from an scrappy bar owner named Rosie with a skull and panda tattoo on her right shoulder and a potato cannon loaded behind the bar because the sheriff Told her she wasn't legally allowed to keep a shotgun back their loaded, But no one said anything about a potato cannon, For "special circumstances".... And Harry desperately wanting to grow up to be as cool as her one day.... while Sirius fixes the Speaker system behind the bar in exchange for free drinks and a place to stay for the next couple weeks. Since harry wants to see the Miraculous Flash flooding that is a brief rainy season in the American south west... for some odd reason his godson loves cactus flowers and wants to see them in person, but at the moment learning When to shoot an 8 ball into the corner pocket is a much higher priority for little Harry

*** There's lots of those. I don't know about Britain, but in America, we also have "gangs" of Christian bikers that do charity work while wearing leathers and huge tats.

  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

** So...what? Harry rolls into Hogwarts with a drug addiction, insisting on wearing biker leathers instead of his robes, refusing to identify with his House because he already has a Family, a degrading attitude towards all women, and engaging in physical violence at the slightest opportunity? Assuming you wanted the response to engage with the stereotype that is. I'm not sure how that fic works...Harry gets expelled a few days after arriving at Hogwarts after assaulting Malfoy, having already plunged Gryffindor into negative points over the preceding days.

*** ... Did you comment on my Pirate Harry prompt a few days ago? I seem to remember a reply that was very similar to yours.

On another note, if it's realism you desire, perhaps a book series about magic isn't your cup of tea.

******* "Hey asshole! Guess who?" Harry crowed, slamming open the door of the Falmouth bar. Pettigrew tried to run, but found Harry's chain-clad fist in his way. His last conscious thought was to wonder how Harry had found him so fast, before he could even flee England. The (mostly drunk) patrons roared in approval as Harry hauled the traitorous rat out of the door by his shirt collar. Harry tossed a balled up Â£50 note in the bartender's direction to pay for the door.

Pettigrew groaned in agony as he came to, then instantly regretted being awake as his eyes focussed on a leering Harry Potter who was inches from his face. He could smell a sharp, acrid scent that he knew to be rat poison; no doubt he was surrounded by it, preventing him from transforming without the risk of dying in agony. The bonds around his hands and ankles left him enough flexibility to sit up, but definitely not run or even stand. "Hello, rat face. We're going to turn you in to the Ministry in little bit. After we have a little fun, of course." Harry leered grotesquely, "I just want you to know something first. This. Is. Going. To. Hurt!". Harry walked away from him, ignoring the whimpering little man.

Seconds later, the quiet of the night was shattered by the characteristic earth-shaking growl of a V-twin motorcycle engine starting. Peter shut his eyes.
