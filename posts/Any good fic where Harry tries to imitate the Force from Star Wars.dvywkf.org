Preferably the Dark Side. I've read a fic with a similar premise but stopped at the point when Harry gets the ability to just make stuff from thin air without any cost whatsoever. It's a huge turn off for me when there is an OP power without equal counterbalance, it's just plain uninteresting. Ye, and no slash please.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)

  At age eight, Harry Potter had an epiphany. He realized, with the utter certainty that only an eight years old can have, that he was a Jedi.

** I have an idea like this in the works, but it is not Harry Potter and his friends that realize this. It will explore the use of the Dark Side. Will link it when I post it in the future.

  Whitetigerwolfs Dark Lady challenge. Hermione watches Star Wars at age six and tries to connect with the force. Now watch how a game of pretend turns into a journey to the dark side filled with -friendship and love? Yes, Harry's responsible somehow...
