** Cauterize: It's short, touching, canon-compliant, and does a good job exploring what life is like after the series ends. One of the first fics I ever read.

Just a Random Tuesday: I like its combination of "slice of life" and the faculty member POV, and the interactions with the rest of the staff, Snape in particular, are fantastic.

A Black Comedy: This fic doesn't take itself seriously /at all/, yet still manages to put together a plot that sneaks up on you around chapter 10 or so. There's even a legitimate twist (IMO) at the end, complete with foreshadowing if you're paying attention. Plus I'm a sucker for any story where Sirius gets a happy ending, he absolutely deserves one.

I'm actually not sure what my other two favorites would be. Trying to limit myself to complete ones only, here.

** linkffn(The Sea King) has to be my favorite one shot of all time. It has one of my favorite portrayals of harry years down the road after the events of canon.

linkffn(the shadow of angmar) is my choice for best crossover. Also one of the most well-written stories out there. It could be an actual novel if it was an original work.

I'm not awesome at categorizing my favorite stories, because I have read waaaay too many to remember them all and my tastes change all the time.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Things I like:

- Dark, serious fics
- AU fics
- Characters who are legitimate badasses without being god-mode Sues
- Defying and subverting authority
- Harry/Ginny

With that in mind, my all-time top fics are probably The Changeling, The Sum of their Parts, Backwards with Purpose, A Long Journey Home, and The Arithmancer.

** Hmm ... in no particular order, because there isn't much point in comparing them to each other directly:

*Seventh Horcrux* by Emerald Ashes: It's basically a parody fic through and through, going through the stations of canon but at each of those stations trampling so many silly tropes associated with ... pretty much anything and everything, really. Magical cores? Made fun of. Living in an enchanted trunk? Made fun of. Dumbledore stealing Harry's money? Made fun of. It plays the concept of unreliable narration to its fullest, providing almost constant hilarity, and yet when it ends that ending is not just a punchline to some joke but a fitting ending on its own.

*Last Chance* by Laume: For people who want to see Tom Riddle try, this is /the/ story. It starts with a point of divergence that is Dumbledore deciding that scaring Tom Riddle on their first meeting is likely a bad idea, and progresses into a heartwarming story of someone who is flawed and made mistakes, and someone who is flawed and making mistakes, both trying, sometimes failing and sometimes succeeding, to be the better person.

*Coexistence* by darkcyan: It's hard to say much without spoiling things, so to keep it simple I'll say that I like the story for the interactions between characters. The story more or less sends a character into the past, in a way that leaves them with somewhat limited capabilities and struggling to do what they need to do, and their interactions with characters, interactions that you know change things from how they were into something new, something ... perhaps better, this is what makes the story really great. Because there's nothing like knowing that people who would have gone down a very dark path now have a normal life, because they were given a choice and they took it.

*the family evans* by dirgewithoutmusic: It's the once-unnamed one-shot which revisits the series to answer one question, “What if Petunia, when she found Harry on her doorstep, took him in not into the house but into the family?”, and it's basically a short retelling of the story with one difference, this being that now Harry doesn't have “relatives” but “family”. For me, this story, with its flawed people who make mistakes but who nonetheless are family because they are trying to be family, it's something I could never quite get to the end of without having tears in my eyes, and for that I feel it deserves to be on this list.

*The Elite* by Adari: Another one-shot, and this one gives you one potential explanation for why Harry nodded to Draco in the ending. It's a tale of ... an unlikely friendship kind of thing that somehow happened against the better judgment of the involved parties, really.

** No particular order for these. HPMOR: Yeah, Methods of Rationality was the FIRST HP fanfic I read ( it certainly have me overly high expectations for the next few I read :P) and I loved it! The tone, story, magic was just all so different from the original and so well done that I really felt like I could immerse myself in the story. It might be one of the reasons why I love AU ff's so much better than all those FFs which read exactly like the originials, except written in a different style. Very nice.

Delenda Est : Something about the Bellatrix/Harry interaction just really sticks with me, maybe because we and Harry (time travel fic) both know how Bella /could/ end up so its like he's walking on eggshells sometimes. Also teacher!Harry fics are always a nice favourite, its very nice to see Hogwarts from that other perspective.

Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly : VERY nice AU fic where Harry time travels back, but instead of getting his own body ends up with Lockhart's. I'll admit sometimes it feels a little like he just rolls over all opposition, but it was such a fresh perspective that I really loved it.

Wind Shear: Another Harry/Bellatrix. I just wish there were more of these lmao, love that pairing. Another teacher harry, and its also quite good, but what I liked more was the feel of how lonely and alien harry felt in the past, almost like he never quite got rouns to fitting in until the epilogue, very nice.

0800-Rent-A-Hero: LOVE THIS FIC. I'm sad to say I don't think it'll ever be completed, but it was also the fic that made me love teacher Harry most, and it is the BEST (and only?) power FF where the focus is on Divination, and its done so well at the same time! Also a nice perspective on the OOtP as that fanatical group from the outside, very nice.

Black Queen quartet: Yeah, its a dark one, fem!harry who is adopted as a black. Very dark tone, lots of black magic, very nice. Maybe its obvious but I really like AU stuff which really diverged from canon heavily. I like original stories /based/ on HP and this one really delivers. Very long, very nice. Not quite finished yet, but its almost there.

** To be honest I havent found the perfect fanfiction yet because there are some aspects I dislike in every fic.

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) i like Milo, the weirdness magnet, the differences between magical systems, the plot about Fiona and the heartwarming scene where a charcter is willing to die for a person who didnt even exist before. What i dislike: its essentielly another „Harrys seven years in Hogwarts but something is different“ fic. There are some stations of canon and it isnt finished.

linkffn(Strangers of Drakeshaugh) has an interesting relationship between Harrys family and his muggle neighbours. Mike reminded me a lot of my father. I didnt care that much about the murder case though.

linkao3(Hermione Granger's Crammar for Delinquent Students) has an interesting premise, older characters, is super funny and has a believable and appropriately awkward relationship between Draco who is still a jerk and Harry. I hope its not racist but its rare to see a POC!Harry. Downside: Sadly the Author decided to end the story right were it was getting interesting, no guerilla war against Voldemort.

** linkao3(11968875) - I really like trio fics, and this one is heartwarming and funny without being saccharine.

linkao3(3459731) - it has a really interesting canon divergence that I don't think I've seen anyone else use (Hermione gets Riddle's diary). Hermione gets a lot of depth and Riddle manages to be both fascinating and still murderously unhinged.

linkao3(105485) - I really like fics that explore more secondary characters, and this one does that with a level of nuance and empathy that's rarely matched.

linkao3(6701647) - normally I skip over long plotty fics because so many of them just feel like a slog, but this one never did. I really liked getting to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione not just as adults but rather old adults, and the epilogue made me cry a little.

linkao3(14164617) - the only WIP on this list, because it has a talent for describing complicated emotions I would sell my soul to have.

** It's hard to narrow it down; these may not be my actual 'top five' but they are the five of my favourite fics that come to mind at present, not including crossovers.

​

Though polarizing hereabouts, *Methods of Rationality* will always be high on my favourites list. The insanely high divergence level, the exploration of magic and the overall way the story works just can't be disregarded. Yes, I personally disagree with some of the changes, and it can be a bit preachy at times, but none of that is enough to overpower the excellent story. (I may just be a sucker for Ravenclaw/overly intelligent characters though.) I've reread it more than any other fanfic, and it never fails to suck me in when I do so.

I'm currently only about a quarter of the way through it, but The *Sacrifices Arc* is shaping up to be another favourite. I absolutely love the way it's taken such commonly misused plot elements and turned them into a coherent narrative, and its wonderful handling of Dark and Light magic and pureblood culture.

*Seventh Horcrux* of course is one of the other fics I return to regularly, as it's one of the funniest yet cohesive canon rehashings I've ever encountered.

I greatly enjoyed *The Arithmancer* though I haven't read it in a while. See aforementioned attraction to intelligent characters and deep explorations of magic. :P (I do plan to reread and catch up on the series once I finish the 3m-word behemoth that is Sacrifices Arc.)

*Blindness* is my favourite overpowered!Harry fic, with a unique premise and execution.

** Top 2 :

Love in a Time of the Zombie Apocalypse by Rizzle : it's so good ! I mean who would have thought that HP+Zombies could work? And I feel it's a full story.

Hard to pick one from Colubrina but yeah I'm a Lengend of Arthur nerd so : Lady of the lake. I love dark Hermiones and I'm allways a sucker for war era stories. Be them after Voldy or while.

Others I think I'd put on my top :

Aurelian by BittyBlueEyes I don't remember it that well but I'm pretty sure it's what got me into Dramiones with Turncoat by Elizaye.

And lastly I've just finished Clean and it's sequel Marked and they were really good!
