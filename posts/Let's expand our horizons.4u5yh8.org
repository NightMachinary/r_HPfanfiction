Rec a story that you have never seen recced here before. Tell us why you like it, or why we might enjoy it. I'm so tired of seeing the same dozen fics recced over and over. Any length, any genre, any pairing, any plotline.

I'm going to rec [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=3397][Malfoy Child]] by Vorabiza. 98K words. Has a de-aged Malfoy, which I don't think I've seen often, and a unique way to restart the Potter-Malfoy relationship, since four-year-olds evidently bring out Harry's protective instincts. Good humor, amusing contrasts between the inner workings of Slytherin house and Gryffindor. A little too saccharine in places (I could do without the Angel nickname), but fun. Eventually Drarry - after the re-aging.

** The Pale Rider's Unholy Price. I'm not really a slash reader, but the writing's solid and the premise is extremely interesting. Plus the updates are coming quickly. Linkffn(12044443)

And....

Salazar's Salesmen. It's about an OC named Corvus Blackstone and his antics. It's been a while since I've read it, but I remember it fondly. His character is interesting and realistic. The kids act like kids, but aren't annoying. This story also has a sequel. Linkffn(5107751)

** This is a minor crossover with the Dresden Files, as in it took the lore and applied it seamlessly to the HP verse with theories as to why HPverse magic is different compared to the Dresdenverse magic. Pretty good characterization too. Linkffn(School Spirit by StoryEnvy)

** I'm sure it /has/ been recced a few times, but as far as "expanding horizons" goes, linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) will expand your horizons to the breaking point. It's the single most surrealistic fic that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. My nickname for it is HP Fanfiction's Catch 22.

There's not a lot of good fics that I've /never/ seen recced before... But one I'm fairly sure of is linkffn(Reinforced Magic), a HPx Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha crossover. You don't really need knowledge of MGLN to enjoy it (I certainly had none) and it's decently written with an enjoyable twist, and sequels to boot. There are likely some things that people won't enjoy, such as animal familiars turned human, but I think it's still worth a read even if you dislike such things.

EDIT: Aaaand Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus just got recced on another thread right before this. Typical... :P

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
