I have read these fanfics in the past and even put them in my favorites when I read them. But I am not entirely sure if I should ream them again since I'm feeling like reading Harry x Bellatrix again.


** The pre-second-time travel is worth reading from Delenda Est. Earl of the North is... not.

*** The second time travel was unfortunate. I was really enjoying the character interactions.

**** Up untill the second time travel Delanda Est is a really good time travel fic. It is still good afterwards but just not quite as good. Takes a little bit of determination to stick it out untill the end but worth a read as a good time travel and Harry/Bellatrix. Earl of the North is nowhere near similar to Delanda Est and not as good at all. I only read half of it and it was a very trope power house Harry.

** Delenda est is better. It would have been great of the second time jump didn't happen.

** I like delenda est, still do. The war parts after the second time jump are lesser, but i enjoyed it regardless. The highlights for me are still harry navigating his way with the elder black and Malfoy, they're really well written.

Earl of the North though... Just a powerwank.

** Earl of the North was completed a decade ago, Delenda Est was completed six years ago... it might not be the wisest thing to ask reading advice on such fics as they are now considered tropes and disliked just because of that by most people. When these were new fics and the "tropes" were still new(ish) these stories were actually well liked.

You have read them once and favourited them, you have enjoyed them so if you want to read them again just do. The worst that can happen is you decide you don't like them anymore and you lost a few hours on them before you realised it.

** Delenda Est isn't as great as when it was first written, but it's still a lot better than a lot of the garbage that gets linked on here

** I think that it really depends on your ability to enjoy re-reading stories. I have a difficult time re-reading fanfics because I already know what's going to happen and kinda quickly get bored.

** I have reread Delenda Est recently and still enjoyed it. Haven't picked up Earl of the North in a long time but don't really feel the desire to. Passageways is my other favorite Harry/Bellatrix but is sadly abandoned.

** Depends Est is not. I realised recently. They are so many issues I could not overlook this time around.

1. Harry time travels back into the past. Why didn't anyone point out he looked like James Potter since Harry is a carbon copy of him. Idk if this was ever given a reason in the book?

2. Harry suddenly time travels, ends up in the past and immediately buddy's up to Bellatrix.

3. How did Harry become a Hogwarts teacher without credentials or any of that sort?

*** I had read it last month. I don't get what people like about it. People keep saying it's a great romance story. But there's little to no substance to their relationship. It was a big disappointment from the amount of hype people gave it.

**** I think people like it because:

A) It's a classic fic - been around for ever.

B) It's always been the figurehead of it's rare, sought after pairing (Harry/Bella).

(Lesser point) C) It's a time-travel that has Harry interact with all the characters you could want, it doesn't ignore then like some fics do.

** Delenda Est isn't worth reading at all.

Harry was such an incompetent teacher (and wizard in general) in that story it was aggravating.
