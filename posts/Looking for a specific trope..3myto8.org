I want some more stories with the main character having some sort of presence in their mind or outward which guides them in the story. Examples would be Denarian Renegade and The Evil Overlord List. Anything else like that?

*** This one's great! I found it while I was scavenging around looking for more fics with a buddy cop (without slash) relationship between Loldemort and Harry.

For those who haven't had the time to read it yet, here's the premise: It's kind of similar to a few others in that you've got a sane Tom chilling inside Potter's head, but this one differs from a lot of the others because this Tom never really got over that whole OUT WITH THE MUGGLE CORRUPTION! MUGGLEBORNS SHALL BE PURGED! phase of his life and (at least to the point where I've gotten) seems to be indoctrinating Harry with his ideology.

**** I won't spoil how it ends for you, but the author goes insane on the author notes due to the ending, and basically invites anyone who wants to write a sequel. I'm kinda... writing... one. It's only about 30k words so far, I figure I'll start posting it when it gets to be 100k.

****** I know, right? It's very shocking. I reread the end chapter like five times just going "...what?"

But from the perspective of someone writing a sequel, that particular ending does so much! It gives Harry a reason to hate/fear/avoid Dumbledore without the usual "Dursleys" or "manipulating Harry's life" that every single other fic does. It sets Harry loose in the world so young that it's almost like a redo or time travel fic, but without the future knowledge. He's still 11 at the end of that fic, but he's all alone and he can't go back to Hogwarts, which avoids the boring canon redo. Personally I like Tom Riddle better than Voldemort, because there's a chance he's still redeemable, kinda.

And then there's how everybody else deals with him being missing, and... well, just read some of the reviews to get a sense of all the different directions it could go in.

I tend to go through and write all the exciting conversations and confrontations first, then go back and fill in other plot details and descriptions.

********** Well, in canon, Dumbledore planned for Harry to die all along. He /hoped/ that Harry wouldn't die permanently because of the double anchor of Voldemort using Harry's blood and the Horcrux dying in Harry's place, but this was untested magic. There were no guarantees, and Harry absolutely had to die for the Horcrux to die so that Voldemort could be killed.

So you could say that was a factor in Tozette's fic, and another factor was that Dumbledore thought Harry was possessed. Remember what happened to Quirrell when he was possessed? It was too much stress for his body and in under a year he was dying- only drinking the unicorn blood was keeping his body alive.

So I think (Tozette doesn't touch on this but I'm writing it into my sequel) that Dumbledore thinks the same thing is happening to Harry. The audience knows it isn't because we know the Horcrux in the scar just woke up and it is contained within the scar, which Harry has lived with almost all his life. But to Dumbledore, it looks like Harry will die soon from possession damage- remember, he reads Harry's mind and sees Voldemort has been there at least a year- and Harry is doomed no matter what. So since there's no way to save him, it's better to kill Harry and Voldemort together rather than risk Voldemort escaping.

In addition, he may believe that he is saving Harry from a prolonged and painful death. Remember that this is the option Dumbledore himself took- death by AK- when facing his own prolonged and painful death due to the curse from the Gaunt ring horcrux.

So, uh, to me there's still room for Dumbledore to be a good guy in this- just someone who jumped to the wrong conclusion and acted too quickly. Very Gryffindorish of him, much more than he acts in canon, IMHO.

** Do stories with horcrux interaction like linkffn(9911469) meet your criteria? There are a number of good fics with that trope.

 

There is also a recently started fic, called /Path to Victory/. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3mnpgv/path_to_victory_a_hpworm_crossover/][It was discussed a few days ago]]. It can tenuously be called a HP/Worm crossover. I've enjoyed it a lot so far, and it is comprehensible whether or not you've read Worm.

 

There is also a time travel/do-over fic with a twist: Harry goes back, and thought he'd have his younger body to himself. Instead he's stuck as a voice in young Harry's head and has to convince his young self to cooperate. I don't remember the name of this fic, hopefully another redditor can swoop in with a linkffn

** linkffn(Moratorium)

Female Harry is abused to the point of developing an 'evil' personality. Doesn't start out exactly like what you're looking for until the second or maybe even third chapter.

Pretty good over all. Good enough that I wish it were expanded into a 'proper' series with a good 80-120k words per book.
