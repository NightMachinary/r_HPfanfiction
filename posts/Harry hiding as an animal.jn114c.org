I'm currently reading My Maltese Tiger by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/elvirakitties/pseuds/elvirakitties][elvirakitties]] and I've read another where Harry puts on a collar (belonged to Malfoys) and gets stuck as a panther, with only Draco knowing who he is. I love this idea. Harry being an animal (Animagus) and getting to sneak around, hide from the world, get to see people in a different light, or learning things aren't how he thought. All while the wizarding world (Dumbledore) is looking for him.

Now I tend to favor stories where Dumbledore is bad/manipulative/evil, with select character bashing, and Harry befriending Draco, Severus, Or Tom. I like gray Harry or even just over it harry, you know the ones where he isn't good or bad but just tired of every one demanding shit from him. I want to read these kinds of stories.

I'd like slash pairing but I'm fine with gen or het. The only thing besides him being in hiding as an animal that I'd really like is him befriending someone (hopefully Slytherin/dark wizard) that he doesn't in canon. Like Draco, Blaise, Theo, those character that are typical "bad" or "dark". who we only get to see that one side of in the books.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Little Harry Potter was not the biggest fan of his own life, but what could he possibly do about it? Escaping to play video games in the dark of night helps... but only a little. A Gamer Fic.
