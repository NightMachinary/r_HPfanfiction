So I've had an interesting idea lately. I wanted to do a short story about Harry right after Deathly Hallows. Harry was basically on the doorstep of the afterlife, spitting distance from seeing the people he'd wanted to meet his whole life (his parents) as well as having lost those closest to them (Sirius and Lupin). I always figured that would have a huge impact on someone, even a resilient person like Harry. Coping with losing the chance to move on for several more decades by returning to life where there would be sad kind of loneliness with no decent relatives around and losing a chance to get to know them.

I wanted to explore that and I finished with it the other day. I've not seen a story about this topic before, though it's easy to miss given the nearly 800K HP fanfics on FFN. I'll be releasing chapters every week or so. It will be short when it's all said and done with. Tell me what you think!

  Mortal minds were not meant to see the splendor of the Beyond before their time came, not even the Master of Death. After slaying Voldemort, Harry must find something to help him come to grips with his sojourn to the afterlife lest the temptation of the Veil win out...

** I just read the first chapter and it is really good!! One thing I would say would be just to comb through it for a few missing words and grammatical corrections but I really like the way you have the story moving.

***** Once a week or so. As I say in the OP, I've already written the whole thing out (though I need to properly separate the final two chapters in my document, they run into each other right now because laziness). It's fairly short, although annoyingly writing it took up most of August meaning my other stories were on the backburner.
