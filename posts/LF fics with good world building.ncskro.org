Harry or Hermione are not the central character, preferably they remain in the background.

No bashing


** So technically Harry is the main character in this, but he goes by a different name the majority of the story and you honestly forget. One of my all-time faves. Could totally be its own book. Author explores tons of new avenues of magic and new locations and schools. Highly recommend!

** Rose Petal Red has a SI reincarnated into a Harry Potter AU. Definitely includes lots of worldbuilding and Harry and Hermione aren't the central characters. linkao3(26470377)

** Which kind of world building are you after?

Literally exploring the world, seeing other countries with different magical traditions? linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has some of that, although it's a modest amount in a very long story, and Harry /and/ Hermione are in the foreground (they're siblings).

Expanding on aspects of magical theory and areas of magic that canon glosses over? linkffn(The Arithmancer) goes a lot into spell engineering, with some ritual magic as it progresses, but it features Hermione (Harry is in the background). linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has a lot about Potions and about magical affinities - the difference between Dark and Light magic, between Pureblood and first-generation magic, etc, plus some exploration of mind magic. Technically Harry is the protagonist, but she's a totally different person from canon Harry.

Filling in more of the gaps in magical society and how their community operates from day to day? Northumbrian has a lot of short stories that give insight into regular Wizarding life after the war; linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is a nice one about Harry and Ginny moving into a new neighbourhood with their children, told mostly from their new neighbour's perspective.

What kind of building would you like?

*** Would prefer exploring the wizarding world, different cultures and traditions in different regions.

Daily life in british magical world would also be fine

Thanx for the recs, but don't these have Harry or Hermione as a central character?
