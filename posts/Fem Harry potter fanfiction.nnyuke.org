Hi everyone I'm looking for a Fem Harry Potter fanfiction where she falls in love with Myrddin Emerys (Merlin) and is traveling the world. She can get to the past through time traveling or being the master of death. I just read A long Journey home so I'm looking for a new one like it.

  Beth's ill-advised jaunt into the Department of Mysteries goes badly, because of course it does. She ends up accidentally causing a weird magical chain-reaction and getting herself tossed a thousand years into the past, because OF COURSE she does. At this point, she's not even surprised anymore. That's just her luck, isn't it?
