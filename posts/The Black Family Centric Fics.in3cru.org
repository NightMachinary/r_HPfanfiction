Personally I think the Black family and their general bloodline had the most complex family relation (and not just because of the pureblood inbreeding that makes everyone practically related).

So basically my request is, any fics with good world building that explores the Black family dynamic would be great. It doesn't necessarily have to be super canon compliant, as long as it's not crazy far off.

For example, each of the Black sisters have their own backstory that is somewhat briefly glazed over in the books. As for Draco I strongly believe he could have gotten a redemption arc and would love to see things in his perspective.

I also love romance fics so maybe pairings like narcissa + luicius, regulus + oc, andormeda + teddy. I'm open to fics without romance tho! Anything is great ❤️

Anyways, I understand that this request may be super specific but if anyone has recommendations!!! Thanks in advance :)

Also feel free to leave behind headcanons/ canon things that you know about the Black family because l'd love to hear it.


** I highly recommend izzythehutt's Black family series, based on the premise of Regulus surviving the cave, crashing with Sirius, and involving him again with his estranged family.

  Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent.Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life.[AU of the First Wizarding War in which stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together - Winner of 2018 Shrieking Shack Society Silver Marauders Medal for Best Sirius Characterization]

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history looms large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker (and more boring) than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web---and his cousin Narcissa's social set.Meanwhile, Walburga hatches a daring scheme to restore her wild firstborn's damaged reputation in the family---finding him a suitable bride---while Orion grapples with the past, and the high price his two sons have paid for his inaction.[Regulus Black Lives/Black Family Witness Protection AU.

** Hey! I have quite a few fics about the Black family, mostly Regulus-centric - my profile's [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/unspeakable3][here]]. I'm currently writing a canon-compliant fic about Regulus's final years, there are some snippets on my Tumblr [[https://unspeakable3.tumblr.com/tagged/lionheart][here]].

Can also recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian/works?fandom_id=136512][TheDivineComedian]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/such_heights/pseuds/such_heights/works?fandom_id=136512][such_heights]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/thewhitebirds/pseuds/thewhitebirds/works?fandom_id=136512][thewhitebirds]]!

As for headcanons... I have a lot, haha! Anything specific you wanted to chat about?

** One of my favorite fics of all time. This follows Andromeda's life from childhood to marriage, and heartbreakingly captures the dynamics between the Black sisters and their cousins.

So, so good. It was written like 15 years ago though, and the sisters' ages are a little skewed, but that's very easy to ignore.

  Andromeda says little, but she sees everything. Through their years at Hogwarts, she watches her sisters as one falls in love and one falls into madness, and doesn't see as a muggleborn boy breaks into her sheltered life. Now Complete.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)
