Can anyone point me to a fic where Snape is portrayed with the same personality as canon (aka doesn't start being super nice and caring out of nowhere) where he and Harry stop hating each other so much? Due to Snape seeing the humble good side of Harry or Harry realizing the truth about Snape's alligence?


** Mlocatis in ff.net almost exclusively writes stories like that. Check out her profile. Crime and Punishment is her most updated story... Sorry I don't know how to use the bot. They're very centered around the snape/harry guardian relationship though. Not much of the Hogwarts plotline is developed.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed, un-Britpicked, unapologetic.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** linkao3(World in Pieces)

Has a lot of character interaction between Harry and Snape. Might not be exactly what you're looking for, but still really good. There's also a one shot in that universe where the other dimension's Snape speaks to Canon Snape. Definitely worth a shot.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.
