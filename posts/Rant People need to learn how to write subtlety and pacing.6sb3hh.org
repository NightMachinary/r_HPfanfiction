What i mean by this is in most of the newer fics that i have read the pacing is far to fast and the story is easy to read. In one story harry is apparently Ginny's soul mate but Imperioused to be friends with Ron. after the fight with the basilisk harry is trying to save Ginny when all of a sudden the soul fragment in his head pops out and says "harry we should fuze u could become super powerful" and i instantly dropped the fic like the plague. As ive said hefore i am noticing this problem with newer fics and its beginning to urk me especially since its this very problem thats preventing me from sorting by recently updated instead of favorites when i search.

(Written on phone sorry for grammar)

** Sure, but at the very least, they're breathing life into the fandom. And all authors start somewhere -- I'll always support a fic even if I personally don't enjoy it. Years later they may write something I vividly enjoy.

*** Not sure about this. Many times when I come across a story that has fast-pacing and no subtlety, I find that the author hasn't read the Harry Potter books, regarding the films as canon (which is fine to an extent), with a great many stories not even being completed. It seems like these authors aren't exactly breathing life into the fandom, as they don't respect the source material, but more and more are becoming self-inserts, with the author positioning him/herself as one of the characters in the story.

You are reading some weird fics, because in most of bothe new and old fics that I've read or tried to (and that includes a big portion of fics recommended here) the problem is that the pacing is too slow and there are tens of thousands of words between things actually happening.

** Be the change you want to see in the world and all that.

Hate to be a dinger like the other commenters, but if I picked up a fic written as you've written this post I would drop it. Though you wrote in on the phone, would you go back and edit it for clarity? Probably not. Same as most authors.

- uncapitalized I's

- run on sentences

- fuze > *fuse*

- urk > *irk*

- Ive > I'*ve*

- hefore > *before*

- Its > *It's*

- thats > *that's*

I've probably written 300k of drafted stories in my life. One-shots, novella's, and attempts at full-fledged novels.

I've read books on storycraft, characterisation, plotting, editing, and grammar. I've gone through books with a notepad by my side and jotted down things for hours as I read; sentences that grabbed my attention, intense descriptions, awe-inspiring scenes.

It's difficult as fuck to write a /good/ story. It's just about impossible for most people to write a /great/ story. You need fundamental understanding of structuring a story, capturing the main characters in your mind, then melding them with a water-tight plot . . . and the patience to keep the story unpublished while you edit it for weeks or months to polish it to perfection.

** Correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like the vast majority of the "good" authors have left the HP Fanfiction world... I got into this about ten years ago when things were still going strong, but I can tell that its started to see a decline.

I'm not saying that all new fics are trash now; I'm saying that the percentage of good has begun to rapidly decline.

*** I have exactly the opposite impression.

Most of my top favorites were completed after 2014.

I think with fandom getting older, the average quality of fics is also getting better.

If you sort FFN fics based on Favorites, you will notice that trashy Dramione romances are being pushed out from the top. Only two remain on first page.

I see that you are mostly interested in H/G stories. Yes, I kind agree that there is a lack of good ones in recent years.

***** First of all, given how the last three Books were written, Harry and Ginny were very well suited for each other:

- Both were intimately violated by Voldemort and survived. Harry began to notice Ginny when she brought him out of his brooding during Christmas in Year 5.

- She was a core member of the DA. In fact, calling it 'Dumbledore's Army' was her idea. Then she went with him to the DoM, faced 12 veteran Death Eaters, fought valiantly, and survived.

- She was great at Quidditch, and led the team to victory in Year 5 when Harry was barred from playing. She was again instrumental in winning the decisive game in Year 6, when Harry was sitting in Detention. They kissed after that event.

- She had an evil sense of humor which Harry greatly appreciated. Mocking Fleur, beating up Zach Smith, and making fun of Ron were just the ones mentioned in the Books.

- She was obviously very attractive, and Book Harry definitely went for very good looking girls at the school.

- She knew and understood Harry much better than Hermione. One key instance was how differently she and Hermione reacted after Harry cut Draco up in Year 6. Hermione was gloating with self-righteousness, while Ginny offered Harry unconditional support.

--------------

According to our surveys (3 since 2015) here, Ginny's biggest haters are TEENAGE GIRLs, while her fans are teenage boys and OLDER WOMEN. But since teenage girls are DISPROPORTIONATELY OVERREPRESENTED among HP fanfic authors, we also get a disproportionate number of Ginny bashing fics.

Character wise, Ginny was an aggressive and loyal warrior, the good version of Bellatrix IMO. She was more suited for the sidekick role than the main one. Hermione, on the other hand, was the mastermind or the good version of Tom Riddle, and that makes her far more interesting as a main character.

Personally, I'm neutral on pairings as long as they are credibly written, and that's perhaps why I'm finding more and more good new stories as opposed to the person I replied to.

***** Most of the awkwardness comes from the fact that much of Ginny's character development occurs off-screen (so to say), and as such it can be hard for people to connect the points at which we see her, you basically have to hunt down for anything with a magnifying lens. That lead many people to deciding that she is a flat character with no traits and thus automatically unsuitable, and from then on certain fanfic authors took what is known of her and started bashing her to show how greatly unsuitable a partner she has to be.

I am not a fan of the pairing (I am not someone who is into pairings, and when I read romance I prefer to see it develop so this pairing elicits a shrug from me), but I never had any issues with treating it as a possible match. And I say that as ... well, according to the survey I probably count as an “older” woman, but seriously fuck that phrasing.
