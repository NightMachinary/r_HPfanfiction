:END:
I read this a couple of years ago. So I think it starts off after the war, everyone's happy and Harry's engaged to Ginny. He's at the Weasley's house and somehow travels back in time to the day of Snape's Worst Memory. While he's there, he tells Snape to tell Lily "how he really feels" before going to Dumbledore, who helps him get back to his own time. When he arrives, he finds out that he is now Harry Snape, son of Severus and Lily, and he has a brother named Draco Snape. Neville is the BWL and is engaged to Ginny. Harry speaks to Dumbledore's portrait to get help to return to the old timeline and convinces his old friends to trust him by showing them a picture of the 6 of them (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville). Also, Ginny (the one who's engaged to Neville) tells Harry that she's in love with Draco and makes him swear to never tell anyone else.
