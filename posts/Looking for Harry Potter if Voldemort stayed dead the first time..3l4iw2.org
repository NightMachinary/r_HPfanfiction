** wouldn't that just be a fic about a kid that goes to a school? Nearly everything interesting happened as a result of voldemort

*** This is really the kind of attitude that kills fanfiction. Interesting things can happen without Voldemort around. If they didn't happen in canon, make them happen. Seriously, there are just so many plots besides "Defeat the Evil Overlord".

**** Agreed! All sorts of interesting plots can happen and have already been written. To think otherwise is a show of poor imagination.

*** Yeah, I guess... but it would be about a Wizard School. And I always thought the magic aspect was much more interesting than the action and emotional stuff.

*** Even with Voldemort dead a lot of stuff can still happen:

- The death eaters are still out there under Malfoy.
- Pettigrew is still a rat and disguised as Scabbers.
- Sirius Black's situation is still not resolved.
- Bartemius Crouch jr is still out there and will break free in year 4 regardless.
- ...

A lot can still happen without Voldemort's direct involvement.

**** It's also the perfect setup for a manipulative Dumbledore.

The main antagonist to such a fic should be a Dumbledore who believes Voldemort is not truly gone, and ruins a kid's life because of the ramblings of a 'seer'.

Keypoints could be :

- A young harry tries to escape the machinations of a politically powerful figure in the name of freedom.

- Harry being painted as a darklord

- Harry actually 'becoming' a dark lord

- Harry gathering and leading oppressed magical races to fight for independence (house elves and werewolves being two examples, and goblins always seem to be up for some rebellion)

There's probably more, buy you get the idea.

***** Especially when he'd probably be more successful than Voldemort. I mean, he seemed to be on the rise before Voldemort returned, and has just a bit more sanity and subtlety than Voldemort has. And then add Barty Jr. as a loose cannon who tries to hurt both sides...

****** But then Winky caught him again, did she not? That's why she was the one who had Harry's wand. She forced him under the invisibility cloak before the Ministry officials showed up and Mr. Crouch Sr. took him home.

Then afterwards Pettigrew and Voldemort had heard about him from Bertha Jorkins, so they came and freed him and put Crouch Sr. under Imperius.

** Thorny Rose Trilogy by Brennus, linkffn(9631998;9969456;10288020), and the Accidental Bond by kbo, linkffn(5604382), are both great stories that did away Voldemort without him being resurrected. But they are M rated.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11453335/1/The-All-New-Adventures-Of-Hermione-Granger-In-The-Chance-Of-A-Lifetime][I think this story kind of fits it]], although the story will probably be from Hermione's perspective most of the time. I have no clue what other challenges the 'fates' have drawn up for Hermione and Harry though. It's new and WIP, I discovered it yesterday.
