I am looking for Fic recommendations of Master of Death and/or Political Fanfiction. I would prefer if it was long and complete but any non complete long fic is fine as well. Even better if it somehow starts with Harry at it before the start of first year or being sent to before that time through time travel. Actually any time travel as long as it involves politics and/or master of Death Harry is fine. Now if that are fics that are amazing that are political and/or master of Death Harry without a long length feel free to share them as long as the story will feel complete after I finish reading it. Pairings are okay, as long as Harry doesn't end up with Ron, or Draco. Multiple characters in one relationship is fine as well. Bashing is fine to as long as it is reasonable and makes sense for the plot. Basically any trope is fine, I really don't mind even overdone ones. Thanks for taking the time to respond to this. If you need clarification on what I enjoy feel free to ask me, I will respond as promptly as I can. Thanks again for the recommendations. Also, one last thing, if possible I prefer FanFiction.Net, because of the app which lets me download the story but other sites work too.

The Pureblood Pretense (and sequels, author is midway through book 4) is my favorite 'political' fanfic. It doesn't use a lot of the fanon cliches most political fics have--11 year old politicians, Harry being a Lord at 11 and easily effecting political change, boring Wizengamot stuff, etc. But the central conflict of the story is political--it's an AU where Tom Riddle became a politician instead of a Dark Lord, and enacted a Pureblood supremacist agenda. It does a great job of making Riddle & co sinister and dangerous antagonists without them having to be deranged terrorists.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
