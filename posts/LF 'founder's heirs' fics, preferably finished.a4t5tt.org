** While not completely genetically accurate, Harry Potter and the Founder's Four by Darthmarrs has a magical inheritance.

The Dangerverse by whydoyouneedtoknow has genetic and magical inheritance, which multiple characters receiving "inheritances." Warning, the entire series is /long./ Also the first work of the series is not as polished as the rest, as it was the author's first ever longstyle fanfic, and was a bit of a learning experience.

Years before that fateful event, a green-eyed toddler is found by Salazar Slytherin, who decides to take him in as an heir. But the child has dreams much greater than simply being Slytherin's heir.

** Cassandra Claire incorporated time travel and founder heirs into her Draco Trilogy, if you're interested. It's not on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] since she got published, but you can still find PDFs of her work. The Trilogy was started between PoA and GoF, and I believe it was completed before OotP came out, so it deviates from canon a great deal. You'll see a lot of inspiration for The Mortal Instruments series in it.
