Okay so does anyone remember at the end of tron legacy when Sam's dad sacrificed himself in the most harass way possible? Does anyone have a fan fiction where that scene even remotely happens? So harry sacrifice, dumbledore, hell even voldemort sacrifice would be amazing if it was in this form. So anyone help please, and if you haven't seen this scene GO AND WATCH IT!!!


** What about Dumbledore sacrificing himself, using Lily's ritual, to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes? In the middle of a battle?

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
