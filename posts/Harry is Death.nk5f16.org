Harry becomes the entity/god/eldritch monstrosity Death.

That's all. Thank you


** On a Pale Horse on ffnet and AO3 fits the bill. It's a bit cracky and is unfortunately abandoned, but it is definitely worth a read.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

**** Quite probably for the last of the four, since it takes place in the Buffyverse. For the first one, it only has limited influence from Buffy, so I *think* it should be easy enough to follow without having watched the show, but can't say for certain. I do know that I've been able to follow other crossovers by the same author that involve settings I knew little or nothing about, so chances are good you'd just miss a reference here or a joke there.
