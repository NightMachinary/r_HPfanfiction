** People enjoy enemies to lovers trope. That Draco keeps coming back after getting his ass handed to him and Harry spends months following him around doesn't help (or does depending on your view of things).

** u/kdbvols:
#+begin_quote
  ‘...he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick --' ‘You have told me this at least a dozen times already,' said Mr Malfoy
#+end_quote

This is a direct quote from Chamber of Secrets. There's probably a bit of an obsession there, I don't think it's too crazy. Way less crazy to me than Harry/Bellatrix, and while there aren't as many of them, Delenda Est was an enjoyable read

** Several things that have already been said in here plus more.

1. They honestly are a bit obsessed with each other in canon. Because of this it's fairly easy to assume they would 'notice' the other if they were attracted to them.

2. Enemies to lovers is a popular trope and as someone who enjoys the trope it's just fun to me. This plus it honestly seems like they go out of their way to annoy each other sometimes.

3. There really isnt a better gay ship for main characters. Harry is kind of familial and very platonic friends with the weasley kids so they just arent seen like that as much. That plus there arent a ton of rlly fleshed out male characters Harry's age.

Like it's not everyone's cup of tea but its popular so people have their reasons. And honestly for a lot of fandoms the most shipped relationships tend to be gay ones.

** I dont get it either. I think a lot of people just infer sexual tension from their mutual hatred.

** Why not ? It's fandom. It's (meant to be) fun

** I suspect the movies. They portray Draco more favorably. In my mind, AVPM portrays Draco's character more authentically, despite being a parody.

** Drarry feels like something you'd only get if you read the books or -- more likely -- saw the movies as a teenager and up.

Because...

A) Movie Draco is very charming.

And B) Post Puberty people probably percieve possible parings with a passion more often that pre puberty people do.

And as someone who read HP in the 4th grade and has a noncommittal relationship with the movies... I don't really get it either.

** Probably enemies to lovers and the fact Draco (at least from a article I read, do correct me if I'm wrong) tried to offer friendship and Harry declined. Plus they'd look kinda cute together, at least that's my opinion. This is all coming from a Drarry shipper who doesn't get involved with the fandom though haha. The whole “they'd look cute together” is mainly because their hair colors are completely different from each (Draco's being super light and Harry's being super dark). Not sure why other people ship them though, that's just my reasons

** I believe that many people feel strong titillating vibes from homosexual relationships of the other gender. And majority of readers of fanfiction are women.
