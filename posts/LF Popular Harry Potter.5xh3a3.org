Looking for a Harry where in Hogwarts he's popular, as in King of Slytherin he has somewhat of a title in school and he's well known / liked or even feared.


** Jeconais has a fic called motivations that has Harry become sort of popular and branch out to new friends. I thought the author did a good job dealing with the high school mentality of trying to balance new and old friends in it. I personally don't like the romance between Harry and Astoria in it, though.

*** The romance in that story is ridiculous. It also has the classic Jeconais trope of having Harry stand up in the middle of the great hall to announce his plans and schemes to all and sundry.

*** This fic is getting recommended like crazy the last few months and I'm anxious to start it. However I never read unfinished fics due to so many good ones being abandoned. Can you tell based on the arc so far how close it is to being completed?

**** I wouldn't worry about it being abandoned, the author had a mailing list and he talks about his schedule for posting! Hopefully because of that he won't decide that the story is boring and abandon it

***** How trope-y is the fic? The title, the harem and everything makes it seem so.
