You are a new resident at Privet Drive. You can't quite remember why you decided to move here of all places, but it must have been a good idea. Right? Upon moving in you get warned about a violent thug living in the area. Upon the 'thug' being pointed out to you, you realise something. The 'thug' has green eyes. The 'thug' has messy black hair. The 'thug', when the wind catches the hair, has a lightning bolt scar.

​

You have no magic. You have all of the knowledge that you can remember without looking anything up. If you contact the magical world directly, you will be ignored and obliviated as a security risk.

​

Subtlety is the name of the game here. You have a couple of years before Harry leaves for Hogwarts, and in that time you need to improve things enough that the second blood war doesn't end with a sea of corpses.

​

Just remember: if you see a green light, duck.


** Pretty simple. First talk to the Dursleys to make things a little easier for Harry. Then get involved in the magical world. Make up a backstory for knowing magic, such as having had a muggleborn older brother who got tragically killed in the war at age twelve. Then when talking to Mrs Figg mention how intelligent her kneazles are, she'll ask how you know about magical cats and that's how you can steer the conversation towards the magical world. With an excuse to know about magic and a neighbor who probably has an owl or something similar, you can get access to magical newspapers and books. Visiting Diagon should be doable. Once you have your own robes you should be able to walk around in the wizarding world without anyone thinking anything about it, if anyone notices lack of magic they'll assume you're a squib and if someone asks, you have a backstory. Now you can go to the Ministry where you can run into Arthur Weasley, talk about batteries and things like that, get invited to the Burrow and somehow find out that the rat definitely isn't a normal rat. Get the Weasleys to call aurors while Scabbers is sleeping and get Pettigrew arrested and Sirius freed. Now Harry can get a proper father figure and pre Hogwarts preparation with you as a close friend to Sirius, Harry, and the Weasleys. Talk Sirius into letting you visit Grimmauld somehow and you have the perfect opportunity to stumble across a Horcrux. Now Dumbledore can get involved and start hunting those years in advance. Once Harry is at Hogwarts you can write letters to him to guide him in the right directions. The Heir situation should just result in another Horcrux quickly discovered with a hint or two, just mention that you suspect a cursed object being involved. Mention to Dumbledore that he should put some sort of monitoring charms on any location Voldemort related, such as Riddle Manor and the graveyard where Tom Senior is buried, and Voldemort will get a surprise visit by Dumbledore, the entire Order and half of the auror force while he's still an ugly baby. Tell him all Horcruxes are destroyed (even if you didn't actually get all of them yet, Harry is a tricky one) to avoid ugly baby Voldemort escaping by suicide, and you have him pretty much captured. Now let Dumbledore and the Department of Mysteries figure out a way to get rid of him without killing Harry and you're done. Bonus points for investing in Apple as soon as you arrived in the 80s.

** Tell Figg enough stuff to convince her to get a sit-down with Dumbledore. Infodump on him. A fully-informed Dumbledore solves canon in a day. Write everything down in advance if, for some reason, Figg contacts the DMLE and has me obliviated (per the prompt) before I can infodump on Dumbledore.

Immediately move back to America and look up my family and friends. Realize they're all either nonexistent or 30 years younger than I remember, they have no idea who I am, and any attempt to convince them will see me committed to a mental institution.

Head into a downward spiral of alcoholism and despair at the loss of my life, my loved ones, and anything that gave my existence meaning.

** The character could be a Muggle that just happens to know of magic, maybe they can say that they have a sibling that has magic.

Petunia knew of magic, even though she wasn't a witch after all.

Though the biggest issue is what to do with the knowledge that you have? You can't use an owl, as far as I'm aware only magical folks and squibs can use owls.

You can't see Hogwarts if you're a Muggle, only magical folks and squibs can... mhm this is tough.

The closest thing that you could probably do is contact Arabella Figgs; who would be right next door to Harry, and try and get her to understand that the privacy of Witches and Wizards hasn't been breached, and that you can possibly help, though in a way that won't get you obliviated.

That is definitely tough. It'd be easier if you were a squib at least, you'd be able to see Hogwarts and contact the correct people using owls, however as a Muggle you're next to useless in contacting people, and as you said you can either do it subtlety, which would probably be the best bet, or try to attempt to get Arabella Figgs on your side, without getting your mind wiped, which might be what happens anyway, if you aren't careful.

Write anonymous op-ed pieces about how the lack of trial and the frankly circumstantial evidence around the arrest of Sirius Black.

Anonymous tip to the ministry that Peter Pettigrew was an illegal animagus.

Randomly remind Harry that he should always check all of his options before jumping to conclusions. (Don't trust Kreature when he says Sirius is not there, that way they never go to the ministry in the first place and Sirius doesn't die.)

When Harry is in school, write anonymous tips to him and Hermione to solve their puzzles faster.

Anonymous tip to Dumbledore to seek out the Horcruxes. Don't waste time trying to confirm with Slughorn that he did create them, just assume that he did and start hunting. (I wouldn't be able to even give them exact locations because I don't remember all of the specifics)

** Without going into the magical world?

Get hired as a teacher at Harry's elementary school and get involved in his early education.

Introduce him to the game dungeons and dragons as an after-school activity. Literally run him a campaign that is a bit of a railroad completely based on the events that he will go through upon reaching hogwarts.

Eventually after a couple years of breezing through school and knowing things like how the mirror of erised works or the philosophers stone, chamber of secrets basilisk etc etc etc. Harry would probably think I am a seer. Would get in front of Dumbledore most likely by the time 2nd or 3rd year wraps. Infodump from that point forward.

Any explanation about ties to the magical world are I'm a foreigner traveling from America, but have a magical grandparents who raised me and recently passed away.

** You know, I'm pretty sure if I told Figg "Yo, can you get a message to Dumbledore for me", he wouldn't just obliviate me on the spot. Probably.

If I don't want to go that route... Find a witch. Needs to be someone, preferably with resources, who is willing to marry a Muggle. Probably one who is willing to view marriage as a practical arrangement rather than a romantic one (ie, I trade her knowledge of the future, after demonstrating its accuracy, in exchange for access to the Wizarding World). Marry her. Legal way in to the Wizarding World, but will take time. Learn any and all forms of magic I can use- like, I don't see any reason a Muggle can't wield a goblin steel blade, or wear a hat with a shield charm cast on it- the magic is imbued in the item. Find out the legal limits on me owning property/working/etc. in the magical world. Make a list of things that Muggles know that wizards don't, and start disseminating the knowledge. I think I'll set up a business as a private tutor catering to Muggleborns and half-bloods who don't want to fall behind on the Muggle side of the world. Maybe see if I can get Dumbledore (who is very open-minded about hiring) to give me the Muggle Studies job when and if it comes open.

Probably should get a gun. This will likely be very, very hard to do legally in the UK.

Oh, and I pay Voldie's dad's tomb a visit, dig it up, and torch the remains. Try resurrecting now, Riddle!
