** If I had to take a guess I'd say yes. Werewolves cannot be Animagi, so I imagine Animagi cannot be werewolves.

Though, it would be fun to see a lycanthropy-infected McGonagall turn into a giant sabertooth cat on full moons.

*** I also think it all boils down to blood. I think the intense procedure it takes to become an animagus is sort of a way to change someone's genetic code. I don't think people who are an animagus have the same sort of blood as only humans, which could totally deter, and even gross out, a werewolf.

**** One idea I've always stuck by is that the Animagus is a representation of one's soul/magic, becoming an Animagi involves fully manifesting your "inner beast". In this case the Lychanthropy Curse alters an individual to such an extent (or specifically targeting the magic/soul that involves Animagi) that you could not change yourself enough either way.

** I wonder if it's the same for metamorphmagus.

** I like to think of it as another one of those wacky laws of magic. Easily bent but never actually broken.

For example, we know that magic cannot create food. It's one of the fundamental laws. Yet nothing stops you from /enlarging/ food, maybe even duplicating food. The end result is the same -- you get food from magic -- but you've not violated the fundamental law.

And so a fundamental law of lycanthropy is that humans who survive being bitten by a werewolf gain the disease. But that's the thing, isn't it? When you're an animagus in your animal form, you're not human. You're a cat, or a rat, or a deer, or a dog, or whatever. Since a human didn't survive being bitten by a werewolf, the animagus doesn't get infected by the disease.

I think an animagus in their human form is just as susceptible to lycranthropy as anyone else, and it would likely strip away their ability to transform into their animal self, since werewolves are unable to become animagi.

** Reminds me of the Albus Potter series where this exact same thing is discussed in great detail.

** I'm pretty sure werewolves must be descended from some kind of cursed animagus transformation gone wrong. So it would make sense that a werewolf would recognize an animagus as a fellow animal.

** Yeah. I had talked to a lot of people over this exact same thing when I was writing my latest chapter of Seasons of the Witch. Harry fought a werewolf while in his animagus form. Ultimately the consensus that I reached was that I had to use the spirit of the law, which means that lycanthopy only affects humans. So, while you can look into it deeper and what it ultimately means to be human, but I really just looked to canon and Sirius and friends could "keep Remus in check" so that's what I used as my baseline for Lycanthopy not effecting animagi.

** My headcanon is that if an animagus is bitten while in human form, the werewolf curse will duke it out with their inner animal for control of the human. Usually, the werewolf will win and destroy their animagus ability. Very rarely the curse can be fought off with possible negative consequences for their animagus form.
