Hi, I was hoping someone might be able to help me find a fanfiction where Remus Lupin opens a book store and adopts Harry (may have been gender swapped or Hermione); the story starts off with Harry as a child. If I remember correctly they lived together above the bookstore. Sorry I can't provide more detail I read it several years ago and I haven't been able to find it since.

Thank you all for your help.

Edit: Added more detail.


** It wouldn't be Living with Danger, would it? Remus Lupin does adopt Harry in that, as well as Hermione, and I'm pretty sure he at least works in a bookshop at some point during the fic...
