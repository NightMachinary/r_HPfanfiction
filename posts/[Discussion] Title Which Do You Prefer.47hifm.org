I have two working titles for my Harry Potter fic. I've been agonizing over which one to use and just can't decide, so I thought I'd appeal to folks here...

I'm mostly interested in first reactions, so I won't give a plot summary. Just know that it is humor/parody.

So, without further ado, the two titles:

Harry Potter and the Really Big Hug

OR

Harry Potter and the Mildly Suggestive Handshake

Preferences?

EDIT: Wow, thanks everyone! I didn't expect such a big response.

It looks like the winner is definitely "Harry Potter and the Mildly Suggestive Handshake." Thus, I'll stick with that, or some very close variation on it like "Slightly Suggestive."

In case anyone else is wondering: I'll start posting the story sometime soon, in a week or so. I expect to do weekly or semi-weekly updates. Probably on fanfiction.net...

Thanks again!

** Just to be different, I think you should name it "Harry Potter and the Semi Sensual Shake", get some alliteration going in there.

*** Haha, I like that! The "mildly suggestive" bit has something of a double meaning that fits with the plot, so I don't think I can add in "sensual"--but I might work with the alliteration idea to make it "slightly suggestive" instead.

** Yeah the second definitively has a striking aura. I would read it just to understand the title, so I think it's a great one.

**** Its appropriate to promote your first chapter (or set of chapters, basically whatever you publish at first). After that, avoid *new* promotions except at major milestones: you finished a school year in a multi year fic, you completed the story, etc.

Its would be fine to post a comment in your original promotion when you have completed chapters if you wish, though most of the time people that care would have just followed your story.

We like to support the authors in our community, but we don't want the feed flooded with self promotions. Keep that in mind and you should be fine.
