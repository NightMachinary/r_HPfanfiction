I noticed that quite a few post war stories say that Andromeda Tonks is too old to care for Teddy. According to the wiki she was born between 1951 and 55. She would be 42-47 when the war ended, quite possibly able to still have a child on her own. So why age her up?


** That's an even weirder thing in this fandom, what with wizards living longer lives than muggles. You'd have to age Andromeda to older than Dumbledore to reliabily impact her ability to care for a child.

*** I assume most people think grandmother -> really old even though Andromeda had her daughter at a young age (18-22) and Tonks was 24/25 when she had Teddy. Granted Tonks looks really old in DH but the movies fucked up a lot of ages, like the Potters in the mirror scene or Narcissa in HBP (who was 41 but looks 55-65).

**** And that is your answer: the movies fucked up a lot of ages.

Andromeda isn't really seen, so people take how Tonks looked, think that she's like eleventy bajilion years old, and add 20 to 30 years to that to get Andromeda's age, thus arriving at some weird value.

It's a common thing with movie stuff. People who remember the movies more than the books, or worse yet had only ever watched the movies and never read the books, end up with mistakes of this kind left and right.

** I think it would depend on what the plot needs to happen to Teddy. If he needs to go to Harry for the plot then having her be too old to care for Teddy is an easy way to make that happen. Also, it could be that the author may not be calculating her age based on the time in the books but based on the current year while still leaving other characters a specific age.

*** But why change her age just to get Teddy to Harry? After she lost her husband and daughter (not sure if she cared about Lupin) being unable to care for a baby would be a perfectly valid excuse.

Then again, of all characters Harry would probably need the most therapy.

***** You remember that Harry went through a decade of abuse before even starting at Hogwarts where he went through several therapy-requiring events each year, right? He had to kill at 11, has memories of his parents being brutally murdered right in front of him and lost nearly all important adults in his life. He would be beyond fucked up after the war.

****** You could also say that Harry is a strong character as the abuse did not effect him. Even though he was under a lot of pressure and a lot of things happened to him he always dealt with it well.

I'm not sure who would need the therapy the most, but I can imagine Hermione (she is overthinking and trying to rationalize stuff..), George (who lost Fred) or even Draco (who we did see almost broken in HBP)

******* Draco is a good suggestion. The others at least have the consolation that they fought for a just cause, but Draco in the end realizes that he did horrible things for a horrible cause. He's like one of those teenagers brainwashed by the Hitler youth who had to fight in the last days of WW2.

Thinking about what the generation of my grandparents went through, I think humans are generally way more resilient than many people in the fandom assume. Of course therapy can help coping faster and better, but many people who went through fucked up situations are eventually still able to live normal lives afterwards without it.

******* This is a fucked up view of therapy.

To the audience: If you're listening, and you've considered therapy for any reason, then go if you're able to do so. Going to therapy doesn't make you weak any more than getting a yearly check up with a primary doctor does. It's just taking care of your mental health as opposed to physical health, and even that's a misnomer given how intertwined the two are.

******* Yeah, they aren't. When they go to therapy it's for reasons and to get help with something that actually was traumatic.

Sure, some people cope with it somehow, many do. But for at least some of them, getting therapy would mean the difference between surviving and living. And personally, as someone who did get therapy because of something that does count as parental abuse, I see your comment as really out of place; don't shit on therapy, it's hard enough for people who actually need it to accept that and get it without stuff of the kind you wrote.

**** It's because her being aged up and the reason why she could potentially be unable to care for a child are two different things. The first one happened because of the movies, and the second one tied into the first one because once that was done it seemed the easiest excuse for it and the writers were only looking for an excuse.

Although in my headcanon Andromeda was the eldest and her running off and getting married pushed her parents to force Bellatrix into the Lestrange marriage. Bella was not a nice person before, but no unhinged madman either.

***** Even so, Andromeda has to be old enough to be Tonks' mother, and Bellatrix is to her left on the family tree, which suggests that Bellatrix is older than her. (This is all from the books, and from what I've seen, family trees work like that.)

Tonks: 1995 -1 (As an Auror) -3 (Auror training) -7 (Hogwarts) -11 (Pre Hogwarts) = 1973.

Assuming that Andi didn't finish her NEWTs seven months pregnant, we get:

Andromeda: 1973 -1 (or more) -7 (Hogwarts) -11 (Pre-Hogwarts) = 1954. (Hence, Bellatrix has to be born in 1954 (twin sister) or earlier.)

Narcissa could possibly be born in 1961 (Class of 1979) without screwing with other people's DOBs, although it would make her and Lucius' marriage rather creepy, him being born between 12 Sep 1953 and 11 Sep 1954 (41 on second Monday of September 1995).

1951, 195{2-4} and 1955 are actually rather plausible, then.

  Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda's burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco.

*** Dumbledore called Belltrix the oldest of Sirius relatives in half-blood prince, when he was worried who would inherit Grimmauld place.

#+begin_quote
  Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of ‘Black.' Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.” A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius's mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry's mind. “I bet there has,” he said. “Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius's living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.”
