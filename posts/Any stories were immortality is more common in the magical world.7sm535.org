any stories were immortality is more common in the magical world ? with people achieving it either on purpose or by accident

maybe its just that the wizard that achieve it don't broadcast it to the world the way the Flames did.

the only story's that I know of that actively acknowledge it are some of kathryn518 stories linkffn(9704180) ,linkffn(12101842)

some stories have being a metamorphmagus make the person immortal.

and there is even a story that I read ages ago that I have forgotten almost completely that had it so that collecting the Deathly hallows would give the person who did it immortal and then even if the owner lost them they still kept the immortality. so there are a bunch of Immoral witch's and wizards running around that have collected the Deathly hallows and then after getting the immortality gave them up because they weren't worth the trouble because all the trouble having them caused the owner mainly getting hunted by other Hallow hunters.


** This is exactly what you want. Immortality is quite common this this fic. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I by Taure)

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.

** In the abandoned linkffn(11762909) there appears to be several OCs who may in fact be immortal. Really great world building.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.
