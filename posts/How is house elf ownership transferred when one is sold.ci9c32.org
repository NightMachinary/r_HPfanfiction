** I dont think there is much of a transfer done, House-Elves are mentioned as coming as part of big properties like manors and castles and they obey who ever owns the property.

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said George. “But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. *House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house. . . .”* Harry was silent.
#+end_quote

They dont seem to magically know who owns the Property though, but the magic still forces them to obey the command of the owner of it, Dumbledore calls the magic a enchantment of their kind.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh, yes," said Dumbledore. "You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoy's our whereabouts, or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. *He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius*. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it."
#+end_quote

And he uses it to find out who the owner of 12 Grimmauld Place is when nobody knew if it belonged to Harry or Bellatrix, and they knew that Harry owned it when Kreacher was forced to obey him even though he believed Bellatrix to be his mistress.

#+begin_quote
  "You see," Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered,

  "if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited ---"

  "Kreacher," finished Dumbledore.

  "Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't!" croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears.

  "*Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won't go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won't, won't, won't ---"*

  "As you can see, Harry," said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher's continued croaks of "wont, won't, won't," "Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership."
#+end_quote

and here we see him being forced to obey Harry.

#+begin_quote
  *"Give him an order," said Dumbledore. "If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress."*

  "Won't, won't, won't, WON'T!"

  Kreacher's voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, "Kreacher, shut up!"

  It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.
#+end_quote

So if you want to transfer the ownership of the House-Elf you would have to transfer the Property they belong to. They are like Serfs in that regard.

*** I think that the fact that Dumbledore didn't know if Kreacher was inherited means they aren't bound to properties - after all, he was sure that harry inherited the house.

**** Dumbledore didn't know if Harry inherited the house, that was the whole point of testing Kreachers obedience.

​

#+begin_quote
  "That is generous," said Dumbledore. "We have, however, vacated the

  building temporarily."

  "Why?"

  "Well," said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who

  was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead,

  "Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct

  line, to the next male with the name of 'Black.' Sirius was the very last of the

  line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were

  childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have

  the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has

  been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other

  than a pureblood."

  A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius's mother that

  hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry's

  mind. "I bet there has," he said.

  "Quite," said Dumbledore. "And if such an enchantment exists, then the

  ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius's living

  relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange."

  Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the

  telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange,

  Sirius's killer, inherit his house?

  "No," he said.

  "Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn't get it either," said

  Dumbledore calmly. "The situation is fraught with complications. We do not

  know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for

  example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed

  from Sirius's hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at

  any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have

  clarified the position,"

  "But how are you going to find out if I'm allowed to own it?"

  "Fortunately," said Dumbledore, "there is a simple test."

  ...

  "You see," Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as

  though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, "if you have indeed inherited the

  house, you have also inherited ---"

  ...

  "Kreacher," finished Dumbledore.

***** Ah. Still, I don't think they are bound to the property - since they can be relocated, as the office says, they can't be (solely) bound to property.

****** The relocation, could be achieved by freeing them and then binding them to a new property. If you look at serfs who also were forced to serve the Person who owned the land they were bound to(legally of course, not magically), they were also able to move to be relocated as long they had permission of both their former lord and the one whose land they were moving to. I could easily see something like this being done with house-elves.

** Strictly speaking, I don't believe there is hard canon evidence of an inherently magical House-Elf bond --- it could just as easily be that the rules of obedience and all their arcane special cases like the clothes-thing are just ingrained in Elf mentality, whether culturally or through hereditary knowledge (which we know is a thing in /HP/ magic: consider Parseltongue).

So it could be as easy as the old Master of the House-Elf informing them that it's all legally arranged and now /that/ guy over there is your Master. And the Elf's drive to slavishly obey would transfer to that guy.

Even if one goes with a more directly magical bond, I think it would still work along those lines, because the spellwork, however it worked, would likely be clever enough to know to adjust if the House-Elf in question knows for sure that they have been bought and paid for. /Not/ including provisions for sales and inheritances would be a pretty blatant design flaw that whoever originally designed the bond would have thought of from a mile away.

#+end_quote

Though I do believe that a decent amount of indoctrination is involved so they dont betray their master like Kreacher did by misinterpreting the wordings of the orders, and so they view being freed as inherently wrong.

But we know that the bond isn't transferred by informing the Elf about who owns the Property, because in Half-Blood-Prince they actively used the bond to find out who owns the property when nobody knew who owned 12 Grimmauld Place.
