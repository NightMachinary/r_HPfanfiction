  PLEASE NOTE: The warnings on this story are strictly precautionary in case of triggers. The violence is not exceedingly graphic and the rape/non-con is attempted only; both occur in later chapters.Harry and Ginny lived happily ever after...eventually. After the war, things didn't go as easily as they should have.

**** I haven't re-read it in a while, so I may be off on some of the details.

It's a canon complaintish fic, dealing with the aftermath of the war. The point of view character is mainly Ginny, with Harry being a close secondary, mainly focusing on their relationship and how they deal with what happened after the war. Ginny in particular doesn't handle it very well.

There is some action but I can't remember it very well so I'm guessing it doesn't have much focus.

What I really personally liked about the fic was that Harry and Ginny break up at some point and spend time apart dealing with their own problems. I liked the new characters that were introduced, especially during Harry's part of the story, though I do remember not liking Ginny at all the first time I read it.

​

EDIT: I forgot to add that the sequel, Inner Demons, is what I enjoyed the most and what most of the above was describing.

She hadn't meant to look for him. Not in the corridors, not beneath the white sheets of the fallen, not on the way to the Chamber of Secrets with Ron, but she was a stupid girl."

** Well, I two stories that I don't often see recommended on here that I like a lot.

Linkffn(5915140), Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer is an old story about Harry learning how to become a curse breaker that I liked a lot. While this story is complete its sequel is not sadly.

Linkffn(11610805), Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion is also a good story and a fun take on Harry's fourth year and how he does things differently if he was stuck in the muggle world for a little longer. Its sequel is ongoing and is updated once in a while. The author generally focuses on linkffn(12307781) Heroes Assemble! which is also another good Harry Potter X Avengers Crossover that is worth suggesting.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
