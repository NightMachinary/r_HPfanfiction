Alright, i wanna read some good fics that feature harry as badass powerhouse and i'm stuck in deciding which of the three i have in mind should i start/continue. So i figured to ask people questions regarding the fics. The fics are:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane]]. I started to this fic only for me to stop after the first few chapters because i just feel like the development in terms of power will be slow. Now i just wanna know that will it take like half of the fic for Harry to become the /force of nature/ this fic and the community cracks up to be? If so, is the pay-off worth it?

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][Abraxas]] Now this is probably the one i'm most interested in reading because from what i've heard this fic has a fair amount of smut and is grimdark which both i'm a fan of. Thing is, I really don't like an R/Hr pairing^{/pleasedon'tAKme/} so i'm just wondering how prominent would the pairing be featured in the story(I can tolerate it for the sake of the plot if it's necessary but nothing more than that). Also i kinda spoiled myself with this one that the story takes a dark twist, I'm just curious if that twist is a good one or a twist which the story falls itself apart.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwars Battle School]] Same issue with Magicks of the Arcane, Power development seems too long, wanna know if spending any time with it will pay off.

Your thoughts and responses are deeply appreciated. If you think none of those are worth my time then a recommendation(s) is more than welcome. Although i have read a large majority of Badass/powerful Harry stories so please take that into consideration. Thanks!


** Well, I know one of them. I can tell you that HBS is rather convoluted and has serious plotting issues and imo, drags on way too long in places and places too much emphasis on action scenes that would benefit from being tightened up wordcount-wise.

That said, it is a unique take on Hogwarts and there's enough of it to sink your teeth into. It was also updated last month, but the author's projected update timeframe is already a few weeks gone, so who knows if it'll be completed.

In general, it's uneven. Some of the stuff I found really interesting, other parts bored the living daylights out of me. Give it a try, see if the hook works for you. It's not the worst fic, but there are plenty of better ones.

I honestly don't know how you think that the power development is slow. Literally, in Chapter One he uses magic that sixth/seventh years wouldn't be capable of, and it is implied that most adult witches and wizards are not capable of it. In Chapter 6, the Minister of Magical Norway applauds Harry for, and I quote

  a display of magic long lost in legends and myths
#+end_quote

so yeah, the power development is not slow, not slow at all.

I have nothing to say of HBS that others here haven't already said other than: the first 'book' is better than the second in having a much tighter plot, while book 2 is starting to sprawl with too many threads. This is the only one of the three with a slow power development.

As for Abraxas, this definitely has the fastest power development. Ron/Hermione is the secondary pairing, so nothing to worry about for you there. Yes, the story has a dark twist. No, the twist doesn't make the story fall apart. Rather, it has the standard Brennus failing of having an unsatisfactory conclusion (last chapter).

As for the order? Honestly, I would do them in the order you have listed, for two reasons. First, Magicks of the Arcane and Abraxas are complete, and Hogwarts Battle School is not. Second, Magicks of the Arcane is better than Abraxas.

On a scale of 1 to Unsung Hero, how unsatisfactory are we talking about here?

** I would read them in alphabetical order.

R/Hr pairing is not the focus of Abraxas, but Hermione does have a side plot of her own.

** Magicks and Abraxas should be read first as they are both completed, and as a general rule, completed fics should always be recommended and read first.

Magicks is a more realized story, but it's hard for me to read through a lot of smut. Harry is appropriately strong, but there are certain parts of the ending that make me question whether or not the build up was generally worth it.

Abraxas is fine, but it spins a bit out of control towards the end. Echoing what others have said, it ends with a discordant note that might not be well received.
