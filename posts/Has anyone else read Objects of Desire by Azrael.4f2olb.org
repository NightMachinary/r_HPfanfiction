** You probably don't see it mentioned because people on this subreddit generally aren't fans of relationships involving Snape--especially with people far younger than him--and don't like slash--especially Draco/Harry.

** Yeah, pretty much what [[/u/Hostiel]] said. Snape isn't a loved character around here (for good reason in my opinion) so it's pretty rare for a story with him as a love interest to get any sort of praise.

** You are forgetting Potter Law:

#+begin_quote
  XVII. No one had (or will have) sex with Severus Snape.
#+end_quote

Also:

#+begin_quote
  X. Let it be known that magic can do almost anything if the will is there, except get Harry Potter pregnant. That requires a mind more fucked up than Demon God of Chaos's.

  Clarification on Homosexuals: Male and gay characters are allowed, so long as they are relegated to being secondary characters and are never Harry Potter; he has never showed signs of being homosexual - ditch that shit, suicide girls.

  Cupdentarding the Clarification: Changing the hero to a girl to get around this ruling is stictly forbidden. The main character has a penis and it will only be permitted to enter the opening on a female's body. Aforementioned female must be one-hundred percent female and not a polyjuiced Draco Malfoy, curious as to how the opposite sex lives.

Does this refer specifically to /any/ piece of literature in which our main character Harry Potter assumes the form of the opposite gender, or just those in which this is done in order to write homosexual fiction without it actually being homosexual? For instance, if one were to introduce two different instances of Harry Potter, change one of them to the female form, and then introduce a heterosexual relationship between the two main characters, would that be acceptable?

** I'm not a huge fan of any Snape/student pairing, but I might give it a shot. As much as I love this subreddit, I wish their were ones with more specific pairings that were more active. Drarry is a huge fan base, and [[/r/Drarry][r/Drarry]] has 12 subscribers. I like canon compliant fics too, but I see harmony o here all the time in a fic that sounds good otherwise and it makes me sad
