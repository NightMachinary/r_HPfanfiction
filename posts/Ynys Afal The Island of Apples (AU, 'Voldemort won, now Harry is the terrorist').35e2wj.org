Chapter 5 of my fanfic, /Ynys Afal: The Island of Apples/, has just been posted! It's an AU fanfic set in a familiar but different wizarding Britain in which Voldemort won, has a Dark Lady ruling at his side, and where Harry Potter has been missing - believed dead - for ten years. Now it's 2011 and the Ministry of Magic has voted to declare war on Ireland in order to unify the British Isles under one magical government, but it's really just an excuse to get the Death Eaters fighting again so they don't get too difficult to handle.

Except Harry Potter wasn't dead, he'd been kidnapped by the Unspeakables, and now Harry and the Unspeakables are back to bring revolution to Britain. The universe is darker than canon, and it's canon-compliant largely except it's also AU.

It's a story with old prophecies, new prophecies, and stuff that isn't related to prophecies at all. It's at 53000 words now and there's still a way to go until the first installment of the series (this one!) is complete. It's not a canon rehash. The main characters are all in their thirties. It's a Wizarding Britain that's been ruled by Voldemort for five years, where Harry has been dead for ten (except he wasn't!) This is where the fanfic picks up.

I'd really like it if if you all read it (obviously!) but I'd also appreciate it if you just took a glance and gave me some feedback. I'd really, really like to get some feedback! When it's finished I'm going to tidy it all up and post it elsewhere.

*TLDR: This is an AU where Harry's been missing for ten years and Voldemort has been running the Ministry for five. Everything sucks if you're not a Dark pureblood. Britain declared war on Ireland, which in this universe never unified with Britain in the 1700s. Harry wasn't dead though, he was with the Unspeakables, and now they want to cause a revolution.*


** The beginning is a huge infodump. If you want to write an AU, don't begin by listing the changes from canon. That's to be shown or left for the reader to infer at the appropriate time. Doing it this way ruins a large part of the AU's attraction.

*** I do agree that it's a bit infodumpy. I've left a lot more of the setting out than I included, honestly - it took me a while to decide exactly what to tell at the beginning, and what I was going to show later. I think I trimmed it down to the barest necessities (it seems like a lot at the beginning, but ultimately those bits are just minor bits of setting).

I had hoped I'd managed to strike a balance between infodump and then showing and telling more about the world and how it works later. I guess I could probably do a lot better with that. Thanks for your time.

** So, some good things. I appreciate the thought you've put into the world. It seems very involved. I can always appreciate a complex plot, especially one that does not give all the answers right away.

That being said, it is very hard to get into. Part of it is the multiple POV's within one chapter. It's not that I can't handle the different storylines, but it's easy to lose the thread of the plot when some parts of the story are unrelated to the others. Given the volume of information thrown at us, it's hard to relate characters to this new world.

I know it's probably too late to ask you to rewrite the story, but I think scaling the story down would benefit it a lot. Right now, it's a bit of a difficult read.

*** I'm guessing the 'ten years ago' bits are the sticking point? Those are less important after chapter six anyway, as the background work is laid and the first of the major major plot arcs begins. Thanks for taking the time to read and give me some feedback - I had worried it'd be a little hard to get into.

I plan on spending more time fixed upon particular characters in upcoming chapters but I felt like I needed to introduce the major players sooner rather than later. The scale of the story though is part of the story. I have plan. I know what's going to happen and how they get there. I just need to make sure the 'getting there' is fun for people reading!
