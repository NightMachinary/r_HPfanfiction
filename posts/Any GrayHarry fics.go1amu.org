I'm looking for fics where Harry is, in any shape or form, morally gray. Or Harry uses both Light and Dark magic. Or Harry's put in Slytherin.

I'm looking for a wide range of things. I don't care if it's time travel, if Harry's background is different, or if there are no canon ships. (No HP/TMR, please.) Feel free to post anything remotely related to this!

Thank you for taking the time to comment and recommend anything!

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

  After the death of her master and friend, Mana and her prince mourn the loss of Mahaad and commit themselves to defending the kingdom against its impending downfall. As more guardians fall and the reign is plunged deeper into shadows, Mana senses it. On the prince's-no- the pharaoh's shoulders sits the crushing weight of sadness at his father's death, guilt at the millennium sacrifice, fear for the fate of his people. Mana sensed all this. She sensed his burden. He endured all this with impregnable resolve and yet, she intuitively knew - the loss of Mahaad, his closest friend and most trusted servant -that loss was just too heavy to bear. Invoking the strength and sacrificial love that so strongly defined her late master, Mana set out to lighten his load...
