Title says all. I was looking around in the Internet and i only have found 1 Fic, that covers the possibility of Hermione witnessing the Locket scene. Its a H/Hr fic called "Deathly Hallows Revisited" by redstarpuppy ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6984470/1/Deathly-Hallows-Revisited]]). Another fic contains the aftermath of the Lockets influence after the War, which makes Ron depressive. Harry tells Hermione about the Lockets destruction and so she is "cheering" up the Red head by going to the Hogwarts ground, encounter Ron naked and using the same lines, Riddle-Hermione was using to mock Ron, but now twisted so Ron is good and Harry is "not good". In the end, they have Sex. Anyway, i wanted to know if there are more fics that contain Hermione witnessing the Locket scene, since its a shame (in my eyes) that there are barely any fictions that cover this scene. It doesnt matter, if its H/Hr or if it stays Canon or even non-Canon (who knows, maybe Ron/Hermione's feelings change after that and they get together with known or unknown/OC characters)....i think it would even be ok, if Hermione is "watching" this scene (as a memory, maybe) in a Future after the War.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm#pt][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]] is BtVS crossover in which Ginny gained the Slayer power during the Astronomy Tower battle. Voldemort countered by raising a new army of demons and vampires. The Trio and Ginny had to fight those in addition to the Horcrux Hunt. The destruction of the Locket was witnessed by all 4 of them.

** I don't have any fics, but can I just say that this scene for me is probably the low-point of Ron's character (and that's saying a lot considering his previous behaviour)? It's just so pathetic and sad... not only that the Horcrux thinks this is the best way to get Ron to turn him against his friends, but that Harry (hist best friend!) feels the need to reassure Ron afterwards by telling him that Hermione was *really* sad when Ron left and that she's like a sister to him. Really tells all about Ronald Bilius Weasley. Even if Harry and Hermione had been shagging each other since the day that he left, it would be none of his business anymore and he should be happy that they take him back after abandoning them.

I can't imagine any reality in which Hermione witnesses that and would ever marry such a pathetic, jealous, possessive and /uncharitable/ piece of filth.
