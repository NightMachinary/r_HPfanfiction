I always read in fanfiction about all that muscle Harry has because of flying around on a broom. I truly have no idea how likely this is so can someone enlighten me?

**** Kind of and kind of not. It wouldn't have hurt him directly unless his muscles count as atrophied---which they don't, as Harry has a history of running away from Dudley's gang which definitely gave him some muscles, just ones focused on speed and agility and reaction and thus ones that don't get visibly bulkier---but it could have temporarily incapacitated him which could result in an injury unless someone from the audience had the necessary reaction speed to cast a spell to stop his fall, and with the times when he was at risk being the ones when he pulled the tightest manoeuvres at the highest speed, it's unlikely they could have reacted in time.

As for the muscle from flying thing, the strain from acceleration does cause the muscles to work, but it is not sufficient to gain muscle with just that; heck, unless Harry trained every day and was a lunatic about it, I doubt just that would have been enough to maintain the muscles ... thankfully he moves around a lot other than flying.

I don't know where/ when you grew up in England but at my school in the early-mid 2000's when I was about 12-ish we very much had to run and exercise if we were a part of any sport team. It wasn't even a sporting school but you could expect to run around the school field a couple of times- and I mean run, not jog- as well as climb up and down the gymnasium's rope climbing frames several times.

Like a bull ride or something similar? you need strength to do so, it makes sense to have quiditch players work out so they don't lose their grip on their brooms the moment they make a sharp turn, or to hit away a canon ball or throw the quaffal at high speeds.

I really love the implication that strength training always makes people bulky. You can get quite a lot stronger without getting significantly bigger. My brother is a wiry twig (as in, he's incredibly skinny) but he also has visible abdominal muscles and can do pullups without breaking a sweat. If you want to imply that the ability to pull yourself back onto your broom is worthless in Quidditch, sure.

And obviously it's fanon because we don't get in depth descriptions of Quidditch players' muscles. I'm not saying that Oliver Wood is a roid monster, but a Quidditch player has got to have a significant amount of functional strength.

** The Firebolt's top speed is 150 miles per hour, and the Quidditch pitch is 180 feet wide. g-force on a turn is v^2/r, so even for a semicircle with a radius of 180 feet, the g-force would be 8.4 g's, which is actually more than a (muggle) human body can take without the aide of a g-suit. It doesn't take much muscle to point a broom and go, but it takes a /lot/ of muscle just to lift your arms against a fraction of what top brooms are capable of.

***** If she were to have made Quidditch a fully-thought-out sport then the various positions would require different performance profile brooms. A keeper doesn't need a high top speed but they need a broom that corners extremely well and gives good burst acceleration. Acceleration isn't as much of a concern for a beater but their brooms need to be very stable. And none of the players need a racing broom. The pitch is far too small for that.

But JKR wrote for children and a very simplified understanding of sports and equipment performance profiles.

** I highly doubt that canon Harry would gain any significant muscle from Quidditch. Matches are spread out, training doesn't seem strength-intensive but is frequent enough.

Couple of considerations

1) Does flying a broom require a lot of strength to maneouvre correctly or is it just "point and go"? It doesn't seem strenuous or particularly taxing on the body, more of an endurance thing.

2) Drills described in the books only seem to consist of passing Quaffles/using golf balls as practice snitches. Don't think there is any mention of calisthenic or other forms of strength building exercises. Correct me if I'm wrong.

3) if Harry is a seeker, he should preferably be as light as possible to take advantage of his Nimbus/Firebolt speed. The advantage of Cedric Diggory as an older, heavier but not necessarily "muscular" dude (leave your movie actors at the door pls) is that he isn't as affected by the harsh weather in the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff match in PoA. Harry doesn't really tussle with players like Chasers or swing bats like Beaters. He doesn't need to be as bulky.

4) Harry was always described as thin for his age. His diet is better at Hogwarts for sure, but he also has a history of not getting enough food during his stays with the Dursleys. Molly Weasley always comments on his "peaky" appearance, but that may just be a motherly exaggeration thing.

I don't think Harry would be muscular without a significant reworking of his training format and diet, Again, his role on the team doesn't require it and quidditch doesn't seem like it requires a load of strength anyways.

** It's never really described in canon beyond some basic drills, but logically excersize to stay fit and some kind of basic strength training to be able to keep yourself on your broom while twisting and turning while experiencing, presumably, several Gs of additional force due to your momentum would be necessary.

So, indirectly, you could expect most Quidditch players to be fairly fit. With the notable exceptions of some beaters, perhaps, like Crabbe and Goyle, who tend to be more like linebackers. But even then they'd need more strength than average to be able to support their weight while moving on the broom. One little tumble, otherwise, and they're slipping right off.

** I would say that any muscle gain from flying at that speed would probably come from isometric-type work. This is where one has to maintain muscle strain which increases stamina.

You need /plenty/ of strength to wrestle a racing bike round corners and make sure you don't get thrown off on bumps. I've never seen any successful racers at an event like the TT, or the various sledging sports, who aren't well-conditioned.
