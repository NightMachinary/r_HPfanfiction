Okay, I really need help finding this fanfiction story.

I cannot find it on my own as I cannot remember the summary or title but remember some things about it.

I KNOW for sure somewhere someone out there knows this fanfiction.

Anyway, it's Severitus and Harry starts visiting the past in his dreams. Harry meets a young hurt lonely Tom Riddle and helped him. I also know that he uses an alias in his "past" dreams. Don't remember what he calls himself though.

That's pretty much all I remember of it. I absolutely LOVED that story and can't find it anywhere.


** I don't think it's Severitus, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7416274/1/Memento-Mori-Memento-Amor][this one, maybe?]]

** Unfortunately not. It's longer than five chapters. More than fifteen chapters, I believe... But thank you for taking the time to look! :)

** Nope, none of those. Thank you for looking. I think this also might help, it's not slash. I think it's Gen or Het. :)
