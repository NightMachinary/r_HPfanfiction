Looking for well written femslash stories. All pairings as long as it's not Hermione/Ginny, can read a Ginny story but not that pairing. T to M rating, over 50k wording. Doesn't have to be complete but preferred. Have read most of the Hermione/McGonagall and Hermione/Bellatrix stories.

Read Diginity in Fear (Hermione/Tonks) today which I loved.


** Okay, I'm going to rec some of my faves for you. I don't think any of them are over 50k, but they're all excellent and well worth it despite the lengths. You just haven't gotten much recc'd here so I figured I'd just go for it even though they may not be what you're looking for.

(also, maybe check out [[/r/HPSlashFic]] ?? you might have some more luck over there!)

linkao3(now they say I've got to hide it by fmslash; patience by fleetofshippyships; secretstudying by originalpuck; ashes ashes by provocative_envy; the scandalous tale of the diagon nursery calendar by woldy; set your hope on fire by theviolinist).

I also have saved to read but haven't yet read: linkao3(light of the moon by lunas_secret_lover; 7897300).

  It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front.

  He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944.

  Years ago, when they were first starting out both in their relationship and their careers, when they were babies and hardly understood their car insurance let alone the multi-billion dollar, all-consuming, world-encompassing, life-altering business of news reporting---back then, Derek would practice his expressions in the mirror, and Stiles would think, I'm so glad he'll never have to use that face with me. And then Stiles screwed up, and he's seen nothing but that face for the past two years. Aesthetically, it's still an awesome face, and it probably always will be, but Derek is so much more than another hot dude. And he always will be.
