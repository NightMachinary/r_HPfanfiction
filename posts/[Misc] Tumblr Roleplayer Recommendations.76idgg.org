If anyone here roleplays on Tumblr or follows any roleplayers, can you please recommend some URLs? I'm just getting started in roleplaying on Tumblr, and I want some recommendations!

Just in advance, I don't really care if you don't like roleplaying or had a bad experience with it yourself - I just want any recs from anyone who has them. :) Thanks
