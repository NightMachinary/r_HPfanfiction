Recently read : Time to put your galleons where your mouth is, Tsume Yuki, as well as Time Turned Back, Sakurademonalchemist. Loved the "nice slytherin" angle, where protagonist basically reforms public opinion of his house, by being a respected/adored slytherin student. Completed or frequently updated fics are preferred, not a fan of slash.

** There's one fic I like. It's a complete AU, but it does have Draco as one of the main characters and he basically, through the story, shows that Slytherin isn't evil. I like it. It's a good read. And yes, it's complete.

Isn't really canon compliant, but it's quite good. In fact I think I'm going to go reread it now.

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her - and yet... Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar? (Reincarnation fic)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
