Really simple question. I tend to prefer around 10k words/chapter, +/- maybe 3k. More than that, and chapters get a bit tiring to read through. Less than that and I tend to get annoyed having to constantly go to the next chapter. Also feels like authors who write longer chapters tend to have things plotted out better, though that's just something I've observed.

I pretty much skip over any fic with a lower than 5k words/chapter average. The quality just seems to nosedive in terms of writing. Exceptions being oneshots.


** I won't pick up a story that is under 2k a chapter and I prefer to read 5k or more.

** I don't write with chapters, and when reading, I don't tend to notice chapter breaks much. I convert everything to ebook form and read on my nook, and that doesn't make chapter breaks too in-your-face.

  but I'll state with complete certainty that you are missing out on a lot of good fics if you are skipping over everything that's less than 5k/chapter.
#+end_quote

I agree with you, and I tend to make exceptions for fics that come recommended or are by authors I've read before. Or sometimes if I'm looking for a particular genre or pairing.

It's just, with the amount of fanfiction out there for HP, it's so much easier to find fics (when searching at least) that are decent by sorting through chapter length. I'm not saying a fic is bad because the average chapter length is short, nor that a fic is good just because the average chapter length is long (God knows "His Angel" is shitty enough, and the average chapter length is long enough there). It's just the correlation I've observed.

***** Mhmm, I feel your pain with His Angel. I'm actually a big sucker for Harry/Fleur, so I gave that fic a shot. An actual, cringe worthy shot. I think I got about 15 chapters in before I said "fuck this shit".

The one problem with fanfiction, you can't throw it against a wall into a bin like a normal book. Some fics just make me want to print them out, just so I can throw them away. His Angel is one of them.

** To be honest, this question is a peeve of mine. I understand a preference for length, for whatever reason--time commitment, preference of style, common lengths of your preferred genre, what have you--but the idea of a correlation between quality and length completely strange to me. Even if it's common on ffnet. That's like saying 'this movie probably sucks because it's only 90 minutes' or 'I only watch movies over 2 hours long.' It's a meaningless benchmark.

*** I would argue that there's a serious correlation between low quality writing, lack of commitment, and lack of any serious plotting, and low word count chapters. I'm not saying one necessitates the other, I'm just saying that a fic with 20 chapters, each at 10k+ words, is far more likely to be worth reading than a 20 chapter fic with an average chapter length of 2k words.

This isn't always the case, but I'd be willing to bet that if you took every fic under five thousand words, and every fic above ten thousand, and compared them, the quality would be infinitely better on the 10k+ word fics on average.

**** I think it's because of the genre you prefer and the length you are accustomed to reading; or maybe you click through more fics than I do, because I don't read a wide range of fics and certainly not the genres popular in this subreddit. Outside of fantasy epics (which tend to require more exposition--and even then I think 6k is a good realm to stay around), I don't see this trend at all nor a reason for it. Slice-of-life, romance, family, character-centric--these genres tend to be on the shorter end. Even my favorite adventure fics hover around the 3.5k range per chapter, and I'm picky about any fic with 5k+ chapters because these fics can be wordy, lack focus, and overly indulgent with plotlines.

** Doesn't matter for me, since I love both oneshots and chaptered fics. With that being said, I don't really like chaptered fics that's under 30k words, since I feel it's not long enough to develop the plot, etc... (multiple shots and chaptered oneshots aside)

***** Obviously there's been no scientific study on the subject, but it's just common sense. Someone willing to put in the time to write long, detailed chapters, one after another, is far more likely to take the time to edit and correctly plot their stories than someone who writes 50 1k word chapters and posts them quickly.

I'd paypal anyone $50 who could take 10 truly random stories with 50+ chapters at say 2k words or less chapters, and them compare them with the fics that have the same word count, but a average of 10k+ words per chapter. Then compare the two, and determine the quality between the two, with the lower word count chapters having higher quality writing. It's not gonna happen.

** Most of the chapters I write have an average of 4-5K words, with a rarity of lengths in the range of 3K, or 6-7K. And yet nobody has told me the quality is low due to the length. In fact I've had several say mine are high quality.

*** It's not so much that the quality is low because of the length, but more that the length tends to be indicative of low quality. One doesn't necessitate the other, but there's definitely correlation.

*** I am of the same general opinion as you typically if it isn't at least 1k words per chapter I skip over it. The only exceptions to this for me are one-shots or fics with a lot of chapters.

As an aside I too read on my phone, using a chrome app, a lot when I can at work and for some damn reason almost every word that starts with "fi" like first, is replaced with "u" readin as urst the only time this doesn't happen is with bolder or italicised words. Does this happen to anyone else.

**** Well, I read on Safari so I wouldn't know. Do you read on ffnet/ao3? i've never had trouble with reading on my phone with those sites, but livejournal and other non-traditional fic sites are a nightmare because they're not mobile-friendly. Maybe you should start using other app. If your phone is an iPhone just use Safari. If it has Android, you can use Firefox or Opera and see if the problem is solved.

***** Yeah I might as well see if that works, one day all "fi" became "u" and for the most part I am able read just fine it, and I only ever use ff.net it's been my go to site for years I'm just not too familiar with other ones, although one of my favorite fics just moved to ao3 so I've been trying to familiarize myself with it.

** Personally, I have no chapter length preference whatsoever. I do, however, have a story length preference. Full length stories should be 80k-130k words. Any more than that, and it is quite common to find that either the story is either too slow moving, or they don't know where to end the story.

Personally, I find that not knowing where to end is actually one of the most common problems in fanfiction. It can be difficult to end a story where you've worked hard to build up and expand the world, but I find that authors who right several stories in the same world, or write a story and then write lots of little oneshots in that world are much better at letting go when it's time for the story to end, instead of dragging it out until they are ready.

*** Wow, 130k words seems almost like a taste to me. I prefer stories or series ranging in the 200k+ (with no upper limit, I've read fics with 1.2m words for instance).

I do understand what you're saying though. With fanfics, you'll very often find authors floundering in the end, with no idea what to do. It makes me wonder sometimes whether they bothered to plot the story out before writing it, or if they just let their story go where it will.

** It's also a stylistic preference of the authors. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4538453/Yeghishe][Yeghishe]] for instance tends to write stories as tiny snapshots of very short length to tell a story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9000908/1/The-Housekeeper][The Housekeeper]] is at 99 chapters and just passed 20k words, but is an oddly captivating read... and I /really/ tend to dislike the fluffy stuff. The most popular stories usually are in the 5-10k words per chapter range, but popularity does not equate to quality (/cough/HarryCrow/cough/).

So, while it makes sense that there should be some correlation, chapter length should not be an exclusive filter for quality. There are plenty of long length per chapter stories that are absolutely cringeworthy, and there are plenty of short length per chapter stories which are fantastic.

Personally, my ideal is around 6-7k words per chapter, but there have been plenty of ones with around 2-3k per chapter that I've greatly enjoyed. It really depends on the pacing set for the stories.
