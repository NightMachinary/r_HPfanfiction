:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry Potter was too late. Sure, the diary was destroyed, but it happened when the process was almost finished - Tom Rddle was already in, even if Ginny was not yet out. As a result, the soul pieces merge, and so do the character traits and memories. Obviously, Tom is more ruthless and more experienced, so he gains control, but Ginny has some points she will not compromise on.

The end result is a bright, cheerful, helpful girl that enjoys skinny dipping in the Black Lake, helping other students with their problems and generally enjoys her life... But Dumbledore catches on and confronts Ginnymort during a lake trip with Harry.

Now if I could only remember what this fic was called....!


** Now I want to read a Ginny centric Dark!Independent!Ginnymort! fic.

Like Indy!Harry but ginny.

** That sounds a bit like [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/book-learning-hp.446003/reader/?page=3][Book Learning]] by Zerrer. There's no Dumbledore finding out or skinny dipping, but it does have the merging part.
