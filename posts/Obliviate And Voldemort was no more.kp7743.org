Voldemort has just appeared in Diagon alley attacking everyone without scruples! But then suddenly out of the second-story window, Helena Young a recent graduate from Hogwarts hits him with a spell. It's not lethal so it doesn't register on Voldies ritually enhanced danger senses but when it hits he suddenly stops and starts to drool Voldemort had just been hit by an Obliviate and the last thing he could remember was wanting food from his mother's breast (Not that he could remember those words!).


** Lol I see this as Lockheart hitting him with this. Cause of this, his books sell even more,and he becomes more famous.

*** Would be interesting if Lockhart got caught out for impersonating all those people and obliviating them, but folks are reluctant to punish him since he got rid of Voldemort.

*** I don't think so. While unconfirmed, it's possible that Occlumency can protect Voldemort's mind from the Memory Charm. It's said that Occlumency can resist the effects of Veritaserum and is said to be similar to resisting the Imperius Curse, requiring mental discipline.

***** Oh. I am far from an expert in prophecies and the most I know is that fanon portrays it as either horribly vague (typically attached to Indy!Harry fanfics to explain why Harry is not the only person who can kill Voldemort) or very specific. So, I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that.

****** Well, Voldemort is not dead so Harry could still kill him, imagine this scenario: After Voldemort got hit by the Obliviate and got detained in a show of power Minister Cornelius Fudge will publically have the once in a lifetime chance to Avada Kedavra Voldemort.

Cornelius Fudge missed 5 times that day.

*** Most likely yes, Occlumency can protect against subtle things like legilimency or veritaserum but while similar it has no effect against spells like the Imperius so it shouldn't help against something like the memory charm, that's like a hammer to the mind. He would still be alive so the Prophecy would be fine.

Also another way of beating him would be turning him into a ferret.

** Helena Young was a girl born in the end of SEPTember, who's parents defied Voldemort in three inconsequential ways everyone overlooked.

**** I think it's the combination of that and being left at an orphanage. there you have both nature and nurture driving him toward being disconnected from others

If he'd been born via love potion but had a loving upbringing (say by adoption) there might be some mitigating effect?

**** Depends on your interpretation. Empathising with someone, feeling sorry or with a person, doesn't isn't necessary related to the ability to love. That would mean that Voldemort is truly beyond redemption even with a clean sleight after he created his first horcrux. Makes me wonder why Dumbledore constantly insisted on trying to redeem him.
