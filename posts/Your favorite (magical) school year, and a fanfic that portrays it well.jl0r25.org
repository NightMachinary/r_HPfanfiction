I personally like fourth year the best, because there's a lot to discover, a social hierarchy has solidified and bigger challenges are apparent. Haven't read a decent fanfic set in Year four yet. Although I don't really care about TTT.

I think seventh year can be discarded because there's always something weird at the end. Haven't read any stories that show otherwise.


** I really enjoyed 4th year as well! The Triwizard Tournament really elevated the school year for me, and we get introduced to a lot more characters. This fanfic's portrayal of that year felt like everything I had dreamed of.

Linkao3(survival is a talent) It's ongoing, and begins from 2nd year, but when I reread it recently, the author kind of rushes through 2nd and 3rd year, and has gone deeper into the 4th, 5th and 6th (which is ongoing) years. It's incredible though, I recommend at least checking it out :)

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** Fourth year is my favorite too. I've read a lot of fourth year rewrites but the best would have to be The Boy Who Lived, The Brightest Witch, and The Boy Who Wasn't.

  A single conversation between Hermione and Neville in November of their fourth year changed the course of Harry's friendships forever. Eventual HHr.
