I mean in the books? Maybe its just me but even though like its shown as not good to use them its also not that bad?

Like its not to the level of the unforgivables or sectumsempra. Its not like wow you a monster for using it.

Its kinda casual like Molly like oh ya i used it as a kid. Romilda Vane used it and ya that was shown as bad that she did but not that bad. No like indication this is mega messed up that she did it. Or that she is like an awful person. Not like the way Rowling sorta frames things like sectumsempra or even calling someone a mudblood. I mean isnt this thing basically a date rape drug?

Same goes with like Merope who like actually pulled off using it. Which means she actually raped someone. Its still like it was still bad she did it but oh no she still lived a hard life don't you feel bad for her? The guy she raped was a dick fyi no one liked him or his family.

So it kinda like heres this date rape drug dont use it. Youre an asshole if you do. But not that big an asshole and/or pretty sympathetic. Thats kinda the vibe the books give me about love potion.

What do you think? Is it shown to be more horrible? Like ever i mean in its depiction like by the narrative. Not like if it ever causes problems. I mean its been a while there have definitely been things ive forgotten.


** It's probably been banned in this woke day and age, but when I was at (primary) school it was fairly common for people to play "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)#Kiss_chase][kiss chase]]". Often you didn't really have a choice whether or not to play.

From the giggly, trivial way love potions are viewed, I suspect than an "ordinary" love potion operates at this kind of level - it allows you to momentarily steal a kiss which everyone can have a giggle about but not much more than that. Remember, Amortentia is /the most powerful love potion in the world/.

** Wizarding culture is about as fucked up as our own, so it makes sense that characters are casual about some horrific things, just like people in our culture are casual about some horrific things.

** From what we see in Canon, the effects of a love potions are "very" obvious, so any Witch or Wizard with a magical education should be able to identify someone under these effects.

Because of this reason, using a Love Potion as a "Date Rape Drug" should be very hard in any situation where there are magical witnesses (just like when people would, or at least should act when a man is dragging a veeeery drunk girl during a party with obvious intents, people should act when someone seem under a love potions for the sames intents).

And even if it leave the possibility of administrating the potion when people are alone . . . well it's a rape and even without the potions, the rapist would have had a lot of other options (just the Imperius and Obliviate to cite the most obvious). Even in this case, a Love Potion is probably not the best solution since the victim would either know that she was under a love potion the moment the effects ends, or have to retake a dose of a potion which would make it very obvious she has been druged the moment she meets another witch or wizard.

What I meant to say is that Love Potions are not that bad by themselves, they are just supposed to give a little push to someone or as a harmless fun, and someone who would use them to commit a crime would commit said crime even without it, and even has spell that would probably be more effective for his goal.

The situation of Merope is a bit special because she was living as a hermit, and drugged a muggle, meaning that no one was able to identify the love potion. But even if I'm not sure the magical World has laws for this excat situation, what she did was totally Muggle Baiting and had she been found out, she would have been arrested for this reason alone (though I wonder what would have happened to Tom Sr, would he have been Obliviated or his "marriage" to Merope would have given him the right to know about Magic. And would he had been forced to take care of Tom Jr if he was already born?).

** “Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love” by aibidil follows around Harry, Ron Hermione and Draco as they deal with the repercussions of outlawing the use of love potions.

There is a fair bit of debate in the story about the ethics of love potions, given that they obviate consent but still have strong cultural value for a fair number of people. (There is also a Drarry plot going on at the same time.)

Edit: for English

*** Otherwise, to return to your question, in canon they are treated as relatively harmless by many characters, including Molly, but there is an implicit message that they are, at least, morally dubious. From what we see:

1. Love potions don't induce true love, hence Merope's issue with Mr Riddle. Instead, they induce an obsession (that becomes more potent the longer they are left to age.)

2. Their use is not criminally sanctioned - at least as far as we see (Romilda Vane, and WWW both have them without consequence). They are considered scandalous enough to gossip about (Skeeter), harmless enough to suggest brewing in a school (Lockhart), and still harmful enough that they are banned in said school.

Yet that is not to say that a reader of the books comes out with a positive opinion of love potions. Dumbledore considers that Merope was likely to have used a love potion over an unforgivable as they are the more ‘romantic' option- hardly a favourable comparison. Voldemort himself is the result of the coercion here.

And there is also Ron's experience with love potions, which is not a ringing endorsement (even if that potion was past its ‘use by date').

(Admittedly I'm mostly using memory, what OP wrote and the HP wiki here, so it's possible I've completely forgotten something.)

So... it's complex. It is not really outright condemned by anyone or the Ministry, as far as we see. But each time it is definitely or probably used ‘on screen' it's creepy at best.

  In which a group of wizards' rights activists goes on the offensive after a prohibition against love potions, forcing the magical world to confront the horror of magic's role in sexual assault and the murky legal nature of consent. Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Draco are swept together to solve the case, and in the process they're made to confront their own love and lust---with and without potions.

** I'm surprised nobody has jumped in to claim that Molly didn't USE the love potion, she only admitted that she BREWED it. That always annoys me. She definitely used it.

(Maybe we should have this on the next survey. I'm going to be saying that all week; this is the second time today. I didn't even know about the survey two days ago and now I want to add a bunch of stuff to it.)

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

** Harry Potter - Three to Backstep by Sinyk has one of the characters refer to love potions and all other mind-altering potions as liquid Imperius and should be illegal.
