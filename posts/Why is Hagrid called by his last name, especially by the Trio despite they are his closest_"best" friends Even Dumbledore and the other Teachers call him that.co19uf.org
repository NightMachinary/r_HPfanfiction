I get, that "Rubeus" might be a little hard for Kids to speak correct (although they are not in the Kindergarten anymore), but as mentioned in the title: Even dumbledore and the other teachers are calling him Hagrid. If i remember right, only Tom Riddle has called him by his First Name in his Memory when he was blackening Hagrid for the Attacks.

Is this a Magic Society thing or a Cultural/social thing that exist in some Regions on Earth? No Offense. It just seems strange to me. I mean, Snape is called by his First Name by the Teachers....of course because of the cooperative thing, but Hagrid is constantly called with his Last Name. Is that a subtle thing to sort him into the "Outsider" or "extraordinary" category? He is also half-giant after all.

** Hagrid introduces himself to Harry with "True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts." but as others have pointed out, he then tells Harry to "Call me Hagrid", so that's where Harry gets it. His friends presumably just go with that.

There are a few people who call him Rubeus in the books.

Firstly, Olivander greets him with "Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"

Secondly, the young Tom Riddle says “ 'Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply." when he frames Hagrid, and then uses the name a couple more times.

Dumbledore says "I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid" when Hagrid gets the CoMC job.

Finally, the name is used once in a Potterwatch broadcast and comes up a couple of times in Skeeter's articles. There's one use in narrative text too.

So as a general rule, Hagrid is "Rubeus" to people who knew him as a child but he now goes by Hagrid.

*** It's also used by people who don't seem to care about him. Olivander is blatantly reminding him of how he got his wand snapped, and Tom is obviously framing him.

Dumbledore using his full name for formality's sake is different, since he calls him Hagrid normally.

** Some people go by their last name by choice. Everyone but my dad calls my by my last name, including my wife. It started in high school, and persisted through college. After that, it was so normal that being called by my first name feels weird and uncomfortable.

I've been going by my last name for around 15 years now, and I can totally understand the preference.

Also, none of this is to say I don't like my first name. I actually really do like it.

** As others have pointed out, he asked Harry to call him Hagrid, but also, its not abnormal for some people to be known exclusively by their last name. I have a couple friends who are both known by their last names only, to the point that even their parents, teachers etc refer to them by their last name. This one time a teacher actually called one of them by his first name and he sat there blankly until she full-named him and he realised that it was him being talked to.

that is absurd in my opinion. The next thing that will happen is "Honey, do you remember, how we named our Child?" "oh....uhhh,....i have no idea, sweety. we called him that most of the time anyway so i think it wouldnt be a problem, if it goes that way. Lets look for the birth certificate and change the name" I think, using permamently and only the Family name is killing the Persons personality/identity

**** I don't think it kills identity, and they definitely didn't think so, they would usually introduce themselves as “hi I'm LastName.” For both of them I think it happened because they both had really common first names but really unusual last names. Obviously when they were kids their parents must've called them by their first names but over time even the parents last name'd them. Its obviously not because they forgot their children's names.

** In addition to him asking people to call him that (which really should be the only thing important here), there is also just a thing that happens sometimes where certain people just end up going by a last name/middle name/nickname for whatever reason. Often its because there are more than 1 person with the name in a small group (a class with 3 michaels out of 30 kids might have a “Mike”, “Michael” and a “Smith” who goes by their last name, or 3 Rachels who end up “Rachel” “Asian Rachel” “Rachel Anna” who includes their middle name). But it doesn't necessarily have to be because of having multiple of the same named person. Sometimes its just something that happens or in the case of a friend of mine, had a friend who was an antagonistic friend who faked disliking them a lot and called them their last name and everyone else followed along because they were friends.

** > Is this a Magic Society thing or a Cultural/social thing that exist in some Regions on Earth?

It's certainly a Thing in some real cultures. Chinese and Hungarian names, for example, have the family name first. The chap known as Imre Nagy in the West was actually Nagy Imre, would be addressed as Mr Nagy, and called Imre by his friends.

Mind you, Rubeus is a plausible given name, so Hagrid could well be his family name. But Tonks is also called Tonks by her friends, despite that being her family name. Perhaps Hagrid just doesn't like his given name.
