How much do they tamper with things? Do they try and counter each other's plots? Do they know that the other is even a time traveler? etc.

Also, who is it? That's up to you as well. Can be as many bad guys or as many good guys.


** I recall one where Harry, who as Master of Death had been stuck working as the check-in clerk for the afterlife, went back in time and took Voldemort with him, they had a specific set of changes they were each allowed to make to the timeline. Unfortunately, the fic died before it could get anywhere.
