any particular reason why he's depicted happier and more carefree/cheerful than he was in Canon?

hyperactive / chick magnet / overly cheerful or childish antics are usually the common points in every story. did I miss something from the books or what?


** I imagine because most people don't want to write a sad man who's basically a shell of his former self and prefer to have him be the happy-days marauder. Otherwise, it's just college-movie playboy stereotypes mixed with the pranks.

*** Writing makes me experience the emotions of the characters I write. It's just human empathy at work, you know? But I don't want to feel sad. I have enough sadness on a regular basis to deal with in the real world.

That's why I'll never write a miserable, depressed Sirius Black.

**** Sounds sorta like the method-writer approach, basically. Makes perfect sense you wouldn't wanna be sad unless you have to be.

I admit, I'd definitely only write a Sad Sirius if it was necessary to tell the story I wanted to. If either Happy or Sad Sirius would work, I'd probably choose the happier one.

Maybe? I guess. I mean, I can't really dissociate from my characters when I write them. I /have/ to get in their heads to figure out what they're thinking. I suspect I have a somewhat underdeveloped mental model of how other people work that I have to, out of necessity, go "I'm in their spot. How would I react?" I don't really have any other way of writing people, so...

I don't know how well that comes across. Do you get what I'm trying to say?

****** Yep. I'm somewhat similar, though my necessity comes from a decade of D&D - I literally can't stop myself being my characters, even if I'm writing in third person. :D

But that is pretty much the definition of Method Writing though. I don't know about you, but I find it a fun way to work. Really helps get down a character's 'voice', y'know? :)

** I think it's partially because Harry goes out of his way several times to describe how good-looking Sirius is... which is a very rare thing for his POV, I think all in all he describes like 3 people as attractive in the entire series. Which I think is an automatic connection to lots of people; attractive young man = ladies man.

Then there is the part where he looks at the photo album and at the wedding photo there's Sirius and laughing very exuberantly; iirc not many photos get described in detail but this detail does get mentioned. As we get few hints of Marauder gen personalities, this sticks out with regards to Sirius. (And slots in neatly with other indications of him being cheerful, mischievous & a bit reckless that we see with regards to Harry, like when Sirius suggests to him to use his murder reputation against the Dursleys or when he immediately returns to the country when Harry tells him about his nightmare at the start of 4th book.)

The third factor in my opinion is the whole "almost killed Snape" bit. I don't remember how much indication in canon we get of what actually happened (as it's all 5th book stuff and JKR went out of her way to make all adults in Harry's life unreliable from that book onwards to explain why Harry was essentially fighting the war on his own, I personally discount all characterisations etc about people that I don't like from that book on lol and don't remember much.) but for Sirius to have "almost killed Snape" in the way he did (which was a horrid thing to do, no bones about it) but still be a good guy, he has to be reckless & thoughtless for that to work out. (Personally I have Thoughts on JKR's immense efforts to make Snape look less like an asshole, which is at the root of all "James & Sirius were assholes" characterisations, but... not gonna get on that soap box lol.)

I agree, I think she tried really hard to make him a bit more redeemable by the end of the series, excluding his love for Lily, which came at the cost of incinerating any chance James had at being an interesting character. He plummeted from his pedestal quite hard, and broke his reputation in the process. The thing about James is that we see a few flashbacks and he does come across as less than nice in 2/3 of them, with the third one being dead. On the other hand, we're stuck with Snape for seven books, and you know, there's that minor inconvenience of James being dead.

I find most discussions surrounding him to be quite straining because we have no other favourable accounts of him at all, other than his friends' testimonies of his maturity later on in life, and his supposed status as Head Boy (which I doubt, because neither Sirius nor Lupin brought it up in the prefects discussion). It's a shame, because James has the potential to be an interesting character, but alas, he's either the devil's child in his haters' eyes or a well of virtue in his fans', there is no in between.

**** Agreed.

One problem with James is, we see via /showing/ that he's a bad guy but are only told via /telling/ that he's a good guy. Showing will always be more powerful than telling, which leaves us in a bit of a dilemma.

***** The real tragedy here is he never actually go to grow up, however much he matured. So even if he did, he wouldn't be what he is likely to have been at thirty, but it's generally agreed upon (how?) that he was a terrible person, and Lily had wrong judgement to marry him, so they'd divorce in the future...and I just can't because divorcing him usually accompanies marrying Snape right off the bat. It's laughably bad.

****** True. I mean I can see where the trend is coming from - JKR tries so, so hard to tell us Snape is a good guy. She replicates Harry's school experience, trying to turn James&Co into Malfoy&Co and Snape into Harry, bad home life included, in order to garner our sympathy for Snape. She /literally/ tells us when Harry says he named his son Albus /Severus/ after "the bravest men he ever knew" which is such a reality-distorting take on the facts I get exhausted just thinking about arguing with someone about it.

******* Many people claim that Snape was abused by Tobias, physically and otherwise, and it seems to be taken as canon. I know he was neglected by both parents, but was it ever outright stated he was /abused/? The thing is, a lot of evidence is there to back up James and co. being bullies, and I realise Rowling intended that. It just seems, wrong is the right word? I hate it when James is even accused of being a rapist by Snape fanatics. Like it was shoehorned somewhat. It doesn't matter though, I love these characters because they're complex and well-written. That whole thing about about 'the bravest man I ever knew', what utter tripe. In order for Snape to be such, Harry and Ginny's entire characters must be so soft-headed, and destroyed just to have a kid named after Snape. It just goes so against Harry and Ginny's entire personalities, I just can't comprehend it.

Here's the thing, a simple discussion is good, but Snape fanatics can sometimes get so damn aggressive which is what makes it so damned draining, I've been outright insulted and called stupid and obtuse before, so now I just generally avoid it. The sarcasm and passive-aggressiveness is not appreciated, at all.

**** Wellllll I have this Theory.

So the production of the first film overlapped with the production (as in preparing for publishing) of book 5.

Snape, in book 1-4, is pretty one-dimensional. The big mystery about him isn't why is he an arse to Harry, he's an arse to everyone, it's why he's helping Harry despite hating him.

I think JKR has been caught a little off-guard by how much HP suddenly has taken off and now has to scramble closing all those plot holes and figuring out how to explain stuff she didn't really think about before. I do believe that she had some things figured out from the start, but I highly, highly doubt she had all the nitty gritty details locked down, and I think why is Snape was one of those things she hadn't really thought about yet.

Now Suddenly we get Alan Rickman playing Snape. Who is an amazing actor. Who is asking her "why is Snape". Who she doesn't want to disappoint. So she goes "uhhhh why is Snape why is Snape... shit gimme a sec... oh right because Lily!". And AR is like "oohhhh" and goes off to do his thing, and he's frickin' /amazing/. (Personally I have a hard time forgiving AR (jk) for being so amazing because I'm solid convinced he's the reason why we get so many Snape apologists.) And now JKR has to figure out how to make all of this make sense.

I don't think she cared that much about Snape up until book 4, but suddenly he's Important to her. Except he's been such an unmitigated arsehole it's very difficult to get him out of that pit she pushed him in. So she goes out of her way - goes so far out of her way that on her way from London to Edinburgh she took a shortcut via Reykjavik - to woobify Snape. He really isn't that bad! He had a horrible childhood! His only friend was Lily! And he was bullied by everyone at school! And then Lily /married his bully/ gasp the betrayal! And /that's/ why he joined the Wizard Nazis, not because he's one himself! Actually he's a half-blood himself you know!! And he regretted it! That's why he became a spy at great danger to his own life you know!! Good Guy award winner 1981.

She got so deep into this shtick she lost sight of, you know... common sense. In no world is "ah my Lord as reward for telling you about this prophecy how about you do me a tiny lil favour... I mean kill the husband & son but spare the girl pls I wanna pork her" an acceptable, good guy thing to say. In no world is "teacher hardcore targeting an 11yo while habitually bullying everybody else" excusable. In no world is "casually calling his supposedly only friend a racial slur but it's fine I was just humiliated & angry bc bullies that she defended me from" okay.

And now while trying to pull Snape out of his pit she tripped and pushed James & Sirius into another. But well James is dead and she's already trying to get rid of Sirius, so this actually does fit kinda into how she's already trying to make Sirius seem unreliable & selfishly reckless in book 5 (as opposed to "reckless for other people" in book 4) on her quest to explain why a teenager is fighting the war on his own, so here, have some throwaway explanations why James & Sirius aren't that bad really. Can we go back to Snape now hey do you think we could rename the series I think "The Tragic Tale of Severus Snape" has a nice ring to it don't you think? ahh my poor boo. Alan you're doing amazing sweetie.

** I think it's because he suffered a lot, but that just begs the question as to why they do not make Remus, for example, that way. Or any other character who has suffered in the books in innumerable ways. Harry, for one, is allowed to angst and weep and cry a lot in fanfiction. I can see the appeal, it's just not accurate. Sirius was also very sulky in Snape's Worst Memory, it was James and Peter that were the more energetic and louder ones, Sirius was 'haughty', he does not actively seek out attention, but just does whatever he pleases. He was proud, bored and sullen. The quieter two were Sirius and Remus. So, Sirius obviously had issues early on, and not just because of Azkaban. His home life might not have been physically abusive, but he was at least neglected emotionally judging by Walburga's portrait. You didn't miss anything from the books, he's always been quite chill, and certainly not a bag of energy ready to burst with fireworks and rainbows, he might as well be half leprechaun, fanon Sirius would certainly find family amongst them.

As for the 'chick magnet'. He is attractive, and he's one of the only characters whom somebody openly gawks at in the books (the girl in the flashback). It wasn't so much gawking as 'staring wistfully' but you catch my drift. But the idea that obviously all handsome or beautiful people just be romantically involved every other day (players) is such a shallow take on so many characters and a much shallower assumption to project onto others in real life. I mean, Fleur for example sometimes gets the same treatment, albeit rarely. Obviously, she values so much more than a one time fling, Sirius is much the same, but I don't know where that was lost, exactly? Rowling even called him a 'loose canon' who was much too busy to settle down. I feel like people actually believe that Lily and James getting married at 18 and becoming teen parents is a normal thing, but it's not...even if at the time of the war it was as we later learn from Arthur and Molly for example. Actually, it was James that was looking over to the lake constantly to impress the girls, not Sirius. Although that might've just been Lily.

Sirius is an idealist ('what was there to be gained? Only innocent lives, Peter' and 'then you should have died rather than betray your friends' and the entire verbal spar with Fred in Grimmauld Place 'things worth dying for'). Notice that he calls Pettigrew by his first name, and didn't start cursing him and insult him childishly at every turn. You didn't mention this but the idea that he did everything because of James is very vapid and shallow, he has his own agency and he's not just in for the thrills, and he certainly isn't just part of the Order because he wanted to protect his friends, although that is a motivation, certainly. Sirius just isn't as fickle as he's sometimes portrayed to be in this respect, and for a guy whose entire dramatic introduction being a book to illustrate his loyalty (dude swam to Surrey from the middle of the North Sea, talk about dedication), that's very baffling.

I can rant for days about this, and I still wouldn't be satisfied.

** No one's yet mentioned his dog animagus, which I think has something to do with his fanon portrayal. Happy, silly and energetic.

He is described as energetic several times in canon, and as part of a double act with James, the two of them according to Lily spent a lot of time hexing other students for fun so it's easy to draw parallells either to the Weasley twins or to the petty duelling Gryffindor/Slytherin thing we see between Harry and Malfoy. However, from what we see of Sirius's sense of humour both in flashbacks and post Azkaban, it's dark and sarcastic and he's well-spoken yet uses a mix of crude and clever language (Kreacher snogging a pair of his father's trousers or crying over his mother's bloomers, the jab about Peter wetting himself if he gets any more excited, calling the Black family most ancient and noble, etc). His humour is very specific and rarely replicated well in fanfiction.

As for chick magnet, and I feel like I've posted this before but maybe not many people have read it, but there is an essay about Lupin that JKR wrote, mostly backstory but there is a very insightful quote there, which is Lupin bitterly saying "he always got the women" about Sirius.

JKR comment from her old website: I shook hands with a woman who leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, 'Sirius Black is sexy, right?' And yes, of course she was right, as the Immeritus club know. The best-looking, most rebellious, most dangerous of the four marauders...

So if we want to go by word of god, even though it's never explicitly stated in the books, then he definitely was a chick magnet. He is in the books described as saying and doing things energatically several times, but not hyperactive. He possibly did more childish pranks although his sense of humour was much darker than that from what little we get to see. He is never described as overly cheerful or silly or vain or frivolous, in fact I think people who say these are James's personality traits are probably right.

** Like most tropes, someone probably wrote a pretty popular fic with this characterization of Sirius, other writers copied this characterization when they wrote their own fics more and more until people could not remember anymore which Sirius was canon and which one was fanon.

I don't know why the first person who wrote Sirius like he did (nobody else than him does), but I can guess that he wanted to "fix" Sirius by writing him how he was before Azkaban rather than that depressed, half broken man we have in canon (also because writing elaborate characters is hard).\\
Whether this characterization of Pre Azkaban Sirius is accurate or not is up to the reader, though I'm personally in the "Not Accurate" category.
