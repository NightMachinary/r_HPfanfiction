Basically, Harry has a sibling but Dumbledore isn't an idiot and recognizes that Harry is the BWL. Preferably the siblings would still be orphaned and Harry's sibling would be a well-written OC. I would strongly prefer Harry/Ginny but I can deal with most pairings so long as there is no character bashing. Preferably not Harry/Hermione or slash. In essence, no WBWL stories.


** Set in HBP and Harry has a twin sister in Slytherin. It's kind of Harry's sister/Draco but it is definitely the best Sibling fic I've ever read.

  Harry wasn't the only Potter displaced by the events in Godric's Hollow on Halloween 1981. Leila, Harry's twin, was also there that night. Now, headed into her sixth year, Leila finds that everything changes when she falls into the arms of Hogwarts resident Death Eater, Draco Malfoy. Fate steps in and throws her completely off course, leaving her lost along the way.

**** It's quite easy. For fanfiction.net stories, just write linkffn(...) and in the brackets either the ID of the fic, or the title and the author. A full help is in the sidebar.

So in case of the fic you just linked, just type

linkffn(Lost Along the Way by January Lily)

** I am writting one where Harry has a twin sister named Emily but he's still is the boy who lived. It is still early first year but I do plan on it being canon when it comes to Harry. The twins live with Sirius in London. I do plan on having it be H/G.
