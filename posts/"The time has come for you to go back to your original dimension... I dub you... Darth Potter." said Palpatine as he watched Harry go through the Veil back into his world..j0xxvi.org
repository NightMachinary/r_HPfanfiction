** "As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie-"

Suddenly, Umbridge stopped talking. She opened her mouth - once, twice - but no sound came out.

Panic visible in her eyes, the DADA professor grabbed at her neck, as if someone was choking her and she was trying to stop him. With her other hand, Umbridge tried to reach for her wand, but her hand was shaking so much that she couldn't even get a good grip.

Harry smiled coldly.

"I find your lack of faith disturbing... Professor."
