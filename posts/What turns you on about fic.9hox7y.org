Just wondering what kind of stuff turns you on about a fic?

Word length? Genre? Pairing? Year it Starts? Reviews?

Just wondering


** Lots of things, though they're not really a genre:

- Adventure stories (in Hogwarts or out, as long as they aren't rehashes).
- Interesting or new depictions of magic (and not just wandless-ing everything).
- Stories that explore the impact magic has on peoples psychology and social interactions and culture.
- A unique 4th year/any year tournament. This can go a long way for me honestly.
- Magical creatures featuring quite a bit, but not in an overwhelming way (ex. Harry steals all their abilities or becomes a dragon animagus - can be done well but only in certain cases).
- How long author has had a fanfiction page (this is surprisingly helpful actually).
- In media res stories are always kind of interesting.

Bottom line though is I tend to look for fics that do /something/ conceptually different. Its probably a bit of a deficiency on my part, but I am pretty willing to overlook quite a bit of poor writing or angst for something different.

*** I have the same problem if the concept is interesting enough I'll slog through some pretty shitty writing.

Well written smut.

On topic with the actual meaning of your question, genre and pairing out of what you mentioned. But really it's more of a question of what turns me off a fic, because I generally exclude fics with elements I don't like rather than search for fics with elements I do like.

*** That's pretty much the same for me as well. If it lacks most or all the kinds of things I don't like, and the premise seems interesting, I give it a chance.

**** There isn't really a good way to search for specifics besides the Tag system, so excluding a ton of stuff through scryer is a good way to find what you are interested in by virtue of what remains after the filters.

** A bottle of bourbon with some Sinatra in the background. A candlelit room and an eye catching set of lingerie. I am a simple man, I enjoy the classics. üòèüòè

** Adventure, Post-War, a unique idea, between 70 and 350k words. I really dont care about followers, favourites etc

** Well-written, gen or with minimal romance, the longer the better. Genre, pairing, year, and reviews are mostly irrelevant.

I do tend to lean toward more intelligent characters - clever applications of magic interest me more than blatant powersmash types. (On that note, I really wish there were more Ravenclaw!Draco or Smart!Draco stories that weren't blatant shipfics.)

** A nice summary that's not overly-vague but one that doesn't spoil too much.

Word length and reviews don't matter too much to me, they don't really indicate how good the story is.

I tend to avoid any Ginny/Harry, or Luna/Harry and any Harry slash fics. But any other pairing is game for me.

** I prefer complete fictions, but admit that some of the best will be forever unfinished.

I generally don't read anything under 1,000 words or listed as a drabble, but I'll make exceptions for authors whose other works I enjoy.

I avoid the fic site search engines. I usually begin by finding a fic rec on an award site, then trolling through the authors other works and bookmarks/favourites. Sometimes I stumble across a user with similar taste to mine and just spend days checking out the fic they've bothered to mark.

I find that fics with lots of reviews are generally a safe bet, but largely ignore the content of those reviews.

I like shipping fics with slow burns and string female leads. Lots of self reflection, emotional turmoil and judiciously used dialog, too.

Some of the sexiest fics are rated T and are electric without a blunt fade to black. Some smutty M rated fics are just random hate sex scenes. Can't really go by the rating be because I primarily look for an emotional high.

Interesting question.
