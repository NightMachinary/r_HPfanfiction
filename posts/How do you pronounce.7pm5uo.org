I find it odd when I am watching movies and find things pronounced differently then i had been doing all along.

For example, I always said Sirus as Sir-rye-us. And Nagini I pronounced as Nah-Jinny, but others pronounced nuh-gee-nee

Also Narcissa, some pronounce Nar-kiss-uh, I say Nar-siss-uh

Or Lucius, some say Lushius, Lushus, I say Loo-see-us

What about you all?


** Honestly I don't even try to pronounce those words in my head when I'm reading. I just sort of go "oh it's that one" and keep going. I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, and honestly while I love the exotic looking names, there is no way in hell I'm going to try and pronounce them. I mean hell, I used to pronounce Ravnica as "rav-in-i-cah" and there is no way any sane English speaker thinks that is right.

Which, you know, is probably why my stories are all nuts.

** You want crazy pronunciations, listen to the Game of Thrones audio books. They're read by the late Roy Dotrice and he does a pretty good job, but he could not stay consistent for anything. Brienne the Beauty is "Bree-enn" in one book and then "Bri-een" in another. I think he also changes up Danerys a few times. It's rather distracting.

** Nah-gee-nee

Seer-ree-us (though that could just be my american accent talking. It's the "serious" puns, I swear.)

and the other two I agree with you. Narcissa is from Narcissus of greek myth, so no question there, and Lushus, or Luscious, is just flat out wrong unless they're actively trying to piss Lucius off. It is definitely Loo-see-us.

I will admit, though, that I spelled Peverell completely wrong when I first read it. I thought it was Pervell for the longest time. The one day I realised I was wrong. It was weird.

*** It's so funny how we hold tight to our pronounciations. Like I gave up Sirius's and admitted I'm wrong and what not and began pronouncing his name right but for some reason I absolutely can not ever give up Nagini's pronounciation. JK rowling herself could tell me I'm wrong and I'd be like 'nope don't care'

hahah I'm American too, when I first read it I DID say Serious, but I'm like 'no wait no one would name/pronounce their kids name 'serious' thats dumb so it can't be that. It has to be Sir-rye-us

**** In British English "Sirius" is not pronounced exactly the same as "serious", though they are close. The difference is in the bolded vowel sound:

S*i*rius -> i

S*e*rious -> ɪə̯

**** Nagini is sanskrit, the female form of "naga".

I listened to Stephen Fry's audiobook of the series for years, mostly something to sleep to. His pronunciation of words is what I use.

***** *Nāga*

Nāga (IAST: nāgá; Devanāgarī: नाग) is the Sanskrit and Pali word for a deity or class of entity or being taking the form of a very great snake, specifically the king cobra, found in the Indian religions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. A female nāga is a nāgin" or nāgini".

** As a kid, I read Draco as DRAH-koh instead of DRAY-koh.

Narcissa (nah-SISS-uh) is pronounced like /narcissistic/ (which it shares a root word with).

Lucius (LOO-see-iss) shouldn't really be up for debate, since it's a real name, pronounced like Lucien, Luciano or Lucy.

Sirius is named after the star, which I've usually heard pronouce SIH-ree-iss (in the UK at least).

Nagini... I have no idea. It's apparently Sanskrit. I always read it as nuh-GEE-nee.

Well, /yes/, but on the other hand, wizards may still be working from the Latin name separate from how the pronunciation of the name on the muggle end evolved, so whule Lushous might be out, perhaks Lookious is not. Or, barring this, considering their last name, the Malfoys seem to be of French descent, so perhaps it's pronounced the French way, /lysiys/ in phonetic alhabet.

As for Nagini, I follow the movies' lead and say Nah-ghee-nee.

**** I'd argue the French pronunciation is basically the English -- just with a French accent. The /y/ sound doesn't exist in most British accents after all.

And I think the original Latin would have been Loochious. Hard 'c' is church Latin.

***** I think you're confused on the Latin pronunciation rules? I've always learnt in my Latin classes that hard 'c'-s are the traditional rendition of the Roman prounciation, and "ch" is Church Latin.

As for "Lucius", I see where you're coming from, but at the same time, the English pronunciation doesn't pronounce the two 'u' the same way, whereas the French one does, which I feel is a substantial difference.

***** I have never once studied Greek Mythology outside of my Mythology class in high school, which wasn't part of the common classes everyone took. The middle school and two high schools I've attended didn't even have a Greek Mythology class.

Even if it was, Narcissus would be a small part of everything that was studied. Most people don't remember most of what they've learned in high school, much less middle school.
