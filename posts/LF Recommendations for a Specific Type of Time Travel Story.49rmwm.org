Like the title said, I'm looking for recommendations for a specific type of time travel story where Harry (or other characters I guess... though I prefer Harry-centric) travel back in time to when Marauders are in school / the first war with Voldemort is going on. The catch is I want an adult Harry to travel back in time or at least not the cliched Harry pretends to be a random transfer student and attends boring classes with his parents. I want him to be actively fighting in the war. Examples I have of this are Delenda Est linkffn(5511855) I know he does spend time at Hogwarts with his parents as a professor but he also is going out as a skilled vigilante and is playing politics with cool characters we never met from the Black and Malfoy families. The other example I have, that I read recently, is Whiskey Time Travel linkffn(11233445) which I really enjoyed even though it is not complete. I loved how he was an unspeakable and was really skilled. Basically I want a Harry who is a skilled fighter who travels back in time to before he was born and takes the fight to Voldemort. I don't care about if there is a pairing or not but please no slash as the main relationship with Harry. Also as a side note, does anyone know of any other stories with Harry/Amelia Bones where Harry has traveled back in time. I really liked the relationship they were building in Whiskey Time Travel.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
