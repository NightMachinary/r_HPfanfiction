I'm currently working on a Harry Potter/Warcraft crossover. Before publishing it I've been toying with the idea of including either an Appendix or Dramatis Personae with each chapter to help people keep track of the various characters.

In the story Harry and Ginny are transported to Azeroth the Warcraft home world and over the course of the story encounter a multitude of characters from that universe. The story follows them and while they may encounter a character at one point in the story that character may have been changed completely by the time they encounter them again later due to events happening offscreen. I could write about what happens to each character but I feel like for the most part it would just be a retelling of their canon character arcs and I'd rather focus on the changes the presence of Harry and Ginny in this world make.

So I had the idea to either include a Dramatis Personae at the beginning of each chapter with a brief description of all the characters encountered that chapter OR an appendix at the end of each chapter with either short bio's for new characters being introduced or characters that haven't appeared in a while and links to their various wiki pages so those who want to read their back story have the option to. In the Appendix I would probably also include links to World Maps, location descriptions and maybe even a link to music from the games for certain zones (Dat Grizzly Hills theme).

So knowing that many on this sub don't approve of long Authors notes I'm wondering if this is a good idea or perhaps I should just let the story tell itself and if people have questions about characters or locations to answer them in review responses and direct them individually to where they can get that information.


** I think you should be able to convey everything you need for your story in the story. A character index seems like a copout to me.

** Character indexes can be very helpful for crossovers. They help people who aren't familiar with a part of the crossover understand who the characters are.

** If you're doing it on FFn, start a forum for yourself. You can then add an A/N saying "Hey, for more about the characters, see my profile for link to forum page about it."
