Was listening to npr today and they had a segment about the Ramones and how people who were outcasts really connected to their music. What bigger outcast than pre-Troll hermione?


** I have no clue how to make a story out of that but it's kind of odd that no orientation program exists for people coming from Muggle background. I mean Harry was lucky to run into the Weasleys but probably most Muggleborns were just as lost. Do they just start from the assumption that they'll make friends along the way?

*** My headcanon is that Muggleborns' letters included more detailed directions and such. Harry was not, technically, a Muggleborn, and IIRC Hagrid was surprised that he knew nothing about magic.

**** Don't Muggleborns have teachers give them their letters?

***** Probably; I don't know what canon info we have about that.

The point is that for a Muggleborn, directions to the platform would have been a part of the standard orientation package, whether delivered in writing or in person by a Professor. This we can infer from the fact that they had all somehow made it there.

Hagrid wasn't a Hogwarts Professor and was sent ad hoc, however, so he might not have had the proverbial "Muggleborn checklist" to go through.

*** I feel like something is there, Im just not sure what, but I just found the thought of Hermione being into Punk Rock hilarious.
