**** I've actually got that saved in my "to put on kindle" bookmarks lol. The only reason I hadn't yet is it lacking completion and recent updates. But I definitely plan to read it. I didn't realize it was an actual 3 person pairing though. The way the description read I just thought the characters were included.

** I've recommended a Fleur/Tonks/Harry in another coment, so here's the rest of what I can remember having read. linkffn(Heart and Soul; What it comes down to: A year too soon; A badger's champion; Harry Potter and the International TriWizard Tournament)

Its incest so its understandable if you don't want it, but its Harry/OC/Gabby linkffn(Potters against the world)

Its supposed to be harem, but so far, its only been Harry/Fleur/Luna with hint of Hermione (IIRC) linkffn(A Godfather's Promise)

Its Harry/Pansy, but Narcissa plays a large role(as a partner) in this, great plot imo linkffn(We're in this Together)

Though its actually a Harem, it takes a long long time for it to become more than Harry/Daphne/Susan linkffn(Whispers in the Night) Not the best of plots however.

Those are all I can remember, and even if a few don't fit exactly into your ask, do try to give a read if you're bored.

** Most of the ones I've found are meh at best (in my opinion). There is one though called Ruthless by AngelaStarCat. Premise is that James Potter did a thing and now Harry can only make "right" choices - not the morally just choices, but choices that have the best possible outcome.

Its Harry/Hermione/Theodore Nott. Though it's mostly the boys with Hermione, the boys' relationship with each other is more like brothers.
