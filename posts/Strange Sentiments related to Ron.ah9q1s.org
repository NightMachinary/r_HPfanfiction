So recently I have been reading a Dark Trio fic named Black and Gold and Ron is nothing more than a Pet to his master Harry, wanting not his own glory but that of Harry. But still he is included, he is powerful and he is a protagonist. I find myself liking the fic just because of that. I let Dumbledore bashing not get me down. Even Harry casually threatening Snape didn't dissuade me from the fic. I felt it was worth all of it for Ron is not worse than a Death Eater.

But then it hit me. This isn't Ron. I know this isn't the same for everybody but the only truly defining factor of an 11 year old Ron for me is that he doesn't want to live in his brother's or anyone's shadow. His deepest hearts desire is to achieve glory of his own.

So why is it that I was and still am happy to see the name Ron tacked on to an OC who I would have deeply resented if he had replaced Ron.

Are these the signs of a fanatic? Am I crazy?


** It's rare to find decent fanfiction with a prominent Ron. A list of some characters who are tagged in stories more than Ron on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. (Rating: All, Language: English)

Ron Weasley (38k)

- Harry Potter (171k)
- Hermione Granger (142k)
- Draco Malfoy(124K)
- Severus Snape (56k)
- Sirius Black (44k)
- James Potter (41k)
- Ginny Weasley (45k)
- Lilly Evans (41k)

Ron barely edges out Remus who has 37.5k.

Of course, this doesn't account for stories who don't use the tagging system at all or stories that only used the tagging system for the main pairing. However, I find the disparity so large that Ron probably couldn't catch up in any case. And in a lot cases, Ron is still bashed in stories he's tagged in.

So, it makes sense to me that you would read stories you otherwise wouldn't just because Ron is prominent and powerful in it.

But Ron's my favorite character so I could be bias.

*P.S.* The whole OC with a canon name on it. Yeah, that accounts for, at the /very/ /least,/ 65-75% of stories with the main canon characters in it. It's probably around 90-95% for Harry's character specifically though.

*** I think a huge part of these numbers are slash. Draco/Harry and Sirius/Remus were two of the most prominent pairings in fanfics, iirc.

** From my experience the author has an odd tendency of characters either outright hating Harry or swearing their undying loyalty.

But still, Dark!Ron is a rarely seen work, so it makes sense that you still enjoy it, even if accepting he's now an OC with a familar name.

** I wouldn't expect a dark!Harry fic with Dumbledore bashing to have an even remotely positive portrayal of Ron, so I wouldn't read them even if they were my cup of tea.

I think Authors who write Ron-centric fics are much more willing to take a risk and tell a character driven story, than write a 'my character is the most powerfullest and edgiest if all' fic.

I could name hundreds of well liked fanfics with Harry and Hermione as mains, that completely miss the mark on their characterisation (and are just plain bad).

I can only name 2 Ron fics that fit that over the top power fantasy, and one of them isn't that bad, and the other is most certainly satire of the super!Harry trope.

Looking for fics with a good and accurate perception of Ron is really difficult, and their aren't that many long ones.

Harry, Hermione and Ron are very complex characters, but unlike Harry and Hermione, it's very difficult to take a shortcut to write for Ron.

You can play up Harry's 'hero thing's and Hermione brains, but if you use the same method of shortcut to get Ron's characterisation, you end up turning him into a bloody hell machine.

I think the fandom has spent more time analysing Harry and Hermione (particularly after the movies twisted Ron's character), and only now are authors and readers starting to understand and appreciate Ron Weasley (that includes me).

That being said, Solstice Muse and Windischild have been writing fantastic Ron fics for ages.

Just gonna link this community I made, which I think do a good positive perception of Ron, missing some of the lower quality recs people usually get for fics with him as a central character.

** People are going to fill in character traits subconsciously which aren't explicitly countered, meaning that if there's a character that they love or hate, their love or hate for the character will ultimately bias their judgement of their actions.

What you are saying implies that you like Ron a lot as a character, meaning you may like his portrayal in a certain story even if he ends up acting OOC in it to a point of dislike for an OC, due to the fic not explicitly invalidating your interpretation of Ron's personality.

I don't know. I think there's a certain type of person for whom that works. Personally I either see those characters as OC's (basically ignoring their name) or entirely compartmentalize the "Ron" from the fanfic away from real!Ron.

In any case I'm not suddenly more interested in a CSI Miami fic, just because the main characters are named Harry and Hermione.

Are you sure that's true? There's a phenomenon that I like to call "protagonist bias", where (probably because of immersion) questionable acts by the protagonist become more palpable to the reader. So I'm not sure this has just something to do with the name, but just with being invested and relating to a main character.

*** On the first point I'm probably just a different kind of reader. I probably don't even have a nearly correct definition of real!Ron anymore. I guess I immerse myself more easily with these common names. It's like the Daphne phenomenon. All these persons named Daphne mesh together to create a greater whole in my mind. On the other hand, I have little patience for getting to know an OC every time I pick up a new fic.

On the second part, I don't and wouldn't have resented the OC for the things he/she did. I would have just resented that the author had to replace Ron. I have experienced this time and again with stories where Ron has a twin sister. My thoughts are like 'Why? Just why couldn't Ron fill those shoes'

The more I talk the more illogical my thoughts seem to me.

** Ron is a difficult character to write in fanfiction because most of his "roles" are either obsolete or filled by the characters introduced by the changes the author made. It is therefore not surprising that many are not sure what to do with him.

We don't need an "introduction to the magical world" type of character (unnecessary, well-known exposition most of the time), and that role, as well as "best mate" are spots usually filled by the characters you introduce. You have a political kid fill the role of the guide (mostly Malfoy, Bones or Greengrass, sometimes even Sirius). You obviously make whoever else you want to introduce the best friend because you want them to be involved. You have to shoehorn the love interest in somehow. But where does that leave Ron?

Hermione can be annoying due to her lack of social competence (especially in the first few books), but she is a useful character for anything but extreme AUs like "Hogwarts Underground Racing Leauge".

I know it is a rather cynical point of view, but from a literary perspective, there is a better character for almost everything but canon compliant stories. Wood is the better keeper, some snob would be better suited to teach about the high society, Hermione for academics, Neville is the wildcard, Ron is too young for a mentor role.

At the same time, this is not an excuse for bashing him.
