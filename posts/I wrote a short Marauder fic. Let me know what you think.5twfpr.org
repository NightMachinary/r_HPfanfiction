** Hi! I'm kind of new to the sub, but want to help out anyway. Hope this isn't inappropriate.

The premise is new and interesting and I'd like to see more. But there are a couple of distracting style issues:

1. Overuse of the word 'guys', and a general anachronistic vibe to the slang they use

2. Improperly placed paragraph breaks.

PS The language seems to be tagged as Estonian?

Cheers!

*** No, no! That's exactly why I posted it here! Thank you for your feedback! No idea how it was listed as being in Estonian... Regardless, thanks!

** This is a lovely start. Your dialogue is really nice and feels natural. I do agree with zero to zeroes that some of the language feels a bit modern, and at times a little American too. For a good idea of how people spoke in 1970s England, it might be worth looking up a few British sitcoms from that era. Fawlty towers, Only Fools and horses, Ab Fab, the young ones (more 80s but was aimed at young people).

Something I really like is the little background details you slip in. Feels very JK.

*** Thank you! (Unless I'm writing an academic paper) I do tend to have that problem of having characters speak the way that I do. I will definitely keep that in mind!
