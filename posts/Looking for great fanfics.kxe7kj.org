Hi,

I'm looking for great HP fanfics. Here are more details about what I'm looking for:

- Must be in English

- Must be complete

- Must be a complete rewrite of the story, even if it's very canon-divergent

- Must have a mature tone (humor is okay but I still want something coherent and mostly serious)

- Must be on ffnet or AO3

I'm okay with self-inserts and fix-its. I absolutely loved The Arithmancer and I'm looking for something in this vibe, where the universe and characters are explored in depth. Please don't suggest stories that don't fit one criteria, except for the one about tone, since this is the only one I could let go of.

Thank you, in advance, for your suggestions!


** Can I just start off by saying that this is the perfect example of a request post? AI realize that my summaries aren't serious, but the stories are.

Anyway, this is after canon, but disregards Cursed Child. Harry is fed up with the Ministry and takes a stand as a dark Lord, but not an edgy Dumbledore hater.

Lockhart succeeds in obliviating Harry and he turns into the chillest kid ever. Kind of a Snape mentor, bc Snape thinks his new personality is a vast improvement.

I usually hate child fics, but Hermione gets lonely and summons a demon to have a friend. They take advantage and manipulate her into being a dark witch.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

** Tricky. My best suggestions for expanding the world are incomplete, and there's another that's a complete nonmagical AU rewrite (and part of a larger series) but on a different site.

Have you read linkffn(The Snape Chronicles)? Canon compliant, but canon is only a small fraction of it, and it definitely has more mature themes (Voldemort was not gentle with his returned servants). It really gave me a different perspective on Harry's behaviour, especially how he came across to someone who only saw a few parts of his life. Snape saw him retaliate violently against insults and charge off into danger, but didn't see him show kindness to a house elf or save his cousin's soul despite their history.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
