Got this stuck in my head the other day. I know most OP stories are either Harry or occasionally the Trio as a whole. But I am interested in purely a Hermione oriented one.

I would prefer Hermione paired with Harry in some sort of romantic fashion (even if its part of a polyamorous relationship), and as such, no Ron. I would also like to see her very much with a "Take Charge" personality and attitude, not just within the bounds of a relationship with Harry or friendship with others, but also within the wizarding world as a larger whole. The time period doesn't matter (school, post-school, time travel, whatever). Mature rated fics preferred, or at least ones where the author doesn't tiptoe around mature themes.

Any recommendations?

*EDIT:* Thanks to those who have posted. I am a bit miffed at the amount of hate this post has been garnering me through the wild upvote/downvote swing on the thread itself (at one point 10+ now all the way back down to 2), and multiple PM's saying my request was stupid.

Honestly sitting here wondering why this request, of all things, would be annoying to some. Is it perhaps the Ginny/Harry ship fanbase?


** Off the top of my head, here are several that haven't been mentioned so far:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) has exactly that and may, one day, update. Right [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]?
- Ditto linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen).
- Ditto linkffn(Rule of two, dreams come true by Darklooshkin). Right, [[/u/Darklooshkin]]?
- /Dangerous/ by BlackLotus went down with GrangerEnchanted.com, but someone has saved it: [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsYlo4cG9IOG9nWnc]] ; also unfinished.

As for the flames, I suspect that among the people who are flaming you, there will be more Harry/Daphne 'shippers than Harry/Ginny. It's not about the 'ship between Harry and Hermione. Rather, it's about you daring to ask for a fic in which Harry's partner (a woman!) might be more powerful than him.

Oh, yes. Things a male character will get praised for will make some people cry "Mary Sue" if it's a female character doing it. Sometimes Harry not doing everything himself is enough to trigger the hatred.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** My linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) certainly qualifies for the "take-charge characterization" bit, and if I'm being honest, with the "OP!Hermione" bit too. It's not M at all, on the other hand, and doesn't feature a pairing. Still, I think you may enjoy it. Warning: rampant, gleeful insanity.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.
