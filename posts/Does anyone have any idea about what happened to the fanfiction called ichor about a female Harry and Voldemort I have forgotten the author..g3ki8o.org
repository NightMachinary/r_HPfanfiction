So I read this fic a year ago and I fell in love with the way female Harry and Tom were written. Does anyone know where this story went?


** I found it on AO3:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7635940]]

*** Hey thanks for this but the one I was specifying was a fem Harry with Tom. I don't know if the author might have deleted it.

** You won't find it on Ao3 or Fanfiction but the writer Nocturnememory has started to slowly post Ichor to Wordpress. I think to better control who can see it

**** No worries. I was the same as it was one of my favourite HP/LV stories. So glad that she's got her inspiration back for the story and it looks like she's rewriting and fleshing it out more than what was orginally there
