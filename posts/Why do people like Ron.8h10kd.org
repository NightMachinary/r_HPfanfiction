** First, that description probably describes a significant portion of people in the world. Greed, envy, and sloth are all common character flaws. /And yet people with those flaws often have friends./ That means that an even larger portion of people are like that or have friends like that, and can relate.

It's easy to hate Ron-the-character-in-a-book because of whatever flaws are hilighted (and how dare he harm the designated protagonist in any way!), but if Ron was a real person? He'd be just an average kid.

Do keep in mind that we see him through a narrative medium - a book. We /cannot/ see every moment of his life, and so we must only see the most interesting parts. Fights and arguments are usually interesting, so that is what we see in the book. We see Ron's flaws because that's what moves the plot and provides social conflict. We don't see Ron being an average, decent school friend because that's boring.

tl;dr the book necessarily paints character flaws in a bad light and makes us invested in protecting Harry. Flaws that would be only slightly annoying in real people become intolerable in books. Ron's probably a great guy (or at least relatable to many), but we only really see him at his worst due to narrative restrictions.

**** If I'm interpreting TE7 correctly, are you trying to say Charlie's a dick? (Charlie, meaning Charlie Weasley.)

** I am not a Ron fan, mostly due to the early books. I found Hermione or Harry and their problems way more relatable, but there are plenty of people who see themselves in Ron. He is probably the most "average" of the trio, and a lot of people can see themselves in his spot
