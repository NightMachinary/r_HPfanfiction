Hey guys,\\
After reading a few FF I'm quite tempted to give it a try, specially since I got an idea of plot which could give something refreshing and new. But with 800k+ FF out there I was wondering if I was not about to just make something that is already done... Hence I'd like to discuss this plot, see if it's not done yet and what you think about it!

*Type* : Mostly adventure/mystery/suspens with a bit of romance mostly Harry/Hermione/Bella

*Inspiration : "*Delenda Est" for Bella character, "The Debt Of Time" for marauders

*Plot summary* : Starts end of 7th year when the trio gets to Hogwarts for the battle. Main difference with canon is the relationship between Harry/Hermione. The battle go horribly wrong, the diadem horcruxe is not found and everyone is slaughtered, harry and hermione last survivors flee.

They find a way to go back in time, but this way will let them arrive 1 full moon appart. They make plans to bring down Voldemort and his horcruxes.

Harry arrives in the past first (so 1 month before Hermione). He arrives in summer 1977 (before 7th year of marauders, snape and non-canonically Bellatrix and few others future death eaters.).

Harry messes up trying to get the ring and Tom use legimency on him and discover some of the future and what he is doing here. (exactly what he discovers is to be determined, but at least not that hermione is coming soon).

Tom memory charm Harry erasing everything and forging for him memories as a pure blood biggot. Toms then gives him the mission to infiltrate the order and get the trust of Albus, so Harry is sent to Hogwarts under a second false identity. At hogwarts he find himself a 7th year with at the same time as his parents and Bellatrix and co. He's sorted gryffindor.

Hermione arrives and Harry is not at their planed meeting. She finds that their plans of making things right are gone to ashes. Unsure what to do she goes to Dumbledor and tell him everything to happen in the future. Initially he thinks it's best he does not know. But then Hermione tell him something is wrong with Harry and that he's already changing the course of events. They don't understand why harry acts like that, it could be a time-travel ripple or whatever. So they don't know how to act on it. The best they find is that Hermione is to join the 7th year as a slitherin and try to infiltrate the death eathers circles in order to find the horcruxes and get closer to voldemort. And maybe turn some people from their dark future. Seeing the importance Dumbledor will teach hermione occlumency.

Harry the voldemort-double-agent befriend the marauders. On her side Hermione befriend Snape Bella and the others. Hermione try to reach to Harry to understand what's happening but he's not receptive and she dares not say about the future while unsure what happenned.

Some interactions between marauders and slytherins later, Bella is told Harry is a double agent. Voldemort thinks the cup (not yet horcruxe) is at hogwarts and ask them to find it for him. Maybe the start of some light romance.

On her side Hermione gets invited into the secret pureblood recruiting group for initiation.

Hermione and Dumbledore also have some adventure chasing the ring and maybe locket while trying to figure out what happenned to harry.

At some point Bella see Hermione scar which does not match the pure-blood background that she was giving. Bella legimence hermione and finds who did it. Disgusted by her future crazy self she decides to protect Hermione's secret while not giving up entirely a lifetime of indoctrination yet. And distance herself from hermione as she feels contradictory things.

Hermione gets invited at Lucius and Narcissa wedding at the malfoy manor by Rodolphus. During which Hermione meets Tom. She seems familar to him but he can't find why. She try to steal the book by imperio lucius, but Bella finds out. Ultimatelly she helps her.

Bella is torn because she has feelings for both Harry and Hermione. She can't bettray Harry's secret as a double agent but she starts to see the truth in what Hermione says.

At some points Tom remember that he seen Hermione in Harry's memories. He understand that she also comes from the future he check the ring and locket which are gone and fears for the diadem. He can't get inside hogwarts so he needs someone to get it. He ask Bella and Harry (as they successfully provided the cup before) and tell them Hermione is a double-agent which he wants Harry and Bella to trap after the diadem is secure. Bella is in a dead end and tells everything to Hermione, which in turn tells Bella more about the future, including that Harry is also from the future.

Then it will be about trying to get Harry back if they can and how to deal with a Voldemort knowing an unknown quantity of information from the future.

Sounds to have potential (to me at least!). And now you're mostly spoiled if it's get written! What do you think of it? Other than the many spelling errors I most certainly made.

Now the next step would be to finalise the plot and make a scene by scene breakdown I guess.


** Your Harry is too incompetent here, and why doesn't Voldemort simply kill him? Sounds like manufactured drama to me.

I may sound harsh here, but villain doing stuffs instead of killing captured hero is a way too overused trope in fictions. Such things don't happen in real wars. It also goes against the very nature of Voldemort, who really delights in killing and using Avada Kedavra.

If Voldemort wasn't that murder happy Avada Kedavra addict, he could have simply stunned Lily, and the whole BWL plot would have never happened.

*** Indeed. Though the point is mostly to give Tom an unknown knowledge of the future. Which enables to have some unexpected things happenning.

Regarding the doing stuff instead of killing, well that depends, it seems to me that Tom mostly want power over the country. As if he was just a killing maniac he would just be spending all of his time killing people. Over-powered as he is in canon he could be doing that all day.

And memory charm letting you erase someone's identity and forging a new one. Well it's a great recruiting method.

Also it could be stated that the whole Harry Potter world (specially canon) is 100% manufactured drama with 0 logic.

Anyway it sounds like this idea is not meeting a lot of enthousiasm!
