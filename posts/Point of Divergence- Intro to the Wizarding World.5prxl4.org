It never made sense to me that Dumbledore sent Hagrid to get Harry. Dumbledore thinks Harry is so important and doesnt go himself or send one of the other teachers to see what is going on always seemed off to me, especially with how concerned he is about Harry's security. I would really enjoy some fanfics that depart from Canon there. I've read a few like this but would really like some more! I've read To Shape and Change and Results of A Proper Introduction and liked them. Edited to correct the name of a fic.


** Agreed.

I have always found it odd that Dumbledore sent someone that didn't even graduate from Hogwarts to introduce Harry to the wizarding world and Hogwarts. It's even worse because he gave Hagrid an important job to do as well(getting the stone from Gringotts), which meant Harry had less time in the alley because Hagrid had to get back to Hogwarts.

I really want a divergent fic where either professor Sprout or Flitwick introduce Harry to the wizarding world. I think they would have been more thorough than Hagrid. They probably wouldn't have let Harry go home after he was done with shopping either, especially after seeing how Harry was treated.

*** I think that's exactly the reason he sent Hagrid. Not only is Hagrid Dumbledore's man to the letter - and would give Harry the best opinion of Dumbledore, compared to the other professors - but Hagrid is not as observant as other people. Dumbledore wanted Harry at the Dursleys. Anyone else would've twigged onto the fact that something is wrong and raised hell.

**** Hmm, maybe.

I think the professors respect Dumbledore too much to raise hell in the way that would see Harry leave the Dursleys. McGonagall knew that the Dursley's were "the worst sort of muggles" yet she didn't do anything for Harry. I think that even if the other teachers saw his home situation the most they would do is check up on him and keep the Dursleys in line.

***** Perhaps. Though it's one thing to say "they were the worst sort of muggles" after observing them for one day and another to actually know what they did and how they treated Harry. Also, I'm not really sure Dumbledore would want even something like "keeping them in line", since he places utmost importance on the blood words, perhaps at the expense of other things. If the Dursleys got too angry or intimidated they might refuse to take Harry back each summer.

****** The Dursleys didn't even have a choice as to whether to take him in, I highly doubt Dumbledore would give them a choice as to whether they should take Harry back. He left Harry on the Dursleys door step so they would have no choice but to take him in.

***** I mean, going against Dumbledore is both Political and Magical Suicide (unless you do it post fifth-year). McGonagall could have taken Harry from under his nose at a later point (say, when he was seven) but that doesn't stop Albus from retrieving him easily, McGonagall wouldn't be able to stand up to him in a Duel.

The whole "I want him to grow up away from the fame" is the most OOC thing Dumbledore has said/done since putting on an obviously cursed ring due to mortal infatuation. We see Dumbledore as someone who has an incredible amount of foresight and an incredible amount of care towards Harry.

So let's set up a picture of what Dumbledore knew about Petunia. For most of Lily's school years, she constantly sent letters about wanting to be a wizard/magical, and saying that there must have been a mistake. Does he not assume that that could lead to darker emotions bubbling up, maybe even a hate for that which she wished for because she couldn't have it?

There's also the fact that she'd never be capable of telling Harry what he needed to know, she knew the bare minimum, maybe even less. Was she supposed to be able to tell Harry about his vault? The different magical currency? When she didn't even know it? It's such a poor oversight, I have an extremely hard time believing that it was an accident or a 'miscalculation'.

**** Exactly, Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard at heard (oh, I don't question that he has good intentions over all, but he's ok with sacrificing people (especially Harry) for his "greater good" (I myself would have less of a problem with that if he were upfront about this and told Harry when he asked - I mean it's a harsh burden, but lying doesn't make it better! Ignorance isn't bliss, especially once you learn what has been withheld from you!))

ps: There's also the fact that he didn't look for an alternative solution (lock Voldemort's spirit up, destroy the horcruxes (except Harry) and finish Voldemort once Harry has lived a long and happy life! Or - remove the Horcrux another way (in canon we don't know if there is one because it's never brought up!))

**** Indeed, I've recently read a fanfiction were Neville uses plants to fight, so no reason why Sprout (who probably knows more about plants than even Mr.-Green-Thumb does) can't do the same and ruin the Dursleys lawn etc. ;)

Flitwick going all Darth Yoda on the place would also be nice to read :D ^{^}

**** Maybe it would turn into a Hufflepuff!Harry story where he joins her house because of the introduction she gave him. She would then look out for him all through out Hogwarts, even visiting him during summer to make sure the Dursleys are treating him well(theres no way Dumbledore would let Harry leave the Dursleys).

********* That is also true, that is where the basis for the whole "Heir of All Founders" thing really comes from. While we don't see the thoughts of canon Harry all too much, we do know that he is a lot more complex than JKR lets on. I think that when she realised that she was building a character that went against her world-view, she immediately made a u-turn with the story.

*********** He is, to put it simply, a conservative. He was crafted to be someone with nationalist values (raised by people who are such) and someone who understood the true value of hard work, and who thought that it should be people>government. This left a bad taste in Rowling's mouth, you can clearly see vehement hate towards the right side of the political spectrum on her twitter and in general media, and even to what charities she donates to (donated millions of pounds to keep Scotland tethered to a nation that oppressed them for years, virtue signals about taking in Refugees when she could perfectly house hundreds in one of her 3 mansions).

She herself never realized that the incompetent government she created in the Ministry of Magic, is a Leftist Government, LOL.

****** Agreed, I mean if you do it in a fanfiction - ok, your story, so go for it, but I agree that if you keep Harry close to canon, then he'd either end up in Slytherin (because he probably didn't meet Malfoy if a different professor took him and he didn't get Hagrid's biased view of Slytherin house either) or go to Gryffindor again because bravery (one could call it stupidly brave, because he doesn't think stuff through - his intentions are good, but the outcomes often aren't...look at Sirius's death!) is one of his key traits, too :)

Ok, he also might go to Raveclaw (IMHO smart Slytherins aren't in the house itself because that is looked down upon and in Raveclaw nobody will question them wanting to learn stuff (the intelligent and curious - for the most part - are in that house after all), even if it's stuff of a darker persuasion :) )
