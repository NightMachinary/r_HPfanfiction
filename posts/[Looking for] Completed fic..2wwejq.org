I had a week off and went on a bit of a fanfic bender. After reading a study in magic, harry potter and the boy who lived, and Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum, and rereading the likely abandoned akren series, I really wanna read something that's complete.

I love crossovers for the most part, as long as I have some knowledge of the second half, or if it's not as necessary.

Slash is fine as long as it isn't the focus.

Prefer less angst, more magic.

I also dislocated a rib earlier and am stuck in bed reading today. Help a bored fan out!


** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]

It's complete and amazingly well written.

I love all of Jim's work.

Also look at Joe Ducie (Joe6991) hero trilogy

**** You can't really. You can bend them pretty badly and cause a stress fracture at the joint spot. Now that hurts like a bitch let me tell you.

(Not sure if trolling.)

Jbern is Jim Bernheimer. Joe Ducie (Joe6991) is the author of the Hero trilogy. Each has published several original fiction novels professionally.

** /The Firebird Trilogy/ ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685][link to book 1]]) (500k words, complete): A rather dark but very interesting AU, where women rule over men, and Voldemort and Harry are /almost/ on the same side. Also includes brief excursions into other magical countries (Brazil, Western America, Eastern America).

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005][Oh God Not Again!]]/ (200k words, complete): A single comedic time loop. (The third-most-favorited complete story for /Harry Potter/.)

*** How I managed to read hundreds of fanfics without noticing the "completed" filter, I'll never know. Thank you kind sir. And I quite enjoyed the first part of the firebird trilogy, but stopped reading near when I turned into a harem. Jealousy, perhaps? =P

Oh no not again is one of my favs =)

**** my problem w/ the later books was that the author didn't really seem to know how to transition Harry between his very believable performance in book 1 to having a harem, and starts losing his way from there

*** Just finished /Oh God Not Again!/ the other day. It is a quick read, and I really enjoyed it. There were times I couldn't stop laughing. I'd highly recommend it!
