Oneshot from Lucius Malfoy's perspective. Voldemort and the Death Eaters gain control of wizarding Britain and are completely segregated from muggles and muggleborns. Dystopia ensues:

- Voldemort continues to be insane
- The loss of skilled, non-Death Eater labour harms the economy
- The genetic defects from centuries of inbreeding is gradually killing them off.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Grow Young With Me; Renascentia; Negligentia; Black Luminary; The Merging; Prince of the Dark Kingdom; 11160991; 9666689) are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head. Completion statuses are as follows:

- Accidental Horcrux is complete with an abandoned sequel
- Grow Young With Me updates very slowly, but is always worth the wait
- Renascentia is complete, as, I believe, is its sequel *edit: turns out its sequel /isn't/ complete, after all*
- Negligentia is a long one shot with a pair of sequels that I honestly don't recommend
- I feel like Black Luminary hasn't updated in a while, but I also haven't been on the lookout, since I decided to wait for the third year to finish before going back to it
- The Merging is one chapter and two epilogues away from completion, but hasn't updated in over a year, but it's gone longer than that between updates before, so I'm not worried
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom is straight up dead, as is Rent a Hero
- A Beautiful Collision hasn't updated in years, but the author has said they might go back to it someday, and they're still active on the site.

Bonus anti recommendation even though no one asked: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is often praised for its worldbuilding, but because the writer is dreadful at writing organic exposition, it's presented by having characters talk unnaturally at each other about history and politics in way more detail than anybody ever gives in casual conversation.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off.

** I think the mods should consider putting up a sticky called "Favorite Fics of HPFANFICTION".

--------------

For this type of requests, I like to link the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/htmlview?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][list of most recommended fics]] on this sub from 2011 to 2018, and [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/][the HPFanfiction Recommender]] that lets you search for more recent popular fics and authors.

Among the Top 20, my personal favorites are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is obviously the most popular one by a wide margin. This ‘Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but he only wants to teach DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my favorite postwar fic. Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is a dark war epic set in an extreme AU. It's one of the very few fics that has Harry raised by his own parents, but he actually turns out to be a lot more vicious than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is Harry time travel to 1975. He teams up with Bellatrix and changes a lot of things. This Harry is war hardened veteran, and Bellatrix, despite following Harry, is by no means a paragon of virtue. But it's fun watching her in action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is another long war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is a dimensional travel. Here, badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new world where things have become very different. They are not particularly dark, but they kill Death Eaters without blinking their eyes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is a major AU in which Harry was raised by Sirius in France. He went to Beauxbaton along with Neville and the Weasleys, and was personally taught by Dumbledore there. In 1999, Ron volunteers to go spying in Britain, where he meets a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Hermione.

--------------

Here are some newer fics, finished after 2017 and thus not making it to the top 20:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], linkffn(13133746): One of the best Harry/Daphne fics, no bashing, no power fantasies, great characterizations, and a very adorable Astoria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary][Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary]], linkffn(12407442): Luna got the Diary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): Probably the best canon compliant postwar fic. It depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, and quite unique as it's narrated from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][The House of Potter Rebuilt]], linkffn(11933512): An unique indy!Harry fic with a quite original plot. The "House" here actually means an actual building.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

*** Top 5 Summaries:

1. Meaning of One is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.
2. Before I read, Meaning of One, Nightmares of Futures Past was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.
3. Harry is a Dragon, was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.
4. This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.
5. I love the concept of Forced Maturity. It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.

#+begin_quote
  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday.

Akira Kurusu returns home and awakens in the Velvet Room with an offer to sit at the board, to play the game not as a pawn, but as a player.

You were working with him today.” He swallowed and shook his head in bewilderment. “He -- didn't say anything to me. We barely spoke, to be honest,” he explained faintly. Was this because of Morgana? He seemed unusually spooked when he saw him, was he maybe afraid of cats? No, Morgana said that sometimes Potsu fed him in the back alley when he was on break and the cat was stretching his legs.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817/chapters/36799368][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] linkao3(15809817) Remus/Sirius, post-Deathly Hallows, AU where they both survive the War. A really interesting take on their relationship and how the wizarding world dealt with the aftermath of a brutal war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]] linkao3(3171550) Harry/Draco, post-Deathly Hallows. Draco has gone missing, and Harry is the Auror assigned to find him. Probably the most beautiful slow burn I've ever read. As a result of this fic I can't help myself staring at my husband's wrists when he drives?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6246406/chapters/14311300][Not From Others]] linkao3(6246406) the events of Deathly Hallows from Ginny's point of view, canon-compliant. I normally go for AUs/alternate takes, but this is where I go for a canon-compliant fix. I recommend the author's one-shots and missing Hogwarts moments too!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16405130/chapters/38403062][Grow Young with Me]] linkao3(16405130) not completed, but recently updated! Harry/OC, post-Deathly Hallows. I love stories with original muggle characters, and this is by far my favourite. The most recent chapter made my heart SING.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

Redeemed Dudley, Harry is a good parent and much Snape history needs to be researched.

flamethrower: Of a Linear Circle [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]]\\
Snape makes friends with a portrait in the Slytherin Common room, and the rest is history. Also because of unconventional means of time travel. The story has slash on it, but that's not the main point of interest about it. Instead, it has an extremely well-researched history from the times of Founders and a very bad arse defence against the dark arts professor.

The Green Girl linkffn(11027125) is one of my favorites to reread. It's just plain fun!

The same goes for Harry Potter and the Connection Reversed linkffn(9132770).
