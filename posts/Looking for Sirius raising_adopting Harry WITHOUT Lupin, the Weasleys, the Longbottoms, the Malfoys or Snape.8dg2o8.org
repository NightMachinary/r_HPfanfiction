It feels like every "Harry is raised/adopted by Sirius" story has either Lupin and Marauder wank or the Weasleys/Longbottoms in them. And the remaining few either have some weird Malfoy interactions where everyone hates Lucius and yet they are hanging out together or for some reason Snape in them.

I don't particularly care where this story starts, could be childhood or after the 3rd year, but I want to read something different from the usual fare. Please, no slash or Ron/Hermione in the background.


** linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox) is exactly like you specify. The reason all those people you don't want to see in the story are not present there is because Sirius and Harry live outside of Britain, which might or might not be your cup of tea.

If you want to avoid Hermione and Ron altogether, you might want to not read the rest of the trilogy, though.

*** I don't mind them as characters, I quite like canon "let's lead Umbridge in a rape train" Hermione, but that pairing... Let's just say that my suspension of disbelief has more issues with that ship than with magic and I really do not like reading it for a variety of reasons.

**** Ah. I misread the Ron/Hermione pairing for Ron and Hermione characters.

The main pairing in the trilogy is HHr, but that's really in the (very long) epilogue to book 3.

** I don't think it's something /you'd/ like, based on what I've seen you request before, but other people following the thread might like this. I don't think the Weasley family will be featured in it and Lupin had no part in Harry's raising, either. Oh and Snape is an actual Death Eater. There's minor hints of Harry (if you can even call him that) x Lisa Turpin, but since it takes place in 3rd year, there's no romance. Pretty much completely AU.

... Although I should warn you that it's Sirius x Narcissa.

** Well, without Lupin is a bit hard, only 2 comes to mind, and they're both quite similar in the "raising" part. linkffn(The Last of the Peverells; The Green in the Gray)

If you can stomach a Lupin, there's another one called linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) though this has genderbend mid-way through (but not done in a stupid way, its actually quite nice).

If you can stomach Lupin and Lily (meaning, only James died) there's a couple more, linkffn(The Return of the Marauder's; Ilvermorny's Champion)

  This story is about the developing relationship between Beast Boy and Raven. Told chiefly from Raven's point of view, it will also address her relationships with the other members of her team, as Raven strives to grow beyond her heritage and become a fully rounded human being. Not all chapters will be suitable for minors. Rated M for adult themes and some graphic violence.

***** The author of "Ilvermorney" writes superb smut (at least his recent work is good in that regard, the older ones have issues), but his plotlines and politics are questionable. And, perhaps his biggest issue, he doesn't get things moving. I mean, "The free use experience" for example is mostly about sex, and the sex scenes are some of the best I have read, but it gets bogged down in side plots and even more side plots. His other works are even worse in that regard (I vaguely remember that his time-travel Harry/Ginny one took a million words to cover the first four books, which is as much as Rowling used for the entire series).

**** I couldn't slog through chapter 1 of Son of Potter, he is so OOC. He doesn't even defend Ron or Hermione with a single word when Sirius bashes him.

Yes, Sirius is his godfather, but at that point he spoke to him for a few hours, tops.

And suddenly Sirius launches into a big exposition without telling us (or Harry) why we should care. This would have been so easy to improve, too.

Just have Sirius say "I know it's boring, but hear me out - this will get me freed," and it would have made so much more sense.

Of course, you don't have to agree with me, but that story was simply not for me and had too many issues in the first few pages that would have been discovered by a good beta.
