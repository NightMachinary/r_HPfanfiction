Looking for fics that involve a prank war between Harry and the Weasley Twins.


** Well, pureblood pretense has some interesting prank wars later on(probably in second or third book), but it's by no means a main part of the story. Also the characterization of the twins in this story is the best, that I've personally came across. Here's a first part Linkffn(pureblood pretense)
