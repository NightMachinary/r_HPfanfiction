I can't imagine there are a lot of them, but for some reason I love the idea of Hamilton/Harry Potter crossover fics, possibly because I read "Stay Alive Till This Horror Show Has Passed" Linkffn(12033002) and really liked it. That particular story basically has the Hamilton crew at Hogwarts during the 97-98 school year, and focuses much more on the world of Hogwarts than the HP characters. I'm not picky about the recommendations, it could be characters from one in the world of the other, stories where the characters actually interact, whatever, I'm just interested to see what sort of ideas people have come up with. Thanks!
