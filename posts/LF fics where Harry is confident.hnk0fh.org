I don't mean ‘lord of a dozen houses I am a jackass who rants at his enemies and has a massive slave harem' no I mean he comes away from his adventures with a modicum of self esteem so he doesn't just try to wave away his accomplishments and he also isn't completely dependent on others for emotional support like a normal person. But at the same time isn't a complete dick

Before people start complaining about this, this request comes from the fact that canon and most fics ignore the affect his childhood had on him and show him as well adjusted, I want fics that are along the same vain but with a more confident Harry

The merging is a good example of this as well as ‘surroundings'


** Sorry, what does LF mean?

** I think linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) has an appropriate level of confidence from your request. linkffn(Three black birds) probably as well.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.
