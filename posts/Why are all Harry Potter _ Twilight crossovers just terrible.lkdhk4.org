Seriously joking aside why do they always make Harry so damn pouty ?

**** I would be interested in reading that.

Harry has to face the fact that Bella doesn't disagree with Voldemort's aims (immortality), only his methods (sacrificial murder). Bella can't understand why everyone doesn't collect the bones of their fathers, blood of their enemies, and flesh (a skin sample should do) from anyone who serves them, just in case they become useful. Obliviation becomes an offence worthy of Azkaban unless done with consent. And blood purism gets scientifically studied to determine whether there is actually a quantitative or qualitative difference between fresh vs generational magic.

** I read one once with the premise that Bella is a muggleborn witch that got sent to Hogwarts and fled to Forks during the whole Umbridge's Muggleborn Registration brouhaha. So the events of Twilight still happened but it added a depth to her character. Had some interesting world building with the Volturi. I wouldn't call it terrible, but it certainly wasn't the best thing I read.

  Voldemort has taken over Wizarding Britain, and muggleborn Bella Swan has fled England to live with her father in America. Unable to use magic and in constant fear of being found and thrown in Azkaban- or worse, Bella doesn't have time for romance, despite how drawn she is to the handsome vampire she sits next to in Biology.

** I think the clue lies in the demographic for the Twilight series.

Emo teenage girls are, almost by definition, pouty. So, they write their main character (Harry) in a way they can relate to - they make him the poutiest pouter to ever pout.

They also don't tend to have well-developed writing skills, to say the least. Hence, badly written drivel.

In either case, maybe - with the caveat of probably being less "so bad it's hilarious".

EDIT: Googling reveals that you're referring to My Immortal, in which case no - if only because My Immortal is a /funny/ kind of bad, these fics just tend to be the "I wish I'd never read this" kind of bad.

She's stupid, selfish, stubborn. Many negative traits, no real positives. I've read the books and watched the movies. Both are terrible.

I feel bad for Edward (The vampire she falls in love with). He at the very least tries to keep her away, but her dumbass is just so enamored by him. Which ends up causing huge problems for Edward and his family.
