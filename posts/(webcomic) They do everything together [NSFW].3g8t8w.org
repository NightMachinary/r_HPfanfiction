** Odd. Odd, but not surprising. In a world with transfiguration, pensieves and polyjuice, there is a startling lack of clever use of these in fics. Certainly far less than I'd expect to see in a realistic setting.

I think I've seen selling the hair of famous people for polyjuice purposes done at times. And Draco getting it on with a Hermione flavored hooker. Right. Still, it'd be great to see writers tackle the more nefarious uses of magical tools.

*** There was a [[/r/FanTheories][/r/FanTheory]] there somewhere, according to which the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Aged_witch][aged witch]] was selling the nails to switch and bewitch.

#+begin_quote
  An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do.

  “Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear, making him jump.

  An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away.

  “I'm fine, thanks,” he said. “I'm just---”

  “HARRY! What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?”

  Harry's heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard.

There was another one saying that Voldemort was purposefully hairless so no one could easily impersonate him via hair-polyjuice.

  In the afternoon of 10 August, 1992, this witch was in Knockturn Alley, carrying a tray of what appeared to be whole human fingernails; it is possible she planned to sell them. She witnessed Harry Potter wandering Knockturn Alley, staring anxiously around and clutching his broken glasses tightly to his face. Seeing his distress, she asked him if he was lost, only frightening him by her leer. Rubeus Hagrid soon arrived, having planned to buy some Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent, although his plans were forgotten when he saw Harry with the witch. His arrival, combined with his prodigious size, scared her and caused her to drop most of the fingernails, at which point she cursed.

*** I've read one where Hermione acting as a spy I think used polyjuice to appear as a prostitute to get into where the death eaters were staying. One of the few I've come across to use polyjuice repeatedly instead of just minor disguise charms. (Don't recall which story, I'd have to dig to find it)

** Two words: polyjuice parties. There'd be a lot of craziness and drama at those. Imagine finding out that the person you slept with turned out to be someone you don't like.

*** I always thought those kinds of ideas effectively lead to some kind of rape. Of either the person under the influence of polyjuice potion or the person they're at the party with. Just think about it. People poly-juicing themselves as other people's SOs...
