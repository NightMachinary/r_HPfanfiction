Let me first preface this by saying I didn't like it, but I REALLY want to like it. I've been looking for a good Marauders fic for so so long. I've read the first chapter.

It's so poorly written, it seems like it's been translated from a different language or something. Has it? It makes no sense to me. It's vaguely reminiscent those "R4nD0m!1!" /holds up spork/" fics from like 2006-8ish, if you know what I mean.

Does it get better? Is it the sort of thing I should stick at reading?

I hate the way that Remus and Sirius are so different to how they appeared in the little snippets you see of them in canon. I don't think either of them would ever write to each other saying things like "HELLO my good sir, hahaha. Oh wait. Stop. James is eating a biscuit!!! GREAT SCOTT Moony you need to ride the motorbike haha!!!". It just feels forced and unnatural to me.

I guess I just wanted to vent because it's not what I thought it would be at all. I think I might need some encouragement to continue reading, if it is worth continuing.

Can we discuss?


** Marauder fics, in my opinion, live and die with the dialouges. The dialouges in this suck. Big times.

nuff said.

*** I 100% agree. I don't think I've ever read one where they seem... Believable. One of my favourites (although it's not a very serious fic and I've never heard anyone mention it on here, which leads me to think that it isn't very popular?) is Match. by mental. It's not exactly believable and nor are the characters really as I would expect but I do think the dialogue is a perfect example of blokey british humour haha!

Don't suppose you have any recommendations for me do you?

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

**** Oh man, there's a fic I never thought I'd see mentioned here. Totally aimless but written so well. Still love it when I reread parts of it. Too bad it never finished :( It was SUPER popular back in 2008ish (Top 10 on HPFF) but the original version got taken down, and she wasn't active at that point anymore, anyway.

**** Against the Moon is excellent, though it's young marauders and it's long as hell.

The Life and Times is recommended really frequently here, and while it's not bad, I actually like [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewuser.php?uid=46901][I'll Pick You Up]] by MagEd.

** The problem with SBP is it was /the definitive/ Marauders fic for so long that it influenced /so much/ fic that came after it... and so there are huge swathes of fic that are horrifically out of character because they springboarded off of SBP.

As to whether you should keep going, depends how far in you are. If it's more than 10k I'd drop it, probably.

*** I don't think I'm going to continue. It seems /okay/ in parts but, it's just not my thing. Yeah it's very reminiscent of the fics that were abundant when I was younger, seem to have coincided with everyone being a "scene kid" and "random"

** The SBP was written way back in 2004, and has not aged well.

It was basically the fic that launched 1000 head canons. It looks positively mediocre now, because so many authors read it and were influenced by it.

It's like looking at a 16th century painting and going, "That baby has the face of an adult and the proportions of an alien. This is a terrible painting." You're not wrong, but it was a landmark piece at the time and it influenced a lot of other works.

** I read most of it in a long train trip and I liked it but I had no desire to continue reading it when I got home. It's fun but, as you mention, the characterization is weird and in the end I couldn't reconcile that version of the Marauders with what we have read in the books. It's very... /headcanon-y/ I think, which would explain its popularity.

** Hilariously this is one of the only Marauders fanfictions that I haven't read. Though not due to any conscious avoidance of it, merely ignorance. But from those choice quotes it sounds terrible.

** It definitely improves - I think the authors are much better at drama than they are at humour, and the fic matures, and becomes a collection of much more interesting character studies, as it gets closer to wartime. However, if you don't like the humour, it's not worth it.

** I quite enjoyed SBP. It's the reason I started shipping Wolfstar at all. 100% conversion. Read most of it on a plane ride to LeakyCon/in line at Wizarding World of Harry Potter, so it felt extra special. A lot of what people are saying is true, though. It hasn't aged very well.

I say go ahead and read it. I didn't like some parts of it (e.g. Prewett brothers worshiping, the beach??), but it's like reading a little bit of fanfiction history. I was 12 when I first started reading/writing fanfiction, so it definitely feels like a blast from the past (a lot of stories were like that back then). Wish I had read it when I was younger. So, if you want to waste a couple hours learning about the origins of Marauder tropes and the birth of Wolfstar, go for it. You wouldn't miss too much if you dropped it though. The thing with Marauder stories is that it's the same story over and over...

...and yet, I can't stop reading them.

** It's a shame you didn't like it. I really enjoyed it. I think that it definitely improves in the later chapters.

Try reading the Hallowe'en chapter in seventh year.
