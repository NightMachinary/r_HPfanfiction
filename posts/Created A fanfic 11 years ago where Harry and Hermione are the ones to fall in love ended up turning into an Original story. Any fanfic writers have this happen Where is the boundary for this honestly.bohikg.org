I started essentially 'fixing' the plot and world building of HP then adding on stuff to make it more dramatic and before I knew it, it became unrecognisable.

Essentially Voldermort is Harry's dad. Harry lives in an orphanage, granted he's still abused. Harry is super powerful but can't control it and his powers make him go coo-coo. Magic is a lot more rigid and structured with actual rules. The curriculum is much more straightforward. Dumbledore can't actually beat Voldermort. Malfoy is smarter and more of a pain and becomes friends with Harry in the end. Harry still has relatives, evil relatives but yeah direct relatives.

I felt that it would be dumb to keep calling it fanfiction so I changed all the names.

I really want to know where the boundary is for fanfiction and basically an original story using a popular name.


** There are two major authors whose stories are basically 'fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off'. Cassandra Clare and E.L James.

So it's doable. Where it stands ethically is up to you. Also, unless you've published the fanfic, you probably won't get laughed at quite so much (you can still find copies of Cassandra Clare's Draco Trilogy and...whatever the fuck it was E L James wrote)

+also unless you changed the setting as well, Britain does not have orphanages, dating as far back as the 70's+

*** E.L. James wrote [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Universe]["Master of the Universe"]] under the penname Snowqueen Icedragon.

Another example of fanfic turning mainstream is the movie [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_(2019_film]["After"]]) starring Hero Fiennes Tiffin, the actor who played young Tom Riddle from HBP as an expy of Harry Styles from a Wattpad One Direction fanfic. The serial number filing was so bad that the re-named character is "Hardin Scott".

The boundary is having enough differences that someone is willing to pay for the rights to it without fear of being sued. For written fiction, name and setting changes is usually enough.

**** Thanks. I've already changed the names. Setting is pretty much the same though. The whole story is however way too different from the original canon I decided to make it my own original story.

** I never actually wrote it, but the line for me was when I was when the story stood well enough on its own to be its own story, rather than one that fit in fan fiction. At what point does it take more work to explain "It's Harry Potter, except..." than it is to write it as your own thing?

For me, it helped that mine was a massive chimera of a multicross.

*** Yeah I think it'll be far more work to explain it as HP honestly. Its plot is so complicated and so far from the HP world. I was going to use alternate realities to do that but I managed to make it more of a plot device.

** I've got one like that, albeit not in the HP fandom. It's a Viking mythological fantasy story that started as a Supernatural fan fiction that explains how the archangel Gabriel became Loki (canon as since explained how that happens but I wrote it before).

​

If you're not already familiar with Supernatural, there's absolutely no way you can tell it's a fan fiction because the setting and 80% of the characters are original. Even Gabriel, despite being one of the main characters, and other canon characters being easily be reworked because the setting allows for supernatural creatures, gods and what-not. Or I can very easily remove them from the story altogether because they're not essential to the plot and are more observers to the original characters' story with their own side-plot that doesn't affect the main story at all.

​

It kind of work as an origin story fan fiction, but it works much better as an original work. And I'm more interested in working on it as an original work, which is why I'm doing it.
