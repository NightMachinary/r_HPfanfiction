Several years ago, I found a what I thought to be at the time - beautiful - short story set just before Tom Riddle became Voldemort.

It's in two parts, One where the child Tom rips a bird's throat open trying to understand it's singing voice. The second is when a recently graduated girl (Rose?) muses on her relationship with Tom Riddle, realizing that though there had been hard times, their love would get through it.

It ends with a newly named Lord Voldemort killing his girlfriend and taking her heart out, attempting to analyse how such a thing as love would be possible.
