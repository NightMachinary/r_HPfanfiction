So recently I have seen plenty of posts about Daphne and Hinny hating and all that, and I wanted to state my point.

Before I do, let me set my stance, so people can prepare their argument to call me on my bias and all that. I'm a Canon supporter in everything except on Avatar the Last Airbender (where I don't see Kataang lasting long). In HP, I must say, that keeping straight to the written works, I don't see how Canon pairings wouldn't work.

I stand with Romione and Hinny, but I understand why people complain. Romione argued all the time while Ginny is a Mary Sue. But still, I don't see the alternatives as valid.

---

On Romione, this article puts out the points of view better than I could: [[https://www.quora.com/If-Hermione-Granger-had-married-Harry-Potter-would-she-have-been-unhappy-Would-she-have-felt-unfulfilled-living-in-the-shadow-of-a-more-famous-but-lesser-skilled-wizard/answer/Sahil-Juneja-1]]

---

On Hinny, I think she's perfect for Harry. I don't think that people argue about this perse. I mean, it is obvious Ginny is perfect for Harry. Common interests, sassy, pretty... She is simple about things, which Harry needs since he is complicated enough for the two of them. Quidditch and the Weasleys are perfect for a sense for the need of belonging to Harry as well. Also Ginny has an emotional maturity that Harry craves, especially at the point in his life when he develops feeling for her. She is blunt and puts Harry's feet on the ground without being meaner or sweeter than she needs. Hermione on the other hand would try to be careful with her words, and many times she didn't get to Harry because of it.

What's the problem with Hinny then? Ginny is too much of a Mary Sue. How did she become so confident when she was so shy? How did she become so emotionally strong after the Chamber? All those questions... probably what we missed was more development.

Maybe what we needed was to have Ginny Weasley develop more slowly and some other new character to take the role of HBP Ginny and Harry's love interest. Though then, you would miss that extra layer of marrying into the Weasleys... which resonates with Harry's need for belonging and the Weasley family. Maybe what we needed was someone else to be the girl in the Chamber and have HBP Ginny to be the real Ginny all along... But then we miss that common experience of Harry/Ginny with Tom Riddle.

I guess that the best answer would have been to have more development for Ginny, to help smooth transition her character. This was tough since she is in another year than Harry, they don't spend much time together, and book 5 was long enough as it was.

---

On other pairings. I don't support pairings that didn't seem like they had worked based on the books. Like Pansy (like why?)... or even Hermione (more on the above article, but yeah, Harry never gave any signs of looking at her as a woman). Even so, I can see Daphne working, since she is a clean slate and people can do with her as they want to. In good Haphne fics, the sense of belonging of Harry is switched from Quidditch to putting Daphne as frowned upon in her own house, as Harry is by the whole school... gives them something to relate to that is not hate for marriage contracts. Even so, sometimes to make Haphne work, they do tend to lower down a notch on Harry's temper and impulsiveness. Maybe this could happen, but fics seem to do it a bit too quickly.

---

Another important thing which people seemed to overlook a lot is POV. The entire series is from Harry's POV, so we missed all of Ron/Hermione alone conversations and Ginny development. So some things people bash about canon pairings wouldn't stand if we had had a glimpse at those hidden conversations. Just imagine the following conversations:

- Every meaningful thing with Ginny in POA, GOF and OOTP... she discussing the diary and going to grow based on that experience. SOme fics do it, but they have Harry involved... I think a Harryless development on her own with conversations with Bill and such would have made sense. Still a conversation with Harry on OOTP where they bond over a long period of time over the diary, Voldemort's return and the sort would have done wonders.

- A conversation of Romione in GOF, where Hermione confronts Ron about not backing Harry. Then, she realizing how it affects his sense of inferiority and truly understanding that, for Hermione has a insecurities of her own. Imagine following that with Ron deciding that it was him who needed to take the first step towards reconciliation. A non-romantic conversation that would have done wonders to the Romione non-believers.

- A scene in HBP where Hermione realizes that even if Ron scored no good points by jumping to Lavender, Hermione did pretty of wrong too. I mean, she did invite him to the party and didn't clarify that as a date, though that's not the real issue. The thing was her distrust, her reaction, her hypocrisy at the game to some extend for she cheated as well to get Ron through the tryouts... More importantly, the ability to recognize the jealousy and the fact that Ron did had the right to date whoever he wanted. Granted, it pulled him away from a romantic relationship with her, but it didn't have to affect their friendship.

​

I think that's all... I'm embracing myself for the angry arguments coming. Canon guardian out!


** I definitely don't care about ships - so long as they meet the verisimilitude of whatever fic I'm reading at the time, I'll read whatever.

Though I am slightly baffled by your last point there. You seem to be saying that if the canon ships were developed in canon so they actually worked and felt right, then people wouldn't bash them. Like the thing that would make Romione and Hinny work is fanon adding in more scenes to canon to actually develop those relationships properly. I'm sure I'm reading that wrong, but I honestly can't work out what else you might mean by all of that. "All of those things that Rowling didn't write and we didn't see, that's what makes those relationships work!"

How do you not see alternatives as valid when the alternatives generally add on to make them valid. The alternative pairs are doing what you claim should be done for canon paring.

Adding parts to make the pairings better than canon portrayal which is your argument when you say "And, if some parts weren't left out, maybe more people would think so." You're making assumption about parts that are left out, whereas other ff writers are also making assumptions and showing it in their work instead.

***** There are parts that can be filled, but others would go as canon. For example, Daphne is a clean slate and we can do whatever with her... But Harry and Hermione are not. It is more difficult IMO to make a Harry/Hermione work, staying true to characters in canon than Daphne. And even Daphne has her limitations, since for example we know she does not play Quidditch.

Why? Canon-compliant up to pre-Ron/Hermione kissing can definitely have Harry/Hermione pair working. We see things from a very limited Harry POV. There could have just been off-screen interactions that play towards that pairing too that just happened to not make it into the book because of the way the plots were structured, which is little to no romance other than to drive the conflict. That is the assumption you are making about canon pairings.

******* The thing is, we are in Harry's head. And we never a single romantic thought of Harry towards Hermione. Not the slightest discomfort that she is with Krum for example. He doesn't care about Hermione romantically as he clearly does about Cho and Ginny. The thing that the article gets right of all, is that there was never a spark between them. All the qualities of pro Harry/Hermione relationship are one of friendship, and going against that is also another nail in pro of men are women can't be friends.

People can have all the dialogues and scenes from the books and have Harry/Hermione... I mean it is fanfiction, they can do whatever they want. But to me, when I read something clearly against Harry's thoughts in the books, that's AU... even if you keep the dialogues the same.

Again that was answered.... "There could have just been off-screen interactions that play towards that pairing too that just happened to not make it into the book because of the way the plots were structured, which is little to no romance other than to drive the conflict."

There was little romance other than to drive the plot. You're using the completed works to argue your point. I'm saying you can go canon-compliant up to a lot of points and add in different scenes to create your own romance. That doesn't make it not canon-complaint up to that point.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't care about Hermione romantically as he clearly does about Cho and Ginny.
#+end_quote

So what? He is 11-17 in the books. You can have little moments of friendship and then a switch occurs where you realize it is romantic. It doesn't have to start off romantic like it does with Cho and Ginny.

Also I don't know how true this is. We may not hear of his romantic thoughts for whatever reason (doesn't help the plot), but there are other's who comment on his relationship with Hermione and that has to give you pause that there may be romantic like interactions between them. You can have men/women friendships without giving off that vibe to other people, it does happen. So the fact that others are commenting on it should give you some pause.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well that's full on bull. You are choosing to read the interaction as just friends, which is fine. But to discount that it could be read as slightly more than friends is choosing to be blind to another viewpoint.

I could say the same thing about Ron "All the qualities of pro Ron/Hermione relationship are one of friendship, and going against that is also another nail in pro of men are women can't be friends."

You cannot say I have to objectively read their interactions as romance pre-kiss. If you take away the kiss, you can read their interaction as just friends as well. Hell you could even handwave away the kiss as adrenaline, and there is a basis for that. I'm not saying that the pairing works or doesn't work. I'm just saying that you are using the kiss to justify absolutely everything, which isn't the point unless it is only complete DH compliant fanfic you're reading.

#+end_quote

That's fair. I don't argue against that. Except that isn't what you said. You said "I don't see the alternatives as valid" which is invalidating every other non-canon main(edited in) pairing as a working pairing.

This is the last message because you're just choosing to dig your heels in now on the concept that Harry/Hermione is invalid, while discounting that you are bias in reading their interaction. You are taking a conclusion and using the narrative to suit that conclusion, and it doesn't appear you are willing to acknowledge that the narrative can be read differently, leading to different conclusions.

********* About the excerpts, put my answer to those after in an edit on the previous comment.

Ron/Hermione had interactions that hinted to that attraction way back than the kiss. Without a doubt, starting at the Ball. About their qualities, is not in the vein of who had more qualities than the other. The thing is Ron's qualities are set as a way to fit with Hermione's personality. Ron is a total prat at times and can dismiss Hermione's point of view all the time, but he goes back to her and validates Hermione's point of view with her. Ron listens to Hermione and when he says Hermione was right is because he truly means it. Harry plenty of times in the books just bubbles up while Hermione is trying to get to him with arguments that he just chooses just not to listen to. To say something.

Harry has other qualities, as I have said, he is selfless. And that's a good quality, but I mean, that's a good quality that could work to pair him up to anyone, not Hermione in particular. Harry is just the guy who would risk his and Hermione's life to save anyone, because he just had to save everyone. Ron wouldn't.

Not saying that you can't go canon-compliant up until a point. BUt you would have to do tons of work. Some on lowering Ron/Hermione if you go after the Ball, but some people are just fond of making Hermione so proud that he would never forgive Ron and just shut her off her life after it (which does happened in a bunch of fics). But I think they would have to change how Harry approaches romance. if they do book 4, there has to be a way to change Harry's feelings and explain how he just had zero interest in her up to a point.

Look at our 2 canon examples. Cho, Harry hadn't really seen her before so it was kind of crush on sight thing. Physical and Quidditch. There's a spark. GInny, he did know, but not HBP GInny, who did like a 180 from book2. There was an instant spark there as well, based on personality more than physical.

The thing is, if you spend already 4 years next to this person without a spark, then you can't go spark suddenly. It would probably have to be a more gradual thing, which kind of goes different to what we know of Harry approach to romance in the books. Then, the internet is filled of Harry/Hermione fics when they fall in love the moment Ron doesn't believe Harry in GOF and it is if they had been in love forever and all that weird stuff.

I've tried reading Harry/Hemrione fics but they don't feel as real. They feel more like a rehearsed romance movie, with super understanding and suddenly corny-romantic Harry. They try to go 180 from Ron and say Harry/Hermione always agree on everything.

And I think I'm going to stop this thread here, for I have a chapter to publish and I and can't keep arguing here forever when it is clear we are not getting anywhere.

Nice ranting with you, fine sir.

#+end_quote

You 100% can, you forget they start at 11. You can be friends at 11 and really get romantic feelings AFTER, even after 3-4 years. That's kinda how it can works around that age. It doesn't take a huge character change to work.

#+begin_quote
  I've tried reading Harry/Hemrione fics but they don't feel as real.

Fair. I've never argued you can't dislike the pairing. I just take offense to the not seeing them as valid, which is a very bold claim.

#+begin_quote
  it is clear we are not getting anywhere.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure we are on the same page that Ron isn't a bad match for Hermione or that Ron isn't a bad person. You seem to be under the impression that I think Harry is better for Hermione. I am not making any of those arguments. I am merely arguing to not downplay Harry's character growth and traits, while overstating Ron's which you and the quora answer do, and that there are moments in the story that are not objectively read as just friendship.

We aren't getting anywhere imo because there isn't anywhere for me to go. I'm open to Ron/Hermione. I am not open to the idea that Ron objectively acted better and overplay his strengths while downplaying another's. I am also not open to saying objectively there is no spark.

If you want to overstate Ron's character and overlook the flaw (you in the general sense), that is fine, just don't compare it against another character WHILE downplaying that other character's same traits.

I think you have good arguments, I am merely saying you should be more open minded and that Harry/Hermione can be valid and be canon complaint, even if you don't feel like it is a real pairing.

From the other message

#+begin_quote
  Hold it against him? So you favor grudges?
#+end_quote

No. Holding it against someone doesn't just mean holding a grudge. Forgive but don't forget is a very real thing and is what I mean by holding it against someone. You can understand how someone reacts, but not like how and why the react that way. It doesn't make it a grudge. It is making them accountable.

It's a good time to end because now it's just going to get into philosphy rather than HP

#+begin_quote

It's relative really. Where did Ron had a chance to prove himself? Classwork? He didn't thought he would be better than Hermione in any class. Quidditch? He didn't thought he could outshine Harry. Anywhere else? Harry and Hermione were always with them. Ron's inferiority complex is not only the complex itself, but the fact that he can't seem to stand on his own and stay next to the persons he likes in the first place. The attention Ron got after the 2nd task, which was certainly smaller than Harry's, was after the conflict the paragraph is talking about happened and it was resolved.

Obviously the 2nd task helped for a while, but he was not going to make a name for himself based on that thing.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think you're missing the point here. Yes Harry helped with the locket, which was important. And he told him he saw Hermione as a sister, which I really don't think made much of a difference at this point. The writer is talking about the decision to go backend confront Harry and Hermione.

Yes, Ron did wrong under the locket influence whatever. But both Harry and Ron said hurtful things. And Ron was the guy who seemed them.

Yes, people can say that Harry was the offended party in both GOF and DH. But he could have done better, he could have started the contact and conversation to make peace in GOF. It would have been certainly easy for Ron to not return, especially since he might have thought more than once that they were not going to forgive him. Yet he did.

****** On average, Hermione was poor with handling situations appropriately.

- PoA: Lavender; Scabbers; being a tattle; being rude because she overworked herself; insulting Trelawney because she disagreed

- OotP: Luna, insulting Luna because she disagreed

- HBP: treatment of Fleur, Lavender, and Ron because of jealousy. Using Cormac to get back at Ron.

- DH: attacking Ron when he returned

And outside personal issues she was terrible in stressful situations.

I never said Harry exploded. It's a poor example to use because not only does JKR have Harry examine his feelings, she has him stamp down his jealousy. To contrast that with GoF Ron, who took an entire month to get over himself, makes it worse.

It wasn't Harry's responsibility to soothe Ron's jealousy or make contact.

******* About Harry's jealousy in OotP... it is not a one thing stuff. The prefect thing and other stuff related to Dumbledore appreciating other people instead of him carried throught OotP. He was at Hermione and Ron's throats for some time there.

As I say we miss a lot for the one POV thing... in GOF. Ron had wanted to talk to Harry before some time before he approached him, yet he didn't know how. How long before, we don't know. Yet he did.

Was it Harry's responsibility to soothe Ron, No. But a more mature person would have understand that from a friend he had spend over 3 years with. Harry didn't need to recognize any guilt, but it didn't cost him anything to talk with Ron and put things over the table, especially whe he is supposed to value his friendship so much. And he didn't. For one month. I imagine an adult Harry would have acted differently, but 4th year Harry was more proud about being right, than humble.

It was part of it. But there was jealousy about other people having a more important role than he did. The jealousy of the prefect thing didn't evaporated in a minutes, it came back to his mind from time to time. Harry also thought that he should be prefect not Ron. Harry thought that he should know things before many of the other people, that he had more right.

A dragon has nothing to do with valuing friendships. It was not his fault, but it was within his power to stop. And he didn't try. As I said, a more mature person would have tried, fault or not.

#+end_quote

Hermione does feel ignored. Not by her parents, but by classmates. Even Harry and Ron when they focus on Quidditch. Even Harry and Ron, both, when they don't talk to her because she told McGonagall about the firebolt. Harry is not a sait. And Hermione is not perfect.

#+end_quote

That's your bias showing. The Dumbledore thing is not jealousy. The Prefect thing was jealous but he deals with it. It's natural to be jealous of a "prestigious" position, but he didn't turn on Ron because of that jealousy.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Except he did have the right. He was chosen (unofficially) as Dumbledore's successor to the war. He should definitely know more of the important stuff or at least be told why he isn't being informed other than "you're a kid, let the adults handle it."

He just saw his classmate get murdered in front of him then had an assassination attempt with dementors, it's definitely justified to want to know a lot more when you're in the thick of things. That isn't a knock on Harry.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They did not claim Hermione doesn't feel ignored, just that it is a different type of ignored. I wouldn't say Ron lived like he was ignored either. I would classify it more as not as well though of compared to his peers/siblings.

I don't think anyone is arguing that Harry is perfect and Ron isn't. But more so that in the link, they downplayed Harry a lot and looked at Ron much more favorably.

I am not saying he doesn't deal with it eventually. But the prefect jealousy is there, and stays on the back of his mind for some time.

Harry is more selfless. He sacrificed himself for people. Ron would sacrifice for Hermione, but not for random people like Harry. To say a quality. However that is not relevant to talk about pairing and it didn't come up.

#+end_quote

He isn't going to think twice about Hermione getting it because it is 1 guy/1 girl who get it. Why would he think about Hermione getting it. The point is it shows Harry dealing with it. While he isn't happy he doesn't get it, he deals with it rather than create a rift over it which is the entire point that was being made. Downplaying Harry dealing with internal issues, while making it seem like Ron was better at dealing with his issues is a critique of the link, and is a valid one because it isn't an objective review of their ability to deal with jealousy or their ability to be introspective.

That isn't a negative on Harry, and if you choose to think so, there's not much else to talk about. Especially because Harry deals with it the way a majority of the people would. Harry literally saw Cedric killed in front of him, had an assassination attempt on his life, and was frozen out by his friends. What else should he have felt? He most certainly should know more than them and while it was more of a happenstance of why they knew more, it doesn't invalidate how Harry, nor a majority of the world would have, felt.

it 100% is their fault they ignored him though and is part of the reason he lashed out. They could have sent him letters through means other than owls. After 4th year Harry saw a classmate murdered, was tortured, saw his parents spirit, fought against Voldemort, and this is all before the dementors. Then his friends don't check up on him? Yea he is right to be pissed and is not a character trait knock. I'm going to guess that most people would be absolutely pissed their friend didn't show concern. I have a difficult time imagining he would have lashed out at them the way he had, had they talked to him throughout the summer, even if they said he couldn't say much until they meet in person because of fear of intercepting letters.

#+begin_quote

I never said he did. I am claiming he acted better than Ron, and objectively that is true. Both had jealous issues and one decided to create a rift for weeks on end.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm not arguing in favor of either match, even if I have my own bias. I am just saying that in the link the same qualities that both Ron and Harry have, are overstated for Ron and underplayed for Harry.

From Harry's POV, it cannot be definitively stated that Ron is a better match. Yes there may have been things happening off screen to make them a better match, but that means that you (general sense) have to create assumptions. Whereas going off baseline and creating no assumptions, Ron/Hermione is not the greatest match; this isn't to say the couldn't be, just that from what we are shown, with no other assumptions it isn't great.

Harry didn't create a rift where he just straight ignored them though. He might have been distant, but that's fair given the way the summer played out for him. Look I'm not saying it was handled the best way. But it is definitely handled better than Ron in GOF.

It is a given, but you don't know how it played out. Before the pairing occurs, it could have gone either way. You're using the fact that the pairing worked out to make assumptions that the conversations were more favorable for the pairing. Any fic that goes canon-complaint up to DH can just as easily not have the pairing and the assumption would be that the off-screen conversations did not play out favorably for the pairing.

It's fine to think Ron/Hermione work, but to completely discount the validity of it not working is just insane because we don't have written work of Ron/Hermione pre-pairing sans Harry.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

So? Because Harry remembers it is his job to be the better person? That isn't how it works. The entire premise that you're arguing for is that the characteristic of how Ron deals with his issue makes him better for Hermione, while discounting how other's handle their issue and how it is so much worse that they handle it the way they do. That isn't a fair viewpoint to have, and the quora answer is completely bias in that regard which is what this entire chain is about.

#+begin_quote
  PS ch 16: Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. "Hermione!" "Harry---you're a great wizard, you know." "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things---friendship and bravery and---oh Harry---be careful!"

  GoF Ch 18: He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione. "Hello," she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. "I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?" "Good idea," said Harry gratefully. They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before.To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question. "Well, of course I knew you hadn't entered yourself," she said when he'd finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. "The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! ...”

  OotP ch 4: He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of of very bushy hair---Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat...

  OotP Ch 9: The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand. ‘Did you---did you get---?” She spotted the badge in Harry's hand and let out a shriek. “I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too, Harry, me too!” “No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron's hand. “It's Ron, not me.” “It---what?” “Ron's prefect, not me,” Harry said. “Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I mean---”

First. Kreacher is not an elf they can see as one they can trust, they are not their master it is Sirius. And even he was okay with sending it, there are plenty of ways in which that plan could just end scaring the crap out of the Dursleys, which can end with other complications. Remember Dobby and Harry getting a notice in 2nd year, they did and surely didn't want to risk something like that happening at a time like 5th year.

The thing is the big rift was caused by Ron, we all know that, and we don't get a chance to see how Harry would have reacted on the other side. Saying "sorry" is not a thing that is comfortable for Harry, for he believes has the high ground usually. The times he realizes he did wrong is more common for him to shrug, look somewhat embarrassed and stop acting like a prat towards the offended party and hope that it is enough for things to go back to normal.

We do know that Ron showed a type of reaction that we never saw Harry take in the books (and here you can argue he didn't have a chance to do in the same scale as Ron, but the simple thing is that he didn't, and was a type of humility we never saw Harry display). Basically Ron was in the wrong for starting it, then he was in the right for owning up and fixing it. Harry was just wrong in not trying to fix it, but the opportunity to be the better man was presented plenty of times and he didn't take it. Ron was there in the common room clearly wanting to talk to him, and Harry just cut it off frowned and went to bed.

People can blame Ron all they want, but the way I see it, this GOF rift is actually a good point for Ron. Because it shows character growth. Because Ron did show maturity after the fact. Because he learned from that and was a better person after the fact.

There was no spark. These are vague excerpts that could have meant any number of things, and people who go for Harry/Hermione based on these, does go AU in the reactions to them.

**** To add to the bit of [[/u/Ash_Lestrange]], especially regarding the Horcrux bit. Think about how fucked up Ron's priorities are in that scene. So he ran out from the other two, literally leaving them 2 against the world (since the order did nothing more than a cosy radio show). He comes back and his biggest worry isn't if Hermione is even alive or well, it is whether Harry stuck his dick in the girl he ran away from.

The Horcrux wanted to make Ron leave, and it could have shown any number of grotesque images, from his mother and sister being gang-raped by a bunch of Death Eaters blaming him ("that's what we do to the families who dare to defy us") to his entire family being brutally murdered by werewolves, literally torn to pieces before being devoured for pretty much the same reason. But no, the Horcrux knows that the most effective way, the thing which would make Ron falter the most, is Harry making out with Hermione.

And that's not even mentioning that Ron left in the first place. Yes, he was influenced by the Horcrux, but so were Harry and Hermione and yet they never left or abandoned their quest. They stayed despite no romantic feelings (that we know of) while Ron left despite having feeling for Hermione (supposedly).

About the locket attacking his anxiety over Harry/Hermione... well it was what it fed on while he wore the locket. The fact the locket didn't show he was afraid if they were alright, is in part because the locket didn't fed from that. Ron did not use the locket after he left. The locket did not know of Ron's fears while he was with Bill.

There are many thing to add to your last statement. You're going for an "amount of love" argument... like "he loved more because he didn't left"... which is weird statement to defend based on evidence. If comparing Harry/Ron... Harry did not choose to stay with Hermione... Harry was already staying, it was Hermione who stayed. And while all of them had used the locket, it was Ron who was wearing it while the argument broke. And as statted, the "it affected me more", is not a simple phrase, the locket really fed on insecurities so it had more success in exploiting Ron.

That's even worse. When he knew nothing was happening AND knew nothing about his family, his worst worry is Harry and Hermione getting together. Like, you are fighting magical Hitler, you witnessed the deportation committee, you are the only real resistance, and his worry is his two friends getting together.

I am not saying that Harry loved her more, canon has no romance between them. I am saying that whatever Ron felt clearly wasn't the real deal since he left.

  Harry was already staying

He could have fucked off to Samoa. Voldemort can't magically track people to find him without any clue (eg the taboo which probably does not work on the other side of the globe)

******* So get your stuff together. You blame him for caring more about the Harry/Hermione than Family. Then you blame him about leaving Harry/Hermione.

If you remember correctly, the reason why he decided to leave, the trigger... Was that he thought Harry didn't care about Ginny being in danger at Hogwarts. Ron was worried about his family, that's what he throws in Harry's face when he leaves, if you remember the dialogue.

And the dialogue was not about Hermione staying and Ron saying he didn't want to stay with her... It was Harry/Ron breaking, one staying and one leaving... Then Ron asking Hermione if she would leave with him... If he was more important than the mission... And Hermione saying no. She is the one that makes the decision. Yeah it was shitty decision to make, but in Ron's Horcrux state of mind, it was Hermione who choose.

So the locket knew about that worry, and yet Harry/Hermione was the chosen projection to break them up. Which contradicts what you said earlier that the locket only knew Rons worry about Harry and Hermione, not about his family.

********* The locket knew all of they anxieties but knew what to use.

If the locket went for "Your family is in danger"... then it was harder to attack the three of them... After all they were on a mission to stop Voldemort... they were supposed to be doing something. Going for that is attacking something that the three of them have in common and could come an understanding.

Attacking with Harry/Hermione makes the more sense. It breaks the three apart... puts distrust in Ron... who sooner or later was going to explode (the problem was he exploding at a time when he fell on snatchers.. by plot convenience)... then the locket knows that Ron breaking with Harry either makes Hermione follow of Hermione stay and cause a rift of some sort between Harry/Hermione. For the locket had seen Harry and Hermione's thoughts too.

And there was a rift of sorts. Harry and Hermione were "not happy after he left" as Ron imagined. they barely talked to each other for long periods of time. Harry feeling guilty, and Hermione knowing it was not Harry's fault perse but couldn't avoid projecting her blame into the situation that happened instead of the person.

****** Your argument shows that Ron is objectively weaker/disloyal than Harry or Hermione. They all took shifts with the locket, but the ginger was the only one to run out on them to go home for a nice meal and a warm bed (wonder what Molly/Arthur's reaction to him abandoning H/Hr was, btw!).

******* You are using the arguments that Harry used in the heat of the moment. Which Ron leaving aside, lets not forget that both used words trying to hurt the other.

Ron doesn't go because he wants a warm meal. He does want one, yet that's not his reason to leave. He leaves because Harry's words made him think that Harry doesn't value GInny or the rest of his family's safety. It is what starts the argument. Here is Ron going throw hell (because he knows the locket is torturing, he recognizes as soon as he takes it away)... and there is Harry brushing away his family's safety as it weren't important. In his eyes, Harry is being disloyal to the Weasleys.

Harry would sacrifice himself for the world, Ron only for those who mattered to him. Harry would put his friends' safety at risk for saving Malfoy. Ron would wonder why Harry couldn't think on his family (their family to a point) before the other families.

You totally went around the point and went for direct meaning of dialogues which were thrown in the heat of the moment, and neither of the two friends meant to say as they said it. If you forget the text, it clearly states Ron wanted to return as soon as he left (the realization of what happened fell on it and he was out of the locket)... and then the whole snatchers came and he went to Bill. Not to his parents.

** Btw, I think there's a good "missing moments" fic out there of Hermione coming on to realize the situation herself after Ron is poisoned and then talks to McGonagall and the to a scarred Lavender after the war. Don't remember what it was called though.
