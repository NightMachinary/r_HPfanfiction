Hello!

I'm tired or reading fics where the MC has Dumbledore as one of his enemies but Dumbledore acts like a fool and never does anything right.

I'm looking for fics where Dumbledore demonstrates that he is really damn old and has a lot of knowledge in magic and politics. That he is an enemy that Voldemort feared. So no getting outplayed by schoolboys trying to be grown ups.

Thanks!


** He is quite difficult to deal with in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]], linkffn(11574569), and he has it out for Harry. Year 1 ended with pretty much a pyrrhic victory for Harry.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
