** [[http://www.dreiser.org/miscfic/crazy.htm][Crazy Little Things]] - Little by little, in her own unusual way, Luna Lovegood begins to romance Hermione Granger.

[[http://www.dreiser.org/miscfic/nodefense.htm][No Defense for you]]/[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4238384/1/][Aucune Defense Pour Toi]] - The new defense against the dark arts teacher arrives at Hogwarts carrying a secret that will change Hermione's life forever.

All found or referenced on [[http://www.dreiser.org/harrypotter.html][the author's site]].

(bending the rule to include Harry, though mostly as an observer) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4541731/1/Alternative-Medicine][Alternative Medicine]] - Harry is struck down by a nasty curse that requires some non-traditional medical care in South India. Hermione, Padma, and Parvati volunteer to assist in his care, and a menage-a-foursome is born. Harry/multi.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8783437/1/Written-In-The-Body][Written in the Body]] - Being tortured by Bellatrix changes Hermione in a big way. She decides that no one else is allowed to write her life and is determined to live her life her own way, whatever the cost. This includes going after the love of her dreams if only she could figure out who they are. Femmeslash. Hermione/Ginny.

Not too much new in this category- I think the femslash writers are going nuts for Legend of Korra right now.

** Can you clarify 'good' in this request?

I know some fics where Hermione and another witch have some (mmph! Oh yeah!) good times together and some others where she explores a relationship with another main cast character and some others where she falls under the influence of older, more powerful... /influences/ (one of the Black sisters or her mentor the cat, usually).

*** Specifically looking for the second one - e.g. Hermione/Ginny, Hermione/Luna, Hermione/one of the Patils (unlikely as it seems), that kind of stuff. H/Tonks wouldn't be amiss either.

**** You might try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]], 405k words, complete. Hermione in an on-again/off-again relationship with a sister/mother/female version of Harry (sort of--you'll have to read to understand).

** I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/][Murder Most Horrid]] which is a Bellatrix/Hermione fic set in an AU where Voldemort never existed and Bellatrix isn't a raving lunatic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]] is a Hermione/Ginny time travel fic where they're sent back in time by Dumbledore during the final battle. Definitely recommend this one.

I also second Crazy Little Things, Aucune Defense Pour Toi and Written in the Body recommended by [[/u/wordhammer]].

One's I've read but it's been too long to remember how good they were:

#+begin_quote
  When Shell Cottage receives a motley group, Fleur and Bill do their best to ensure their safety. In the weeks that follow, wounds are healed and plans are concocted. Fleur and Hermione find themselves coming to a new understanding of one another.
#+end_quote

Probably the best Fleur / Hermione fic starting in book 6. A decent mix of sticking to cannon but changing up enough little things to keep it interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6507212/1/Entwined][Entwined]]

#+begin_quote
  After an impossible encounter, two young women find their lives destined to entwine. This is the tale of Hermione Granger and Fleur Delacour, and how they fell in love.
#+end_quote

There are a lot of 4th year Fleur / Hermione fics, this is one of the best if not the best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here And There]]

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Hogwarts reaches a critical point. With few options and even less people left to defeat Voldemort, the side of good's fate may rest on the shoulders and in the hands of two witches. A journey through many kinds of barriers. Eventual HG/GW
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/3/1/0/0/0/0/][This FanFiction.net]] community is the best place to look for Harry Potter femslash fanfic, if its on fanfiction.net it will be in that community.

*** COMPLETELY agree that Entwined is the best Fleur-Hermione fic. It seriously kills me that the sequel hasn't been finished though :/ maybe someday...

** I really like Roundabout Destiny. It is a SB/HG pairing but not in a creepy way. Hermione dies and is brought back a Hermione Potter, fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She sets to fix the future with her past knowledge. Starts in year one. Very good! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny]]
