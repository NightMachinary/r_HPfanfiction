** Why is DWP publishing it instead of hgfan111?

  I enjoyed writing fiction again, but it's very, very far from perfect, and very raw. It's not anything more than dipping my toe back in, and having some fun with Ella.

I mean, she kind of implies she doesn't care that much about it.

****** Right, but why not just post it under your own account anyway? It's not like they're trying to pass it off as DWP's story, they openly say it's hers. The only advantage I can think of is using DWP's audience.

******* Pretty sure she deleted her old fics because she was going on to being a publishing author, and wanted to delete all her old works to 'clean up her image,' as it were.

But if you publish it through someone else, only someone who reads that author/genre would know who that person was to connect the dots.

Just a guess though.

******** That makes sense. I would still publish it under a different name altogether though, rather than through someone else's account.

********* But its less likely to be read.

People, no matter what they say, care about being known for who they are and what they do. Publishing under a new name when a sub-community already knows about you is too tempting to avoid.

In fairness, you are not likely to find them either unless you are already fairly cognizant of the wider HP - H/G fandom, so that would not mean much to anybody else.

********** So I was right- it's using DWPs audience. This seems pretty disingenuous and a bit shitty, especially after DWP has made a song and dance about deleting all her fics.

******* Because she doesn't care enough to? Or she thought it wasn't good enough to post but DWP thought differently? Some authors don't like to include stories they don't think are good enough on their profile, but don't mind if they're out there.

** Wait, I'm confused. I thought Deadwoodpecker was deleting her fics, so why is she starting a new one? This feels like a severe need for attention.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny's in danger, and Britain's most infamous (and infamously infuriating) Auror is on the case. (This is not mine, but is the fic HGFan1111 wrote last month during a renewed fervor of writing).
