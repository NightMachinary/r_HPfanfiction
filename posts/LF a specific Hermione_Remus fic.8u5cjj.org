Looking for a Hermione Remus fic. It's Postwar, with active Order still, I think. Sirius is alive. I remember that Hermione and Remus have a one night stand, after Tonks and Ginny try to drug them with some sort of lust potion, and Hermione drinks Harry's because he secretly hates the drink Ginny always makes for him. Remus marks Hermione as his mate, and she starts having side effects of the full moon, which Severus helps her with by brewing a less intense version of the wolfsbane potion. There's a side thing where someone obsesses over who took Hermione's virginity because she won't tell them and the twins make a spell where it outs everyone's first time, and Hermione and Remus are sent on a undercover mission for the Order.
