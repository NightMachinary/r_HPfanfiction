Are there any stories where the main HP cast fight in World War 2?

Any story where one of the teachers adopts Harry?

Any Hermione/Original Male Character or Reader stories?


** Think there was an entire series called like The Amulet of Time or something where Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny went back in time starting with the Hogwarts founders and continuing into WWII etc? It was a multi-story fic series.

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With someone meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from their entanglement in World War II and Grindelwald's reign, to canon years and a much changed future.TMR/HP Slash.AUTHOR'S NOTE 28/12/2019: Some readers have asked me to upload this story to AO3. It is fairly advanced in Fanfiction.net. I will finish uploading it on this site as well, as requested, in the span of a few weeks. It is a story written some years ago and it has not been revised since then.I will do my best to revise it and finish the story starting mid2020.Thank you to all of those who have reviewed, it is due to you that I finally decided to get back to writing after such a long absence. Studying, working, family - in short, life, has kept me pretty busy. But you have convinced me to give it a go and try to finish this :) As for that, which would you prefer I tackle first, Twist of Fate or Vindico Atrum? Ideally I would like to do both but given my time constraints I will probably just be able to focus on one for a while.

  AU: The continuation of Book I. Not all of Tom Riddle is gone. A mysterious journal and a new Defense teacher pose challenges for Harry and his guardian. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva.
