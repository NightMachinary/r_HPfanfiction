Got the idea from re-reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3470741/1/Resolution][Resolution]]; there's a scene where Harry visits an alternate dimension and his counterpart arrives at the Burrow with his quidditch bros. Any fics like that?

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

** Linkffn(Lion Unity) is a lot more team-centric but Hermione and Ron are still involved.

  In the books, Harry's been betrayed by his house so many times it's never a surprise. But what if the Gryffindors got their act together after Harry's first year and start acting like a family again? The result is Lion Unity, where wizards and witches all over the world learn not to mess with Harry and his huge family.
