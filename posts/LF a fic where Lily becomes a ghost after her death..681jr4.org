After Lily's death she becomes a ghost and tries to do her best for Harry.

It doesn't matter who she is bound to as long as she becomes a ghost although it would be interesting to see her become bound to Serverus Snape or just not bound at all.

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.
