I'm looking for a long series that features a Slytherin Harry, preferably a Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter story, although I wouldn't be adverse to another pairing as long as it's well-written. It would be great if it's available in ao3. Thank you!!


** Only one that comes to mind is linkao3(on the way to greatness by mira_mirth).

** FF dot net, but it's good - Dark Harry, Dark Hermione - Harry is in Gryffindor but is Slytherin at heart, he's trying to keep that bit under the radar. I know it's not precisely what you asked for but you might like it so I thought I'd throw it out there. It's complete in seven stories.

** linkffn(2580283) sounds right up your street. It's one of the HP fanfic classics. Slytherin Harry 7 year AU, complete (and long), Harry/Draco pairing.

Warnings: angst, lots of filler, angst, frustrating!Harry, more angst. With a side serving of extra angst.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
