Like this is just a shit excuse to avoid having to address slavery concerns. Dobby directly contradicts this idea in canon and it seems like the only reason it comes up is so that we can get Dobby Ex Machina every time Harry needs to sneak out of Hogwarts/get food/get rescued/have a house elf army at his house/for those "oh yeah we murder and torture mudbloods but in reality /we/ are the good guys for some reason".


** I can accept House Elves commonly dying without a master because they commit suicide or just stop bothering to eat/drink, as that kinda fits with Winky, who might well have spiralled further without Dobby to help her.

But completely agreed on it being stupid to make House Elves instantly die without a master, simply "because magic".

** Iremember a fic where house elves are described as the root european folk tales about [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore][brownies]]), a type of household spirit. Basically house elves used to be wild, and would do chores in exchange for gifts. On rare occasions though a brownie (house elf) would become unstable and turn into a berserking terror. House elves started bonding with a master because it stopped them from going berserk somehow. Either that or wizards got tired of the occasional rabid elf and were going to hunt the all down so they decided to bond to prevent that. I thought it was a decent reason for the current situation. Wizards abuse the bond now, and elves are afraid to be free for fear of going feral. Free elves have a general stigma that was originally rooted in fear but has morphed over time.

** Not a lot to add but there was the house elf of Hepzibah Smith who iirc went meekly to her death. Of course she and everyone else were sure she had killed her owner, but still it might show something lacking in the self preservation department. Winkys state has been mentioned, but I think Kreacher in that context can be brought up. He let the Blacks home fall to ruin, and who knows what he would have done without the portraits. As Taure said I don't think they just waste away because of magic but with the severe moods of a house elf I can certainly see them giving up on life and dying much earlier than they should (which I think is born out in real life data of those who have a purpose/trying to will tend to live longer).

It's well-intentioned, but in the end it's the idea of a teenage girl who thinks she understands the plight of these enslaved creatures she just learned about. It works in the books because it helps Hermione's character--no one can argue that she's an unemotional know-it-all, because she really does care about house-elves, to the point of ridiculousness. It's also something people can associate with--most people can recall some cause they got behind in their teen years, and knows that in hindsight their methods might not have been the best.

I love SPEW in the books. It doesn't really help the house-elves and it creates a lot of dumb acronym jokes, but it's sweet and it makes me love Hermione, and I always name my Fantasy Football team SPEW in its honor.

***** This right here. Elements of the house-elf situation in the books (specifically that of house-elves hating the concept of freedom) rather resembles that of the White Man's Burden, if anything. Speculation here: through however many centuries of wizard/elf relations, the more magically versatile former may have not only succeeded in subjugating the latter in body, but also in mind. The success of the Atlantic slave trade owes much to the widespread teachings of scientific racism, the criminalisation of the literate among enslaved peoples, etc. It worked infamously well, for runaway slaves - as downtrodden as they were - often returned to their 'dear' masters. It's never been much of a stretch for me to see parallels in HP, but hey - it's just my perspective.

'Clumsy' is too kind a word for it. Hermione saw house-elves all abhorred the idea of freedom and there was clear evidence that they would be miserable if freed. And what did she do? In all her infinite wisdom she tried to force freedom upon the house elves via her knitting binge with no regard to their wishes whatsoever. That's the worst sort of condescension, and the house elves would have paid the price for it had Hermione succeeded in her goals.

And comparing the House Elf slavery situation (if you call it slavery) to the real world is rather iffy because we don't have a species of sentient willing slaves who would turn suicidal if freed.

Strengthening laws against House Elf abuse is a good thing, of course. I just don't see how it co-relates to forcing freedom upon them.

In that, it may well have been the least bad option available to her at the time.

House-elves' express wishes are just as iffy: they are a product of generations of a culture in which they ostracize any member who is freed, no matter the reason (e.g., their treatment of Winky), and the magic binding them makes them /punish themselves/ for even the tiniest acts of disobedience. If that's not an effective way to brainwash someone into believing that their treatment is just, I don't know what is. Can house-elves in such a culture meaningfully consent to being magically bound (assuming someone even asks them)?

#+end_quote

(source: The wikia, which sources OoTP.)

Hermione indeed attempted to force them into freedom. Whether it would have succeeded or not is unclear, but the house elves refused to clean Gryffindor Tower after that and Dobby hoarded all the hats and socks. There is another instance where Dobby says that the House Elves fear Hermione and want nothing to do with her. So, that's that.

And brainwashed or not, forcing freedom is the stupidest way to go about it. And house elves are a whole different species where I don't think our standard arguments would apply. In any case, I have a fundamental dislike of being told what's best for me, and /'they just think they do but they really don't'/ argument is skirting dangerously close to that.

EDIT: I'm not going to go into the brainwashing argument in detail /again/, but I give my thoughts on it [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=786433&postcount=191][here]].

Ron made two accusations at once: that elves like slavery and that Hermione's trying to trick them into becoming free. Hermione responded to one of them. At that point, she was so angry that she left. You take that as admission of guilt regarding the other accusation. She didn't say she didn't, so she must have done. That reasoning didn't work when I was six and using it on my classmates, and it still doesn't work.

The only thing this conversation you quoted adds to the discussion is that she decided to deny one assertion and not the other. One was an attack on her worldview; the other was an attack on her character. You might find it more natural to respond to attacks on your character before attacks on your worldview, but not everyone is like you. Also, Hermione had seen how Ron responded to Harry defending his own character the year before with the Tournament -- it's like kicking a bale of wool.

What? Hermione was leaving out hats for house elves and covering them with rubbish (she says yes to that). /Of course/ she was trying to force them to be free. Can you think of another reason why she would hide hats and cover them with rubbish?

Your reply was pointless and added nothing to the discussion. Whether she replied to Ron's accusation or not is irrelevant because it is obviously true. And Hermiones /"Of course they want to be free!"/ is factually incorrect anyway. She was obviously deluded when it came to house elves.

Seeing that /everyone/ believes that Hermione is trying to trick house elves into freedom and that Hermione doesn't refute it and 'turns pink' at the accusation, I don't see how you can read this otherwise. It is a fact that if you hide hats behind rubbish, elves /would/ pick them up accidentally, and Hermione surely knew that.

Because it's heavily implied that Dobby, Kreacher, and Winky were all emotionally and physically tortured slaves" and maybe she threw in SPEW to address the contradiction of why the people on Harry's side can be slave owners who are totally apathetic about slavery and still be portrayed as having a relatively clean moral conscience as "good" guys.

Winky was happy. She would have continued to be happy had she continued serving the Crouches. Crouch fired her for disobeying orders and that's when became unhappy. There was no abuse involved.

Kreacher was happy when he serving blood purists and hated Sirius because he did not adhere to his family's of blood purity and hated his Death Eater family whom Kreacher loved.

And then I read these comments criticizing Hermione's behavior and verifying the wizarding community's attitude that elves want to be enslaved . . . and I cannot help but wonder if deep down, people like the idea of having others under their control.

It's just not though. You're comparing invading and assimilating a perfectly benign thing to ending slavery.

What about whaling in Japan?

Look further back into history, China invaded Korea in the 17th century and made it a part of the Manchu dynasty's empire. Much later on, they rose up and cast them out only to become apart of the Japanese rule after a slow acquiesition of the country from the 19th century to the early 20th.

Then in the late 20th century you have the Russians/Chinese and Americans dividing it up into north and south. But I was talking about the original divisions in the country.

Your point about reunification? And disbanding all the shit they've put up over the years? Yes, they should get rid of that. Because it's oppression, nothing to do with culture. It's all part of a dictatorship's way of enforcing its rule on the people that live there. A regime that if we look back has only been around for less than a hundred years and was enforced by treaties from foreigners.

#+begin_quote
  It's arguable that slavery was part of Americas culture, is it wrong that it was ended?
#+end_quote

No, it's not. I'm not sure why you're arguing that point, seeing as it has very little to do with anything that has been said in this thread thus far. Besides, it was a huge part of worldwide culture, not just in America.

Yes, whaling still happens, what do you want me to say about that? That they should stop doing it for sport? Because I agree, they should.

Acid attacks in Bangladesh are hardly apart of their culture. Once again, I'm completely confused as to what you're trying to say here.

Honour killings in Sri Lanka? I'll admit I've no idea about that at all.

I think that they should be stopped, of course I do and I'm sure that there's a large bunch of liberal minded people who agree within those countries who probably are campaigning exactly for that purpose.

#+end_quote

You're twisting my words. The racism, the ignorance and all of it is symptomatic of a bigger problem than what you see on the surface, it can only be changed at the heart by its own people. Education is often said to be the way forward in this. You educate people that, in this example, everyone is a human being we're all entitled to the basic human rights, we're all entitled to being ourselves. In order to remove the stigma the problem's got to be removed at the base.

#+begin_quote
  why the fuck were you talking about executing all werewolves after they'd achieved their goals?
#+end_quote

When I said that, I meant it could be a proposed motion in the Wizarding World. Not specifically SPEW. I would most likely be proposed by radicals, even given the temperament of the wizarding world. As I'm sure you're aware, radicals exist in practically every walk of life, young and old.

#+begin_quote
  ...The organisation consists of Hermione and 10 people she scared into buying a button.
#+end_quote

In the books, it consists of only 5 people from memory; Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Dobby. In the future, though, who's to say it doesn't become a much larger organisation? Wouldn't you think someone like Hermione would preach the belief and try to build it up from 5 members? Make it have a larger following? Maybe try to push for reforms and actually make a difference? The epilogue skimmed over a lot of things. It was a nice, happy, uncomplicated ending. But back to the point, membership wouldn't remain at 5 indefinitely.

#+begin_quote
  Then i'm sure you can provide me empirical evidence that at least one of the members of SPEW are evil.
#+end_quote

I grant you, of the 5 from the books who are members, they're all good people. Heroes of their world, as you know. But in the future, of the potential many unknowns who could join? There are bound to be some who agree on the grounds of Elf welfare, but disagree on whether werewolves should be considered people too. That's life. There are people who fervently believe in some things but on a related topic are against it. The thing you need to understand here is that not agreeing with something doesn't necessarily make a person evil. As I've said in my previous response, topics like this are divisive. People always have reasons for the things they believe in. Fictional characters are no different. In the end the best we can hope for is that the end result satisfies the largest number of people. Because it's impossible to please everyone at once.

Look, we could go round and round arguing over each other's points and how we both phrased things. You seem to think I'm the second coming of Hitler or something whilst I'm here trying to clarify my points with apparently little success. So I'll make it quick with what I hope is a clear clarifying and summarising statement of what I really believe about all the things you're accusing me of believing in.

We can look at various situations in various countries and for most of us we're outsiders looking in. From our point of view, we have been raised in a certain society that doesn't practise the things that are commonplace or practices elsewhere, some will be perfectly innocent and harmless things. Other things will be not as innocent, for example as you've said, North Korea's work camps and the other examples you used. We, as outsiders are looking in and from our point of view, we /know/ that what is going on there is morally wrong. We know because we've been raised to see that x, y and z is wrong. Slavery is wrong, working people to death is wrong, executing people or jailing them without habeas corpus is wrong. We know this. But there are some places where some of the above still applies in practice. You can call it culture, you can call it tradition, whatever. But the simple fact is, we know it's wrong, but it's not our place to interfere in the running of that particular country or place.

We know that what they're doing is fundamentally wrong, but because we're looking in and we condemn, but we're not citizens there, we can't do anything about it. Sure there can be economic sanctions, embargoes, blockades, non-military solutions to put pressure on those countries as well as amnesty provided for those who don't want to live under the regimes. But for the most part we, as people can't do anything to improve their situation. Within the country itself there has to be a significant call for change. There has to be a significant following, a need, a desire for change in order for it to take place. A change in policy brought on by the population of the country itself. Only then can change truly occur. Only then can things get better. By attacking the root of the problem, which is the people within those countries themselves, they have to want the change in order to embrace it. Outsiders can help and give approval and condemnation of actions and whatever you think would actually help the situation. But overall we can't do shit to fix another society unless they specifically want it to change themselves.

Though there are occasions throughout history where a nation has attempted to change a regime or people by force, invading and enforcing a new way of life upon people. But that's another problem and only causes harm than good. Plus the idea of a wrong to right a wrong is in itself fundamentally wrong. The only way for change to really happen is the natural, slow evolution of people. A gathering of like-minded people spreading their ideas to the rest of their country and we're talking decades here, if not centuries.

At the end of the day, Harry Potter is set in a fictional world with an outdated culture. Technologically they're stuck in about the early 20th century and beliefs wise they're still stuck in bigoted ways. It is a fantasy world where house elf slavery is a thing, where elves seem to like it except for Dobby who was the only exception to this rule that we've ever seen. But whether we like it or not, that is how it is and that's a part of this fictional world's culture. By using the word "culture" in this sense, I mean that it is tradition, that it is just the de facto of life there. It doesn't by any means that it's right. It's just how it is. Merely that it is a thing that happens. Along with the habits of wearing robes, riding brooms, etc. etc. The world also plays host to a world of magical and mythical creatures, vastly different from its mundane counterpart as well as having a bunch of creatures from legend and fairytale. All in all it's a wonderful world. But even in that seemingly majestic world, there are still problems which aren't going to be solved in a heartbeat or with a flick of a wand. Problems which mirror ones in our own world.

Now I've said my piece, that'll be my final word on this as I'm now headed off to bed. You can agree or with my statement and/or fact my original answer to this question, which was that:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes, I think it's stupid to assume that house elves get killed by their magic if they're not bonded to a master and I agree with Taure about just how exactly they might die if they're freed. But I strongly feel that it would not be the case 100% of the time."
