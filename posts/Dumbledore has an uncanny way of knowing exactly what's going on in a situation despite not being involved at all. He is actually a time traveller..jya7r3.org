** There was a fic similar to this. I don't remember what it was called but it was about how Dumbledore had time traveled several times and tried to change things each time, but they never worked out (he specifically stated that every time Harry did not stay with the Dursley's he dies before the age of 6) and that was why things had to happen the way they did even though it might be hard.

** I came up with a silly idea in this vein some time ago. Dumbledore's ridiculous outfits is in fact him exploiting chaos theory from multiple travels by making specific people notice them and interpret them differently, causing subtle changes that ultimately spiral into very different futures. This is why Harry & co were as ridiculously lucky as they were: if he failed, Dumbledore just spun back the clock and used a different outfit.
