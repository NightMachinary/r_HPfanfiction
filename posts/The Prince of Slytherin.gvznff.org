Are Sirius and Remus a couple in this fic? Do any relationships change?


** Are you talking about the one by TheSinisterMan? If so then they aren't a couple, also no real pairings yet. The author has said no dating till year 4 yule ball (the fic is at end of year 3 now)

**** The fic in it's entirety (it's still ongoing) is on ff.net, the first chapter is a prologue set at the end of year 4, the next chapter is the beginning of the fic starting with Voldemorts attack in Halloween 1981.
