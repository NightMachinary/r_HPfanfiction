I recently got made aware of the queer subtext of Remus Lupin and now I'm curious to see it in fics. Please, any fics of any era where Sirius and Remus are paired. Any trope, any era, they can be the main characters or side characters (like in C'est La Vie by cywscross), whatever. Oh, and Slash is allowed. Obviously. :)


** [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] is beautifully written.

*** I just finished reading The Shoebox Project after a week of bedtime reading, it is now forever embedded in my heart as canon to HP. It felt like a lifetime spent away and eventually come to a closure after all that's there and happened. I could not recommend more of this fanfic to a Wolfstar fan.

** “The Electric Fizzing Prick Pistols, or Whatever” is one of my favorite fics of any genre. Short, funny, and sweet Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1319809]])

  Everyone is born with Words on their arm that connect them to their Soulmate. James finds his, Sirius had everything figured out back in First Year, Peter doesn't talk to girls anyway, and Remus thinks he'd very much just like to put his earmuffs back on and disappear.(Written August, 2013.)

Anything by TheDivineComedian is very good, and it's often a pairing in their stories.

  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.

  Harry Potter grew up at Number Four Privet Drive. Harry Potter has never known his parents. Harry Potter is a wizard.Harry Potter is not the Boy Who Lived.--The Thrown Pebble is Book One of a whole-canon reimagining wherein Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the one targeted by Voldemort. This changes many things, and other things not at all.(TTP is complete; the series is a WIP. Tags will be updated as chapters are posted. See series notes for more details.)

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

** I really liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787432][Fractured Skies by Orphan Account]] - it features a deaf Sirius and the way signing is portrayed seems to really capture the poetry of the language. The story beautifully conveys the challenges of living on the fringe ... the otherness (not just Sirius, but also Lupin). Also, I loved how the Marauder's story was made mundane (not magical) with links to the original stories woven in. It is slash and has a sequel that is also good.
