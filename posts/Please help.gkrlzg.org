:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this a long time ago, so I don't remember too much but just few things. James & Harry are siblings. Harry is courted/engaged to TMR/Voldermort. Their parents are against it but Harry's grandparents support it. There is a Wizengamot meeting going on where they find out Harry was assaulted by his teacher or was it nanny. Harry's father knew and did nothing. He is against same-sex couples. Harry's grandparents take away his father's lordship. Augusta try to interfere but was quickly told not to interfere in family their business. Later it turn out that Harry's mother was controlling his father by love potion I think. He realises it and come back to apologise to his children and his parents. He's was also it a secret relationship with someone but it ended badly because of his wife.


** Might want to flair this as "What's that fanfic?"

Sorry I can't help you, however, as this seems like exactly the sort of fanfic I'd avoid(a romantic relationship with someone old enough to be your grandfather? Brrrr)

*** Thanks

Also I'm pretty sure TMR/Voldemort isn't that old it this fic. This is alternate universe & isn't set in books timeline.
