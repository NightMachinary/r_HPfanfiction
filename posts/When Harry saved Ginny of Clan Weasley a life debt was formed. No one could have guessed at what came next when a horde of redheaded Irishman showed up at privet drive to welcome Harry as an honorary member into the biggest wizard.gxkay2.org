** Harry being Harry just assumed the life debt didn't matter. Ginny was Ron's little sister any good friend would have saved her, By the time they left for the summer holiday Harry sensed something was different , just a bit. Ginny stopped blushing around him , which was nice as she was quite funny when She acted like a normal human rather than When she did it constant impression of a tomato.

Ron kept taking about his family , cousins, brothers, grandparents In Excruciating Detail to the point Harry felt like his best mate was trying to help him revise for some kind of Exam Based solely on the Weasley clan. And Ron kept saying “ our” When referring to his family it was rather Bizarre.

Hermione and Neville were the only one acting Moderately normal, Hermione kept giving him pamphlets about life debt and magical adoption Which were interesting but not particularly relevant to him. Nev seemed to think he would see Harry at his gran's Summer solstice celebration this summer, as the Weasley came ever year.

Under normal circumstances Harry would've asked questions but he was tired a lot lately and The basilisk venom scar on his shoulder still hurt Periodically so Madame Pumphrey has him on some mild pain potions for the last few weeks of second year. They made him kind of sleepy but helped heal any lasting damage. So Harry just went with it at this point, magical healing was strange.

When they arrived at KingsCross station Things got even stranger All of Ron's brother Were there and Bill Weasley wasn't on the platform but instead standing beside his uncle Vernon talking to him. In a serious tone with Charlie Weasley standing behind him Cracking his knuckles rather menacingly.

His uncle kept muttering about “Ginger freaks” On the entire drive home but when they arrived Harry was ushered up to his room by his Aunt Along with his wand and trunk he got to keep everything in his new room, Not locked under the stairs. That would have been amazing enough but Quidditch and weird sisters memorabilia and posters littered his new room. His Aunt Had looked annoyed And rather flustered When she shoved him into the room and slammed the door behind him. There was a fireplace next to the window that hadn't been there before with a letter pinned to it. Signed by someone named Aunt Tessie. Informing him the family would be by for tea in the morning. That she hoped He liked his new room as she had sent her sons To make some adjustments so he could Be in touch with the rest of the family while still living in A Muggle town. Harry vaguely remembered Ron complaining on the train about A great aunt That made dry fruit cake , Maybe that was her. His brain was still a little foggy from the last healing potion Madame Pumphrey Gave him before boarding the train so Harry just Refolded the letter ate a few of the Biscuits in The tin on his dresser and went to sleep. He woke the next morning to 30 red heads Surrounding his bed and Someone who looked like an older version of Ginny shaking him awake while trying to force a sweater that said “ Honorary Weasley” over his head. It was all rather mad, but they brought Treacle tarts with them so Harry could forgive the Intrusion quite easily

** Vernon Dursley did not notice anything out of the ordinary when he went to pick up his nephew from the train station, at least, not anything more out of the ordinary than the usual strangeness. He did notice a large family of redheaded people who walked Harry to him, but he assumed that it was just a family of /those people/ and thought nothing more of it. Besides, he had bigger issues to worry about.

Grunnings was right in the middle of a rather hostile takeover by a company from Ireland, which meant more stress at work. Quotas were getting higher and as a mid-level manager, that meant more stress for him. The new owners were polite enough, though Vernon did think some of their mannerisms were peculiar. He would certainly have to get used to the accents.

When they got to the car, Petunia began gossiping with him about the new neighbors at number 5. The old neighbors were quiet, respectable people who out of the blue up and left. Petunia and her friends thought there was a scandal involved, but no matter how much digging they did, it seemed as if the old neighbors had just simply moved away. The new neighbors were strange folk, but the wife was polite and seemed ready to gossip just as much as all the other women of the neighborhood, so Petunia liked her.

"She said she's from Ireland. I hope they aren't coming here with any funny ideas," Petunia explained fretfully. Vernon grunted in response. He would on no accounts have any more funny business in /his/ neighborhood. There was enough of that as it is with his nephew.

Vernon had eventually met the neighbors. They were younger, probably in their mid twenties of he were to guess, and they had a son who was a little younger than Dudley. When they spoke, Vernon learned that the man was actually apart of the company that had bought out Grunnings. It was somewhat unnerving to have a man so young be Vernon's boss, but he tactfully avoided showing that discomfort.

As the summer progressed, Vernon noticed more and more redheads whenever he went. At first he wasn't consciously aware of it, but by mid-July, he had taken notice and was beginning to think something funny was afoot. His suspicions were confirmed one night when he and Petunia were watching the evening news.

"Who the ruddy hell could that be?" Vernon said angrily, marching to the door. He opened it rather violently, ready to tell off whoever it was. He was quickly stopped when he saw a shock of red hair and a wide grin.

"Vernon! Good to see you! We were hoping to speak to Harry," the man said jovially. Vernon stopped dead in his tracks. Behind him was a massive crowd of redheaded people of all ages, all of them looking incredibly happy. Vernon let out a sound like a balloon letting out air. Harry was at the staircase looking bewildered.

"Do I know you?" Harry asked curiously. Their neighbor laughed heartily and shook his head.

"Nah, but we know /you!/ You're the one who saved ickle Ginny Weasley this past year, correct?" he asked. Harry nodded, though still looking incredibly confused. The man somehow grinned wider.

"Aye, then that means you're now apart of the family! As is custom, the whole of the Weasley clan is here to welcome you! Come on down and I'll introduce ya!" he cried with delight. Harry's face split into a grin and he rushed past Vernon, who promptly closed the door, counted to ten.

He should have known something funny was going on.
