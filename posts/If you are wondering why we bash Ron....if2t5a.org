#+begin_quote
  called Hermione a nightmare in public
#+end_quote

After she loudly berated him in class instead asking if he wanted help or quietly correcting him. At the age of 11.

#+begin_quote
  called Hermione a know-it-all at least twice a week for at least the first few years at Hogwarts (PoA ch 9).
#+end_quote

So did everyone else. And defended Hermione from Snape, got a detention for it, and never rubbed it in her face. There is this thing known as banter between friends. Look it up.

#+begin_quote
  generally mocked Hermione's academic interests except when she was helping him with his homework.
#+end_quote

Proof?

Also reminded Hermione of her brilliance when she was stressing out (see: pre-O.W.L. results in HBP).

#+begin_quote
  Some people (perhaps a bit unfairly) blame Ron for the Scabbers, Crookshanks situation, when Hermione was being dismissive of Ron's reasonable concerns (perhaps because Ron had been calling her a know-it-all twice a week since first year?).
#+end_quote

Hermione was generally a bad friend in PoA, albeit a concerned one. Also, Harry's "twice a week" claim was most probably an exaggeration (see: hyperbole).

#+begin_quote
  mocked Hermione for being interested in justice for house-elves.
#+end_quote

No. He tried to correct her belief that she knew what was best for House Elves. He was also the one who remembered about House Elves in DH, which shows that he cared for her ideals and beliefs.

#+begin_quote
  was jealous and didn't believe Harry and he abandoned him after Harry's name came out of the Goblet.
#+end_quote

And Harry didn't do jacksquat to tell Ron about the truth. Harry thought it would be dramatic to say someone was trying to kill him, which resulted in him floundering about without explaining the situation properly, right after he came to their dorm from a massive party. Ron's "jealousy issues" are ridiculously inconsistent in canon.

#+begin_quote
  was sexist (called girls trolls)
#+end_quote

No. He said a specific girl had a troll-like appearance because of her acne. It isn't a nice thing to say, but it isn't sexist either.

#+begin_quote
  was dismissive of the idea that anyone would like Hermione enough to ask her to the Yule Ball.
#+end_quote

No. He said it couldn't be true once, and then shut up about it until after the Yule Ball.

#+begin_quote
  had a jealous meltdown and treated Hermione like crap about Krum and the Yule Ball.
#+end_quote

Were you ever 14?

#+begin_quote
  started fights with Hermione often enough for Harry to notice---even in fifth year which otherwise had no major incidents.
#+end_quote

Harry was generally moody in their fifth year, of course he noticed their fights and got irritated. Honestly...

Also, "started"... That's funny.

#+begin_quote
  started off sixth year by hitting Harry on the head (not with intended malice, but it was nonetheless a sign of things to come).
#+end_quote

Do you have a best friend?

#+begin_quote
  was a jealous dick to Hermione about Slughorn's party (which she invited him to anyway, for some ungodly reason).
#+end_quote

She asked him to it, said it was completely unromantic, reprimanded him for some other school related shit. Hmmm, I guess Ron's to be blamed for not fucking her on the table right there. Also, she asked McLaggen out to make Ron jealous. Heck, she even contemplated on asking Zacharias Smith.

#+begin_quote
  was a sexist controlling asshole when he slut-shamed and attacked his sister (Harry had to hold him back),
#+end_quote

Bwa-ha-ha. He was an older brother, and a bit of an ass about it. Also, Ginny repeatedly made scathing remarks about the lack of romance in his life.

#+begin_quote
  then---out of jealousy over Hermione ostensibly kissing Krum two years prior---he verbally and emotionally attacked Hermione for a couple of weeks.
#+end_quote

Like Hermione didn't reciprocate in kind. She just broke down crying first.

#+begin_quote
  then, to get even with Ginny for kissing before he did, and to get back at Hermione for kissing Krum, and to score a notch on his belt, he took advantage of Lavender's affections and made sure to publicly snog and more or less grope her in front of Hermione and Ginny..... thus blowing off his date with Hermione without having the courtesy to tell her first.
#+end_quote

Hmm... Never mind that Hermione told him it wasn't romantic, instead of asking him out if she wanted. I guess Ron's the dude, so it's his responsibility to ask her out first. Totally makes sense.

He didn't take advantage of Lavender. He was genuinely invested in the relationship until the initial novelty wore off.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione finally snapped after being abused by Ron for a couple of weeks and sicced canaries on him
#+end_quote

Ron didn't abuse her. He acted like a typical teenage jerk. There's a difference between the two.

Funny how Hermione physically attacking him is mentioned like it's a great achievement. We have a word for that kinda behaviour - psychotic.

#+begin_quote
  complained all the time about the food and accommodations during the horcrux hunt, and complained about Harry having no idea how to find horcruxes.

  [...]

  started a fight with Harry and then ditched Harry and Hermione half-way during the horcrux hunt.
#+end_quote

Let's see

Influenced by horcrux? Check. Worried for his family? Check. Harry genuinely didn't know shit? Check. Came back, apologised and saved Harry's life? Check.

Dont see a single valid reason to hate him.

#+begin_quote
  *bash* Ron...
#+end_quote

Here's the difference between portraying a character in negative light vs bashing them - one involves sticking to their canon virtues and pointing out their negative qualities without needlessly shitting on them and the other strips them of every positive trait to make them useless, a caricature of their original self and have a douchebag protagonist win against them with ridiculous ease.

The fact that you want to bash Ron/actively encourage Ron bashing is worrying. Not uncommon, but worrying.

** Speaking as someone who is meh on both characters, this type of post by a Ron or Hermione fan is always funny because for a grievance against one there's typically a matching action by the other.

Ron called her a nightmare to Harry. Hermione just overheard it. She also happened to /be/ a nightmare, which is why she isn't well liked in universe.

She started just as many fights with Ron and I'm pretty sure Harry noticed them, too. He also noticed her jealous behavior in HBP. Hermione had no excuse for disliking Fleur. She did it because Ron found her attractive.

#+begin_quote
  made sure to publicly snog and more or less grope her in front of Hermione and Ginny
#+end_quote

Teenagers and I suppose we should also dislike Harry, too? Ginny for standing in the middle of a corridor? All the *teenagers* in Madam Puddifoot's? This also strips Lavender of whatever agency she had.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione finally snapped after being abused by Ron for a couple of weeks and sicced canaries on him
#+end_quote

"Hermione responded to verbal abuse by being physically abusive"

Also she sicced canaries on him because she was jealous. She also attacked him after he returned in DH.
