One of mine is when Mr. Ollivander asks the main character which is his wand hand and turns out they're ambidextrous, because of course they are.


** Is that even a cliché? I literally never saw an ambidextrous character, never mind an MC.

*** You must not have read many Indy!Harry then. If the fic makes the MC a genius, or something, they're likely to be ambidextrous.

** Not the worst clichés around, but while we are with Olivander: "While you also take a special Wand holster with quick draw option?".

** Purebloods are actually right to hate or be distrustful of muggleborns

It's wrong to want to want to murder muggleborns but they are unsophisticated and deserving of scorn but there are occasionally "good ones"

** Mine is "Ron ignores everything around him because FOOOOODDDDDDD!!!" I have literally read fics where he ignores fights in the Great Hall, except maybe to take some food from the plate of whoever's fighting.

Given how petty and pointless most of those fights are, that actually sounds kind of... admirable.

"And what did you get from this fight?" asked Ron, between spoonfuls of cake. "Minus a hundred House Points to both sides, a trip to the hospital wing for five people, including one bystander, and detentions for everyone involved."

He took a gulp of pumpkin juice, and continued, "Now, what did it get me? An extra serving of boeuf bourguignon and two slices of that cake whose name I do not know but will find out.
