I'm really sorry if this was already asked, but I'm new in this whole reddit thing. I want to read some next generation fanfiction, and I haven't read ANY Harry Potter related fic. I would like to know which are like the classics or must read, particularly about the third generation (James Sirius, Albus Severus, Rose, Scorpius, etc.) Please I'm open to every suggestion, nothing is too obvious or well known, since as I said, I don't know anything of Harry Potter fanfiction. Thank you so much in advance!

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

** Choices by Aebbe. I am not sure if this is the BEST or most famous or anything but I thought it was really good if you love time travel fics.

The basic premise is that Lily-Luna time travels back 47 years and meets Sirius and James. She finds out she cant change the past and has a brief romance with Sirius and then travels back into 2028. But THEN Sirius time travels forward 47 years and a bunch of the other next gen characters time travel too and exciting adventures happen.

ALSO this fic works (nearly) completely within canon which I love. I think it is so creative when authors can use the events from canon but change our perception of them to tell a different story.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

** "Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends" by GubraithianFire

Albus Potter, arrogant, amoral mafia don, is probably going to steal the answers to the nastiest, most exhausting Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test known to wizard-kind. Sybil Vaisey, self-righteous, scheming rival mafia heiress, is definitely going to stop him.

** Breaking the Quidditch Code and its sequel Decoding the Tutshill Tornadoes are pretty good reads, BtQC feels rushed on the last few chapters and the same with DtTT. Otherwise I'd say they're not a bad read. It focuses on James in his 7th year and his life after. I liked it because Janes was actually relatable in he didn't know how to act around the girl he likes, he fights with Harry and Albus, he follows his female best friend when she goes on a date to "protect" her. In my opinion this would have been Harry if James and Lily had raised him.
