** Hmm well there's always 'My Immortal' as /the/ trollfic. I know some don't like 'Methods of Rationality' because the author injects their beliefs. Cassandra Claire's 'Draco Trilogy' is a big Draco-in-leather-pants.

Honestly, if I'm trawling for worst of the worst, I search by "new." It's a real treasure trove!

Most anything by Kinsfire, though probably special attention should be paid to [[http://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/Death_Isnt_All_Its_Cracked_Up_To_Be/Chapter_1/][the one]] where Harry learns in Heaven that his mother regularly had foursome sex with James, Sirius, and Remus and [[http://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/Forever_Yours_and_Yours/index/][the one]] where he beds Hermione's mother in an H/Hr/mom threesome and his magical seed makes her into a witch.

** Edit: changed objective to subjective. Because that's what I meant.

OK, let's see. Obviously, all of these are subjective. I'm sure someone, somewhere, likes all of them.

Hagrid and the Skoolgurlz: "In the most METAL story you'll ever read, Hagrid, Luna, Ron, Aragog, McGonagall, and Dumbledore form a heavy metal band. Will this band have the balls to make it? You decide! Maybe. Not really. Dumbledore/Cthulhu, Luna/Yaoi, Your Mom/Everyone" This should be funny. Unfortunately, it's just stupid. None of the ongoing jokes work, from Hermione's giant breasts, to rabid Ron, it's a long, long slog. This is what you get when an author is trying WAY TO HARD: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5640811/1/Hagrid-and-the-Skoolgurlz]]

Harry Potter After the War: "ATW takes up the Harry Potter story on the day after the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and will continue the story through to the DH Epilogue, and probably beyond. Years One, Two, and Four are now Complete!" This is over 500000 words, and is part 1 in a series. The next part is over 1000000 words. And...nothing. Ever. Happens. No, not ever. Hold on, I lied. The author eventually starts giving us a yearly summary of Harry's finances. Personally, I enjoy longfic. But it took me forever to get through this one, because I kept falling asleep, and had to backtrack. In all fairness, I do read fanfic in bed at night. But normally, fics can keep me awake. This one just couldn't. If you have insomnia, this might help: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6350739/1/Harry-Potter-After-the-War]]

The Brave New World: "A sixth and seventh year story, totally AU. Harry decides that his life expectancy will be greatly enhanced if leaves Dumbledore and Voldemort behind. Destination: The US." Clocking in at an impressive 890,279 words, I just know a good fanfic is struggling to get out from inside this story, somewhere. Even though Harry is dating an American girl named Sophie by chapter 10 or so, even though the evil Dumbledore plot is cliched, even though Harry goes to America, I'm still kind of charmed by it. That is, until Harry starts participating in various competitions, and the author feels the need to include tournament charts in every single chapter. I appreciate worldbuilding, I really, really do. I can even intellectually appreciate the author's need to make charts, to keep everything straight. But I promise you, never, in the history of the world, has a nice chart or table of numbers improved a story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697521/1/The-Brave-New-World]]

The Harem War: NSFW! "AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi" Guess what? This fanfic has a scorecard at the end of every chapter! It's meant to help us, the readers, keep track of who Harry has slept with, and who he's going to sleep with soon. Isn't that nice? You know, I think my pet peeve is becoming rather obvious. By chapter 42, Harry's harem includes: Hermione Jane (Granger) Potter, Luna Celeste (Lovegood) Black, Dora (Tonks) Black-Potter, Minerva Grace (McGonagall) Potter-Black, Mallory Michelle (Grant) Black-Potter, Daphne Renee (Greengrass) Black-Potter, Astoria Lynn (Greengrass) Potter-Black, Ginevra Molly (Weasley) Potter-Black, Stacey Marie (Campbell) Potter-Black, Tabatha Simone (Collins) Black-Potter, Laura Teresa Oliver, Fiona Michelle Simpson, Rhonda Kaye (Lester) Potter-Black, and Karen Maria (Green) Black-Potter. At the start of the fanfic, we even get several explicit sex scenes with each new girl. About half way through, the author gets tired of writing about sex, and goes off to write about the military and the history of the royal family instead. If you want to know how old each girl is and what school she attended, the relationship scorecard will help you out: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5639518/42/The-Harem-War]]

Harry Potter turns to the Lord: "Harry Potter is plagued by foul dreams, and in his search, finds the one true meaning." This fic is a Christian example of did not do the research. It starts off with Harry Potter having a conversation with his teacher, Dumbledore. It goes down hill from there. Thankfully, it's just over a thousand words, so it won't suck up two weeks of your life: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102928/1/Harry-Potter-turns-to-the-Lord]]

I could go on. Personally, even though I realize these fics are terrible, I still kind of enjoy them anyway. Sometimes it's because of the few good qualities shining bravely through, and sometimes it's because it's so bad it's good. However, It is never because the author took the time to include several interesting charts with every chapter.

I think the alternate timeline of this fic is better. I don't know if you've read is but basically the author couldn't decide whether to have Harry leave the UK or stay so wrote both fics diverging after chapter 10 or so. Both have different character portrayals so it's not a perfect split, like in the American one Hermione is his friend and in the other she chooses Dumbledore over him (possibly the only time i've ever read this).

** On mobile, but seriously the Refiner's Fire is probably the lowest of the low for me. Insanely poor regard for women and how relationships work, this story just ends up reading like an HP RW buddy cop story from the 80s where all the women are useless and vain. Just poor all around after about a third of the way through. Such a strong opening, and then ehhhhh.

*** I thought people here liked this one? Maybe I'm thinking of something else?

Oof, I skimmed a paragraph or two and it's pretty bad! The children's dialogue is terrible and there are 134 "said" in the first chapter alone. Also, all the characters seem the same.
