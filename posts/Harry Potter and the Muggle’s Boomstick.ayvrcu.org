In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry reaches into the Sorting Hat for aid. Instead of receiving a sword, he pulls out a gun.


** "So that's what Dumbledore sends to his greatest supporter, a songbird and an old hat"

The voice was cruel and mocking, but Harry was desperately running to the Sorting Hat. Something was inside of it, and Voldemort hadn't noticed.

"Do you really think that some artifact will help you? That you can defeat ME with a hat?" Riddle snarled and addressed the King of Serpents. "Kill the fool!"

Meanwhile, Harry had pulled a tube out of Gryffindor's relict and it took him a precious second to recognise the object. It didn't look exactly like in the few movies he had seen, but it was close enough that the Gryffindor figured out that he was holding some kind of RPG.

"A piece of pipe? Is Dumbledore trying to mock you?"

The device was heavy, but in his desperation Harry managed to lift the twenty five pounds with a bit of accidental magic. The Basilisk lunged and Harry pulled the trigger whilst "aiming" at the dozens of foot-long fangs in the open jaw. Untrained as he was, the Vampir went high and hit the scaled snout instead. Perhaps with a lesser weapon, this would have mattered, but the last Soviet RPG was capable of punching through thirty inches of steel, five feet of bunker concrete and nearly four metres of dirt. The precursor pierced the Monster's skull before the main warhead detonated and drove a jet of molten metal through the soft tissue along its spine.

Without a sound the sixty feet long beast collapsed and shook the Chamber, although Harry couldn't be sure if it had truly been quiet or if the rocket propellant had just deafened him. The blast had thrown him down onto the ground and he found himself next to the Sorting Head once more.

From his new position he could see that the Basilisk had ploughed a ditch into the stone floor, his fangs spread along its path. One of them was nearly on top of Riddle's diary, which began to smoke as a clear liquid dropped onto its pages.

** I have nothing of value to contribute, so here is the infamous Harry Potter Guns copypasta.

  Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why: Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12. And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal. Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova. Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series: "Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1." And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.﻿

** I /have/ had a long standing fantasy of some enthusiastic wizard turning an elephant gun into a handgun, using runes to negate or absorb the kinetic energy in the recoil.

It'll look like a sawnoff double-barreled shotgun, but fire a rifle round so large it's plain silly.

**** maybe a little /too/ heavy

You'd need to be a master of quick-reversing shrinking charms to use it effectively
