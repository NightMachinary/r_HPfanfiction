*** I'll rec some as well.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/180806/chapters/265936][Survival of the Species]]: The rare mpreg fic that's not stupid, Survival of the Species by Romaine features an anthropologist Draco, Auror Harry, and full canon compliance. Draco asks Harry to accompany him to an uncharted island to learn about a lost civilization of dragon riders. Creaturefic, mpreg, and nothing corny about it--this is one of my all-time favorites.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164][Eclipse]]: One of the big fandom classics by Mijan, Eclipse follows Harry and Draco as they struggle with their roles in the war (as well as with nature). This is the camping fic we wish book seven had been.

[[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/OntheLastDayindex.html][On the Last Day of Our World]] by Sansa: Harry and Draco are locked in detention together when they step into a beam of light that knocks them out. When they wake up, they are entirely alone in the universe. This story follows them as they try to get back home.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=6841][On the Wings of a Storm]], [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=10191][Walking the Line]], and [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=8838][Allegiance and Sedition]] by silentauror: Honestly, anything long by silentauror is fantastic.

[[http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=rurounihime&keyword=The+Road+%28H/D%29&filter=all][The Road]] by ruronihime: This fic has been a WIP for years--seven years. It is not, however, abandoned, and it's definitely worth the time between perfectly-crafted chapters. Very post-apocalyptic, very dark, very wonderful.

Tell me if you need more. I've been in the Drarry fandom since its inception, and I've got loads to share.
