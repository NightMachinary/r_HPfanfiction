I can never find fanfic where Snape accidentally walks into an Order meeting Lily is in... hurt from a Death Eater meeting... does this exist? Thanks!


** Hmm...do you remember what site it was on? Fanfiction.net, Archive of Our Own, Spacebattles...?

How about the general word count? Is it a one-shot that's a couple of thousand words long, or a multi-part story, or as long as Order of the Phoenix?

Or is it just the specific scene you remember? Do you remember any specific phrases that one of the characters might have used?

(By the way, you can press the 'flair' button to add a flair to your title; I recommend the 'What's That Fic' flair.)

(Also, 'Snily torture fanfic' makes it sound like you're looking for something gory and adults-only.)

*** I've never actually seen fanfic about it! I guess I'm asking if it exists... I'm sorry if this isn't the place for that. Maybe even what I could search to try and find it, maybe I'm doing it wrong. Thank you!
