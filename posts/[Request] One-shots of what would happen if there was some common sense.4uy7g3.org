** Not an one-shot, but *Petrification Proliferation*, linkffn(11265467), shows how easy it would be to defeat the bad guys, if the good guys were just slightly more competent.

*His Mother's Love*, linkffn(10132530): Harry finally found some common sense in year 6, and things went far more smoothly.

*Common Sense*, linkffn(4019373), is a nice collection of one-shots showing how common sense would have helped in various scenarios.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.

** One Shots:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4487319/1/The-Greatest-Minister-of-Magic][The Greatest Minister of Magic]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4321429/1/Yes-Minister][Yes, Minister]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/7/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib, Chapter 7]]\\
The premise is that Harry is almost a a squib and needs to be smart on how to get around challenges. The author's take on the Deathly Hallows is pretty great.

EDIT: The story OP lists is based off of "What Should Have Happened in Avatar the Last Airbender", which (while not HP related) is absolutely hillarious

  Points of divergence in the Harry Potter universe. Those moments where someone really ought to have taken a step back and asked, "Wait, what?" An ongoing collection of one-shots. Episode 16: Why I Like You.

  Hinata is getting married! And not to Naruto! How is this happening? An old promise puts our favorite female Hyuuga in a bit of a bind, but when idiocy on Naruto's part leads to a last minute tryst, will Hinata and Naruto find their second chance? Started before knowledge of The Last. Sorry if this summary is sucky, but I'm just starting. Lemons and bad language. COMPLETE.
