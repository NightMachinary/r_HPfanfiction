Just a random thought I had, I tried to keep Harry in character but you'll have to accept him being a little OOC.

The basic idea is that Harry needs to stay alive until all his friends are gone so he can protect them, and because he went about destroying Voldeys soul with the intent of killing him his own soul is unstable. After recognising this Harry creates a Horcrux with his best friend (which friend is your choice) as an anchor. But Harry becomes paranoid (either from soul damage or mental trauma from a war) and so he convinces his new Horcrux and 5 other people to turn each other into Horcruxes (I don't know how, maybe at this point murder is ok) and now Harry has a magically powerful number of people forming an interconnected web of soul anchors, and all of them are accidentally permanently immortal, unless someone can kill all 7 of them simultaneously.

Side note, there is a council of such immortal light lords (light lords who murdered a bunch of people) who watch over the world, and Voldemort originally created 365 Horcruxes, 359 of which this council destroyed, and they where getting around to the other 7 but it's hard you know.

Edit: It had been pointed out that the vessel anchors the soul, and so this probably wouldn't work. If you want a more complex answer to fix this then either: 1) If there is a soul then the soul is the anchor, as fanfics do for Harry. 2) All vessels are indestructible bar fiendfyre, basilisk venom etc, not just the inanimate vessels. 3) Magic. Just, magic.


** I'm not sure that would work. It would seem to me that if you turn someone into a Horcrux, their /body/ is the Horcrux, not their soul; after all, the point of a Horcrux is to be a physical vessel for the soul-shard. So whether or not the living-Horcrux is themselves immortal through Horcruxes of their own is irrelevant; if their body gets destroyed, /their/ soul will live on, but not the soul-shard they were a host to.

*** Ack! Foiled by those tiny details... There's a fic where Harry's body is indesctructable because that's a quality of all vessels not just inanimate ones in someone's AU. I don't know, I guess it doesn't work but we could still just say magic?

It's actually a further misconception that Horcruxes are inherently indestructible. Dark Wizards just put a lot of very strong protective enchantments on them when they make them, for --- obvious reasons.

***** I didn't think this was the case, because 1) Diarymort was indestructible, and Tom was still in school when he made that one. 2) If people could make things indestructible then why doesn't anyone else do it? 3) Why did Voldemort only do the one type of invincibility? The one susceptible to fiendfyre or basilisk venom is good, but Dumbledore can cast fiendfyre, and Tom knows there is a basilisk under the school.

Was it? I don't think we saw anyone try aside from second year students, and surely even school-aged Tom could protect against their best efforts.

** I prefer the term 'Bright lord' for 'light-aligned' overlords. Rolls off the tongue better.

**** I vaguely remember them being in big vogue in fanfics a few years back. I first encountered the term Bright Lord in the LOTR Shadow of Mordor/War games though.

** Nah; a family ring that never leaves my hand, a charmed unbreakable average rock at the bottom of some ocean somewhere, a bit of an extra-solar space plobe (unbreakable too), a piece of PVC wedged vaguely in the middle of the Australian Tectonic Plate (in a 3 meter cube the world suddenly forgot existed), a speck of iron oxide on Mars (this one unenchanted), and the American Declaration of Independence sound like Much better Crux's.

Oh, and I Oblivated the entire experience of #2, #3, and #4 from my head, and everywhere else, and made myself forget where I put #5 (and made myself think it was a grain of ordinary sand), I only made two horcruxes, for three total pieces, a ring, and a priceless artifact. Worst case, I get caught and they extract the existence of a fourth piece, I â€˜know' it's a grain of sand, but not where it is. And it's unenchanted, so Good Luck, With That.

---------

Of course, I don't want to live forever; and it's a good thing too, because that's what I would do.
