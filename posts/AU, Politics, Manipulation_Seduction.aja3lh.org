The Weasleys and the Potters are a famous Magical Family, James and Lily would be alive and Ron, Harry and Draco would possibly be Friends or atleast have a better connection than in Canon. However, Harry is about to adopt the Family business from his Father/Family. The Malfoys are eager to own the Business and want to take it slowly, especially Lucious. He sends Narcissa or Bellatrix (or they go on their own, since they have the same intention) as a "adviser", since Harry is so Young and unexperienced...with the intention to lure him with their attractivity so that he would do more and more Favours for the Malfoys. The "Adviser" however at some point starts to have a crush on the Boy and doubts her actions.

â€‹

Whether Harry is really unexperienced (which he actually is, since he never lead such a Business) or was teached by his Father/Parents (atleast in Theory) and so enjoys the "company" that the female adviser would give is up to the Fic.

Harry would be Full Age, since this is the lowest possible age to enter the Politics. Narcissa/Bellatrix seducing Harry and having sex with him would also be welcomed.
