I'm a massive fan of HP, and I've reread the series countless times. Having just finished another reread recently, I'm looking for something to fill the Harry-sized hole in my heart. I've never read any ff, so give me recommendations! Where should I start?


** Here are my recommendations...

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/khk06/fan_fiction_how_to_separate_good_ones_from_the/][This is my standard fic rec comment (fanfiction recommendation):]]

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619][After the End by Arabella and Zsenya]] - Definitely one of the greats. It was started after /GoF/ and the epilogue was published the night /OotP/ was released. It's twice as long as /OotP/. It's one of the most faithful characterizations I've ever come across and was a totally plausible ending for what we knew at the time. Brilliantly written and you fall in love with the characters again.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] - One of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics out there. It all goes horribly wrong by the end and the only survivors are Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Nearly suicidal in their depression, they find a way to go back in time to make sure everyone survives. Make sure you read Parts II and III as well, although III hasn't been touched in 2 years.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HPATPS.html][Barb LP's Psychic Serpent Trilogy]] - Another post-/GoF/ that covers Harry's last 3 years, I'm hesitant to suggest this. It's wonderfully written for the most part, but I've always felt there was a touch /too much/ personal drama in the relationships, as if she forgot they were just teenagers. But where the series shines is how very /British/ it feels. You get a much stronger sense of the geography and culture of the British Isles that I feel makes it worth the read. Also her oneshots [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/MATB01.html][Mad About the Boy]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HAH01.html][Horntails and Hippogriffs]] are /delightful/ and give you the fuzzies.

[[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=2422][The F Words Series by Antosha]] - Taking place and published immediately after the last chapter of /DH/ (but before the epilogue), these are some of the most amazing fics I've ever read. You get to see the characters pull themselves together again after the Battle of Hogwarts. The next time you finish reading /DH/, start reading the series and prepare to have the bittersweet feeling held at bay for a mite longer. Although really everything by this author is amazing. His characterizations are always spot-on and his Luna is probably the best you'll find aside from Rowling's canon.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - If you haven't read this, you need to do so immediately. The hands-down most hilarious and brilliant fanfic to come out in years. From the description: "Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter... " This should be required reading for everyone.

There are more that I could suggest but I think these represent the very best in terms of story, character, and writing. Plus it's hard to come up with these lists.

If you just type in "fanfiction" or "fanfic" or "fan fiction" or "fan-fiction" in the search reddit box to the right, you'll find more threads.

As far as sites go, I'll second the recommendations for [[http://www.checkmated.com/][checkmated]] and [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/][simplyundeniable]]. I'll also add [[http://sugarquill.net/][The Sugarquill]] (one of the earliest R/H repositories), [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/][PhoenixSong]] (which rose from the ashes of the great GryffindorTower), and [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/][thequidditchpitch]]. Fanfiction.net is like youtube: 99% crap; but there are still some real gems in there if you know where to look. Usually you can cut a lot of the crap by fiddling with the filters (rating>all, books only, word count > 100k, character pairings optional)

This is the story that got me hooked on fan fiction. I saw an oblique reference plus a link to a review on an unrelated blog I read regularly, followed the link to the review, where I found mention of this subreddit and of fanfiction.net, and I've been hooked ever since. At home I have the Chrome extension (don't remember the name) that tracks your browsing time & displays a nifty chart. 40% of the tracked time is on fanfiction.net. Reddit is around 20%, and no other website is in double digits.

** It depends on what you want. In a sufficiently big and old fandom, thousands upon thousands of different premises and ideas have been explored, with a hugely varying level of quality. Do you want to see a story where Voldemort is the hero and Dumbledore the villain? There are many of those, and a few are even readable. A passionate romance between Draco and Hermione? Ditto.

You strike me as an unreserved fan of the books, so I would recommend stories that capture their feel of the early books. Here are two:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]]: Harry and Hermione investigate the disappearance of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sally-Anne_Perks][Sally-Anne Perks]], who, in the books, was sorted just before Potter but then wasn't called to be tested for the OWLS (even though her name would be between Patil and Potter, both of whom were called). What was probably an error by Rowling, the writer spins out into a mystery.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]]: Simply put, Ron was born a girl. Changes ensue, but the spirit is preserved.

Some fanfics explore characters' ambitious sides. Indeed, the Sorting Hat had tempted Harry with greatness, if he were to choose Slytherin. What if he had? Unfortunately, vast majority of fanfics that answer that question are complete crap, but a few are good. The best one (in my opinion) is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On_the_Way_to_Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]. Of course, Hermione does not lack in ambition either, and she goes through her own Slytherin journey in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]].

There are other categories. I'll try to post more when I have the time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][Growing Up Black]] was my first real taste of hp fan fiction. It's a great alternate-universe where Harry is rescued by the Black family and is magically altered to be the supposed son of Sirius. Warning, it's incomplete. My second real fan fic read was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]]. After Snape dies, he's transported back in time to his worst memory, the day he lost Lily's friendship.

I read those two to completion and they got me hooked. Maybe you'll have a similar experience. Oh, and here's my current favorite fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8766329/1/A-Promise-From-Her-Boy][A Promise From Her Boy]]. Only 20k words long, and it really tugged on my heartstrings.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness]] Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is a classic, at least for me. The level of development given to relatively minor characters in the series is awesome. This one one of the first ones I read, and I just keep coming back to it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1550595/Thanfiction]] I would also really recommend pretty much everything by this author. There is a really good sequel to DAYD called Sluagh, and it's just as good if not better. There are also a ton of little oneshots that give you extra peeks into the lives of his characters.

1000/10 would recommend.

They are very long though. I'm a fan of long ones, but they're not for everyone.

** I'm sure plenty of people will recommend Harry-centric stories, but since we already have those without fan fiction, I'll give you these instead:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] is the definitive Snape story, and in my opinion the best piece of fan fiction ever written. 100% book compliant, so this doesn't have a happy end... but this is the story of Snape's life, so happiness doesn't have much place there. But this is a must read if you want a slow paced character piece that will take a character and really give him depth. 650k words (that's 2/3rds the length of the entire seven HP books), but worth it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is arguably everything good about fan fiction. It pokes a bit of fun at how characters are portrayed, has moments that are funny, angsty, impressive, and subtle - sometimes all at the same time. Also, one of the rare cases where the author absolutely nailed the characterizations, and makes brilliant use of the alternate universe. At around 100k words, it's an easy and smooth read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]] is my favorite Ron-centric story. It has quidditch, romance, and a short and sweet narrative. While Ron stories usually suck, this one is a must read. A very to-the-point 15k words that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8444317/1/How-Crap-TV-Saved-the-World][How Crap TV Saved the World]] is a darkly funny one-shot. At under 7k words, it is the shortest of the bunch, but the twisted humor is downright awesome. Easily worth the short read. Also: RITA RITA RITA!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9515485/1/Hednon-%CF%9F-The-stickey-feather][Hednon ϟ The stickey feather]] is everything that's wrong with fan fiction. This is the definition of a crackfic. Also, eww. Also, funny. Again, eww.

** It's pretty much abandoned, but if you don't mind slash, Josephine Darcy's The Marriage Stone is a pretty good read and other authors are attempting to finish it. Of course, the good ones update maybe twice a year...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3120832/1/Some-Say]['Some Say,']] perhaps the best oneshot I've ever read, concerning a memorial erected on Hogwarts' grounds for a certain Severus Snape.

You are GOING to cry.

  I have spent the past ten years religiously reading HPFF and I barely scratched the surface.

Every time I see a thread like this, I wind up with another ten stories bookmarked for later reading. It's like I need a time turner to keep up with it all.
