I'm sick of all the fics that show Cedric Diggory as the perfect friend and embodiment of fair play. It just gets boring really quick. Especially considering all those angsty OOTP and HBP fics where Harry spents five chapters recalling how great Cedric was.

So I wondered if there were fics where he is shown in a bad light without turning him into a rapist or making him cartoonishly stupid. People make good guys out of Dumbledore, Snape and Malfoy, so don't argue about twisting a character.


** Have you read Cursed Child? I have never actually read it, but I think he becomes a death eater or something in another time line.

*** Even Rowling wrote him as the good guy. Although his hint was a little cryptic and he did too little about the Hufflepuff idiots with Malfoy's badges he is still looking good compared to the flaws of other characters like Dumbledore sentencing a toddler to "ten dark years" of torture and abuse or Molly Weasley praising rape drugs in front of children.

**** Yes, but you're asking for bashing of a character that actually went /against/ Harry at a point so any badly written TWT with him in it would satisfy you.

***** In a good story he'd be overwhelmed by his sudden popularity and do some stupid or unkind things due to that.

In a bad TWT story he'd try to rape Hermione. These type of fics usually have atrocious grammar and a stupid plot. I'm asking for something worth reading and not just some digital trash.

*** Well, I'm ok with bashing as long as it makes sense. Molly proudly admitting to have used rape drugs? Call her out on that, make her an evil scheming bitch who tries to set up "happy" marriages for their kids. That's not far from her original character since Harry and Hermione only need a small nudge in the right direction. But making her some sort of evil potion queen who gives every Order member ten different potions on Dumbledore's orders? That's just way over the top. I like my bashing somewhat plausible.

As for Cedric, I'm just bored of seeing him as the bland good guy in every story. I read a couple where he's the lead or at least significantly helps Harry/Hermione but now I want something new and different.

**** It's nice that you don't want crazy bashing, but you still seem to have twisted ideas of some characters.

Wizarding society as a whole needing to change how it views Love Potions does not equal Molly Weasley is a rapist. Because she isn't. And if she was, it would have been mentioned like it was with Merope Gaunt.

***** She used them on Arthur before they were married. Now, in Britain women cannot rape men due to some legal terms requiring penetrarion but in most countries using substances that remove ones inhibitions to not have sex with a person is illegal and the resulting act is called rape. And we are not talking about knowingly drinking alcohol but slipping someone the Potions without their knowledge.

Metrope Gaunt is not better but that does not change the fact that both committed an act that many countries classify as rape.

If I grew up in a society that has no problem with rape that wouldn't change the fact that I'm still doing highly amoral things. Just because my culture is ok with that does not make it ok.

  Mrs Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.

Exactly. It's like no one bothers to read the whole thing, they just jump straight to their conclusions and bashing. There's also more than one type of love potion too.

****** Molly Weasley raped no one. No one at all. Merope Gaunt did. That is the simple and undeniable fact.

My point about Love Potions is that Wizarding society doesn't see them as rape drugs. And, with rare exception, they don't use them as rape drugs either. Evidence of that is the fact that 6th years are taught how to make them. Whatever Molly Weasley did with a love potion, it wasn't raping Arthur, or anyone else for that matter.
