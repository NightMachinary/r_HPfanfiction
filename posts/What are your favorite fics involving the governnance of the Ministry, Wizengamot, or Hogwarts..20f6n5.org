I'm looking for fanfic that focuses on the ins and outs and political wrangling of the governing institutions of the wizarding world. Things like jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4218986/1/Unlikely-Allies][Unlikely Allies]] (about the Hogwarts Board of Governors) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5713064/1/Little-Red-Courgette][Little Red Courgette]] (a Yes Minister-style spoof on the wizarding civil service).


** A Bad Week at the Wizengamot. Short (relatively), sweet and hilarious

*** Read that one, a little over the top but very funny.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]] by CatsAreCool has quite a bit of political wrangling. A bit heavily dosed on the WAFF, but there's at least a lot to read; 600k words, WIP.
