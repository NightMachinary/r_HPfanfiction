I've noticed that in stories where James somehow lives ( especially ones where James lives and Lily dies) James ends up being a dick to Harry and to the other marauders if they aren't dicks to Harry( sometimes they are too)

So any fic where James lives and is actually a good parent who has a good relationship with Harry and the Marauders do as well. Not like a fixit i do want something that has still a good plot and death eater issues and all that. But with James being like a good single parent i guess. Not ship focused but im good with anything slash and fem slash is good too but more focus on plot and friendship not romance.


** I mean, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11831304/1/A-Father-First-Damn-It]]) has the best Potters Ever, atleast as far as Harry is concerned. They aren't Hufflepuffs though.

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.

Sure, we can say that James was in shock and need some time to process what happened. After a few days, James still keeps telling everyone in the Order that Peter was the secret keeper, so then why is he being ignored and brushed off?

In canon, Sirius Black was imprisoned without a trial because of general incompetence and the lack of witnesses, but here James is alive, so why is there not a trial, and why are people still ignoring James?

**** Fair critiques, thank you. It's a combination of incompetence, a world still recovering from years of terror, misinformation being spread (the Prophet is, was, and always will be trash), a legal system that is completely useless but still has to process actual criminals, a backlog of said actual criminals - including within the ranks of Ministry employees - and above all, the need for a scapegoat. And Sirius is it. Also, James's priorities are a bit...skewed, I suppose, at twenty-one years. He's trying to adjust to life as the primary caretaker of a toddler. It's been about three weeks, max, in-story. Lily was buried a week after James wakes up, and he went back two weeks after that. My guy James Potter's got a trial coming up with Wizarding Family Services, after which he'll work on the utter joke that is the Wizarding legal system.

Thanks again for your comments, though. You've given me a fair bit of work to do, and may have broken my writer's block!
