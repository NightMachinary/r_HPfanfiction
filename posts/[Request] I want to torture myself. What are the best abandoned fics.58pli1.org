** linkffn(1594791) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1594791/1/Backwards-Compatible][Backwards Compatible by Ruskbyte]] is a great unfinished Peggy Sue fic.

linkffn(3983128) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock]], also by Ruskbyte, is a great unfinished HP crossover with Banks' "Culture" universe. If you know that universe, you'll probably be saying "how the hell do you cross those two??", but it really works.

linkffn(8823447) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] is a fairly recent Peggy Sue fic featuring an insanely overpowered Hermione. I still have some vague hope it might update again someday.

linkffn(9778984) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] by Taure is a really great story in which Harry receives part of Albus Dumbledore's memories just after Albus' death. It's really amazing, and the fact that there isn't more of it always saddens me.

linkffn(6738586) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6738586/1/The-Sun-Dog][The Sun Dog by Enembee]] is a weird AU in which Harry is a squib. Or maybe he isn't. And in which one Tom Riddle is the Minister of Magic. I am sure it will never update, which makes me sad. *SAD I TELL YOU. SAD.*

So does the fact that Enembee's series that starts with linkffn(5201703) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]] and linkffn(5971274) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] never got its third and final part. It's really well written and then, well, you realize you'll never even guess how it ends, and he's never going to write an ending.

And finally, might I recommend the really weird, short (so far and likely forever) and amazing and very much never going to update linkao3(4789592) [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4789592/chapters/10960700][Unspeakables by Turnpike]], which has possibly the creepiest Slytherin!Harry ever with the saddest backstory.

** linkffn(The Wizard from Earth) It's slow, the events of the story are in time and place riciculously far away from anything in canon, but I love utterly love it. I think the style is great, if you change just a couple of things it might as well be completely original fiction (and a pretty good one at that), which is rare for fanfiction. Most fanfction relies a lot on out pre-built affection for the charachters, the setting and the story. The Wizard from Earth doesn't.

It's grand, it's epic, and it ends at what is basically its beginning.

Go hurt yourself with it.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

linkff (Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer) linkff (Harry Potter and the Debts to Destiny)

No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim, great fic where Harry isn't the BWL at all and loses all his fanon/canon benefits. Way it looks at family magics isn't my cup of tea but it leaves at a great Juncture

linkff (No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim)

Temperatio Temporalis, Great premises of taking all the time travel fics to the extreme. With Harry, Hermione and Luna going back to prevent all the bull shit that happens in Canon asap

** Funnily enough, I just finished re-reading Josephine Darcy's /The Marriage Stone/ about an hour ago. I typically revisit it once or twice a year--have since about 2009. You'd think I'd get bored of it, but I never do. Each re-read makes me fall in love with it all over again.

I would pay a large sum of money for this fic to be finished, tbh.
