Trying to figure out how the economy works in my AU and I'd like someone to bounce ideas off of without it degrading into a debate on economics itself. I'm a fan of Mises if that explains things. ;)

Also, anyone really familiar with the history and inner workings of the various forms of feudalism up through the Early Modern Period would be more than welcome.

... well literally everything I can think of, tbh. But at the moment I'm hashing out the daily life details since I've gotten most of the big world-dev stuff rough hewn enough to know where I'm going with it and have something to go on. And I'm mulling over a sort of feudal structure but with a very bureaucratic Ministry that's more modern, but with the Statute and the goblins and magic screwing everything up so I can't just cut and paste a particular historical practice. I'm a bit OCD about thinking through consequences of world building choices, lol.

But your comment about food and fashion is very pertinent to some of the other bits I'm tackling atm, too. I'm still stuck on male wizarding robes, for example. And food plays a big part in my feudal structure, too.

**** That sounds like an interesting fic! Is is a long fic? Since you said it spans from feudalism up through the Early Modern Period. The consequences of world building are the best but super hard to do. I've been rattling my brain on what would happen if you had people actively trying to break the Statute of Secrecy.

Since everything was so classed based back then you'd have to break down what info you needed by class and era.

I'd look to cultures where robes where the norm to get some ideas. For male wizarding robes I'd look at ancient Chinese robes and see how the male and female clothing differ. Not exactly copy the style but make bullet points at how the two are separate like clothing cuts or accessories. Here's a tumblr post where someone wrote how they think Hogwarts robes should have been like based on book evidence: [[http://thereisareaper.tumblr.com/post/132276464879/hogwarts-school-uniform]] Also I have no evidence for this but I get the feeling that the image we have a wizarding robes (like from DnD) has some bases in western monk clothes.

Don't even get me started on food! I wouldn't know where to stop.

***** Thanks a million for that link! I love that kind of analysis. Though I'm still wondering how in the world they ride broomsticks with robes like that.

It's planned to be 8 books (possibly becoming 9...) rewriting the Hogwarts years, but I'm emphasizing the fact that the wizarding world forked off from the muggle world in the 17th century, and that when a population isolates itself it tends to stagnate and regress rather than progress forward. And with longer lifespans, wizarding culture would be more influenced by generations further back, reducing change and reinforcing tradition. So their mindsets and culture would be still back in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period. Huge culture shock for muggleborns!

Food is a big deal!!! :D I'm having fun developing culinary charms and such, and now I've decided on my interpretation of the transfiguration rules, I have a better idea of what they can and can't do with food.

Btw, the latter portions of my series will revolve heavily around the Statute and its fall. ;) If you're interested in seeing more of what I'm going for, [[https://brilliantshard.wordpress.com/what-you-can-expect/][here's a page on my blog about it.]]

****** I know right?! I'm surprised not that many people have the wizards righting saddle side in their fics. I get having specialized clothing for quidditch, but broomstick riding seems like such a hassle. I beat it's only taught in Hogwarts because of traditions because otherwise it makes no sense. It's why it's only taught in first year. Outside of their one main sport, brooms really aren't that useful. Unless they're rebranded for casual use. Why aren't people riding their broom around Diagon Alley? Why aren't they treated like a bike for carrying their purchases? If they're like a jet pack, why would you walk around a shopping center? I have a lot of thought about a lot of things concerning HP.

That sounds like an absolutely amazing story. Culture shock is so much fun to read. I don't know if it'll help but there's video explaining how Harry Potter is clearly a produce of the 90s and it's mindset especially economically: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mxgSq1wiPk&list=FLm30gcMDG5TkNS_JYbQlisw&index=45&t=881s]] it's long but worth it. Looking at your website, Harry Potter mixed with H.P.Lovecraft?! Yes, give me more, I need this in my life.

On the topic of food, since for a long time food was the subject of it's time and what ingredients people had access to, it influenced what kind of recipes were created. So for the rich, since they had access to a lot of sugar and foreign spices, they came up with some really strange dishes while the poor had more hardy simple food. I'm curious how that'll effect wizarding cooking styles. Here's a simple video on why food plays a huge role in literature in case you were wondering: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qoJgTwDCQM&list=PL1mtdjDVOoOor6Ihzmr1m6C0SpfMB-0tH&index=11&t=2s]]

ah the Statute. I have a draft post I was working on with some of my thoughts around the Stature being broken in case you're interested.

You sound like you're taking this story very seriously and that's so exciting for what you're aiming for.

******* Haha, I did think of side saddle quidditch actually. I mean, it's how broomstick riding was depicted historically I believe. But I was just thinking, what about a bifurcated and pleated robe kind of like the [[https://www.google.com/search?q=hakama&tbm=isch&oq=hakama][Japanese Hakama?]] It has a very wizarding robe-like feel to it that I love, and would be practical for quidditch, dueling, riding, whatever.

I was really impressed with linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) and how she incorporated broomstick riding into daily life. Family-size broomsticks with a 'trunk' and a sort of road system above the clouds, etc.

I'll look into those, videos, thanks! :D

Yeah, I think there are a lot of inhibitory regulations making muggle imports very expensive and difficult, so only wizarding nobles would get the benefit of muggle culinary globalization, and there's also a lot of barriers to concourse between wizarding covens (i.e. between the Britannic Coven and the French Coven etc.), so foreign magical ingredients would also be at a premium, so there would be a sharp divide between classes and their diets.

I'd love to read that! I started a thread on here a while back talking about where I'm going with it in my story, I'll have to dig it up and link you.

Glad to hear you're interested! :)

******** Do you know the history on why brooms became associated with woman and later on witches? It's cause of beer. The image we have of witches (pointy hats, broomsticks, cat familiars) are tied to the history of women making beer. [[https://brewhoppin.com/2015/10/the-truth-of-women-and-beer-witches/]] It leads me to wonder how big a role alcohol plays in the wizarding world. Alcohol plays a huge role in any society especially what kind you drink and where it came from (for example when Britain and France were at war the rich would drink Port from Portugal instead of wine from France). Beer was consumed as the main drink cause water wasn't safe. For a long time babies went straight from breast milk to weak beer. But wizards can create water with magic. So would proper pure bloods reject alcohol and other vices? Would they be hypocrites and denounce them while secretly enjoying them? Or is it not a big deal like it is in modern Britain?

Witchcraft has a fascinating history with feudalism/early capitalism and how basically it was a threat to those in power. Might be something worth looking into.

While it would look neat to have pants like that and my mind did go to them at first I don't know if they'd be practical at least for quidditch. I honestly don't mind the movie version of the quidditch outfits, but my main issue is the robe because that should cause serious drag on the player shouldn't it? At least the seeker's uniform shouldn't have it. Cultures like the wizarding world that have a difficult time changing rapidly would be more conservative with their clothing. Also the more fabric and layers you have equals to being more rich. Taking up more space with your clothing shows how important you are. A Japanese Hakama pants style would work for dueling, riding, everyday wear.

Haven't read Victoria Potter yet but it's on my list to read.

This is what I was gonna post about the Statute. It's just some questions and ideas I had if there was a group that didn't like the Statute and was trying to break it: "I'm not talking about Voldemort and his Death Eaters in wanting to take over the world and prove that wizards are supreme to everyone else. I'm talking about people who believe the separation of the two societies was a mistake to begin with and want to fix the situation because the longer it goes on, the worst it'll be when the two finally clash.

Are they considered a terrorist group? Or maybe an extremist group?

Is it being done by wizards? If yes, are they doing it because they don't want to hide anymore (not because they think they're better, but more in line with being proud of who they are much like the LGBT+ movement) or because they believe it's for the greater good to finally join the two societies?

Is it being done by muggles in the know? By muggles who have a magical family member? Or by those who somehow because of aware of magical society and are trying to expose the truth like conspiracy theories?

Are there philosophical discussions on hypothetical situations on what would happen if muggles knew of the magical world suddenly, vs gradually? What's the end point in which the two societies can stay separate?

I feel like there's so much potential for discussion, but that it'd be a monstrous task to work it into a plot."

I read the thread you posted. You came up with some really interesting ideas. Really grounded and not just the simple "oh we just erase the memories of muggles to keep the secret safe". I like how you brought it back to Arthur Weasley and his job.

I'm sorry if I'm bombarding you with all this info. I literally have no one to talk to about Harry Potter and history like this.

********* Fascinating link! I'll add it to my list of articles on the witch hunts. It's an incredibly complicated and murky thread of history. I've also found evidence that demographically witch hunts were targeted at landed, female singles of 45-60 years of age (mostly widows, basically) and it was basically a method for land grabs. Which that demographic doesn't fit real witches in-universe (particularly in my AU, in which this type of witch hunt wouldn't have touched a single real witch). I'm actually planning a motivation for the Statute that's not related to the actual witch hunts at all, and is mostly political in nature, with the witch hunts only used as a scapegoat to sway the populace.

I'm still deciding on the properties of transfigured alcohol. My current hypothesis is that it's just like normal just there isn't any nutritive content. Duplicating the brew while it's brewing would sterilize the yeasts and halt the maturation, but duplicating it after it's done would just spread out the nutrition like with food. There's also time-acceleration charms in my AU which would be awesome for brewing. Just some of where I've gone so far on that vein, lol.

More fabric = more status makes a ton of sense in my AU. Wizarding clothing is all charmed in various ways, which requires that it be woven from magical materials for the charms to last. That gets expensive fast. One of the common charms is to keep the hem down and also keep it from under your feet, for example. Quidditch robes would be charmed frictionless, which solves that puzzle, methinks.

There's actually a political party in my AU which advocates exactly what you're describing, called the Strong Modernists. The normal Modernists aren't anti-statute, but are pro-muggle and advocate ideals derived from muggle culture. I'm not going with the cliche and blah Dark and Light sides obviously.... :eye-roll: There's a religious party called the Merlinists who represent the "pagans" in counterpoint to the wizarding Catholic (of which there are at least two main factions), Independent Protestant, and a wizarding pseudo-Anglican faction of sorts, plus the Rationalists (remnants of the Renaissance, very sidelined and mostly in the Department of Mysteries), Traditionalists (center-line, conservative), Separatists (the moderate purebloods), and the Dominatists (radical Separatists who believe the magic should be stripped from muggleborns as soon as it's discovered, etc.). Very complicated and fun, hehe.

No worries! I love info-dumps. :D We should chat sometime and I can brain-dump my development so far and see what you think. I'm looking for more sounding boards to take some of the burden off my poor wife, lol!

********** I have a lot of ideas on how wizarding clothing should be more magical. Like fabric that matches the movement of the stars, that change color based on your mood, or the color changes with the day, animal prints that are active and like to move around the fabric (like simple portraits that don't talk), or fabrics that give off a certain scent all the time. Maybe some like having lighting flash on their robes. So many possibilities. In the Edwardian age ladies wore a bunch of dead birds on their hats. You could do the same for witches and have a fake animated animals on their clothing. In the books the wizards were so drab and muted, when historically those with money were very colorful and used lush colors to decorate their homes. Wall paper was /very/ important for the well-to-do.

aw man all these political and religious parties you came up with is really getting my brain rolling. I get why people don't like bring these topics up in their stories cause you have to deal with a lot of difficult questions, but that's exactly why they should be brought up in the first place. It really helps with the world building. (the best example of the worst way to mix fantasy and real history is on the Netflix movie Bright.) How connected to other magical communities are Britain wizards in your AU?

If you ever have questions on history, economics, aesthetics, I would love to help. I'm personally really left so politics is also in my wheelhouse.

*********** :wow: I love those ideas! And they fit so well!! I knew about the wallpaper (and murals, too, in the old castles) and I already planned to incorporate that. Imagine halls that look like paths through primeval forests because the walls are animated murals....

Yeah, it's venturing into hot button topics that might turn away readers, and make the writer's head hurt, lol. But art is so much More when it brings in those deeper elements well. Les Miserables is one of my favorite works mostly because of how well Victor Hugo brought the human soul in all its depth to the surface to be explored. Theme is as important as setting or plot or character! :rant over:

I'm restructuring the entire global wizarding community. Because wizards descended from Atlantis, and I'm tying those into the mysteriously historical Sea Peoples who appeared in the Mediterranean around the Bronze Age (if I'm remembering my notes correctly), among other reasons, the genetic trait of magic is highly concentrated around Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic coastlines. There are a few exceptions, such as Japan and some other east Asian cultures, but they aren't as significant on the international scale. The international wizarding power center was centralized in Spain (I think) before it moved to the Dutch Republic (and then the Netherlands when it changed names), but Wizarding Britannia was always a wizarding superpower alongside the ancient centers of magic like Egypt and Greece because of Merlin (who I've moved to his proper time before the Founding of Hogwarts; he actually taught the Four Founders). Wizarding communities in the Americas are still divided based on the old colonial empires, and there is no MACUSA (:shudders at anachronistic naming:).

That actually didn't answer your question, I just realized, lol. The answer is that British wizards do maintain contact, and have a great deal of political influence in the wider community. They were the first to enact the Statute, for example, though it took a bit for the others to follow suit (the ICW didn't exist as a governing body back then, and even when it formed it didn't have that name until after Grindelwald's War).

I'd love brainstorm with you! Fair warning, I'm not left by any means (I rather eschew political handedness... lol), but I still get along well with most of y'all, Haha. I want to include people who disagree with my own beliefs to participate in my development so I can present the different sides honestly. Does that make sense?

************ That's an interesting idea to have wizards be descended from Atlantis. It would keep the story more focused in Europe instead of hopping around the world. Why Spain and the Dutch Republic for the power center? I'd of thought it'd be Italy. And yes, let's just forget the Newt movies altogether. There are no mafia wizards which is what I was really hoping for so the prequel movies are dead to me.

It's fine if you're not left. Most of the people I know in my life aren't as left as me (yay for living in the south) and I think that's it's really good idea to bounce ideas off of others that have different view points as you when you're writing for a bunch of characters. It'd be boring if everyone's view points were either exactly the same or cartoonistly extreme. Compelling characters are those where you dislike their ideology, but not their personality.

You know, I don't even know what you're AU is about lol. Like I get the elements that are gonna be in it, but what's the summary of the plot? Is Harry even the main character?

************* Now I'm curious why you would have thought Italy, Haha. Spain mostly because it was a major world power which then had a strong inquisition, and its thriving wizarding population fled (which led to its school collapsing), so I have a nice event to precipitate a move of the locus of power of the Sorcerers Guild (which is the predecessor to the ICW). In ancient times it was in Egypt. The Dutch Republic and the Dutch East India Trading Company first came on my radar when plotting the wizarding history of Japan, and they featured there strongly. And they popped up again when I was developing the political sequence of the adoption of the Statute of Secrecy and it fit really nicely.

*************** True, but the Catholic church wasn't particularly friendly always towards the wizards. There were a few popes which accepted them, and there are wizards who reverence the muggle pope, but mostly since 1738 when Pope Clement XII published the Bull /In Eminenti/ there wasn't much love lost between the communities. The whole religious side of wizarding history and culture is something I'll be exploring mostly through Seamus's character arc ("Mum's a witch, Dad's a muggle -- she's a Protestant, he's a Catholic -- bit of a mixed-up family I have.") as he struggles with his Catholic beliefs and tries to reconcile them with the wizarding world.

Yeah, there's a lot of British pride even if it's not tied to an allegiance to the Queen. Wizarding Britannia is a completely separate country after all. That's actually one bit I need to research more. Since the wizarding world broke off in the late 17th century, which view of succession did they predominately hold, and how many of them actually recognize the legitimacy of the current reigning lineage at all? But since they still see themselves as part of ancient Britannia there is still a ton of nationalist pride regardless.

I think there's actually a stronger tie between the Gringotts goblins and the British East India Trading Company than there was with British wizards and the company. Though I need to look into how Marshall, Carter, & Dark from the SCP universe related to the company to see if they might actually be market rivals instead. So much fun weaving three universes together... haha!

Yeah I was wondering how wizards viewed the crown. I wonder if there would be like sovereign citizens wizards that don't even acknowledge the authority of the crown? That the muggle government is illegitimate. Depending on when in the 17th century the wizarding world broke off from the muggles would maybe color their view of the monarchy. If it was during the Puritans when Britain didn't have a monarchy that mindset might of stuck. And the Puritans banned all things fun so the wizards could have been like "nope! We're bouncing!" But the window that the Puritans ruled was very small. After that is was King Charles II who was very popular but had maaaany illegitimate children so maybe that'll play a role? James II only ruled for a couple of years and William and Mary were basically invited to be rulers. Just spit balling here.

I'm only barely knowledgeable on SCP lore. I'll have to start doing my own research to catch up.

**** Feudalism, strictly speaking stopped being a thing for 90% of Europe after the black death. A good short while before the Early Modern Period started. *

Now for Feudalism it's self that is a bigger issue as most people love [[https://westerneuropefeudalism.weebly.com/uploads/4/6/0/8/46087777/3554982_orig.png?335][this]], and indeed it might be considered the archetype of Feudalism and how it should work. We do know that in reality it might be rather lopsided. Take England and France up trough the 100 years war. Where England was a king of England and a duke of France at the same time. Allowing the English king to alternatively use England as a source to secure his power in France and his french lands as a source to secure his powers in England.And then the always lovely HRE: Where power was always consolidating and dividing itself. At least until the Hapsburg got into power. And then there's the Golden Bull of 1356 that constitutionalised (Or at least as good as) which princes was eligible for electing the next Emperor. And here again we see a lot of the same power dynamics of larger princes getting territory that is outside the HRE and not bringing it in as it'd allow them to have an external source with which to challenge others within the empire and usually being capable of drawing in other empire states to defend their territories from outside threats.

I'm home from Uni right now so I only brought the actual medieval book with me, but if I can I'll try to give a more in depth aid to less broad questions.

I'm thinking that wizarding society evolves glacially compared even to medieval times, because of the long generations. And magical bonds and wards aren't easily updated or modified, so revolutionary changes in real estate management would be few and far between. So when they did their hard fork at the end of the 17th century they were already advocating preservation of the older ways, and wouldn't have changed much since then. Viable?

******* Indeed. In my AU I'm going for if you survive 2 years you'll likely live to your thirties, which is when most occupational hazards and disease vulnerabilities peak. If you survive that, you'll most likely live past 100. After that it's mostly dependent on your magical power and gender (males outlive females, due to magical menopause): average witches will live to around 100, wizards to 150; exceptional mages will live another 50 or so; and world class sorcerers like Dumbledore would live a natural life up to 300 years or so. Flamel lived over twice that, and in my AU he's going strong and looks like [[https://imgur.com/gallery/iIivc][Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter]] -- age just doesn't affect him.

So definitely a huge societal lag. :)

Anyway, yeah, that's the kind of stuff I'm trying to study (mostly via wikipedia and YouTube). My idea is that there's a wizarding feudalism that's unique to them that developed since before the founding of Hogwarts. They were already segregated though not secret and had their own society long before the Statute, and the Statute just cemented the isolationism. I have broad-brush concepts for how their society functions but I'm wanting to hammer out details. Interested?

****** So by class based I'd imagine either Feudalistic or Age of Revolutions based. At the end of the day the difference is just a larger and actual middle class. Lawyers, doctors etc that would be part of the third Estate under feudalism, but under the new class system they ended up at least in the middle class. The Estates was the first: Priests, bishops, archbishops and other clergy positions of note. Second Estate: The Nobles and Royalty. And Finally third: The rest. Or: The prayers. The warriors. The Workers.

By dividing into classes you got a more actual division because you could have merchants who were part of the third estate that was richer than noblemen. And Noblemen that was poorer than most merchants. Though I'd say they are usable at the same time, though for different purposes.

Isolationism, the USA up-to WW2 * 1 Billion. To showcase the extremity here: After WW1 they borrowed money to Germany so they could rebuild their industry and help them pay down their debts to Britain who in turn needed to pay their debt to the USA. So America has a vested interested in Germany managing to have an industry to pay their debts. But then they also decided to hike their tariffs, which generally was already quite high. To a point that selling German wares in the US to raise the money needed was dropped because they'd effectively lose more money than they'd earn in doing it. The increase of tariffs was seen as a good way to lower taxes as they'd have guaranteed trade goods coming in.

Socialistic Bureaucracy is not a term I know but a google search gave me [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_collectivism][this]], if correct it'd be stereotypical communism in reality without the welfare.

I'd say it'd be like we see in Europe before vs after the black death. *A surplus of workers lead to decreased wages while a sudden and rapid decrease of workers will lead to a higher wages because of higher demand. But because all major industries are government owned those industries are likely to be secure in workforce, if not work quality.*

******* Oh, thanks for bringing up the Three Estates! One of the things I have been thinking about that connects them to the current discussion is that the peasants made up 80% of the population, and were occupied with farming. Now, I won't get into the complexities of wizarding digestion and nutrition and transfiguration of edibles in my AU in this post, but the pertinent conclusion is that magically farming food is easy and efficient enough for a single person to grow enough in their spare time off a smallish plat to feed a small village. A single magical plantation tended by house elves can feed several cities of wizards. Food is abundant, cheap, and accessible by all. This means that's 80% of the labor market gone, basically. The lowest class would be squibs and those who failed their OWLs and lost their wands (making them functionally squibs), and they'd basically be servants, and they wouldn't make up a huge proportion of the population. The largest class would be the bourgeoisie. Does that track?

Also, wondering if Masters of magic might be considered First Estate along with clergy. Just something I'm pondering.

******** Yeah, House Elves do remove the farmers. But even so from an Estates perspective there'd be a lot of other's that would fill in the group of the Third Estates. Canonically I'd have no issue believing that muggleborns would be automatically in the Third Estate when the Wizarding world was at it's strictest. And probably a good part of the non-ministerial jobs as well would be considered as: "Much too unimportant to allow them any political power/ allow them any say in how the country should be governed"

​

But the Burgiouse would probably end up being a lot larger than the other's since they are more or less 80-ish% of the population.

Meanwhile your question about the First estate and Master of Magic will require your definition of what that is. Right now I'll assume it'd be akin to the fanon term of Master of "Insert magical subject here" which again seems like an odd cross of an Ma/MS and a PhD. In which case I'd say no, while not the most normal thing to come across within the magical world I'd say it'd be too normal for such a position

Only when feudalism basically stopped functioning and the masses gained ecnomic power goverment was able to build a strong beaurocracy and that meant the end of the land owning class. Not immediately but that was the start of the end. So those things simply do not go hand in hand.
