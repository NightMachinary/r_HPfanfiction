  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing.

I've laughed my ass of at this one several times. I highly recommend it

** Maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783269/1/World-Enough-and-Time][World Enough and Time]] has Britain!Bashing basically, so except for very few individuals most of Hogwarts students and teachers are written as pretty mean (/stupid?).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9048823/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Heirs][Harry Potter and the Four Heirs]] isn't the best fic, but it has some nice ideas and Dumbledore!bashing as well as idiot!Ron.

And finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7508571/1/The-Fall-of-the-house-of-Potter][The Fall of the house of Potter]] has a manipulative Dumbledore (which most of the time comes off as bashing anyway), as does [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832676/1/Petunia-s-Boys][Petunia's Boys]], which also features idiot!Ron most of the time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5443513/1/Ron-s-Howler][Ron's Howler]] is pretty entertaining.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]] contains Ron/Ginny/Snape/Dumbledore/Malfoy bashing galore.

Almost anything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1082315/broomstick-flyer][broomstick flyer]] bashes somebody, usually Ron, Dumbledore, and Ginny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10068083/1/Troll-Troll-in-the-Dungeon][Troll! Troll in the Dungeon!]] does a pretty good job of writing Ron as an idiot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837107/1/Tournament-Woes][Tournament Woes]] bashes Dumbledore through the whole thing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8554615/1/The-Lost-Summer][The Lost Summer]] nails Ron, Ginny, and Molly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7800174/1/Eating][Eating?]] bashes Ron.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4913777/1/Our-Turn][Our Turn]] sticks it to Ron and Ginny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3807777/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Acts-of-Betrayal][Harry Potter and the Acts of Betrayal]] bashes Ron, Ginny, and Dumbledore, but it has some pretty dark stuff in it, so be warned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3195738/1/It-s-for-the-Best][It's for the Best]] bashes Dumbledore.

Most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst's]] stories bash the Weasleys and Dumbledore, but the writing certainly isn't the best.
