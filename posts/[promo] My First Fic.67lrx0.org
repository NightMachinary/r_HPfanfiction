just posted my first fic, haven't decided if i will write additional chaps or not. it's a h/hr with light ron!bash, takes place 4th year right after Harry's entry into the TWT. linkffn(12463989)


** I haven't read your fic, but I'd just give the advice that bashing of any kind is ill advised and generally considered poor writing. While it's certainly acceptable to highlight a character's bad qualities, you definitely shouldn't hyperbolize their attributes to make a point.

I'd also recommend you remove the "light Ron!bash" from the summary. It's extremely off-putting, and if it is indeed only "/light/ bashing" you don't need to explicitly state it.

*** It's not light. I thought I would make a nice little post explaining the grammar rules around dialogue and discussing character voice and how to get it right, but when I got to the bit where Ron attacks hermione, calls her a stupid bitch and leaves her tied up in the common room, I thought it might be a waste of time. When Harry walked in and got a boner, that confirmed it.

  After Harry is entered in the TWT, Hermione and Ron have and argument. Harry come across the aftermath, leading both Harry and Hermione to discover new things about themselves. H/Hr light Ron!bash. TBC?
