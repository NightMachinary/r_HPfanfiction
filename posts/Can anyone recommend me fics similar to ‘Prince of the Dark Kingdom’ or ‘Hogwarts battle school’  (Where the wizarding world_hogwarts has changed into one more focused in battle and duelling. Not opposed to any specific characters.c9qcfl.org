#+TITLE: Can anyone recommend me fics similar to ‘Prince of the Dark Kingdom’ or ‘Hogwarts battle school’ ? (Where the wizarding world/hogwarts has changed into one more focused in battle and duelling. Not opposed to any specific characters nor slash) Thanks!

** Hasn't updated in a year, so probably abandoned. But in this HP RWBY fusion crossover Hogwarts and the magical world has reorganized itself into being very battle focused to deal with the threat posed by the Grimm.

** I think a good match would probably be linkffn(Reign of the Serpent), where Salazar basically became king of Britain and changed the rules of Western Europe.

You might also like linkffn(Skitterleap), an AU that depicts a world where Grindelwald defeated Dumbledore, and now Harry is a newly appointed soldier in Grindelwald's army on the eastern front.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

#+begin_quote
  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

** Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)

Big focus on ancient traditions. The Triwizard was never canceled. Dueling and curse breaking competitions.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
