  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** Agreed, I'd have raised holy hell if there were a teacher like him at my kid's school. Just because his feelings were hurt over something that had happened 15 or so years before does not excuse his treatment of his students.

**** But he'd put him in a role that doesn't deal with children as much if he could. Using mind-reading magic on schoolchildren, tolerating kids sabotaging each others' potions, ignoring bullying --

Unless that's a standard part of the Hogwarts experience. Snape wasn't hired because Slughorn retired; he was hired because a nameless other professor who antagonized students and maintained an unsafe environment left.

**** Most kids didn't know that though. All they saw was a professor who was insanely biased in the formative years that basically screwed an entire country out of potions education and undermined the disciplinary system.

Like when a 13 year old child's /greatest fear in the entire world/ is one of his teachers, that should've been a massive red flag to everyone involved.

** This the most realistic I've ever seen someone write Snape - linkffn(Hauntingly by ObsidianPen) He's not the focus of this fic, but he plays a significant role. You'd also have to read the first fic to understand what's really going on, but still. Excellent Snape characterization and motivation.

  Alive. Hidden. Concealed in the metaphorical closet, and the ominous, creaking footsteps outside belong to a monster... He's sniffing the air in anticipation. He's craving more than the scent. Intoxicated by his own bloodlust, and a fleeting moment of weakness is all he needs. "Harry Potter...I will have you..." HP/LV/TR. In the most unhealthy, twisted way. Sequel to 'Mine'.
