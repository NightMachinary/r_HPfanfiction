I've read a few of them already and here's what I've noticed. Many authors make Hermione not only the focal point of the fanfiction (which, obviously makes perfect sence), but they rewrite the story in such a way that she becomes the puppetmaster behing the chosen one and ultimately an over-powered witch. This happens regardless if it's just a re-write of the HP saga from Hermione's point of view or if we're given an alternate universe. I'm currently reading New Blood, a fic where Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, and she's already kinda badass in her first year.

But what do you guys think? And what are your favourite Hermione fanfics out there and why?


** The closer Hermione is to canon, the more I love the fic.

My absolute favorite Hermione-centric fic is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7559806/1/][Cry Out, Curlew]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1693442/][Evil Is A Relative Term]] - linkffn(7559806)

The fic just /gets/ Hermione. It explores her kindness, ambitions, and commitment to duty and is fearless in deconstructing exactly what it costs her to keep giving. It explores her relationship with power and justice, especially now that she, herself, is in a position of power. I also really loved the fic's emphasis on Hermione's near pathological self-reliance and how the people who love her are scrambling to care for her and keep her safe (part of which is an amazing role-reversal with Harry where it's now him who is despairing over her recklessness and lacking sense of self-preservation.)

The fic unfortunately looks to be abandoned, but it thankfully ends on a note that gives a sense of closure.

  Helping others was her passion. It became a revolution. With the power of an open mind, Hermione Granger changed the wizarding world forever.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

** [[/u/davidwelch158][u/davidwelch158]] already linked my favorite (and the perfectly reasonable explanation), but I also liked this one: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/716427][The One Where Hermione Has Good Intentions]]. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731/chapters/7591550]])

I have nothing against overpowered protagonists, but I like to see how it happened. For example in New Blood her rise to power was just too easy for my taste.

I also liked Six Pomegranate Seeds, but was seriously dissappointed by the ending. I feel like it was far too easy to undo the world ending catastrophe that prompted Hogwarts to send Hermione back in time. She didn't even find out what exactly went wrong in her original timeline. And not telling Ron and Harry that she's now in a new body? Didn't really make sense to me...

  Ginny made a thin, distressed sound. “I ... Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly.
