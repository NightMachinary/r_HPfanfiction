  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Linkffn (Browncoat Green Eyes) May not be quite what you're looking for, it's a Firefly crossover. But Harry is around 600+ years old and was in a kind of suspension until the events after the movie Serenity. So, it's long after the events of the Canon Potter books.

**** As [[/u/Power-of-Erised]] says, it's really friendly. You get a feel for the characters as you go because you get to learn about them at nearly the same pace Harry does, and most of the plot is just Harry fucking with them and having fun, while occasionally getting paid. The setting throughout almost the entire story is Serenity, which looks like [[http://www.stormdancer.huntress.org/images/temp/firefly_deckplans.jpg][this on the inside]] and [[http://www.siff.net/assets/Images/FESTIVAL/2014/Films/R-S/Serenity_440x300.jpg][this on the outside]]. Almost all of the other planets they stop at are made up or not really described well in the series (it was only 1 season, remember). It ends up being really easy to follow, and at least to me, really funny and fun to read.

It does abuse the shit out of some of the movie parts, but you kinda get the feel for what happened based on the characters reactions when it comes up. If you haven't watched the movie *don't* go looking for a synopsis for the movie, as it kinda spoils a big twist in the last plot arc.

**** It's set after the Firefly series and it's follow up feature film 'Serenity' so there will be references made that you might not catch. However, everything is explained really well as Harry learns of the new universe he's awoken in, so a grounding in Firefly history is not an absolute necessity.
