** linkffn(63435430

That's Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the GirlWhoLived, which is the super weird (but well written) fanfic where everyone with magic sees Harry as Harriet Potter. It's actually pretty cool, and the mystery of the curse is pretty cool too.

linkffn(8770795)

Harry Dursley and The Chronicles of the King mostly has a very unique Harry Potter plot. Mostly I can just say WTF, since it's been awhile and I can't remember much, but it's kinda weird, but in a good way. It's also has the craziest time turner plot, and also does some real cool stuff with Horcruxes.

linkffn(2428341)

Mastermind Hunting. This one's also weird. And different from a lot of Harry Potter stuff. Has some cool mind stuff and ton of other magic stuff. Let me just copy the summary.

#+begin_quote
  This is a story of the life of Harry Potter. From his disappearance with his friendly relatives to Dumbledore chasing after him around the world, while Voldemort and muggle secret services loom in the background. Technology, Prophecies... one word: power.
#+end_quote

Honestly, looking back through my favorites, there's a lot of really weird, batshit-crazy stuff.

link(4826372)

Harry is a Mew. Like, from Pokemon. (Harry Mewter)

linkffn(2488754)

A Second Chance at Life. Weird fic where Harry frees hogwarts and does magic at another weird original school. You might have seen this one before.

linkffn(2686394)

Hell Eyes. It's essentially an original fic that starts with Harry Potter. It's actually really good.

Alright, I'm going to stop now, since I could just browse through my list and point to tons of fics that are weird in retrospect. These are mostly the ones that come to mind, but man, I can still think of other weird ass fics (but bad ones; these are all good). I need to count up the lengths of all my favorites... And that still wouldn't be all that I read, since I usually only favorite on completion.

I second /Blindness/, /Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone/, /Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them/, /Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus/ plus all the subfics of that, and /Lessons with Hagrid/.

#+begin_quote
  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

***** ??? We don't even */know/* what this Gabrielle fic is about, so that's hardly a fair comment. Who knows, maybe the fic was about crossdressing, or watersports, or bondage, sure it's not everybody's cup of tea but some people might like it. So I would hardly call myself an ‘over eager pedophile' because I was curious about a fic mentioned.

****** Yeah, there's a lot of people who might freak out over the sex in say, Pygmalion - even if it's between consenting/of age characters. There's also the 'morbid curiosity' factor.

******* There's also the fact that pedophilia is just the attraction to kids. I don't give a single shit what someone is thinking. Read about molesting kids all you want - which most of these stories aren't actually about.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to rob a bank. The only thing wrong is if you actually rob it. Thought crimes are the highest forms of immorality I can imagine.

****** I would rather you be a pedophile who reads books over a child molester tbh. I don't get the hatred towards people for simply having thoughts instead of despising the actions. It's known as a thought crime.
