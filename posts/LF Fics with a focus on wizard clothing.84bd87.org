** You may look at linkffn(Patron by Starfox5). She (or he?) does a good job at creating a separate culture for Wizarding World and it includes significant role of robes.

*** Seconded. Robes and the enchanting thereof plays quite a large role in the story.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** I've read your Alexandra Potter story from your google drive and I must say it made me at times a bit uncomfortable but in a good way I guess, when everything you assume about HP universe appears to be false, so you're surprised at every turn and you don't expect it. But also to me this story seemed like “what if Harry was a girl instead” at first glance, but it turned out the story was “what if Harry(the girl) was held accountable for everything she did out of ignorance”. Still, I've never read a story quite like yours, it's unique. Also was wondering if you were planning to change a plot somewhat or just rewrite it in a better way?

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances.
