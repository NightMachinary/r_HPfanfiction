** Only with time travel, and before Myrtle is my sincere opinion. Yes, until then he had already did some scary things at the Orphanage, but he was also a child being bullied and not knowing exactly, it could very well have been accidental Magic. But Hogwarts after Myrtle was killed? It just went downhill from there and no, no redemption needed.

Unless you have Hermione become what Bellatrix went to become...then yeah, two crazy people together is also possible.

*** But Myrtle means he was willing to kill an innocent in cold blood. Unless one is a psychopath, one doesn't simply just go one day and decide "I'm going to kill an innocent person in cold blood". This isn't merely a Death Eater killing someone on the opposite side because they believe in the Pureblood cause -- this is cold-blooded murder with no reasons whatsoever to it.

This is why I think you need to adjust his upbringing early on, far before he even starts Hogwarts, unless one simply subscribes to the idea of him being a psychopath.

** Realistically, and outside of a situation where the pairing doesn't go into creepy non-con territory, it could only work if Tom Riddle wasn't Voldemort. Because an in-character Hermione Granger would not get into a relationship with someone who hated her kind and wouldn't hesitate to murder her parents. She wouldn't stand for the "you are a credit to your race" type of muggleborn acceptance, which is why Lily/Snape could never work.

It's the same for Bellatrix/Harry, the genderswapped version of this pairing. An in-character Harry would never date a Death Eater who murdered his godfather. But if the story is an AU where this never happened... then /possibly/, depending on the writing skill of the author.

*** Objection on the Bellatrix bit, there is a small window where you could make it work if Bellatrix defects after being broken out and before the DoM battle happens. That way you avoid that issue of Sirius and you can use the decade in Azkaban to justify a change of heart (eg Bellatrix never wanting to go back there and that desire overwriting any loyalty to Voldemort, or a decade there left her a lot of time to rethink her life). Obviously Harry (or Hermione) wouldn't want to bone her as they would be very vary, but give it a few years where they fight, sleep (figuratively) and bleed together, and Bellatrix past does not seem that much of an issue, especially as she wasn't directly involved in Harry's parents death (unlike Voldemort, Pettigrew and Snape). Especially if she saves Harry's, or more symbolically, Hermione's life along the way. It would cause a break with Neville, but as there was no ministry battle, the bonds with him aren't forged with blood yet.

I don't think that there is a Bellatrix fic with that plot, but that's the one way I can see a Bellatrix romance work

#+end_quote

Harry's first impression of Bellatrix was seeing her in the Pensieve at her trial in GoF.

#+begin_quote
  ...A woman, with thick, shining dark hair, and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne.

  The Dementors were gliding back into the room. The boy's three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, "The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban, we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!"
#+end_quote

His impression of her was already fixed, long before he'd ever met her in person. I doubt time or circumstance would ever change his dislike of her, since for all his "forgiving nature", he remained on cool terms with Dudley, the Dursleys, and Draco Malfoy after the war (if you discount the shitheap that was Cursed Child) and they didn't commit any murders. And neither time, circumstance, or Bellatrix serving time would change the fact that she turned Neville's parents into vegetables.

It's a core part of Harry's personality to worship the idea of parents. /("Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew---and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents---that there was all the difference in the world.")/ This is how he decides that sacrificing himself for the wizarding world is the best thing to do, and why he blows up at Remus for even thinking about leaving Tonks and baby Teddy.

#+begin_quote
  The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow.
#+end_quote

And you can't forget that Azkaban turned Bellatrix obsessive and mentally unhinged, if she wasn't already crazy before. She's also skeletal looking and 30 years older than Harry.

This is why I don't think it's reasonable for Bellatrix/Harry to happen in the canon timeline, /without/ time travel, or without taking place in an AU with no Death Eaters or wizarding war. It is as improbable as a Hermione/Tom Riddle pairing to happen in a timeline where Tom has petrified/murdered muggleborns, his dad, and made horcruxes.

If he can be civil towards Malfoy despite him nearly murdering Ron and trying the Cruciatus against Harry and never doing anything positive for him, a slow change towards more than cordial wouldn't be off if Bellatrix saved his or his friend's life a few times.

Also, you are assuming that Harry would take the initiative, something I don't see happening with anyone older than him. It's already questionable in Harmony fics, nevermind Fleur or Tonks pairings.

There is every possibility that the Ministry specifically allows for this type of behavior. To enroll in a driver's ed program and test for your license in the first place would require documentation that the Weasleys certainly did not have, meaning that some level of collusion with the Ministry would be necessary. Given that Ron /is/, in fact, a former Auror, it seems more likely than not that he is aware of the extent to which he can legally use magic in such an environment. The fact that Hermione expected him to do so only adds to this.

  It isn't just corruption, they were working towards the systematic deportation of a people while death Squads roamed the countryside and took care of everyone who escaped the bureaucracy. The Aurors, the clerks, the paper pushers, everyone there helped with a small scale genocide.
#+end_quote

And most of those people are blatantly scared for their lives, livelihoods, and families. Remember when people talked about the first war, coming home to find the Dark Mark above their house, knowing that everyone inside was dead and it was your fault for resisting or simply being born impure? That's what happens here if you try to do anything other than your job as it's told to you. It's like blaming the Jews for the Holocaust. They're hopelessly outmatched.

It's not their fault, and they're not corrupt. They're collaborators. There's a difference. They're victims.

Even if you go through the angle of her being somehow useful and turning sides, he wouldn't trust her enough to stick it in her. First, Neville might snap if he found out and killed Harry in his sleep, second, Harry is pretty vanilla.

Then it would go from emotionless manipulation while appearing to be very social and bright - something Tom was very good at in canon - to actually developing feelings. Kind of like Dumbledore's plans for Harry, where he promised himself he wouldn't get too attached to do what he needed to, then failed and valued Harry's life more than countless others.

There are repeated hints in canon that Voldemort doesn't actually follow pureblood supremacism on its own merits, but because it's close enough to his own goals of maintaining power that he goes along with it to keep his followers loyal. For instance, Dumbledore notes that, when given the chance, he marks Harry, not Neville, as his rival. A halfblood, not a pureblood. I could see him eventually valuing a Muggleborn on her own merits.

** Definitely one of the more interesting pairings that is hard to get to work.

The best I've read so far is linkffn(She Rises). It's time travel where a battle-hardened Hermione that has killed and has been tortured extensively--basically dark/grey but still good Hermione--gets thrown back in time. I especially like this fic because she's not trying to redeem Tom (He already has multiple horcruxes and she's aware, though cautions him to not create more. She has no qualms torturing and killing either.). It's not exactly time-travel, but rather Dimension travels with a time difference--meaning that more and more characters will (and already have) follow after Hermione--and the whole thing will (hopefully) eventually come to a four-way war: Tom/Hermione vs Voldemort vs Harry/Dumbledore vs Grindelwald.

That being said, the fic is /very/ slow (with too much focus on the pairing) and this is just me theorizing. I think to put the premise like that, it's pretty awesome, and I can only hope that the author will make it happen.

Other than that, having Tom resurrect from the diary (not in second year, as to avoid an age difference) can work too. Of course, you'd have to come up with a reasonable explanation for it. Maybe Hermione had the diary all the time, but Tom didn't manage (or chose not) to possess her. Along the years Hermione becomes more ruthless and whatnot, while Tom begins to value her and reevaluates his believes of blood purity, etc. Either they come up with a different approach to resurrect him or Hermione tricks a death eater into writing in the diary and Tom uses them to get himself a body. Then he joins the Golden Trio to fight Voldemort, they win, he/she becomes minister of magic, and whatnot--the usual.

That's just one of many ways to make it happen. Still I agree that having canon Hermione paired up with him is unrealistic. I think most stories have the problem with redeeming Tom without giving another (bigger) baddie to fight, and thus the story has no real direction anymore.

Anyway, those are my thoughts. I'm definitely a fan of the pairing, but it's rare that it's done well.

** You need to start (IMO) with reducing the age difference - that can be done with time travel on either part, or with the diary.

Then you need a believable way to bridge the gap between their canon personalities and worldview - so that, IMO, has to be there before Tom/Voldemort becomes 100% obsessed with his pureblood rhetoric and all.

To me, what seems most 'likely' to set it up would be with the diary. Tom is young in that one, and setting him up to be less terrible would not be that hard - nor would including some type of magical effect involved (eg, making Hermione bring him to 'life' in a way that changes him to a degree).

I suspect one way to expand the relationship in a believable way would be to work from the fact that they're both brilliant - and in Tom's case, that Hermione would presumably be his first challenging rival in classes, if not with his outside abilities. That can be the start of a twist in his pureblooded supremacy, which again is necessary to make the relationship believable.

Obviously there's a little bit of loose play with his stance on Muggleborns, she either becomes an exception to his rule because her power is more coveted than his beliefs or authors play with the idea that his whole stance is more of a political play in order to manipulate his way to power. They are both brilliant and seekers of knowledge, so they have common interests. Let's face it Hermione is not a white characters, she's most definitely grey. She's not necessarily opposed to dark, I mean she's brewing Polyjuice out of a restricted book 2nd year, they constantly break rules, she scars Marietta, leaves Umbridge to the whims of the Centaurs, etc etc.

There's also a ton of AUs that present them with their character traits but don't necessarily set them up in canonical universe; i.e. they are born in same era, muggle AUs, etc. In any case I personally love this ship even though it's a bit ridiculous when you try and canonically break it down. It allows for a lot of the whole Light/Dark dynamics and power plays, academic rivalries, ideas of redemption (yeah, yeah maybe fictional but why can't we hope/dream?), and love the idea of brilliant people finding a kindred spirit. I also always gravitate towards villains... also as someone stated they made two hot characters and hot people banging is hot. I'm not gonna lie that does help.

I will say if you are looking for one that tries to fit into canon I'd recommend checking out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars][Unsphere the Stars]]. Anyways the most important thing is it's fiction, ship and let ship. If it isn't your cup of tea there's a ton of other pairings to read out there.

I dropped that fic because of how OOC it was. The prose was pretty and it had some interesting wordbuilding ideas, but it leaned hard into Super Hermione, and the way it interpreted horcruxes was silly and stretched artistic license right outside any possibility of being canon. The most recent chapter made me wish the fic had finished at the end of their Hogwarts years.

I'm sorry, but this was ridiculous and Tom Riddle, before he murdered people and ripped up his soul, was a nasty little brat with no moral center or sense of remorse. He didn't have to be a racist, terrorist, or murderer, but no amount of soul-fixing would fix his moral compass, because he never had one in the first place.

**** I actually haven't read that far but I thought the idea of how it did try to keep more or less to the first books (minus the epilogue) was unique. You might prefer darker Tomione, which definitely exist, not everyone's cup of tea though. I'm a bit more lax because I mostly read for just enjoyment/escapism and it's my guilty pleasure ship. Also I read Cursed Child and if that can be stamped with approval with its OOC then I'm okay with a little here and there.

** I had a thought about this recently. Riddle never bought into the whole blood supremacy thing. To him it was always about power.

The story I've wanted to write is a Tom is the same age as Harry fic. Riddle still creates a terrorist organization, but they are about remaking the wizarding world. 7 years at Hogwarts twisting and manipulating Hermoine into a dark lady.

The Tom Harry relationship is one of smiling rivals. They are cordial but despise one another.

** If it was an alternate universe where Tom Riddle lived a normal, happy life as like a Doctor or something, yes! But other than that, no. Being a criminal is bad and if he is evil then it cannot work for him to be with Hermione unless she is ALSO EVIL herself.
