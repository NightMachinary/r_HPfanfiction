anyone know any good sirius (but post azkaban) x oc (reader) fanfics? thanks!


** This is the only one I know. Which is a shame, because the scenario would make a good character study. And it would explore things like mental health and the effects of dementors.

It's a self-insert covered in three parts: hogwarts, the first war, and the second war. IMO it picks up after hogwarts, but I've never been a fan of the fifth marauder trope. It's the only fic ive ever been able to stomach reading from first person so there's that. Also, the SI isn't overpowered or a master duelist, which is always good to see.

Also, I have a plot bunny that my readers said they would be interested in so I've started writing it but it's nowhere near complete. It's like 10k words so far. It's about a seer that graduated with Snape and the Marauders. They weren't great friends or anything, but she always knew that Peter was the guilty one bc of her divination, so when Sirius escapes she goes to Hogwarts to try to hunt them both down. It's an eventual Sirius/OC and Harry/Luna OR Harry/Blaise but I don't think it's going to be about romance. Which is funny because the whole point of the story was to get more experience writing romance but my brain does what it wants.

(I just wrote the shack scene (bc I don't write chronologically) and she petrifies Peter to take his blood in case he escapes, but gets a vision when their skin meets. She /sees/ him resurrecting Voldemort is like fuuuuck this. So when she comes to she shatters both of his legs and everyone is like WHAT THE FUCK except for Sirius who starts cackling like a mad scientist, which is exactly what I was doing when I imagined Hermione's shock and horror)

** The correct flair is "Request". But anyway, Marlene McKinnon is basically an original character despite being named in canon, so "Innocent" by MarauderLover7 would qualify. Series is incomplete but active.
