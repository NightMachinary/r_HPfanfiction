Do you prefer to write it, edit it, and post each chapter on a schedule or do you prefer to write a chapter, edit the chapter, then post it and begin writing the next one? Why?


** With a destination, determination, and deliberation.

** I have an interesting idea, start writing, either get sidetracked or get writers' block and then abandon it.

** I always wrote, rewrote, and edited the whole thing (then I could iron out discrepancies and plot holes and work in plenty of foreshadowing), got it betaed before posting, then posted chapters twice a week until it was complete. But that certainly didn't do me any good in terms of attention. Had I been in need of validation from reviews in order to continue, I would never have got past the first chapter of anything. It depends how important it is to you to finish your story.

** I do an outline of the scenes per chapter to keep track of where the plot and character development should head. Write the chapter, edit it, usually end up writing an extra scene, edit again, then post.

*** Yeah, that's what I usually do, but I was reading Steven King's book, "On Writing" and he said that if I wait and don't show it to anyone until I finish at least the first draft, it will work out better for me.

(Not to mention it's way less stressful trying to write something that only I know about as opposed to trying to write a new chapter for a group of people on a regular basis)

**** Yeah, I think my next fic I'll take a bit more time with, I'm 55K deep on my current one in like four weeks

** I've done both. I've also written a longfic and not posted until it was finished and then posted the whole thing in one go. That was dumb.

I keep a super-regular posting schedule.

*** I figured I'd write the whole fic, then post each chapter on a regular schedule in order to space out views and such.

** I don't have a set schedule for my writing, and since I also have to work around the availability of my editors, it's easier for me to just publish the chapters as they're finished.

I also like the immediate feedback. it helps me stay focused on the next chapter.

*** Fyi, as a reader i stay away from fics like this. Chapters under 2k lenght is not chapters, they are scenes and i get annoyed when its so darn short. If you write 15-20 "chapters" before posting, why not combine them so you get a good 3-8 k length chapters? I never unstood why anyone would read or write 1k chapters unless its oneshots, its just way too short

** I always write my fics to completion before anything else. I've done that twice but I actually haven't published anything, so I only have completed but unpublished work, which surely is a step up from the numerous uncompleted but published fictions hanging around all the internet.

** I like to finish the whole thing first before posting. Then I'll read it, reread it, edit it, edit it more, fix plot holes, etc etc, and then post the whole thing on some kind of loose schedule with updates maybe 2x a week or so. Otherwise I worry I won't finish it, and I'd hate to leave it half posted and abandoned. I did that back when I was a teenager making my first attempts, and that was lame. Sitting on 11 chapters and not posting them is hard though! But I shall keep going. haha
