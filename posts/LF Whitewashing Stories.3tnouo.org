Are the death-eaters just misunderstood softies? Is Dumbledore just victimizing innocent wizarding families with his bigoted laws? Was that poor diary really Dumbledore's attempt to bind Tom's soul to control him? If any of those were a yes, then that fic belongs in this thread.

*** Everything's a thing.

I've even seen a multitude of stories where Dumbledore corrupted Tom into becoming a Dark Lord so that he could regain fame and popularity by killing another Dark Lord. Then Harry comes along with his blasted prophecy, and jealous!Dumbledore kills his parents, steals all his money and love-potions him to keep him in control so that Harry would be weak and Dumbledore could defeat LV.

**** My favorite version of this is the one where Dumbledore faked his own death at the hands of Snape and returns after Voldemort is killed claiming that he channeled his magic through Harry to defeat the Dark Lord.

***** Damn. That's some next-level manipulative!Dumbledore.

I wonder which story has the most ridiculously manipulative Dumbledore. There should be a contest to find it. Most people find it to be repulsive, but I think that it's absolutely hilarious.

****** That's really hard, because any story where he's that super-manipulative he's usually also a straw man, and Harry can easily see all his manipulation. Which, if he was /good/ at it, Harry shouldn't be able to do.

******** It would get you more fics, but I don't know if it's what you really want. Canon Dumbledore might still be the best manipulative Dumbledore, if you assume he set everything up. For instance, assume he sent Harry to the Dursleys so he'd have low self-esteem because he knew it would be necessary for Harry to sacrifice himself to kill Voldemort.

The best manipulation would be if the characters suspect nothing, and then Dumbledore pops up at the end, like an 80's cartoon villain who just got caught, to explain how he arranged everything.

********* See, that kind of manipulative!Dumbledore /is/ the best, but I've never seen it done. I might as well be asking for a unicorn in that regard.

****** Here are a couple of my favorite evil!Dumbledore:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][Birth of a Nightmare Man]]

- Harry gets locked up in Azkaban. Lots of angst. Followed by a bloodbath of biblical proportions. This one's the prequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] which I also recommend on the principle that psychopath!Harrys are the best Harrys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizard's Fall]]

- This one is legitimately the most scummy Dumbledore I've ever read. It starts out with Albus acting a little evil and only jumps the shark from there. To be fair though, it is a very well-written story.

** linkffn(On the Wings of a Phoenix) One of my favorite stories, though there's a lot to be desired. Nothing is as it seems, and there's two sides to every story.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
