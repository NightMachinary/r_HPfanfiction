  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Paying for his Pedestal has them both despising each other (harry cuz cho is happy, pretty and popular), and cho cuz Harry rapes her in chapter1. But then they eventually fall in love, never finished it cuz it went from Non-con smut into actual romance with charcater devlopment and emotinal growth (yuk!) also its super long. smut scenes are well written though.
