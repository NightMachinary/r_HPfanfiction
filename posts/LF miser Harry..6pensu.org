Lf a miserly Lord Potter-Slytherin-Peverell-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-YouandEveryonesMother who is miserly beyond the point of frugality. The cheapest SOB you've ever seen.

*Bonus points* if he convinces purebloods like the Malfoys to do the same.


** He is fairly frugal in linkffn(The Hidden Kingdom) although I'm not sure he's rolling in Lordships in that one.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.
