I'm looking for any well-written, Harry has anger and doesn't handle it well fics.

Not just overt yelling. One fic I read recently had Harry punching a wall several times, or playing Quidditch aggressively. Another delved into his anger in OotP a little more, where Harry was afraid his anger meant he was turning into Vernon. I feel like that aspect is underutilized, and have a craving for it.


** Please link the fics that you read.

  AU When Harry is fighting Voldemort for the Philosopher's Stone, he makes the horrible discovery that he is keeping Voldemort alive by hosting a fraction of his soul. What is the rest of Harry's time at Hogwarts like when he knows that he has to die?
