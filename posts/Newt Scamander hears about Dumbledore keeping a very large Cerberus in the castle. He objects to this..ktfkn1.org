Newt Scamander, lover of all magical creatures, finds out that Dumbledore is keeping a very large Cerberus /inside/ the castle.

He objects to this. Very loudly.

My idea is that Newt just kicks in the doors of the great hall during breakfast and rips into Dumbledore in front of the entire school, and then goes to get Fluffy out of the castle and to somewhere they can run around and play.

I don't really care for a /plot/, I just love the image of Newt chewing out Dumbledore while the entire student body looks on in shock.

Because, at least in the movie, that room didn't look much bigger than the actual dog. I can't imagine Newt would be too happy about that sort of thing if he found out somehow (maybe he got chatting with Hagrid? idk).


** The story The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLonnie has this as one of of the story arcs. Eg Newt hears about the cerberus in the castle, confronts Dumbledore about it and then later with others handles the situation.

*** Would it even need that? In Greek mythology, Cerberus protects the gates of the underworld, so in the Harry Potter universe, it should be used to no activity and light.

*** Maybe. I guess he could do something like that, I just wanted to share a funny (to me at least) idea that I had.

**** I mean, it could be both. Newt chews out Dumbledore and then:

"Thank you for your advice, Scamander. Now, did you know Hogwarts actually teaches Care of Magical Creatures?"

"Yes, of course."

"And as its Headmaster, I might have asked Professor Kettleburn how best to handle this?"

"But..."

"Of course, I also have passed my OWLs. Do you want to guess my grade in Care?"

** I vaguely remember one where Harry feeds it shrinking solution and smuggles the Cerberus out of the castle and gives it to Newt.
