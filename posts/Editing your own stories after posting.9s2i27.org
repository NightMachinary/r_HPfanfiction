** You have a right to do pretty much anything you want with your story (besides selling it), but I think there are best practices for this kind of thing.

For minor edits like fixing typos, go ahead and do it. No problem. People might not even notice, but future readers will have a better reading experience.

If there's a problem with a specific chapter, I'd say yes, go back and fix it. I've done that a few times when I made a serious mistake. In that case, I think it's good etiquette to put a note at the top of the chapter to say that you made changes. This will inform repeat readers to look out for things being different. If it's a recent chapter, I think it's also good etiquette to make a note of it on the next new chapter so that your followers can go back and see the changes.

Now, if you have already /finished/ the edits to your story, I would say go ahead and post it. It's almost certainly going to be better, after all. I would lean toward replacing your old story. Don't take it down, but just replace the chapters, and put a note on the first chapter that you've done edits. Posting it as a new story is also acceptable, though.

However, if you're thinking about /starting/ a full edit of a story, I would say that's a /bad/ idea in general because even very prolific writers almost always fail to finish a full edit. If you tell your readers you're going to do a full edit, they're going to assume the story is dead.

And either way, I think it's bad etiquette to take the original story down. You can if you want, but people who followed or favorited it are only going to see it missing and not know why. Because of that, it's better to leave it up while you replace the chapters or post a new version.

** My take:

You are completely free to edit your story at any time for any reason and you owe nobody anything.

You can take your stories down, do wholesale rewrites, edit a few lines in situ, fix a comma fault, whatever. You have no obligation to tell anyone anything if you do change stuff, no need to put a "Hey, I'm rewriting for reasons [stating reasons]" or whatever. It's your creation and you alone control how it's viewed by the world (provide you meet the terms and services of the medium on which you're publishing, blah, blah).

*** I couldn't disagree more. Once a piece of artwork has been revealed to the public, I think you have a duty to leave it available to them in some fashion. If you want, you can take it off your ffnet profile and, say, post it as a text file on the Internet Archive, or something.

But I loathe artists thinking they can go and burn their own creations even when there are already people in the world who may be distressed not to find them if they go looking for them again.

To be very blunt, who cares if people are distressed when they can't find the fic? They didn't put any work into it: they didn't spend countless hours writing it, they didn't spend even more editing it. They have no say, relevance, or bearing on whether a fic should be kept up or taken down, because all they did was read it. You think it's loathsome that artists think they can burn their own creation? I think it's absolutely loathsome that readers can be so entitled to think that they are owed anything at all from nonprofit writers.

But with how much is lost each day by accident as the internet goes on I think it sad if authors takes down a story. Whatever you have to say about the story it is still part of our culture and worth preserving as testament of our time.

Do I read fictions from 2000? No usually I don't. But being able to would is an amazing thing. It shows us how far we have come since then. And one time in the future fanfics will be a part of history and will have an impact on our culture.

****** Practically speaking, it's a hard call to make in most instances.

As a case in point, take my most popular story on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], one I that haven't reread in nearly a decade so I'm working off fuzzy memory as to what's actually in it. It was my rookie novel, one that I recognize now has so many glaring flaws that I could spend a half dozen posts enumerating them all. I get equal parts scathing and glowing reviews from readers. It's continually cited on "this is a horrible story, the worst scene of which has resonated with me for negative reasons for years" lists as well as on, "This is an example of high-quality writing in the fandom" lists.

So what's the verdict? Is it good? Bad? Both? Neither?

Suppose that I am a far better and, by objective measures, successful writer than I was ten years ago and writing fiction is just a side hobby for me at any rate, not something I need for personal validation, so I don't need this story to stay up for my own ego. From a purely utilitarian standpoint, is it your sense that I should pull the story from the site, as I've considered several times over the years, or do I have a "duty" to readers to leave it up? I'd propose that the answer is ambiguous at best and that utilitarian arguments are, like in most cases, hard to make in any convincing way.

Same with most fanfiction, so I say burn your babies if you wish to.

****** I don't believe there are ethical implications to keeping up fanfiction or not; you may disagree, but I think it's far too trivial a matter to seriously apply the principles of utility to. Nevertheless, I'll try to respond to the point. When talking about happiness, are we talking about Bentham's pleasure-pain principle? Or are we talking about Mill's higher and lower pleasures? If the first, is this not a grotesque slap to the face of individual rights; couldn't we justify practically anything that could damage an individual from the most simple to the most heinous by using weasel words to say it might bring pleasure to society at large? And if the second, who's to say whether the fanfiction is a higher or lower pleasure, or if it's even a pleasure at all? Mill himself said it was better to be Socrates, dissatisfied, than a satisfied fool. They may be dissatisfied and distressed, but if it is a poor pleasure, it's not worth bemoaning the loss of.

******** You will, I hope, forgive me for being somewhat unclear; it's the first time I've seriously debated philosophy in quite a while. What I mean to say is that there is no practical way to objectively determine whether fanfiction is a higher or lower pleasure. I could say that it is not a higher pleasure because it's not intellectual, in that the vast, vast majority of fanfics are mental rot. I could find a great deal of people within the community that would likely agree with me on that. You may argue that it is a higher pleasure because it requires the mental stimulation of reading, which is inherently an intellectual act. And you could find a great deal of people who agree with you.

The question becomes, which one us is right? According to preference utilitarianism (as far as I recall, of course), it's whichever of us has the greater number of proponents. If I am right, fanfiction is not a higher utility and the dissatisfaction of people in regards to it being deleted is negligible. If you are right, fanfiction is a higher pleasure and is worth keeping up.

However, now I can ask those very same people if every fanfiction is equally as high in utility as every other one. Take something like The Real Us, a fic that quite a lot of people despise for a plethora of reasons. It's very possible that after getting a population to read a few chapters, the majority might agree that it isn't helping overall society, but rather harming it. And say the author themselves came out and said the fic was harmful and they wanted to delete it. But, according to a post you made elsewhere, those people's opinions wouldn't matter because others (even if they're fewer in number) are benefiting from it. Now, despite the fact that the majority population and the creator have decided that this is a harmful pleasure, leading people to become "satisfied fools", you argue that it would still be morally wrong to delete this fic because a fewer number of people have had increased utility due to the fic. This is, of course, contradictory to the general rule of utilitarianism: the greatest good for the greatest number. It is essentially a perversion of the philosophy so that the artist can never be in the right when in regards to controlling or destroying their creation, and declaring that it is somehow an axiomatic moral good that they follow the unwinnable rules of your rigged game.

I hope that makes some sense.

********* The way I look at it, fanfiction is a type of literature, and literature a type of art, and by definition art is a higher and not lower pleasure.

As for your argument as to how my axiom violates "greater good" morality, I think a key point of my argument you're missing is that aside from very few fringe cases, it's not people who want fics deleted and people who want to keep them: it's people who want to keem them and people who are indifferent to their existence. "Keeping them around" is a good to one of the groups and neutral to the other; "deleting them" is an evil to one of the groups and neutral to the other.

If a fanfiction story is found to be harmful (and I think few would be) then it could be argued that it needs to have a warning added at the beginning or something like that, but to remove it on this basis would be censorship.

And if it's bad, as I said elsewhere on this thread, "don't like don't read". The people who don't find it pleasant to read can just go read something else.

Fair enough, I see where you're coming from here. Nevertheless, you'll have to forgive me for being unable to agree with this, because I legitimately cannot stomach the idea of an ethical philosophy that's so actively hostile to artists being "Good" in any sense of the word. Maybe I'm biased by the fact that I write myself, but the idea that I have a moral obligation to bow and scrape to a faceless mob that have done nothing but read some words I've written is honestly stomach-churning. However, while I might not agree with your viewpoint, I understand that ethics is never an easy subject, and I think I understand and ultimately respect your views in an intellectual sense.

**** There's a distinction here that you're not drawing with your example.

Fanfiction is unsold art. It's the equivalent of a canvas in a closet among a stack of other canvases and velvet Elvises. It may have been shown in a gallery some time back, perhaps now it's sitting in a restaurant with a consignment sticker on it, waiting to be sold, but it isn't yet. And, likely, never will be.

If the author thinks she can add a brush stroke here or there to improve the piece, or if she thinks, "This isn't my look anymore, let me take it down," it's her prerogative to do so. This is the thing with unsold art. It's the artist's and she owes nothing to the world.

Once it's sold, once it's the property of another, she has no other rights to her creation save for the right to cash a check and go make more art. Until then, she can burn it all down in a bacchanal bonfire, dancing naked before the flickering flames, bedding any and all who would come celebrate the demise of her works, and it's totally within her rights to do so.

Same with fanfiction, friend.

** It's your work, do what you want with it.

I've seen this tackled a few different ways that I liked as a reader:

1) when adding a new chapter, the author included a /short/ note that changes or corrections were made in XYZ chapters (this is for ongoing stories that might be mostly done on paper but not on the website)

2) when an author was making major changes, they started a new copy of the story and left the old one up while doing revisions, then when done they took down the old one. (drawback to this is if you're big on review/fav numbers, but to be fair, those favs and reviews were for the old version anyway)

I personally don't like starting a /complete/ story then halfway through see a note from the author that they're actually rewriting chapter by chapter so the point I've gotten to might not actually mesh fully with the rest of the story that hasn't been rewritten.

** My personal experience with this was, I had published 10-11 chapters of my story before meeting my editor, so I had edited them all myself. We decided to leave them up, but go through them all and edit again, then switch the new versions in once they were ready. Some drastic changes were made, mainly in terms of chapter breaks and structure, so anything I did add or remove would have little or no bearing on the future of the story.

** It's your story, so the decision to make changes is ultimately your sole prerogative. If the changes are major enough to actually affect the plot or reader perception (e.g. clearer foreshadowing) then it's probably polite to mention in the summary somewhere that you've made changes, but that's about it. And maybe save a private copy of the unedited version somewhere just in case you need to refer back to it for whatever reason.

** I post a changelog in an author's note at the end of each chapter with the date and brief summary of the changes.

** I think you /should/ keep the old version available in some form --- perhaps you could repost the original versions of chapters as "bonus files" at the end of the story. But if you want the main version of the story to be revised it's your right. Do tell your readers that you will have done some editing, either way; that's just common decency.
