My 12-year-old is requesting fics about the further adventures of the slugs Ron threw up.

** YOOO I WAS WRITING A CRACKFIC ABOUT THIS AWHILE AGO! I ain't nowhere near finishing the first chapter, but here's the premise:

They don't know where or what they are. They don't know how they came into existence. They don't know why the world - if that's the word for it - moves so fast around them. All they understand is where they must go. A tingle, or whatever this feeling is, pulls them back towards the place they somehow know they came from. They must trek through green living things, and over cold grey things that never lived. They could care less about their surroundings, hovever, as they find their way back to their creator.

And trust me, he is not happy to see them.

So basically just some sluggies going on a roadtrip.

*Ch.1*

Existence. 

There had been nothing, no thought, no feeling, just an absence of self, and then It was there. Alive.

It was then violently shoved out of a pink tube. It lay cushioned in soft green that it could tell was breathing and living underneath It, and couldn't care less. It sat there, reveling in this new sensation of being alive, when a second thing, similar to Itself fell into the green, and It couldn't help but think, Sibling.

Sibling apparently heard It, and responded with a nod, seeming to like it's new name; that is, if either of them had had the mental capacity to truly appreciate a name. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~

And that's where I left off, sorry. Just an idea.

*** Have you ever thrown up and decided that that was a good time to name the chunks of food coming out of you?

**** No, but I've named the individual waves. When you know you're gonna hurl 3 or 4 times your mind can go to weird places.
