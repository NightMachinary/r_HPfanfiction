Any good ideas on how love can defeat Voldemort.

I do not consider anything like the Care Bear stare to be a good idea.

I just found one, and I was astonished because I kind of thought it couldn't be done.

>! The soul piece in Harry's scar has been aware his whole life, but unable to act because Lily's sacrifice prevented it from taking over Harry. As a result, he's seen the love Harry has experienced his whole life slowly over years and has become good. When Voldemort tries to leverage the soul piece to take over Harry's body, it kills badVold instead. !< It's long and the moving parts are all well foreshadowed early on in different contexts.


** So in Resonance, the love is about who it's directed at. Harry feels...maybe not love but at least warmly toward Snape & Voldemort is caught off guard during the battle bc he never expected it. That's when Harry defeats him. Idk if that's what you're looking for but, yeah.

  "DETENTION!" Through the eyes of Severus Snape, we see the evolving relationship between the two students he always has in detention. The two students that will forever be the death of him and disgust him. Secretly though, he does like them.

** Voldemort pulls an Aaron and truly dies so his daughter can live the life he never had, without the stigmas.

Literally having Harry stand there as Lily and the Prophecy kill Voldemort with

"ðŸŽµThe Power of LOVE.ðŸŽµ"

Is kinda shit, mostly because it implies that it wasn't Lily's love or that Lily Potter was the only mother willing to sacrifice herself for her kid.
