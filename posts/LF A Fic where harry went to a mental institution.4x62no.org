Okay so I saw this fic mentioned here a while ago but forgot to save it.

The Dursleys send Harry to a mental hospital, and the people there discover that he actually has these weird abilities. Goes something like that. Then they started to discover that there are other kids like him? That's as far as I remember, I've only read the summary. I may also be confusing several such stories I've seen for one. I'd really be interested in any story in which Harry goes to a mental hospital though, even though that's the one I'm specifically looking for, so suggestions welcome.

Any ideas?

Edit: Also, I apologize for the title gore. I've no idea how it got like that...

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** There is linkffn(Awaken Sleeper). It fits with the asylum thing you want but it isn't specifically the fic you're looking for.

*** Thanks for the suggestion, that looks interesting. Though, I've never read the Dresden Files past the first page...is it necessary to have prior knowledge of the series before reading this one?

**** Not much. Dresden lore is pretty direct. See bad guy? Point stick and set it on fire.
