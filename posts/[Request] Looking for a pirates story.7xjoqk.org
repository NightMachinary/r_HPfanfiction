I want high seas adventure, swash-buckling Harry, loyal lieutenant Hermione, damsel in distress Fleur. Basically Harry as Jack Sparrow.


** There's linkffn(4247866). The author's good, but unfortunately the story is abandoned and ends before really getting anywhere. Only posting because it's a fairly obscure request and it might be hard to find good matches.

  When Harry and Hermione's visit to Godric's Hollow goes terribly wrong, they escape into a parallel world where greed and rancor rekindle an old war for the mastery of the sea. And it so happens someone they thought dead crossed too, long before they did.
