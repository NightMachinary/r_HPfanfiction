We've all read the fics where the good guys end up in the past and Dumbledore won't let them change anything because bad things happen to wizards that meddle with time. What happens when the time travelor is a bad guy who doesn't get Dumbledore's warning and changes things for the worst (for the bad guys)? Any fics like this would be appreciated.

I'd recommend my personal favorite fanfic, [[https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/dp/133821666X][/The Cursed Child/]].
