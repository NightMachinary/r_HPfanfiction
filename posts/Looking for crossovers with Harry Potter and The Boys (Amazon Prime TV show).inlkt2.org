I'm surprised there haven't been any fics made for this.

Here's a small prompt for this in case anyone plans on making fics like this:

Master of Death Harry Potter who gets shunted from world to world on the whims of Death, is now transported into the world of The Boys where superheroes are not as saintly as the media portrays them to be. Now this is a Harry Potter who has been to the world of the Justice League, so handling the Seven would not really be a huge task for him, however he tends to avoid confrontations unless really pushed into it.

Now Harry finds himself on a plane that's hijacked, and suddenly two "superheroes" come on the plane, and the male lasers the terrorist without a care in the world, unintentionally(intentionally) killing the pilot and damaging the plane. Having briefed by Death about the kind of superheroes in this world, he finds himself disgusted when Homelander threatens to laser every one. He's decided enough is enough, and snaps his fingers.

What happens next?


** Alternatively,AU having wizards in place of supers and having the DA in place of the Seven with Dudley being the one who forms the Boys.

*** It'd be more interesting if it were Tom Riddle ( who's a muggle in this universe) as Butcher.

**** How would that work? The DE's as MI6's Wizarding police force?

Would they become Wizards like the Boys became supes in the comics? Would all their history of atrocities by lies invented by the Ministry?

** Honestly have god tier master of death harry would make it boring

having trained Auror harry means he is strong but would be on the backfoot meaning he would have to out think his opponets

afterall, how do you hit a speedster with a spell you cant, but what you can do is set the enviroment of the battle up before hand

*** good points, but partly the reason i want god tier mod harry is so that he can teach the superheroes of this world a lesson. Harry being the good guy he is may even get Butcher to soften up towards him.
