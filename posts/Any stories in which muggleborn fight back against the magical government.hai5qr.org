I would like to read stories where muggleborns/muggles strike back rather than wait a whole year for voldemort to attack ministry or wait another year for harry Potter to do something while they are in azkaban. Preferably some lesser known or oc hero. May be a dark vengeance against death eaters and supporters in ministry ( that didn't happen in deathly hallows or any other fan fiction I have read. Story just end after voldemort died and other death eaters are not mentioned or just walked away.) I prefer no romance or pairing. If anyone know any stories similar to this description please reply.


** Anything by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/][Starfox5]], probably.

[[/u/deepjeep123][u/deepjeep123]] I recommend starting with /Hermione Granger and The Marriage Law Revolution/ first. It's the earliest of Starfox5's fics. It's about Hermione taking a stand against legalized rape, which is essentially what the Marriage Law boils down to. It occurs a year or two after the Deathly Hallows.

*** Thank you for your suggestion. I actually read marriage law revolution and enjoyed. I will try the second one . But my problem was they let death eaters take over the third time and suddenly became all powerful and aware of the conditions. While everyone else stand by without doing anything. Harry and Hermione was a bit out of character.

*** I started reading divided and entwined. It is promising. I just wish it will not make the muggleborns as villains at the end ( there are some pics like that) and only harry Potter can save the world.
