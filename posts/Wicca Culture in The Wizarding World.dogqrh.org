I don't believe I have heard of very many fics that utilize wicca culture. I have heard and read of coven fics, but those were almost always harem fics and have nothing to do with wiccan culture. Is there any good fics that use this well? As in it goes into detail about wiccan culture and talks about the goddess and the importance of nature?

On another point, the Harry Potter universe is awfully Christian for a society whose entire bases spits in the face of Christian doctrine. Why would they celebrate Christmas? Wouldn't it make more sense for them to engage in druid traditions?

Until 1692, there was no separation between Muggle and magical world. Wizards might not believe in Jesus, but they would still pick up on the culture of the place they were living.

*** That doesn't explain why they would celebrate a holiday that worships the birth of Christ. It is like saying that Jews should celebrate Christmas just because they are surrounded by Christians. Also, considering the Pureblood movement is such a heavy factor, and a long standing one at that, you would think they would take pride in their pagan roots.

The holiday has a much older root and many traditions such as the Christmas tree come from pagan times. Hell, a lot of people who celebrate Christmas are agnostic.

***** You are right. The Holiday does have older roots. It was originally called Yule. It was adopted by the Christian's in an attempt to convert pagans into Christianity and was renamed Christmas. They then claimed it was a day to celebrate the birth of Christ.

The problem with that is that it does not make sense for the pure blood to celebrate the holidays by the Christian name. Especially since Christian witch hunts are the primary reason for the statue of secrecy.

The witch hunts were utterly ineffective against wizards. There was even a witch who got off from being caught and pretending to burn alive while using the flame freezing charm.

While it is true that individuals or small groups of people will cut themselves off from the rest of the world for some esoteric reason, it is not conceivable for multiple Nations to collectively agree to do the same unless they had something to rightfully fear.

Because while wizards would be easily able to win a war against muggles (since nuclear weapons and MAD weren't a thing yet), doing so would require the widespread use of unforgivable curses. And due to their much smaller numbers, even small loses would be devastating.

In reality yes. There's alway's some trauma or cataclysm.

But this is the 'Magical world' wherein fire, drowning, trial by cake or any other muggle method does not harm wizardkind.

And Rowling was writing in a time where the Berlin wall had fallen, Democracies were increasing, she had a positive view of the future and globalisation. The UN was apparently effective so of course she'd mention a parallel to it in the Wizarding world. International cooperation was just a fact of modern life.

I might write a fic paralleling our times...

And whose to say that Gerald Gardner wasn't a wizard (or even a squib) who brought wicca culture into the muggle world? (Granted, this is hypothetical) It wouldn't be the first time someone from the wizarding world directly affected the muggle world.

***** Very well, I will concede to that. However, that brings in another question of whether there are any faithful, trustworthy, or reliable documents or artifacts that describe druid traditions accurately. If so those can be used to build a religion for the wizarding world. Let's be honest, it would be extremely weird for any long standing society to be devoid of an original religion of some form. P.S.

****** Fairly little is known about the druids in particular, as far as I know, but there is a wealth of information on Celtic polytheism, albeit generally of second-hand nature at best. The Romans and later Christian monks recorded a lot of hearsay on the topic. Wikipedia has a helpful, if not very long, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Celtic_religion][article]] on the subject.

I agree that it would be/is very odd for wizarding society to lack any kind of religious tradition. I'd welcome any attempt to invent something neat in regards to it, with or without reference to actual historical rites; I'm just not fond of the practice of falling back on Wicca, being what it is.

And no, I don't think you're being belligerent.

******* *Ancient Celtic religion*

Ancient Celtic religion, commonly known as Celtic paganism, comprises the religious beliefs and practices adhered to by the Iron Age people of Western Europe now known as the Celts, roughly between 500 BCE and 500 CE, spanning the La TÃ¨ne period and the Roman era, and in the case of the Insular Celts the British and Irish Iron Age. Very little is known with any certainty about the subject, and apart from documented names that are thought to be of deities, the only detailed contemporary accounts are by hostile and probably not-well-informed Roman writers.

Celtic paganism was one of a larger group of Iron Age polytheistic religions of the Indo-European family. It comprised a large degree of variation both geographically and chronologically, although "behind this variety, broad structural similarities can be detected" allowing there to be "a basic religious homogeneity" among the Celtic peoples.The Celtic pantheon consists of numerous recorded theonyms, both from Greco-Roman ethnography and from epigraphy.

*** That is an agreeable statement. It is often a trope in fanfics for pure bloods to suffer lower birth rates. As a result they propagate their ideas less because there is less of them. Further more it is believable, if not expected, that a muggle born would keep the religion they are born to and pass it onto their children. This leads to a society that leans more and more towards another religion as time goes on. Come to think of it, this makes the pureblood idea that muggle borns are a threat to their culture more understandable.

** Wizards were heavily tied to muggle royalty before the SOS. Which means they were heavily Christian, as everyone was at that time.

I doubt they would revert to paganism. It would make sense that they follow Christianity culturally, especially with an influx of muggleborns throughout the centuries, which also would be heavily Christian until the 1900s.

*** I could maybe see all the witch hunting putting them off the religion, but I don't see them reverting to some pagan religion noone has followed in centuries.

They'd probably just make their own sect of Christianity, with magic portrayed in a better light and whatever other changes whoever was in charge felt like, probably involving claiming tithes and church land for the ministry somehow.

** My headcanon is that Christianity is more popular among wizards than among muggles. I think there are earlier religions here and there, for example, I imagine that all Persian wizards are Zoroastrians.

However, I like to imagine that a bunch of people with Death Eater-like views began inventing neopagan stuff in the 1950s and that Malfoy has wanted to join them, despite knowing that it's bullshit, but wasn't allowed to by his wife.

I enjoyed that fic, but I rolled my eyes so hard when Lavender had her tarrot card reading moment. As is typical, the fic author just looked at the names of the cards and assumed the most literal (and completely inaccurate) meaning. In actual tarrot reading traditions the meanings tend to be more metaphorical. "Death" doesn't always mean someone literally is going to die, but instead usually means a time of transition or radical change. "The Hanged Man" isn't about someone being killed for justice, but is instead about a state of suspension that forces a person to view the world around them in a different way.

*** J.K. Rolling says a lot of things in retrospect. Like when she said that Hermoine was actually black and an amputee, and that she just forgot to mention it. As such, you can't really take her words seriously after the "death of the author".

Furthermore, her arguement that the two systems don't work with each other has little basis. While she introduced a number of different categories and disciplines of magic (light, dark, gray, transfiguration, charms, potions), she rarely, if ever, went into detail about them. Wand based magic requires wand motions and incantations, but does not explain why, what the motions mean, or why they are important. She doesn't explore the magic methods of other cultures, like rain dances of native Americans, the ritual sacrifices of the Aztecs, the mummification of Egypt, the shrunken heads of the amazon tribes. With the exception of the occasional rule thrown into the story, she doesn't talk about the limitations of magic, and even then the rules are sorta glossed over. At most, what is said is that great deeds take great magic. Nothing more.

Considering the lax rules and descriptions, it makes it very easy for fanfic authors to describe new magic systems that can operate easily in the potter verse magic.

The magic in Harry Potter is essentially the Power of Bullshit, so saying that wicca magic can't operate in Harry Potter is equally bullshit.

****** Absolutely, she has a habit of sticking her foot in her mouth and saying things like, "Oh by the way, wizards shit themselves and vanished the waste". Death of the Author though is not quite the same as discarding any insights the author has to offer after-the-fact. It's more that nobody is obligated to accept them. It's the difference between shutting one's ears to everything JKR says, and listening to what she has to say but saying "You're full of shit, JK, try again."
