They seem like they would be obvious pairings but I haven't seen any stories with them.


** I'm pretty sure the entire Hp/Teen Titans Crossover section is all Harry is someone's brother, Harry is dating Raven and Harry is Raven stories

** Are you talking about Raven as in the blue shapeshifter chick? I only ask because I can't help being nit-picky and she's a Marvel character.

*** That's Mystique. Raven is her human name. OP probably is talking about Raven from Teen Titans, DC, who has a Dark Lord / King of Demons as a father and a villain.

**** Yes! I couldn't think of her name, but I knew she was known as Raven to some. And yeah, that makes sense. I haven't seen much of Teen Titans because it only seems to be broadcast on pay-TV here in Aus. From what I have seen, Raven is badass.
