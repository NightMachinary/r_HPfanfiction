These used to be super-popular for obvious reasons and I still see the odd one popping up, but I'm not sure how well-received they are these days. There's a sense I feel of having covered all ground possible in this era. Is that true?

What's in vogue these days anyway?

Yes I'm thinking of writing something.


** There's definitely still a big audience for them and a reasonable amount of people writing - the difference is they tend to be short stories, one shots or snippets. I think post-DH there was a big "im going to write what happened next!" phase and people would end up with lengthy fics where not much happened and the same beats had to be hit. I think those that are left have found that filling in those years is more powerful when focusing in on specific moments. At least that's how it's been for me - I basically have one giant fic made up from hundreds of one shots all in the same canon-compliant universe.

** I want way more post-DH fics, preferably EWE. The reason I got into HP fan fiction is because I wanted to know what happened after DH. The first fic I ever read was "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]]" by little0bird and I have been hooked on what your brains come up with ever since.

** I want more post-DH punishment fics. As far as I know, it's pretty much just "Sum of Their Parts" and "Marriage Law Revolution", neither of which is satisfactory. I want a fic that's not just Cornelius Fudge and his enablers and Dolores Umbridge and her collaborators (every staffer for the Muggleborn Registration Commission, every Snatcher, every Daily Prophet propagandist, etc.) getting executed, but the whole society that created them getting the Carthage or Khwarazmia treatment.

Don't get me wrong, I love EWE romance. But I really want to read a story where Wizarding Britain's version of Radical Reconstruction happens. Give me Percy Weasley and Barnabus Cuffe in the magical English equivalent of a Vietnamese reeducation camp.

Holy shit lol.

But then again... it's the English. Their idea of a concentration camp is probably serving inmates no-brand teabags instead of proper leaf, Marmite sandwiches, and the only permitted entertainment being a collection of Shakespeare in the original.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8431550/Dorothea-Greengrass][Dorothea Greengrass]] has a few post-DH Haphne fics that are pretty decent. Same parameters, I also like the 'Wheels Within Wheels" series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10223509/Bfd1235813][Bfd1235813]]. All of this is EWE.

A Haphne that I like that is mostly Epilogue compliant is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12414949/1/Black-coffee-with-sugar][Black Coffee with Sugar]]". linkffn(12414949)

  Daphne woke up to the smell of coffee, which was unusual, all things considered. Mostly because she didn't drink coffee.

Come off it mate. Most of the Snarry and Tomarry fics I've come across have Harry be of age. Smearing a /huge/ proportion of the fanbase as pedophilles is a shitty thing to do.

**** Voldemort was born in *1926*. I don't care how old Harry is when you're looking at age gap of more than half a *century*. Tomarry will never cease to be creepy as fuck to me, no matter how you justify it. Not technically paedophelia, no. But still disturbing for a number of reasons.

You'll also notice that it says /student/ in your quote. Snape/*student* is morally reprehensible. Even when the student is 'of age'.

All that being said: you do you. Read whatever the hell you want to read because that's your decision and nobody else's, but it doesn't change the fact that child molestation is an apt label for snape/student and tomarry.

Time travel /shrug/

I assumed you meant "student" as in a person Snape had taught at some point. Him with current students is very bad, I'll agree with you.

I don't even like these pairings, I just don't like seeing such loaded terms being flung around in relation to fanfiction of all terms.

I'm coming /back/ to HP fanfiction after a full decade away. Back in my heyday there were /scads/ of Teacher/Student fics, most especially around OotP/HBP when JK ramped the romance angle, it wasn't out-and-out statutory rape any more in most jurisdictions, and Voldemort was kicking ass and taking names.

Shit I even have a couple of Snape/Hermiones saved somewhere. I usually prefer canon pairings but some of these are really /good/.

What can I say? It was a more innocent time, I think.

Fair enough. I still think child molestation is an apt term and it's a lot less loaded than the alternatives (such as paedophelia, which you brought up... not the dude you're responding to.)

I dislike it too, but at the same time? If it looks like a duck, and acts like a duck... Questionable pairings are still questionable even if you sugar coat them, so you may as well just call them what they are imo. They aren't 'okay' to me but it's fiction, so who cares?

(And yes, I've heard about people losing their shit over authors writing this stuff, and realise that that's probably what's prompting this. Those people are ridiculous.)

***** The pair I read the most is Tomarry (because enemies to lovers or soulmate fics are my jam). A common way of bridging the age gap is time travel or resurrecting a similarly aged Horcrux, like the ring or diary.

Now ngl, there are definitely creepy Voldemort/Harry fics out there- the worst ones are those creature inheritance fics. Yikes.
