Hello!

I've been wondering if there is a fic out there which deals with the fact that harry killed Quirrell at the age of 11? I think it should have affected him more than it did in the books. So maybe some lingering PTSD, struggles with the moral aspect of killing a man(self defense or not), maybe Quirrell's relatives blaming Harry for his death, I'll take anything really.

Any pairing or no pairing is ok, but, please no baseless bashing.

Thank you!


** Just to point out, that's only in the movie. In the book, Quirrel is only injured by Harry and was still operational until Dumbledore arrived. What then killed Quirrel was Riddle leaving his body and fleeing.\\
There might still be fics about that, but just to point it out.

*** Harry was burning quirrel. Then he passes out. He wakes up to a dead quirrel.

**** Harry wakes up to a Dumbledore who tells him that he (Dumbledore) arrived in time to prevent Quirrel from taking the stone, though Harry was "doing very well on [his] own". Dumbledore "arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off [Harry]."

Then Riddle left him and he died. Given that Quirrel was already dying from the possession, it was probably Riddle's departure that killed the injured Quirrel.

***** ...which would be why Harry can't see the thestrals until 5th Year, after Cedric. He never actually saw Quirrell die.

** Let's be honest, by the end of the series all of those kids are traumatized and desperately in need of therapy.

*** That is true, of course.

I was thinking, maybe book 2 for Harry and post-Quirrell angst. So more focus on the fact that harry himself was just a kid back then.
