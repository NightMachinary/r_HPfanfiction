So I was working the other day and an idea popped into my head about a Harry Potter fanfic. I was wondering if anyone had come across any stories about Harry as a professor or as Headmaster teaching the next generation, while still focusing on Harry?


** There are a number that focus on him being a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/search.php?ready=1&keywords=aurors,%20harry%20potter,%20ron&categoryid=0&genreid=0&subgenreid=0&languageid=0&censorid=0&statusid=0&type=story&match=any&sort=0&ppage=1&characterid=0&subcharacterid=0&words=6][Auror]] since that is the JKR timeline but as far teacher or headmaster I haven't read any. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4567822/1/Time-Again][here]] is one ... once again I haven't read it but it was the first one to pop up.

** I have a novel where he becomes Headmaster at the end, but it doesn't factor heavily into the story. If you're interested in giving it a try, here it is:

*** I actually just finished this and its what (I think) gave me the idea of wanting to read more about if harry was the headmaster.

By the way, I really enjoyed your story and its probably one of my favorite fanfics now :)

**** I'm glad you enjoyed it. I have a few ideas for short follow-up stories, a couple of which involve Harry, Hermione and Susan teaching. I need to finish my current work-in-progress first, though.

** If you have not read it yet, I highly suggest [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]['Hope']] by Jaconais. Harry becomes a professor at Beauxbatton. However you have to know up front, this story is Harry/Gabriel Delacour, and she is slightly underage (I think she's either 6th or 7th year)

this space reserved in case I remember any other, there are plenty I have read but Hope sticks as one of my favorites. You can also find a lot where Harry becomes an assistant Professor for DADA in his 6th year as an obvious follow-on to his success teaching the DA in Order of the Phoenix

*** The first fic I ever read was "This Means War" by Jeconais, and it was the reason I got hooked on fanfic in the first place. While much less active these days, I always seem to come back to reading Jeconais' fics every few months, and just marvelling at how well-done they are.
