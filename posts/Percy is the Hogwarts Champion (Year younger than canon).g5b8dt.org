** Fuck, I'm sorry to derail this, but imagine Percy and the Twins spending ~seven years in the same dormitory, comedy gold.

**** Then that would make the Twins second years, and thus joining the Gryffindor Quidditch team the same year as Harry.

** He waited with baited breath for the Hogwarts Champion's name to be chosen. Becoming the Triwizard Champion would improve his career in the ministry when he starts there next year. He was confident that he would be chosen. Penny certainly thought so. As the parchment flew out of the goblet he felt his heart speed up with anticipation. Headmaster Dumbledore caught it and after a moment said, "Percy Weasley"

Cheers erupted around him as his house clapped for him. He spied the bright smile on Penny's face as she made her way towards him and felt warmth bloom in his chest. Not even the twins booing could ruin his good mood. Penny wrapped her arms around him when she reached him. He heard her shout, "Told you." before she pressed kissed his cheek. He saw the twins gagging and felt a twinge of anger despite his best efforts to ignore them. "Congratulations Percy." He turned and saw his youngest brother and his two friends beaming up at him.

"Thank you Ron; Hermione; Harry." He gave each of them a nod. He saw the Headmaster beckon him and after giving Penny a kiss on the cheek walked to the front of the hall. He was pleased that he was chosen. He would get the opportunity to interact with Department Heads from the Ministry. As he was directed towards the ante chambers he saw the Goblet flare once more and stopped in his tracks.

The Great Hall fell silent as everyone watched the events unfold. Another parchment was spit out of the Goblet. Headmaster Dumbledore caught the parchment and stared at it for a few long seconds before reading out, "Harry Potter."
