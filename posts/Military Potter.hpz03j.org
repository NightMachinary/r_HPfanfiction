:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Some time ago ive read 2 ff's and i cant find them any More :(

1. Harry is kind of a special Agent, and after he refuses to re enlist he gets hunted by his former Colleges. He was as far as i can recall in a relationship with the daughter of his direct Boss.

2. I can only remember that the queen makes harry a navy comander and he Attacs Azkaban at somepoint .

Thx in advance Bravo Mike


** 1. is linkffn(7560048)

Harry is betrayed at the final battle and is forced to flee England and rebuild his life anonymously anew.Prophesy has a way of interferring and dragging him back to face his destiny,that doesn't mean he has to like it or cooperate with the powers that be.

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
