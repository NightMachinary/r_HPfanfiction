Gemino and Engorgio can be used to make food more plentiful, but does it work on potions ingredients? How often can you use it before it wears off?


** There is no suggestion in canon that there is any upper limit to duplicating or enlarging food in particular, and it's hard to see /why/ there would be any, though in the case of enlargement, it's worth noting that Transfiguration of a tiny object into a larger one is harder than of one object to another one of equal size, so it's possible that the same principles would make /Engorgio/ exponentially harder to cast the bigger the intended result is compared to the original.

There is no canonical word concerning Potion ingredients, but the fact that there is a thriving market for Potion ingredients in the Wizarding World (whereas there aren't any wizard-only grocery stores... hmm...) suggests that while you might be able to duplicate or enlarge the /substance/, you can't duplicate magical energy using magic. Meaning that you could potentially, say, turn a drop of Basilisk Venom into gallons and gallons of the stuff, but those gallons and gallons would only contain as much magic as the original drop, diluted beyond use.

Don't know if this counts, but: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/The_Magic_Neep]]

Yeah that makes sense.

**** The Magic Neep isn't in canon. It's in a hidden object mobile game, and a place in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Orlando.

*** My headcanon is that it loses potency.

Food loses calories and potion ingredients lose potency if you enlarge it.

I do like your explanation with magic though!

** It's important to remember that 90% of the potion ingredients we see in canon are just regular plants and animal parts - not from magical plants or creatures. I don't really see why there would be any difference between a newt's eye and a steak, when it comes to duplication/expansion.

The important thing to remember about duplication, however, is that you have a copy of the original as-is. Which means if you need something fresh, duplication isn't going to help you, because it replicates the age of the object you're copying. We saw this in DH when Hermione wasn't able to make fresh bread out of the mouldy bread they had.

** My headcanon is that while you could use those charms on potion ingredients, the magical traces the charms leave on them would result in them having their intended effect altered and them not being suitable to make reliable potions, similarly ingredients created by transfiguration would also not behave like a natural ingredients and be just as unsuitable.
