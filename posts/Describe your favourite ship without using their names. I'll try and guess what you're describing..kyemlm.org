***** Even more so if it is an AU where Hufflepuff was the actual super rich house (still with the same reputation though) while Slytherin was a muggleborn/from a very young family that ended up poor after he left/was killed/died naturally/whatever and never got to the heights of prestige Salazar envisioned.

Can you imagine Tom's conflict at having to choose between claiming to be Slytherin's heir and getting only a smidgen of respect from his house-mates or admitting that he is Hufflepuff's heir and get the riches but also be forced to deal with a ridiculous name plus being ridiculed though his whole life since his Hufflepuff side of the family made excellent business decisions and worked hard for their money but never actually bothered showing it off or using it to accumulate power.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

Also, anything with Malfoy would need to diverge early enough that he would be practically recognisable. And Lupin's number 1 canon trait is disappearing, so he's no relationship material.

James/Lily is a special case where I would say that the plot is limiting it rather than the tropes. Few authors are willing to say "screw canon, they win and survive the war".

#+begin_quote
  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

**** There are many different kinds of Tomarry fics. I recommend going through ao3. The older fics are really good. Filter to look through the older ones. There are many completed ones. Though I gotta warn you, "Tom Riddle/Harry Potter", "Voldemort/Harry Potter", and "Tom Riddle | Voldemort/ Harry Potter" are pretty different tags. There are also ones with two "\" marks and those are threesomes. There are many good authors. And many different fics. The diversity is honestly really astounding.
