** DisobedienceWriter has some really good oneshots over on FFN- The Valley of the Kings Massacre, The Potter Family Grimoire, and The Birth of Evil. All really well written and intriguing plots!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1228238/DisobedienceWriter]]

Also, there was one oneshot (around 80k words?) that was somewhat AU involving an OC following different way of living from where she came from, strictly following decorum and Harry becomes intrigued by that style of life and the way magic is taught there. I was skeptical about reading it at first but I was drawn to the plot rather quickly. The author has since taken the fic off from FFN but feel free to shoot me a PM if you're interested in a copy.

EDIT- just remembered the name: HP and the Transfer Student

Some dark humor - Harry invites Dumbledore, the Blacks, his parents and more to appear on Rita Skeeter's new talk show. Some of the most inappropriately funny lines ever written in fanfiction.

In general, you really can't go wrong with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/579283/Lucillia][Lucillia's]] one shots.
