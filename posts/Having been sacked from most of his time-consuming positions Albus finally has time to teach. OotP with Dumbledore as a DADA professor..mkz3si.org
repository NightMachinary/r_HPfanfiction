** I think students like Hermione would HATE having him as a professor. He'd never follow the syllabus, have an informal grading system, and allow his students to bait him into story time instead of an actual lecture. You'd learn so much from him if he actually bothered teaching what he was supposed to that day, instead of getting distracted and lecturing on an Albanian weather charm because he looked out the window and saw rain.

(I love dumbledore, I just think he's a whimsical mess most of the time.)

*** I think you have a point, but at the same time, Dumbledore was an amazing teacher- from what we know anyway.

I think it would feel like he's gone senile, but by going off on tangents of real life events, the students would learn real world things.

I can see it being like a Mister Miyagi wax on wax off type of thing.

I can totally see a scene where a student uses a spell that seemed completely useless during the lesson, only for it to save their life. Just the pure, "oh my god, he's not nuts" would make me laugh.

Dumbles is a Transfiguration Master, he's gotta think outside of the box, so of course he's going to teach outside of it too.

**** I actually thought about your last line when I initially read the prompt! I pictured him hanging out with a couple of younger students to teach them how to use whatever their specialty is (potions, charms, etc.) to defend themselves, because that's how fights really are. He seems like a very hands on teacher if he had the chance to actually teach. (Honestly, people ignore Dumbledore's tragedy as well. Dude just wanted to hang out at Hogwarts but he kept having to fight dark lords bc he was so badass)

***** Ah, a fellow intellectual!

I love the idea of someone throwing around potions like Oprah. "You get a potion! You get a potion! You get a potion!" His targets explode, melt, turn inside out, grow gills and asphyxiate. Just pure carnage! Then he can throw healing potions. Just imagine bleeding out only to get cracked over the head with a bottle and feeling right as rain right after, the possibilities are endless.

(And exactly! The dude just wanted to be normal but people won't leave him alone. Honestly, I kinda want a fic where he becomes a teacher to teach other people to lead the light so that he doesnt have to.)

"Yes... that could work. If I teach everyone to think and act for themselves, maybe even act like I'm losing my touch so that other people step up and do the work, maybe then I can finally retire and create my knitting club! Yes! Magnificent once again, Albus. I think I deserve a lemon drop..."

Was he, though? The only on-screen lessons we get from him were the Pensieve lessons in Book 6, and he dragged those out over the course of what's implied to be months when it could have been wrapped up in a matter of a couple hours or days.

Really, all it did was arbitrarily increase the length of the plot until the hunt for the locket in the cave coincided with Malfoy's plot to invade Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore.

**** Mine taught poli sci too! I can't remember the guy's name, but he gave us extra points on our essays if we could work in “capitalist pig dogs” into our essays smoothly and let me use dragons as a tool of war in a class war simulation. (PS- they're very effective bc not only are they pretty much WMDs, but they can also be used to obliterate the enemy's infrastructure and agricultural resources.)

*** According to the Crimes of Grindelwald (up to you if you consider it canon), he seems to have had the same teaching style like Lupin. My headcanon is that Voldemort also recruited the younger Death Eaters through a secret course of Dark Arts (Bellatrix sort of implies that he had taught them) and his prop was to demonstrate the Unforgivable Curses on spiders and then subject his pupils to the Imperius Curse to see who could break from it.

Sorry for the rambling... anyways to your point. It would be funny to have a senile Dumbledore in his old age who would constantly get distracted by ramblings against government, the youth of today, the amount of books he receives for Christmas. And when he is in a cheery mood he would go on and on and on talking about that time when he fought Grindelwald.

** Road trips all day e'er day. Road trips to Azkaban, Little Hangleton, random orphanages, Albanian forests, random seaside caves. Guest lecturers from the Order of the Phoenix. But also lots of practical DADA learning of course.

The Ministry hears of this and concludes he's trying to build an army. Hermione forms a study group for a little more structured book learning in order to pass her OWL, and sarcastically names it "Dumbledore's Army". And that's how the Fudge-Dumbledore clash happened.
