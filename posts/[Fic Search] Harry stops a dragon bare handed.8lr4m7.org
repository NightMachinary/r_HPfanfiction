The scene was set during the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. I recall Harry catching and stopping the tail of the dragon dead in its tracks. I believe it was wandless body strengthening of some sort. Tonks was in attendance in some official capacity, either as the ministry's judge or as an auror, and she was publicly vocal when Karkaroff showed favoritism.


** sounds like An Unexpected Apprenticeship by Goldfish641 which can be found [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=215775&chapter=0][here]] unfortunately it's been deleted from FFN

** While it's not exactly what you're looking for, it does have harry stopping, and outright destroying a dragon with his own physical might.
