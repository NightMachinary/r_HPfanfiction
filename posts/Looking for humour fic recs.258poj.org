I mean properly stupid btw like "Oh God Not Again"


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]] is pretty hilarious, especially if you don't like Ron. If you do like Ron, you should probably read something else.

Also, take a look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorchach's Blot]]. He's got a bunch of crack stories.

** I don't know whether it's stupid enough for you, but it's filled with silly Slytherins and snarky Snape. If you like it, kindly leave a review.

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]]. It has a lot of Super!Harry, but it's brilliant nonetheless.\\
^{Man, I recommend that one a lot here.}

Anyway, as a general rule I find that Super!Harry has a lot of good humour fics. There's so much more silliness to be had when Harry can manipulate space/time.

** I recall [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/nightwing/TMCRAM.html][this fic]] being ridiculously funny when I read it a few years back. its a marauders era metafic where the marauders and death eaters in training are locked in the Room of Requirement and forced to read the HP books aloud by a crazy authoress who keeps turning them into various things (like donkeys) when they misbehave. Nightwing has also written parodies for the first 5 movies.

** Obsessive Lily Disorder (and by default, You Give Me Heart Palpitation) is a good read for a more crack-y sort of humor. The lampshading type of humor employed by Oh God Not Again is rather hard to find however. Shoebox Project is always worth a read as well

** I've been writing a comedy (sort of) story of my own. It's nothing compared to the classics listed on this thread, but please give it a try if you're interested in internet memes, gaming, and anime.

*** It's very amusing. If you like it try A Black Comedy, it's a similar idea and also Gryffindors Never Dies. A Black Comedy has Harry and Sirius going through the Veil and ending up in an alternate universe and Gryffindors Never Die has a 50 year old Harry and Ron going back in time .

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/546831/kyaru-chan][The Harveste Addams series.]] It's a crackfic series where Harry is adopted by the Addams Family. It's very creative. Some parts are stereotypical, but that's done on purpose considering that the Addams Family are basically a huge stereotype.
