What it says on the label. Schoolkids dare one another, and then there is escalation to double-dare, sometimes even to triple-dare. But triple-dares are rare: the real power is in the double-dog dare. Peer pressure requires that one cannot refuse a double-dog dare without severe social implications.

What would cause a British schoolchild to "know" that one CANNOT refuse this dare? (Magic-specific versions welcome.)


** not sure there would be one. peer pressure usually just comes with a lot of fuckin swearing.

** Hi, British person here lol

Its been a long time since I went to school (I'm 20) but as far as I can remember me and my friends just used to say "I DARE you" with emphasis on the dare.

Like for example:

"Oh, go on, do it. I DARE you."

Again I might be wrong or forgetting something if it comes to me I'll update this. I'd wait to get other peoples opinion as different kids say different stuff. I'm from the North so people down south might have different phrases.

Hope this helps.

*** I'm British too! And that is it, you literally just say I DARE you, most of the time with emphasis on the dare.

I would know I'm only 12

*** I seem to remember us saying "I swear down" a lot or "I swear on (insert family members life)" We were quite dramatic hahaha.

So an example might be:

"I swear down I'll do it" Or "I swear on my mums life I'll do it"

We never meant it obviously lol. We were only little.

** When I was a kid, it was always one-upmanship.

"I dare you to do X"

"I DOUBLE dare YOU to do X"

"Well, I TRIPLE DARE YOU TO DO X"

This interaction was revolutionised when one of us discovered 'googolplex' and later ended when we discovered 'infinity'. :D

There was never really a saying associated with the 'absolutely must accept' dares, just a mix of intimidation and peer pressure on top of the 'whoever knows the highest number/can be bothered to count that high'. I saw a lot of kids attempting nonsense like the 'lean in real close and yell' thing and so on in an attempt to leverage their social standing and general intimidating-ness to get other kids to do things.

Even so, it wasn't common. We weren't really a big 'dare' generation, I think (I was in secondary school a little under ten years ago), and I was the weird kid who didn't really get involved with anyone else beyond my precious books. :)

*** Yes, I'd say this was accurate for my childhood too. There might a weird consequence for backing out, but it probably wasn't much better than the dare.

**** Indeed. Primary through Secondary Schooling was full of weird things like that. Makes me feel ever so lucky that I was always an observer to it instead of a participant. :D
