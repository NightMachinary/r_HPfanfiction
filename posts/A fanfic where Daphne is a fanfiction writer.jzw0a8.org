Daphne is a fanfic writer hiding in the muggle world. Harry stumbles across her work on the net and ask her out for dinner. At he dinner he discovers she is a witch, and later at a park confronts her and learn who she is. Daphne uses Harry as an inspiration for her fanfic writing. Can't find this fic in my favorites, would greatly appreciate someone help me find this fic.
