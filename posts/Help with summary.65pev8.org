I'm fixing my current WIP. I'm not going to bother with the 3 volumes now, it's all going to be in one place, even if it ends up gigantic. But, I will be fixing the first few chapters so it's not so heavy on the purple prose, and I want to change the summary because atm it's crap. I really hate writing summaries, so any advice would be good. I think I discussed it on here before and I got some good advice but stupidly never acted on it and now I can't find it.

The current summary is this:

For Remus Lupin, fresh from school and emboldened by the support of his friends, the Order of the Phoenix offers a thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, yet the dark ascent of Lord Voldemort would bring him close to losing everything... A canon compliant account of Remus Lupin's life, from Hogwarts onwards.

Advice on making it a bit more interesting? The fic in question is this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12248997/1/The-Colour-of-Everything-Vol-1]]

Ta :)


** It's got some bits in it I like, though it partly feels a bit redundant or long to me. If you cut

#+begin_quote
  fresh from school and emboldened by the support of his friends
#+end_quote

it would be more concise, and pack bit more of a punch and the bit at the end about the canon compliant account tells us it begins right after Hogwarts.

Or you could just trim it down quite a bit to

#+begin_quote
  For Remus Lupin, the Order of the Phoenix offers a thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, yet the dark ascent of Lord Voldemort would bring him close to losing everything...
#+end_quote

It implies a young Remus, and cuts down on the unnecessary portions that were present and adds in a bit more menace by ending where it does.

In other news, this reminds me that I still have to read this. Maybe I should just make a FFN account to keep track of things like this...

I like this a lot. I think you can make it a little smoother and even bring in a bit of flair by making it:

"For Remus Lupin, the Order of the Phoenix offers thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, but the bitter war with You-Know-Who may cost him more than he can imagine..."

1) I altered the first sentence to flow better (i assume he will have more than a single adventure).

2) I changed "dark ascent" to "bitter war", but depending how the story is it may not fit (is it war at the start, or only war at the end? My headcanon is that the war was already happening when remus graduated).

3) I added You-Know-Who since it is in line with the time period and has a canon feel.

4) I changed the tense at the end to present from past, because that matches the opening sentence.

5) And then finally i changed "close to losing everything" to "cost more than he can imagine" because it feels more dire and dramatic to me.

**** I'd keep the second sentence. Without it, the summary is almost spectacularly uninformative. I feel like canon-compliance is quite helpful to specify.

*** Thanks so much for this! It's been really helpful :) I've made the changes you guys suggest and I agree it packs more of a punch this way. Hopefully it increases footfall a little.

Haha, if you do read it before I make my changes please push past the waffle in the first chapter. I read it back the other day and wondered if I was on drugs when I wrote it.

**** No problem. I probably won't read it until next week anyways, moving very soon and then I have commitments this weekend, so /shrug/.
