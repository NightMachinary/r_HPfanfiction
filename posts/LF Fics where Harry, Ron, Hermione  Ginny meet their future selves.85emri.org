** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483), is the sequel to the popular "Delenda Est" in which the two dimensions met each other. The Delenda Est dimension is exactly 20 years ahead of the canon one, and Harry has so far met his future self and Hermione. Unfortunately, this story is on hiatus, but the author is still active.

  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.
