I'm sorry to ask however it seems I'm the only person who still cares about this top fic taken down from [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]

The author published chapter 43 after a four year break the fic then went down and hasn't come back since, what happened?


** Who knows. I made my peace with never finishing that one.

*** it really would've been one of a kind if it got an ending though. Or at least written through the end of book four idk. Maybe I need to write my own little ending a bit in order to resign to the unfinished fanfic gods.

** I recently reread this because it's one of my favorite time travel fics, but I really don't think there's any hope of it being finished.

** I don't believe it will. It's one of my all time favourite stories and I am sad, it's abandoned, but I think it won't change :(

*** :'(

It;s such a huge fic that it really feels like someone out there would adopt it. I mean even if it isn't as well written having an ending would really elevate it up there as the goat

** u/JennaSayquah:
#+begin_quote
  The author published chapter 43 after a four year break
#+end_quote

Give the guy a break: he had serious health issues, and spent some significant time in the hospital, during that period. For most of that, he was physically unable to walk (or write).

The most recent update on his blog was last June, in which he said he has not abandoned the story.

Priorities, man.

The [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/index/][existing fic]] (minus chapter 43) is still on fanficauthors-dot-net (login required). Because the FFN version got deleted, Chapter 43 is only known to exist on his Patreon page (or so I'm told; I'm not a paid member) and in [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][ebook available for download]].
