Like in first or second year Harry could sing for himself in the common room as he woke up from a nightmare and someone else who also woke up early like Percy as example hears him. He then becomes a celebrity among the students because of his voice and not because he is the boy who lived. He could start a music club and they could start "surprise" songs at Halloween, the end of the first half of the year and the end of the year.

He becomes also closer to other people than just Hermione and Ron and the students believe him in the fourth year when he says he didn't put his name into the goblet.


** and then when he does the dragon task he sings the dragon to sleep like fleur but instead of using magic to have good singing its all him

or maybe sing in parseltounge for the dragon and then have the music club congratulate him on inventing singing in parseltongue

oooh aand maybe in the dueling club thing have the singing club recognize the uses of parseltongue in singing or something and have them just drag him away all exited before he can even get accused and stuff

sooooo many ways to make the stories more fluffy

/You don't gotta do this/

/Let's reevaluate our options/

/Throw away our old assumptions/

/Cause really we don't wanna go through this/

/I'm really not that special/

/The Boy-Who-Lived is only flesh and bones/

/The truth is in the end/

/I'm pretty useless without friends/

/In fact I'm alone/
