Some folks are posting asking for good fics to read, so I decided to promote my favorite type :P. Excellent combat description, decent characterization and plot. The premise: HP travels back in time, but only has ... twelve hours (or less) to get it all done.


** I read Elizium of the Sleepless Souls by that author, and wow, it was mind-blowing so I'll try this one out too, thanks for the rec!

*** Just finished it myself. I'd place [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langoliers][/the Langoliers/]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante%27s_Peak][/Dante's Peak/]] and /1984/ as neighbour nodes to it.

**** Too little action is 1984. Plus, sadness level set at too much. But putting this at the same level as that, nice.

***** Not at the same level, just connected with edges of similarity (this is only a fanfic, after all).

Well, it's like with Shane Carruth films---there is a lot of things implied to be happening “off screen”, and when you draw these things into the general picture yourself, the film\books stops lacking in action dept.

** /(spoiler warnings)/

Nice battle scenes and magical laws.

There were some places in the story where older!Harry's decisions could've been used by the author for poor plot turns or excuses (e.g. not obliviating the aurors, not trying to placate Sirius first and instead choosing to fight him, entrusting Cedric to kill Voldemort without knowing for sure that he's been rendered completely harmless, etc), but since he didn't use them, I guess it should not be held too much against the story.

On another non-related note, I guess since older!Harry /did/ get to be sent back at the end of his travel period (even if it didn't last any), that means that his original timeline didn't exactly disappear or get “painlessly” modified. That leaves the readers with a world of at least two different timelines, one of which is still a quite unhappy place, where Harry has potentially caused much more destruction than Voldemort ever did.

Thanks for sharing the story.
