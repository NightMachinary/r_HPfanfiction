  In his final moments, Riddle's Diary Horcrux kills Ginny out of spite. Torn apart by the decision he made and his emotions running high, Harry takes The Sorting Hat and escapes from Hogwarts to allow the Hat to shape him into the man he's meant to be. A Knight.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
