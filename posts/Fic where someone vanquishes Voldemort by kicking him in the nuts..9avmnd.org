Because why the hell not? I got kicked in the nuts once and it felt like my soul was leaving my body. In this case it would happen in a literal sense.

Edit: If this actually happens in a fic, can you recommend it? I can't imagine it's very common though.


** Does resurrected lizardman Voldemort even have nuts to kick? According to the internet, snakes' testes are carried internally and adjacent to the kidneys.

*** He does. Because someone is going to kick him there and he will die as a result of that mortal blow. You will not convince me otherwise.

  You know those fanfics where he has Snape brew him a potion to restore his handsome features after the GoF snake face ritual? Maybe in canon, he just asked Snape to brew him a potion to restore his nuts. What I'd give to see that conversation
