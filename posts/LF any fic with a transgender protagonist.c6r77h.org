** "The Girl Who Lived (Again)" by dirgewithoutmusic on ao3 is a one-shot re-imagining of HP with one specific change made to canon: Harry's trans. It's 10,000ish words. The important bits in this fic (and several others like it that the author has written) are the little things that change because of Harry's different experience, rather than there being any massive butterfly effects.

Ugh, I can't really explain the style well. It's not long, but I hope you like it.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/928195/chapters/1805088][TransFigured]] is a Wolfstar fic. It's been awhile since I read it but I remember that I found it really well done and unique.

Teddy is more genderqueer in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/285360?view_adult=true][Being Liquid]], but it's a really good read and I'd highly recommend it if you haven't read it already.

  [Trans!Ron; Ron/Hermione, various pairings] He learned his lesson a long time ago. Boys are boys, girls are girls. And Ron, Ron makes a good boy. He's tall, sturdy, manly, not like some of those long-haired Slytherins he sometimes mistakes for girls when they slink in the dark corridors with their robes floating behind them. He plays Quidditch. He loves Hermione, with a little too much intensity and adoration for a boy his age, but that's what constant brushes with death do to you. He shaves; he doesn't jerk off, granted, but apart from that, he's pretty much the poster boy for healthy, honest masculinity.So why is it, then - why is it he can't believe it, not for one second?

** linkffn(Session Transcripts) has trans!Hermione. I don't recall what name he chose for himself. Something that started with H.. Hector maybe? He's not really the protagonist but he's a major character.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
