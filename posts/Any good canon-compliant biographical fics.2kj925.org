Although it wasn't entirely canon-compliant, I liked the one about Snape (A Difference in the Family or something like that). Does anybody know any fics covering the lives of other more or less significant characters? I would prefer something about Tom Riddle or Dumbledore but any character that we don't know too much about from the canon would be great. Also, if it's possible, I would prefer something that is not abandoned.

Thank you very much.


** Here's a great story about the Dumbledore family. It's a work-in-progress, but very much alive and still being updated.

** Minus a very short bit with Harry at the start, the first chapter (10k words) of my fic The One He Feared is an exploration of Dumbledore and Grindelwald.

The fic as a whole doesn't meet your criteria, but you can read chapter one as essentially a one-shot.
