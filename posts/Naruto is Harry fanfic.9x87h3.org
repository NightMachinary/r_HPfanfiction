  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.

** I don't have one where he's reincarnated but I do have this one. It's a female naruto/female harry (same person) takes traits from both characters and I personally really enjoyed it.
