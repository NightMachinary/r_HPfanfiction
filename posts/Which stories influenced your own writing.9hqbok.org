** For example, the R-series was the inspiration for a series of concepts which I eventually developed into "No longer alone" while pretty much every "Harry gets adopted by the Tonks family" story was a negative example because it ended with a romantic relationship between them.

Another positiv example would be "Dignity in fear", because I adore the way the author writes emotions (even in the steamy parts). Or "Call me" and its sequel for a story where teenagers actually act like teenagers (drinking, drugs, sex) instead of ignoring that side of growing up.

**** As far as my class was concerned there were no exceptions, and from what I've heard, pretty much all of Germany is the same (we aren't really concerned about underage drinking here, at least as far as wine and beer are concerned). And from the "Brit-pick" threads around here, the UK in the 90s wasn't that different. As long as you didn't overdo things, no one really cared. You could get a beer without an ID pretty easily.

The average age for the first time is 16 in the UK, which means that by graduation, a large majority will have had sex, most of them quite regularly if they are in a relationship. Especially considering that Hogwarts is de-facto unsupervised.

I know that I am an outliner when it comes to smoking, having never smoked tobacco or weed. Nearly everyone at least tries it once or twice.

All the stories which pretend that teenagers are angles are just odd. I mean, I'm not asking for Harry to smoke weed every day or fuck his way through Hogwarts, but at least acknowledge that stuff like that happens. Hermione isn't going to be outraged whenever someone mentions underage sex/smoking/drinking because it would be just a regular Tuesday. She might give Harry or Ron shit for doing it, but it will hardly be the first time she hears of it, especially since she is a prefect and will have walked in on the occasional shag or Neville selling some magic shrooms.

****** Like I said, it doesn't have to be omnipresent or even frequently mentioned, but outright ignoring these things results in really weird situations. It makes the characters feel like weird parodies of actual people, since in real life teenagers do the kind of things the author ignores.

** Fic-wise I've been inspired by linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum) and another fic I beta'd, linkffn(The Augeretis Fons by Relish RedShoes). The Aurors is pretty well-known here, murder mystery with excellent and moving character building. The Augeretis Fons is a new fic, still in-progress but when I beta'd it, I was simply amazed. So I'm channeling my inner InquisitorCoC by shilling it here.

In terms of normal books I've got an unhealthy obsession with Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Fuck you, Hollywood, for butchering its legacy.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  Six years after the Battle of Hogwarts, war veterans from both sides begin to die in increasingly violent & suspicious circumstances. Are they unrelated incidents, as The Ministry asserts, or is something more sinister afoot, as Hermione begins to suspect? When someone unexpected returns to Hermione's life, will they prove to be an ally in her investigation or a stone cold killer?

** Easily the most influential fanfiction to me was Shinji and Warhammer 40k. It cememented in my mind that Fanfiction should do three things: 1. Take cannon, and make everything that was even a little sucky about it AWESOME (and by AWESOME I mean KICK REASON TO THE CURB AND GO BEYOND THE IMPOSSIBLE). 2. More than a little irreverent and funny and 3. Never be completed properly.

** I wrote my first story, "And Gryffindor Roars" after reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993848/1/Games-are-afoot][Games are afoot]] by grumpy grizzly. Though it's not particularly well-written (because neither is my first story), it introduced me to the Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger pairing which I really happened to like. It's unfortunate that many stories including them are smut-ridden with few actually having a believable plot but you take what you can get, I guess.

** linkffn(Reclamation of Black Magic) influenced how I thought about going about building up the plot to a satisfying climax. :) I doubt I stack up, but I try. linkffn(Definitions of Romance; Hermione Granger is Stupid) influenced how I think about character interactions, namely how to go about making characters and their attributes work well together, and believably so.

** Well, my Heir of Darkness series was inspired by my inability (at the time) to find any Slytherin!Harry stories that weren't either fluffy to the point of absurdity or so evildark it was just laughable. I wanted a middle route, where he's not adopted by Snape and immediately befriended by every pureblood ever, but still adopts some of the 'dark side' mindset and behaviours without ever realizing what he's doing.
