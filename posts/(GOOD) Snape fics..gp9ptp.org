I'd like recommendations to the following kinds of fanfics:

- Good (and realistic) Severitus fics (that aren't as dark as In Blood Only)
- Good time travel Snape fics where he treats Harry better instead of trying to rectify his and Lily's relationship
- Good Snape vs. Umbridge fanfics
- Good (and realistic) hurt!Snape fanfics where he is also a badass

Sorry if I may be being too specific. Also, if possible, could the fanfics have the canon relationships? Thanks!

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*** I think I've reread this one at least five or six times. I really enjoy the fact that there is a lot more interaction between the first years than there is in a lot of stories. There is a sequel too which is equally good.

**** Yeah, it's so well-written! I enjoyed his friendship with students of other houses too. Everything felt so much more amicable. And the sequel is fantastic too, which doesn't always happen.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I just finished linkao3(The Definition of Home) and it's sequel and I really enjoyed both. Starts the summer after Harry's fourth year and the Severitus develops pretty organically.

#+begin_quote
  Harry runs into Snape while trying to find the definition of home, and finds himself drawn into Snape's summer Order task by the headmaster, looking for a location outside of London. Along the way, he and Snape learn a few new definitions themselves.
