Hi! I've just decided to start writing lots of Harry Potter Drabbles, mostly Crossovers!

I've just finished a Harry/PotC (Harry/Norrington) and I'm now asking for help about what to write about next!

Here's the fandoms I'll probably write about first, but other suggestions are welcome!

*Criminal Minds *Bones *Sherlock *Doctor Who *Merlin *Supernatural *Grimm *Twilight *Lord of the Rings *Glee *Avengers *Pirates of the Carribean

Come with character and/or plot suggestions! I write both slash/het/gen!

Cheers, Vaettr
