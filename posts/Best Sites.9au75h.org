To be honest, I haven't read much fanfic since I was a teenager 10-15 years ago, but I've recently been feeling nostalgic with my own writings, and am interested in getting back into reading some new stuff.

To show my age a bit, my old go-to site was Quizilla, rest in peace.

What are the good fanfic sites these days?


** [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] and ao3 have absorbed a lot of the other smaller sites; these two are the big ones nowadays. The days of having 10-20 fansites have ended, with only a few surviving. SIYE is really the only one that is still around, and even then it is far from alive.

However as you have been out of the fandom for a few years, I suggest you check out the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=0][top 100 most recommended around here]]. There's a lot of good works on this list, and they'd help you become re-acclimated to the fandom quite well.

*** A small comment on SIYE: it's not brimmed with new stories anymore, no, but the traffic it gets is still impressive. Out of AO3, FFN.net and SIYE, my stories get the most hits via the latter.
