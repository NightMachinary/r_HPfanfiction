Hi all - this is a sort of different post than what I've seen around here, but I am elbow-deep in a Snape-centric fanfiction. I have been sifting through fanfiction for years, and one thing that drives me CRAZY is all the portrayals of Snape acting completely out of character whenever we read smut about him. So... I'm trying to write some in-character adult Snape smut. Is there anyone who would be interested in this sort of thing and who would be willing to beta for me? I've never posted any of my fics online so I'm a little nervous! But I'm determined to generate some new quality content and I need yalls help.

Thank you!


** I am interested! I read an ungodly amount of SS/HG, but I would still love to help with other pairings. I've always enjoyed proofreading for friends, and I'd like to think that I do it well!

** Hi, I'm available if you need a Brit picker! My main qualification is that I am British and continually annoyed by people misusing British terms or not understanding how British culture works.

My top ten peeves:

1. Turning a cup of tea into a quasi religious experience. It's not at all, it's literally mug + tea bag + milk + sugar if you are a sicko with problems. For fancy lunch/post dinner, change tea bag for loose leaf. No mucking around with Darjeeling vs Earl Grey or whatever. Flavoured tea isn't considered actual tea.

2. "Alright Mates". Nah, we say "alright guys, how's it going?". Mate is singular unless you are saying "me and a few mates went down the pub".

3. Turning on the faucet (you mean tap!), or going to the bathroom when you mean loo. We also have a lot of euphemisms about it, such as "visit the facilities", "spend a penny" or "go talk to a man about a dog".

4. We don't "write someone" we "send a letter to someone".

5. The tea thing has just reminded me, most people drink instant coffee in the UK, although proper coffee is becoming more common.

6. Graduation ceremonies? Be serious. We don't have extra credit either. OWLs and NEWTs mimic our actual school system of GCSEs at 16 then A levels at 18. They are a mix of coursework and exams. How you do day to day in class is of little consequence in terms of grades, although you will get a bollocking and bad report if you don't do well.

7. Hospital bills after an accident, nope. I've read a few pregnant Hermione stories where she can't afford healthcare so the baby is in danger. Actually, she'd get benefits of £70/week, the council would put her up in accommodation, she'd get doctors visits/hospital visits/whatever, she'd get a sure start maternity grant of £500, then once baby is born she would get child benefit of £20/week, and statutory maternity allowance of £130ish. After the birth she would get a NHS home visitor who looks out for mum and baby having problems and is available for advice.

8. Well that's as many as I can think of, but bugger it, that's a fair few to be getting on with.

...

Other than being completely anal, my other qualifications include living a few streets down from Privet drive, and going into the forbidden forest daily to walk my dog. Well it's not really the forbidden forest, it's just where they filmed a couple of scenes, but I can pretend ;)

That bit probably isn't relevant, but I'll be leaving it there anyway because I think it's cool.

*** Thanks for taking the time to list some pet peeves! I beta HP fanfic all the time, but I'm American so some of these British distinctions have slipped by me. Especially 'tap' vs. 'faucet.' And I just recently found out about the semantic pitfall that is 'pants' vs. 'trousers.'

*** YES! Okay you will be of IMMENSE help to me since I think I flirt with the line between 'charmingly faux British' and 'cloyingly American imitator'. To clarify - do English people really refer to tea as 'having a cuppa'? Because I refuse to accept or use that terminology.

Also, I will be PMing you when a first draft is ready!

**** Err I will indeed shout across the house to my husband "I'm putting the kettle on, do you want a cuppa?", sorry!

Depending on your locality though you might say "I'm putting a brew on" or something though.

PM away- I look forward to it :D

** I would be interested in this. I've never been a beta for fanfiction, but I was a copy editor for both my high school and college newspapers, and was the go-to among my friends for proofreading papers. I also read a fair amount of Snape smut. Are you more interested in writing slash or het? I tend to prefer slash but I read plenty of het as well, so either one is fine with me.

*** It's definitely going to be het, just because I am fanatical about all things being as close to canon as possible. If you're interested, I'd like to take you up on it!

** I have an interest in this. >.>

I usually spend 3-4 hours after work reading random stuff, so could easily accommodate this sort of project. Unavailable on the weekends though. And I've beta read stories for friends before, but not fanfiction.

IDK, message me if you want. I've been looking into becoming a beta for a while so I'm willing to give it a go.
