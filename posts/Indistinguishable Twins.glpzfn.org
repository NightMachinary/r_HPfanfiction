Can anyone recommend any fics where only one person can tell the twins apart. Especially if it's Harry, Hermione or Luna.


** In linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities), Hermione can distinguish them, because as a daughter of two dentists, she sees that one has different fixed cavity than the other one.

And of course, she can recognize them in linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel), because the pairing is her with George, so it would be sad not to.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play
