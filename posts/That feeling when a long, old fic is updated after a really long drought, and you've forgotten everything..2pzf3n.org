Do you reread the whole thing just so you can feel sad again after you read the one new chapter? Do you ignore it, telling yourself you want to wait for more chapters to be released?

This is the conundrum that has been plaguing my mind since Casting Moonshadows was updated after forever.


** If it's a /really/ long drought, and I liked it well enough to begin with, I'll re-read the whole thing (sometimes with judicious skimming, though).

Sometimes I'll just pass it over, though, until there's ~50K of new material, enough to sit down with for a whole evening.

It can really depend on mood.

There are only a few stories I've got on my alerts that I'd pretty much drop everything to read if they update. They are:

**** I was going to laugh at you for thinking that will ever happen, then realized that I have Inverarity's Alexandra Quick series on watch, and it's been 2.5 years since the 4th book of that came out.

Also joe6991's Harry Potter and the Heartland of Time, which did actually do a necropost a couple months ago. :(

And his [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/uncertain-employment-is-uncertain/][website]] said he was working on it as of July this year? haha. I shall hope.

AND NOOOOO joe! Duuuude, his Hero trilogy... wow. I remember reading that a while after I finished the Dark Tower series and it was just amazing. amazing. I think I'm going to download it and start reading it again. yeah.

I probably would.

******* [[http://inverarity.livejournal.com/262263.html][AQATWA is at 32 chapters and 166,000 words.]]

From the most recent update. I believe Inverarity wanted to keep it around the ~35 chapter mark that he's had in the past, so should only be a touch more writing and then just editing to go. With luck, we might well get it in the new year.

I can but dream.

** I usually quickly skim the previous chapter of every fic I read, and hope that that jogs my memory before I read the new chapter. If it doesn't ring a bell after the previous chapter, then I'll skim the first couple because they usually have a lot of the main differences in that. All else fails? I will read through the whole fic, until I remember it.

** I've made a habit of adding as a comment the most important plot points to the story's document, so that when I return to the story later on, I'll be able to quickly read through them and “recognise” which specific story that one was by its “individualities”.

After reaching the current end-point in a WiP/abandoned story, I also try to leave them as they are until they get finished, because getting back to them for a measly one or two chapter update just makes me tired of the story as a whole---like listening to the favourite song/band too often.

** Long gaps have really put me off uncompleted fics over the years. I tried and had loads of alerts coming in for updates but I read so quickly and often that I literally cannot keep up with different stories.

The only fic series I've kept up to date with is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] and sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]]. There's a 3rd story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity][Identity]], in the works but I'll wait until it's finished and then reread the the previous two to get a good grasp of it. It's the only occasion I can think of where I read a story and followed the sequel and am following the next sequel too.

It started in 2005, I picked up reading it in 2006 and yes years later in 2013 she finished it. She would go up to a year or longer between updates so I had to re read it when it was done.
