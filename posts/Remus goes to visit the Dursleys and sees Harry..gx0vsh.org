As you would expect, he takes Harry with him. But because he's a werewolf he'd have to basically leave Harry on his own for a few days each month. To stop this from happening, he travels around the world avoiding the full moon. To sustain this style of living he helps the locals and then writes books about it. His books become massively popular, just like Lockharts.


** This is a great idea except for the fact that the full moon occurs on the same day every where. Maybe it's different in the Harry Potter universe.

*** Maybe he keeps ahead of the full moon by travelling over 1000MPH and just going through 24 hours of daylight?

**** Just prior to sundown take an international Portkey to the other side of the world? Could still require traveling to find safe places to stay, plus he needs to avoid going to the same place to avoid suspicion that he's a werewolf.

*** How far does the Floo or aparition (?) travel? Because if you need direct contact with moonlight to transform, you just travel to a different timezone and avoid nights for those days.

** He could just portkey from the Northern to Southern Hemisphere therefore avoiding the night altogether?

*** That'd be western and eastern hemisphere. Northern and southern is still night at the same time (though there might be a bit of difference due to seasons).

** Of course did canon ever tell us how a werewolf transforms. Eg is it just that the full moon comes up or is it the moonlight from the full moon itself that sets the transformation off? Remember while he was in the shack/tunnel he hadn't transformed. And he didn't transform until he was outside of the tunnel (and of course the movie had the full moon slowly come out from behind clouds).

Only problem is that the full moon was pretty high in the sky which meant it had been up for quite a few hours. So if the transformation is due to just the moon being up why didn't he transform in the shack or why didn't he transform on his walk from the castle to the whomping willow as it was already night? If it's the moonlight itself then why did he transform in the shack when he attended Hogwarts. Or better yet if it's the moonlight itself then why wasn't he simply put in a windowless room deep underground in the castle?

Minor discrepancies that could have major story impacts. And a simple werewolf "cure" would have a house 12 timezones away where as it's becoming night in England it's becoming day there. So a portkey into a blackout curtained room and Remus could get a good day's sleep and portkey back to England when the sun's coming back up having never transformed.

  It had been a full year since he saw the child. Remus assumed that Harry didn't know who he was. And he didn't know what to think about that. Then the boy smiled. His emerald eyes glimmered and he reached his arms forward as he spoke the word that simultaneously broke Remus heart and fixed it. "Moony."

** As an example for the discrepancies today june 5th where I live will have a full moon. Sunset is at 8:36 pm, the moon rises at 8:44 pm, it will cross the meridian (highest point) at 12:36 am (6th) and will set at 5:36 am, and the sun rises at 5:44am

So looking at Glasgow Scotland for today the full moon starts to rise at 9:44 pm, the sun actually sets at 9:56 pm (not a typo), it crosses the meridian at 12:30 am, sunrise is at 4:35 am (6th), and the moon sets 5:06 am (again not a typo). Details are similar for the june 1994 full moon.

Now both the book and the movie had harry, hermione, and ron outside at night eg sun had set. Which that means the moon was already up before Remus ever left the castle. So why no transformation before he even reaches the shack or while he is in the shack?

Just pointing out where real world details impacts a good fiction story (especially for an old detail oriented computer engineer üòÅ).
