I just found Victoria Potter and Electrum Cauldrons and Dragonhide Gloves and I would love to read more Slytherin fem Harry fics like these two but I'm having trouble finding some. Most of the ones I do find ship Harry and Snape or Harry and Voldemort and I really have no interest in reading fics that ship adults with children. I'd also prefer ones that are retelling the story with this au.


** I quite enjoyed !linkffn(Mary Potter). It does a good job adding its own plots and lore. Lily was also insanely badass in this story, where she had the highest single kill count of any member of the Order in addition to being a healer and ritualist.

It also expands the political system from a simple Light/Dark alignment to a more complicated Light/Dark and Progressive/Traditionalist system. Dumbledore is a Light Progressive. McGonagall and Flitwick are Light Traditionalists. It's a pretty interesting system

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; mature!Snape; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (but with 50% more snark). See first chapter for preface. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated. McG first contact/guardian. PM for pdf.

** Linkffn(Tales of Three) is a good one in the making, but she doesn't update that often.

  A fire burns deep within Iris Potter, and such things must be tempered --- even if it's with Albus Dumbledore's idea of education and guidance. After a disastrous end to a school year, the two find themselves tangling with old enemies, eldritch magic, time travel, and that which should have perhaps been left well alone. Morally gray fem!Harry, mentor!Dumbledore.

Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder.
