Unfortunately for Harry, Lily's ancestor was magical and was a bit of a dick: As a result, she had a blood curse placed on her and her line.

Basically, as she grew older, the curse would erode away that part of the brain that tells our body not to do shit that would damage it -- you know, like where you body limits your muscles from doing shit otherwise they'll pulverize bone? (Where mothers can lift cars off their babies and the like, only to suffer for it later).

As her line began to birth squibs which eventually became muggles, however, the curse went dormant... until Lily was born.

She died before she could become old enough that the (unknown at this point) curse could take effect and slowly degrade her health.

Harry, unfortunately, inherited the curse, though the unique protections Lily gave to him on her sacrifice and being blasted by one of the most foulest pieces of magic known to wizardkind caused the curse to change a bit -- being bitten by a basilisk and then healed from the venom further added more bizarre instability to the mix.

Harry meets and falls in love with one of the Greengrass sisters: Maybe it's Daphne, who he slowly, after years, convinced her to become less bigoted like how Astoria did in canon (due to their experiences in the War); Perhaps it's Astoria herself, when they were a little older (Harry and Astoria, being in the hospital wing for their blood curses slowly emerging and bonding could be sadly sweet).

They eventually marry and have a child, Rose.

Now, this is where the batshit insanity begins.

Having such... unique experiences happen to her father, along with his blood curse, and the enfeebling blood curse of her mother's line caused them to mix and mutate.

Her body is stronger due to the in-built limitations in our brains being altered, but the effects of the Greengrass curse acts as a counterbalance which, after a period of pain and illness, means she won't rip herself apart. It also means that she won't become weak and die, as the Greengrass curse intended, and she has an accelerated metabolism (healing, hunger, et cetera).

Her tears have healing properties, inherited from her father: Her blood is also venomous -- by biting her lip and spitting a wad of blood, she can erode any surface or have a lethal weapon.

The lingering protections from her grandmother and her father (from his sacrifice in Deathly Hallows' Final Battle) means that she has a resistance to the Killing Curse, too (though the scarring makes her furious -- she's a bit vain, you see).

So, what does she and her plucky sidekicks (read: Her family that's close in age, like some of the Weasley kids) decide on? Becoming the magical world's first superhero.

Unfortunately, their hijinks in trying to do the right thing causes hilariously chaotic situations.
