There's a lot of fics where Harry for X reason (grim reapers, freak accident etc.) time travels and has everything he needs to defeat the evil Dark Lord, get the girl(s) and live happily ever after.

What I'm looking for is fics where Voldemort (or Tom Riddle if you want to make that distinction) is given the same opportunity to go back with all his knowledge (while hopefully regaining some of his sanity, because I just can't buy he lost to a(n incredibly lucky) teenager otherwise).

If there's a pairing *no slash* please, unless femslash (does there even exist such a thing as fem!Voldemort?). Also, the grittier, gorier etc. the story, the better.


** In *The Evil Overlord List*, linkffn(10972919), there is a voice called Jerry (Harry?) in Tom's head, who was supposedly to be from the future, giving him advice.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** It's sadly not continued, but Darklooshkin wrote a start of a story that fits what you are asking for:
