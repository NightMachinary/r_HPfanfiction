For Reference you might like to check out the Manga [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/107566/Otome_Game_no_Hametsu_Flag_shika_Nai_Akuyaku_Reijou_ni_Tensei_shiteshimatta?q=Otome%20game]["Bakarina"]] or the oft recommended Linkffn(9704180) although that's oriented towards time travel and isn't Draco centric.

  Most people, had they found themselves in occupying the body of a character in a book they enjoyed, would have tried to make sure the story ended happily for all that was involved. Not me. I wasn't stupid enough to miss the chance the forge my own destiny in a new universe, especially not when I found myself in the body of infamous Draco Malfoy. (Erotica, NTR)

  All he wanted was a way out. A way to do it all over again, and to erase his mistakes. He stared at the crackling blue flames so hard they imprinted in his vision. At age eleven, Draco receives a letter from the future, which will make him change the path he has set out upon and lead him into a life he'd never dared to imagine.

  Post-Farewell. Max Caulfield is off to Seattle, practically a world away from her best friend Chloe Price. Sometimes, Fate gives cause for worlds to collide. My last LiS fanfic, and I don't know how long it'll wind up!

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
