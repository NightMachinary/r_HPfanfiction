I am looking for fics where Harry is, or appears to be, dark at the beginning but by the end of the fic he is much more likeable/good. I want all, or most, of those who are his friends in canon to hate him for things he has done, or they think he has done. Not set in Hogwarts, if possible, but that isn't too important.

I would prefer if there was no slash but if the fic is good enough and the slash plays a small enough role then I'll read it. Also, no Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape.

It also doesn't strictly have to be Harry, pretty much anyone will do.

Harry is kidnapped and raised as Voldemort's son. He is not evil, but follows his father's ideals.

** - 1) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] (W: 242,035; WiP)

  - [dimension travel] [HP siblings] [dark!Harry] [AU!Harry] [rape warning] [torture warning]
  - 2) [unknown title] --- I remember someone mentioning a story in which, similar to Imprisoned Realm, Harry finds himself in a different dimension where his family is alive. He finds though that the AU!Harry was very rude and cruel to his family, for which they aren't at first being very positive towards him. This mentioned story could've well been Imprisoned Realm itself, but based on the description I remember the AU!Harry was being deliberately cruel --- like, a spoilt bully more than anything else.

- 3) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]] (470,388 WL Complete / 109,659 WL Abandoned sequel) --- I dropped this one halfway through because the plot and characters seemed too forced to me, so I can't tell if it ultimately matches your request or not.
