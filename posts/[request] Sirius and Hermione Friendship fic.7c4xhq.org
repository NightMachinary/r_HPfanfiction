Im looking for a fanfic that's main plot is the friendship between Sirius and Hermione. I don't care if they getting together but I don't want it to be one chapter of friendship and then smut for the rest of the fanfic. -Thanks


** Feels like "I want to hook you up with my godkid" vs "I adopted you after death eaters killed your family" vs "I want to get in your pants" are all very different kinds of friendship for this question :P

*** Given Hermione was 14 when they met, I also like the idea of "my cat likes you, so you can't be so bad, even if we don't agree on creature rights"

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
