**** She's a good writer. There's a crew of them on tumblr that write really well-written stuff though with a variety of pairings that may or may not be interesting.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

****** Yea. There's a significant chunk of the fandom that would prefer to read/write stories that deal primarily with Hermione rather than Harry, myself included.

** Will time travelling Harry instead of James work? The humour is top notch but sadly abandoned- linkffn(Take Care Of Yourself by NothingPretentious)

  "Anyone can imitate Parseltongue by hissing?"

  "Sure, anyone," Harry slurred, nodding brightly. "You try."

  After a moment of trying to make his tongue move properly, Moony ventured a hiss.

  "Good first go. You said, 'I'm attracted to hairy women in clown outfits'."

  When an infant Harry is rescued from the Dursleys to be raised by his Were-uncle Moony, his Godfather Lord Black, and his time-turned future self, the biggest question is obviously... who gets to be the daddy? T for language, otherwise safe. ON HOLD.

  Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.
