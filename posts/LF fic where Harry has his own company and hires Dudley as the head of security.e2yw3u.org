I also remember that there was a hearing where the Dursleys lost custody of Dudley and Harry was emancipated, so Harry took custody of Dudley and gave him a job at his company, I'm pretty sure that was because Smeltings kicked Dudley out.


** This sounds great. I live for Harry-Dudley friend fics!

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)
