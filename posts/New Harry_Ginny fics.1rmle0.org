I'm looking for a pretty romantic Harry/Ginny fic, preferably one with a pregnancy involved--it doesn't matter if the pregnancy is before or after they're married. If not a pregnancy, a story about after they get back together after the Final Battle up to a proposal is cool! Thanks! :)

** Learning to Live Again is my favorite of all time. Beautifully written. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569]]

** I'll reccommend my two very popular (in danger of tooting my own horn) Harry/Ginny stories in the series I am currently writing. It is Soul Bond and Time Travel, not sure if you're into that...

Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8076284/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Bonds-Of-Time]]

Bonds of Time: Fighting Fate [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8531904/1/Bonds-of-Time-II-Fighting-Fate]]

Ginny will more than likely get pregnant in the third story in this series.

** Doesn't involve pregnancy, at least not yet, but Harry potter and the nightmares of futures past is a great read that starts Harry and Ginny's relationship as soon as his first year, but it's only at the end of year 3 and they aren't really old enough for their relationship to get so serious yet
