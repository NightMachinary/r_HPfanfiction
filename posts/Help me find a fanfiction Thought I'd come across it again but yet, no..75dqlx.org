Read half a SS/HG story and went back to finish but I can't find it :(. I can't remember much but I think SS destroyed a horcrux using fiendfyre, does this ring any bells for anyone? It might also be the one where snape is a runner and hermione joins him... but I could be crossing my fics. Greatful if anyone knows it. Thanks.


** You could be thinking about linkffn(Chasing the Sun by Loten) in which Snape destroys horcruxes using fiendfyre. I could totally understand you not finishing it because it's long as balls, but it's totally worth it.
