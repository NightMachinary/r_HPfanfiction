** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]] by Deadwoodpecker Here is the summary: "AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love." There are a couple of sequels, which I haven't gotten around to read, so I can't comment on those, but I really enjoyed this story.

Summary from ff.net:

#+begin_quote
  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

**** IIRC there might have been some mild Ron bashing prior to the time travel, but after the jump Ron becomes part of the Hogwarts Strike Team and is way more matured than in canon.

Ginny is a bit hostile towards Hermione, but they are not too harsh on her.

They're a bit vary of Dumbledore and don't trust him with everything, but once again, no bashing.

****** You're misremembering; Ron leaves them pre-time jump to bunker up with what remains of his family and has an argument with Hermione beforehand. I wouldn't call it bashing, though, just him choosing his family over them. She's certainly not in love with Ron, though, seeing as she tries to get Harry to date her as soon as they go to the past and tells Harry straight out that she hasn't been with Ron at all for 2 years and isn't burning a torch for him, squicky mental age differences aside.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7644616/1/Hallowed-Time-Twists][Hallowed Time Twists]] is a next gen time travel fic. It features Harry, Teddy and the Potter kids going back to Harry's fifth year, with Ginny joining them later. It is well written and the author has a nice sense of humor, and has some novel ideas I've never seen before in fanfiction. It has flaws -- mostly regarding the pacing, but it is overall quite good -- the Gringotts robbery scene in chapter 33 was awesome and the story is worth reading for that alone.

** There is one story (whose name I can't remember) that involves Harry & Hermione coming back as 18 year olds to Halloween 1981, destroying all the horcruxes, introducing the Potters to the Grangers, destroying Voldemort, and then letting their minds get adsorbed into their infant selves.

If I can remember the name, I'll edit the post with a link to the FF.net edition of the story.

Backwards with Purpose is one of my all-time favorites. HP and the Bonds of Time is a little bit outdated but if you like Harry and Ginny, you might still like it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]] is solid. Featuring Harry and Ron as the time travelers. It's kind of dark in places, but it's also quite funny.
