** I'd throw in my own "No longer alone". In that story there's a different Pettigrew/Black encounter which ends with Pettigrew kissed. Unable to prove his innocence Sirius asked Andromeda to take care of Harry. While the Voldemort conflict is inevitable, the focus of the story is Harry growing into his new family and how having competent adults helping him changes things.

I began to write this story out of frustration over seeing the same tropes again and again so there won't be any multicore wands, no overly helpful Goblins, no "I will Not be controlled" speeches, no quintuple Lordships or Harry somehow controlling politics and no moronic Dumbledore.

Edit: Linked the wrong story and the bot is not responding to the ffnbot!refresh comment. The linked fic fits the request but is a Harry/Tonks mystery instead of a family fic. The premise is that Harry and Tonks become a couple at Slughorn's Christmas party and simultaneously get sucked into a pan-European conflict that is just slowly showing its full extent.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius ever made. Eventual Harry/Lisa Turpin.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) There is less focus on getting to the end confrontation or setting up a big evil villain and more on Harry's crazy adventures and life in general. Although with lots of worldbuilding and great characters. It's super long and unfinished, but I very much enjoyed the long epic journey even if not all the plot lines are resolved in the end.
