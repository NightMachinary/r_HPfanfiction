(and, it's implied, never come round or see the error of their ways or apologize)

I've been thinking recently that for a children's story that's actually quite an unorthodox path to take, or perhaps especially it was when JKR was writing, before we had the wave of grimdark YA following the success of others in that genre that touched on those elements.

Do you prefer fics that change that? Any particular kinds of way of treating the Dursleys differently than in canon that you prefer?

Let's make this a general discussion thread around those topics.


** I think it's regrettably realistic, given the time and place where it happened. And, bluntly, from what we see in canon the Dursleys weren't actually breaking the law as it stood back in the 80s and 90s, although Dudley could readily have got a few cautions for common assault. Child neglect was prosecuted, on the rare occasions it was, under a law that had stood mostly unchanged since 1933, when it was still legal to pull a 14-year-old out of school and send him to work (which was only raised to 16 just in time to get my father two extra years of schooling.) It wasn't changed to include non-physical abuse until 2015.

Enforcement was doubtful at best: they weren't getting to all of the kids who were being beaten to death, never mind the ones who were over-disciplined and kept on short rations that were nevertheless enough to keep the child alive and not suffering from obvious diseases of malnutrition.

  Section 1(1) Children and Young Persons Act 1933 provides: “If any person who has attained the age of sixteen years and has responsibility for a child or young person under that age, willfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons, or exposes him or causes or procures him to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, abandoned, or exposed, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health (including injury to or loss of sight, or hearing, or limb, or organ of the body, and any mental derangement), that person shall be guilty of an offence...”

[[https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/web_Overarching_principles_assaults_on_children_and_cruelty_to_a_child.pdf][source]]

The Dursleys' treatment of Harry qualifies as neglect. Further, they knew of Marge and Dudley abusing him and chose to do nothing, which falls under the "exposes him or causes or procures him to be assaulted" part.

**** You're not reading it quite right. "Exposes" and "Causes or procures him to be assaulted" are two separate things - "exposure" in this context is in the old sense of leaving a child outside in the cold, and doing nothing about an assault you know is happening is not the same as causing or procuring it. There isn't any positive duty to report crime of any kind, even if you're legally responsible for the victim's care. "Neglect" under the act is failure to provide the basics of food, clothing and medical care, in which context short rations, hand-me-downs that don't fit and NHS glasses because the school said he couldn't read the blackboard will do.

Yes, it sucks, yes it's barbaric, and, until 2005 there was a defence of "reasonable punishment" that could be used to muddy the waters enough to make charging and prosecuting doubtful so long as they never broke the skin or left him more than a couple of days without adequate food, not least because the attitude was - and I'm quoting something said in reply to one of my comments earlier today, it hasn't gone away - "Coddling children is why we have adults that need safe spaces and comfort animals 24/7. Some people are just in need of toughening up."

tl, dr; Child protection laws are generally a /lot/ less stringent than you might think they are, they're dubiously enforced except in extreme cases, and forty years ago the Dursleys' canon behaviour wasn't, technically, illegal.

***** Thanks for the clarification!

What you've said made me curious about whether Harry could have pressed charges later in his life after the modern sentencing guidelines were published. Looks like the statute of limitations for child abuse is 3 years after the claimant turns 18, so Harry would have been out of luck by 2001.

****** Ah, you're posting from the US, yes? Limitation means something slightly different under English law. What you've quoted is the limitation period for issuing proceedings for a civil claim. If Harry in his own right wanted to sue, his 21st birthday would be the limit. For the criminal matters - Marge setting the dog on him, Dudley's assaults committed after he turned 8 - there is no limitation period if the matter is at all triable before a Crown Court. Magistrates Courts have a limitation period of 6 months for minor stuff like traffic offences and regulatory infractions, but historic child abuse can be and has been prosecuted decades later. Harry's problem with bringing the Dursleys to account before a criminal court would be that, unless there was something a lot worse happening 'off screen', what they did was either legal or only doubtfully illegal at the time they did it.

Giving a child chores such as trimming garden/mowing lawn/etc is not a crime.

****** Actually, according to modern sentencing guidelines in the UK, favoring one child over the other is treated as an agravating factor in cases of child abuse. Thus, if the Dursleys' abuse of Harry had happened after 2008 (when those guidelines were published) then the fact that they clearly coddled Dudley while providing the bare minimum for Harry would be relevant at trial and would be cause for a harsher sentence. This applies to how much food they gave Harry in comparison to Dudley, clothes that barely fit Harry in comparison to Dudley always getting new clothes, and Harry being used as a servant while Dudley never worked.

We don't have - have never had - any constitutional guarantee against that. Parliament can and does pass laws with retroactive effect, although we /would/ be in breach of treaty obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights if they passed a retrospective criminal law. (All of the retrospective laws I can think of have been about rules of procedure apart from two, claiming jurisdiction over WWII war crimes and re-granting the Falkland Islanders their UK citizenship with effect from the date they'd previously had it stripped. There may be others, of course.)

CJA2003 wasn't retroactive as to offences, but did relax the double jeopardy rule. It didn't make criminal /now/ anything done /then/, just made it possible to re-try offenders who'd got off if new and compelling evidence came to light, provided the Court of Appeal approved the new trial and the offence was on the short list of serious crimes it applied to. It is, of course, the thin end of a very dangerous wedge.

Witness testimony is relevant in court cases, especially since Harry would have far more witnesses available on his side (teachers, neighbors, school nurses, the people who installed the bars on the windows, etc.) than the Dursleys' do.

It is a miracle that Harry didn't get some form of trauma from them, so at least adding some psychological damage (eg a desire for adult approval, being wary of people he does not know or no second chances) turns the Dursley abuse into something beyond a shitty trope.

** "The best revenge is living well." Harry outgrew them

I always read his early time at the Dursleys, when most of the alleged abuses happened, as apocryphal, with Harry being a somewhat unreliable narrator.

There are events of my own youth that could be framed as abusive or neglectful were I so inclined: having my father put out his cigarette on my arm; having a hot iron off the ironing board knocked onto my leg, burning and nearly breaking it; being driven to the doctor for stitches and shots after stepping on a pitchfork barefooted in late November (the temperatures were sub-freezing); being gored by a territorial bull; getting extreme frostbite to the point where skin grafts were discussed; yelling to stop my mother from running over my little sister with a tractor; having a neighbor friend who couldn't play with me anymore because (as I learned later), he was run over by farm equipment being operated by his father (who later killed himself); being inside the bowels of a grain combine when it was started up and wondering whether I could hold on long enough not to die; helping my father remove a neighbor from a piece of his farm equipment in which he unintentionally--or intentionally, this being the farm crisis when suicides were rampant--found himself trapped; climbing slippery rails on a thirty foot tall grain silo at age five without harness or safety cage to scare pigeons out so my father could shoot them; painting overhangs and cupolas in high winds; not always going to school having had enough to eat; multiple school friends missing digits or limbs from farm equipment; being instructed in how to tackle my father and administer CPR if he manages to electrocute himself working on high voltage electrical feeds without equipment or training; being made at age 11 to stay home alone and milk the cows while the family went on vacation; working until heat exhaustion; working 16 hour days doing hard labor; being pulled out of school during harvest season because the parents needed more hands and grain truck drivers; driving solo for the first time at age 6; being bitten by a wild animal and going through the rabies shots sequence (I still feel phantom pain); stepping on a rusty nail that went all the way through my boot; having to remove said nail with a claw hammer since nobody else was around; not bothering to mention it to anyone since it stopped bleeding by then and anyway, I was positive my tetanus vaccine was current; being snubbed socially at church because we were rather poor (we moonlighted as janitors for the church and adjoining parochial school); I could go on...

Framed the right way, this might sound slightly neglectful, possibly on par with Harry's life.

For this reason, I don't quite take Harry at face value with respect to his memories of his home life. Through the lens of a neglected child, it's easy to imagine embellishment of, say, the frying pan incident or the broken arm. This doesn't make him dishonest, necessarily, just human.

Memories, especially those formed early in life, have a tendency to drift and lose specificity, allowing our imaginations to fill in the gaps.

Putting blame on Dumbledore in no way diminishes the blame that the Dursleys so rightly deserve. The Dursleys are unforgivable, regardless of whether or not they wanted Harry. Even if they had to accept him because of <insert magical reason>, they still accepted him. If one accepts a child into his or her house, that person has a moral obligation to be at least /decent/ to the child and treat them well. Harry was made to sleep in a closet for ten years.

Yeah, but I don't think I'm doing that. I think you put it well by saying it isn't a zero-sum game.

Searching for the "ultimate cause" in regards to blame is certainly somewhat flawed, but in this scenario we can make a pretty clear delineation between "healthy normal world" and "something really fucked up is happening here" and that comes all down to Dumbledore. I think everyone can understand that it is bad to put a child in a closet and it rarely has to be said explicitly. On the other hand Dumbledore enabling this situation against his better judgement often gets a pass.

Lets create an analogy: Lets say you had a corrupt government that gave children into abusive households for bribes. Of course I'd want the abusive foster parents punished, but I wouldn't be as upset about them, because I can do very little about the existence of assholes and perverts. The big travesty is the abuse of power and the corruption.

In fact before Hogwarts the worst they did was not buy him expensive stuff, even the cupboard wasn't that bad since it was rather big and properly equipped. The bad stuff was the locks and we have no mention that he was locked for long periods of time, just as justified (from a non magical PoV) punishment.

Read chapter 2 of the first book, you can see Harry speaks and acts quite openly, he isn't meek or afraid. They certainly don't like him but it shows he isn't abused, just not living like Dudley.

  Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barber's looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his fringe, which she left ‘to hide that horrible scar'. Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and Sellotaped glasses. Next morning, however, he had got up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.

  Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old jumper of Dudley's (brown with orange bobbles). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a glove puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.

  On the other hand, he'd got into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big bins outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.

  Dudley came waddling towards them as fast as he could. ‘Out of the way, you,' he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened - one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out on to the floor - people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, ‘Brazil, here I come ... Thanksss, amigo.' The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. ‘But the glass,' he kept saying, ‘where did the glass go?' The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, ‘Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?' Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, ‘Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,' before he collapsed into a chair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.

Honestly I'm not sure if I've read a fic yet that stands out for having dealt with the Dursleys in a way that really prefer. There are a few things I would like to see in a story though.

One/some of Harry's more morally flexible friends get revenge for him. Harry would probably be completely unaware. I particularly like the idea of it being his girlfriend who does so... maybe Daphne.

Harry doesn't obsess, but gets comeback /casually/. Just a few minutes, a few waves of his wand, and voila. It could be something like a couple of curses that make their home and lawn perpetually untidy, that kind of thing. Nothing too crazy, but enough that they'll feel it.

The blood wards fail due to the poor relationship between Harry and Dursleys, leading to them getting Death Eater'd. Bonus points if the Dursleys are aware of why the defenses failed.

The thing is, once she's decided that things aren't right, she also decides that it must all be Petunia's fault, that Vernon wouldn't be that bad unless his wife was pushing things and lying to him. Cue conflict. There's also some Petunia POV, because you know, there's no pancake so thin it only has one side.

** Personally speaking I found it to be an incredibly cheap escape for a series that gets as dark as Harry Potter does sometimes. School children get possessed by evil spirits, tortured by teachers, killed in open warfare against a tyrannical government; and you really expect me to believe in a no-harm-done, feel-good, happy-ending crock of shit for bonafide child abusers?! It's complete and utter bullshit.

I prefer stories where they are punished for their actions. Preferably as cruelly, inhumanely, and viciously as possible. I mean extremely slow, agonizing, torturous deaths that would give even Stephen King nightmarish ideas for his next horror movie.

Why? Because the Dursley's were child abusers. That's the only type of fate that child abusers deserve; both in fiction and in real life. They deserve to be put down with no mercy like the deranged animals they are.
