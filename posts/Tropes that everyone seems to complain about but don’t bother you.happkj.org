  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Honestly, I don't mind the "magical core" fanon as much as I used to. It's not the most interesting magic system and I kind of dislike some things that are done with it occasionally in bashing-stories, but that's more because of the bashing than the actual "magical core" stuff. The existence of magical cores in a fanfic, on its own, doesn't make it any worse for me.

I also don't particularly mind the "Potters are descended from Gryffindor/Merlin/Other-Powerful-Ancestor" thing, on its own. There's some pretty good fanfics that play with that trope without making Harry into an unlikeable Wangsty teen.

*** Canon Dumbledore actually has at least one "wtf" moment in nearly every scene he's in.

One of his very first lines is about how he wouldn't get rid of Harry's scar even if he could, and he starts off the series ignoring McGonagall and condemning Harry to a childhood without love or kindness. Next time his influence is felt is when Hagrid shows up on the island instead of, say, McGonagall, who certainly would have handled the Dursleys more gracefully and might have even wrangled some better treatment for Harry during the conversation.

It's actually incredible how awful Dumbledore is and how easily JKR manipulated us into not noticing until book 5.

But 'bashing' could be extended to something more mild - eg, Dumbledore being slightly manipulative instead of a caricature, or Ron being portrayed a bit more negatively/shallow than canon. I don't mind things like this - but it's very easy to just devolve into a detriment.
