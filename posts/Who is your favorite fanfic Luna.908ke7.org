** If we're talking one-shots, then it's no contest.

[[https://pubfiles.elusiveguy.com/J4AEk8cTPwNAzaw][Faith and Understanding]] is one of my favorite fanfics and one of my favorite Lunas.

She's odd, to the point of being off-putting. She's stubborn. She's initially doubtful of Ginny's sincerity in their friendship, which infuriates Ginny. She's also immensely grateful, to the point of tears, for Ginny's friendship. Ginny is her best friend and Luna loves her for it.

If we're talking multi-chapter fics, then that's easy--the Luna from /Stages of Hope./

This Luna is on the edge of a breakdown, but is also a bastion of compassion. She's far more physically affectionate with Harry and Hermione and Neville than she ever was in canon. Unfailing kind and gentle. She tells fairy tales to her loved ones, stories where good triumphs over evil, in order to keep the tiny sliver of hope alive.

** I actually think I liked the Changeling's characterization of her most. It does the best job (in my opinion) of showing her as a capable human being with talent, while not downplaying the fact that she's very strange.

Make a Wish from Rorschach's Blot features a very silly and amusing Luna and Xeno..

Crazy Little Things by Dreiser is more serious..
