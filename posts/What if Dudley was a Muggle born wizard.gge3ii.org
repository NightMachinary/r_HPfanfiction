If Dudley was a wizard then that would make him Muggle born right? What if Vernon was a muggle and Petunia being a with but never told anyone as being banned by Dumbldore for telling him a word. Then Hagrid wouldn't have come because instead of there only being one letter they'd be two one for Harry and one for Dudley.

" Dudley go get the post please son " said Uncle Vernon " make Harry get it Dad " Dudley moaned ( he didn't like being disturbed when playing his games ) " Boy get the post! " Uncle Vernon said " yes Uncle Vernon " Harry said. Harry walked out of the kitchen into the hallway and picked up the letters Harry turned them over one of them read Mr H Potter Surrey, Little Winging, 4 privit drive, the cupboard under the stairs and another read Mr D Dursley Surrey, Little Winging, 4 privit drive. That's strange he thought even more wireder was that they both had the same envelope and the same stamp, he walked back into the kitchen " Uncle Vernon that's yours, Dudley this is for you " Harry said, Dudley looked at Harry confused " for me? " He asked him " yeah, I have a matching one" Harry said.


** Well-known trope. You'll find many fics on this. Example: Magical relations

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** Is it well known? I haven't had much luck finding other fics with the premise besides that one.

** I'm working on a variation where Dudley got his letter on his birthday, but Vernon said no, then Harry got his and the story follows canon until after meeting Malfoy and doing a little research finds out about the 'innocent' Deatheaters, decides he doesn't want to go.

Harry talks to Dudley who is dreading Smeltings and Harry is dreading Hogwarts (his goal is to be a banker) the two decide to swap places.
