*** A widespread movement mostly supported by regular people is called "Grass Roots." So like if you see people talking about it one way everywhere, Facebook, Reddit, comment sections of news articles.

Astroturfing is when the above is the result of a cube farms of people whose jobs it is to make those comments everywhere, giving the impression of a Grass Roots movement when it's really the result of a highly deceptive advertising campaign. AstroTurf being the brand name for the original fake grass.
