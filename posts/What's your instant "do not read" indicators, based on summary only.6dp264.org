Here's some of mine (taken from real summaries):

- "WARNING: THIS STORY CONTAINS LANGUAGE"
- "please don't review about grammer mistakes"
- "I'm bad at summaries but my writing is better!"
- "SEE SUMMARY INSIDE!"


** - Typos/spelling errors/grammatical errors -- This is the very first thing a potential reader will see; if you can't make a good first impression, you have no chance of writing well in the story.

- “My first fic!” -- No one cares. In fact, if you feel the need to say this you are likely just making excuses

- “Not your usual X fic!” -- If you have to say this then yes, it almost certainly is.

- Asking questions -- 99% of the time, the answer is incredibly obvious. Asking questions is a bad idea 99% of the time. Change your question into a statement or remove it entirely.

- 

  - ex: “Can Harry save his family?” “Will they get together?” “What if yadda yadda?”

- “Sorry I'm bad at summaries.” -- No one cares. It is entirely likely that you cannot come up with a summary because your story is less than well-written or doesn't follow a coherent plot. A decent summary details a portion of the overarching plot without giving away too many details. If you make a summary like that, you're probably having some overarching trouble with your plotline rather than just being bad at summarizing.

** I agree with a lot of things said here but to be quite honest, I often read the fics anyway.

I have very specific taste in pairings and there are some I just can't stand so my options are fairly limited anyway. I'm willing to overlook a lot of things if it means i get to read a decent Harry/Fleur or Honks story.

Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised and even if i'm not I only wasted like 5 minutes because you can usually tell by the first chapter if the story is decent enough to count as readable.

And to be quite honest, I don't read fanfiction because i want to find the height of literature, most of the I just want some silly wish fulfillment for my favorite characters.

** - "Watch as [Character] takes [setting] by storm!" It's not as common is this fandom as it is in others but it just screams "this author has no original ideas" and "bland power-wank bashing alert!" Grey!Lord!Independent!HeirOfEverything!Harry also falls into this category.

- Post-war/epilogue-compliant. I get that /some/ people like the epilogue and I don't begrudge them that, but I think it was terrible and therefore refuse to read any fics that rely on it no matter how good the writing is.

- It's been said already, but bad spelling/grammar. I don't care if it's your first fic or English is not your first language or you suck at editing/have no beta. Spell check is a simple click away and if you can't even be bothered to manage that I have to assume your fic is shit. There is no excuse.

- Any summary that implies the characters are so out of character as to be unrecognizable OC's wearing a familiar face. Or that the main character is an OC. I read fanfics to read more about my favorite characters. If I wanted OC's I'd just go pick up an entirely new series. Similarly if a summary implies a complete misunderstanding of the canon setting (or reality for that matter) that could have been cleared up by a five minute google search without clearly declaring it an AU I'll assume the fic is terrible.

- "I'm bad at summaries" or "See summary inside" implies that you are also probably bad at writing in general if you can't even manage three sentences that state the main topic of your story.

- "On Hiatus" or "rewrite in Progress" I think you meant to say abandoned. Similarly, if it's less than 10K words and hasn't been published in the past month I'm going to assume your fic is dead on arrival like 95% of its peers and won't bother with it let alone hope for an update (no matter how good the premise) since clearly the author has no passion for the work.

- MPREG. That's a whole oher level of squick. I'd rather read Draco/GiantSquid than that. Honestly, I get that people like their slash but there are other more realistic options for your slash couple to have a child such as adoption, a surrogate, gender-bending, or even a damn incubation vat. Just please stop playing mad-scientist with human biology, ok?

- Any fic where Harry's name is something ridiculously pompous such as 'Hadrian.' Harold and Henry are the only formalizations of Harry I'll allow. Fem!Harry gets a bit more leeway with naming but I'll probably nope right out if it sounds extra special-snowflakey.

Criticism is just a very small part of improving. [and some people seem to derive no help at all from criticism]

In my experience practice and studying/research are much more relevant. I'm one of those people who relies a lot on criticism to figure out what's wrong, but I have to acknowledge that there are people who can do without. Do you think Van Gogh improved his art because of criticism?

Not to mention that excessive criticism/discussion (even if it is constructive) can actually distract from improving more than help. Had to learn that lesson myself and still observe it every few months with beginners in the martial art that I practice, that constantly want to discuss instead of using the time for practice.

***** I doubt people listing that in their summaries care about improving their writing. They likely just want to continue to write their niche, not necessarily popular wish fulfilment / kinky fics and not receive hate comments. I would just avoid those fics and move on, I doubt someone saying "Don't like, don't read" is going to be very positive towards any criticism.

** Side note-- I really don't get how people don't read Snape fics. He's literally one of the most complex characters in post-modern literature. I'm not gonna argue that he's a good person, but he's definitely interesting. A good Snape fic is such a character study. Writers who don't like him tend to write him in a very cartoonish style, and it reallyyyyyyy doesn't scratch his surface.

But on to my nope factors. God-Mode Harry, MOD Harry, Lord Potter-Black or anything that makes Harry so OP that there's no real story here

Canon or even popular Fanon parings. If you can convince me that Lucius X Hermione can work, I would rather read that than boring ass Harry/Ginny.

( Lucius and Hermione do work, btw it's called Eden on ff.net. It is the best romance I've ever read in my life, and completely realistic. No soul bonds, weird sex magic, or other BS)

Genderbends are a no for me. I feel like anything that can be accomplished as a male can be done as a female and vice versa so what's the point of changing it.

Boring Snape or Dumbledore. Both of these characters have way too much going on to either entirely good or entirely evil. Stories that don't give them any depth is like..a waste.

**** The problem with said pairing is that Daphne is basically a trope. She is always written the same, the plot is interchangeable and it is nearly guaranteed to include ridiculously overpowered Lordships.

But the worst stories (excluding ridiculous stuff like Hermione or Harry/ Death Eater) are the harem stories where Daphne is only added because the authors hopes to bait people who like Daphne by adding her name and then turning all girls in the harem (usually Susan Bones, Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood and/or Fleur Delacour) into mindless shells that only say three lines between absolutely horrible sex scenes.

And Drarry is a whole other can of worms. There is no way Harry would ever fall for Draco, homosexual or not. They hate each other. This is how teenagers imagine people falling in love.
