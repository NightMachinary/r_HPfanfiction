** It's been a while since I read this one, but I do remember enjoying it, and Harry does become a professor: "Post-OotP Reluctantly taking a leadership role in the fight against Voldemort, urging others to 'say the name', Harry tries to learn how he can use his 'power the Dark Lord knows not' to fulfill the prophecy as he becomes his enemy's biggest target."

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

** Nonjon's series Where in the world is Harry Potter? has Harry becoming a professor later on. It's kinda cracky but still really good.

** There's one that I remember snippets of that I'd love to read again. Harry ended up being head of Hufflepuff house as there were no Hufflepuff alumni on staff, and the Hufflepuff common room had padded walls. It was a generally lighthearted romp that was a little Hufflepuff bashy but in a silly way.

If someone knows what I'm talking about and reminds me then I fully recommend the story.

Edit: turns out it is likely that it was WitWiHP, /part deux/. Shall re-read to confirm.

**** I don't think it was that, seeing as I'm pretty sure it took place a good few years after the war. Doesn't WitWiHP finish before Harry is out of school?

That's the one with Nicolas Flamel as defense teacher, right?

****** I'd suggest you put a spoiler on that comment - it's sort of a big revelation in-story. But yes, that one.

******** Honestly? I don't know. I avoid talking about spoilers so that I don't have to spoiler tag stuff and a lot of subreddits have their own way of making them work.

[[/r/thelastairbender]] uses the format [[/spoiler][Azula kills Dumbledore]] which seems to work here. That's putting the comment you want spoilered in [square brackets] and then putting (/spoiler) immediately after with no spaces
