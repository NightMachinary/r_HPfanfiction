I'm looking for someone who can double check grammar, general character/plot development, and tone/pacing of the story.

I've got 15k already written and I'm planning on writing it all before I publish it.

If you're interested let me know and I'll PM you with the plot and other details to see if you're interested. It won't be a very serious story. It'll have some cracky moments in it as well. It won't be a bash fic though.


** I might be able to do it. Please send the outline.
