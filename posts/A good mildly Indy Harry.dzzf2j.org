Surely there are some good fics that involve Harry becoming more independent. Just enough to branch out to make new friends and stick up for himself, do a bit better and try things on his own for once. Just a mildly independent Harry that isn't taken to the extreme and keeps a good plot going.

Bashing is okay as long as it is reasonable and not the whole "my entire life is a lie and I have been controled by all my friends". Sometimes Harry needs to break away.

Preferably he doesn't have a marriage contract and not a harem. Not actually fussed about a pairing aslong as it is reasonable and not Harry vetting laid every chapter.

Must be complete.


** Apart from the small matter of not being complete, linkffn(13278911) fits your prompt perfectly.

  The rebirth of Tom Riddle, the death of Cedric Diggory... is it any wonder that Harry Potter is behaving a little differently than what his friends and classmates expect? But is this sudden shift merely the result of traumatic experiences, or is something much darker afoot? Who should Harry trust? Who can he turn to? With all that's happened in his life, who'd believe it anyway?
