** /The Sum of Their Parts/, linkffn(11858167): my favorite post DH fic by far. After defeating Voldemort, the establishment betrayed Harry and his friends again. Harry had it finally enough, and decided to overthrow the old regime by any means necessary. Of course, Ron, Hermione, and his DA friends would NOT let him do this alone.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Then there is the /Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution/, linkffn(10595005), where the old regime pushed through a tyrannical marriage law after Voldemort's defeat. It specifically targeted Hermione, so she could be carted off to Draco, to be tortured, mutilated, and murdered. Harry and Hermione responded by organizing the infuriated masses, staging a coup, and executing anyone who had supported that marriage law. However, foreign pureblood regimes were not happy.

** Two older fics of dystopian theme:

linkffn(HP and Merlin's Reaper by Clell65619) - One Harry wins but gets transported to another world where he hadn't survived, and the result of Voldemort's successful first rise twists all the people he knew into different shapes.

linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) - Harry is captured before the trio can embark on the horcrux hunt. Things go badly, but Hermione will not let it all fall apart.

**** I dont think its yours, but I have read them both and could be getting several stories mixed up with them.

I think the one I am talking about though had Harry leaving England when things get bad and being some sort of Royalty on a hidden island where magicals and muggles mixed, and if memory serves... Tonks (I think) goes undercover at an auction to buy girls on Harry's behalf and then them being bonded to either Harry or friends of Harry.

Either way, both the ones you listed are ones I would also highly recommend to to the OP.

And on a personal note... Great story! And do you have any others of a similar nature? I just looked at your profile and you have a TON written. Its a bit overwhelming haha. I did not see any other Multi's but maybe I missed something. I also noticed you have a few Twilight ones written.... Have you ever considered doing a crossover since there are Vampires in the HP universe? I always was intrigued by Bella as a love interest for Harry in some form or way, or the Cullens being involved in Harry Potter story arc somehow. But I have yet to find a single story with either situation.

****** That must be it then. To be honest I am surprised there are not more stories dealing with the combination concepts of Blood and Gender (Male>Female) supremacy (something both inherent to Voldemort and the Pureblood wizard world), as well as Slavery, Slave auctions, and blood/gender regulation.

Perhaps its because they are touchy subjects and few authors want to dive into such worlds, or perhaps because it can be hard to write. To be honest one of the major reasons I love Fan Fiction is because you can explore such taboo and interesting subject matter, regardless of your actual views.

Point is, the few fics posted in this thread for the OP, are nearly all ones I have read, and its a surprisingly limited amount of suggestions. I was honestly expecting more and hoping to see some new ones myself.

** Just a random thought as to a potential dark twist: Dumbledore said that death was just the next great adventure, what if that were somewhat literal?

That is, what if the threat of Voldemort didn't go away with his death? What if the shredded pieces of his soul somehow spread contagion through the spirit world, wreaking havoc in all dimensions?\\
With phantasmal forces causing the world to decay, those still living might have to discover a way to fight back and contain the destruction wrought by Voldemort's utterly corrupted vestiges.
