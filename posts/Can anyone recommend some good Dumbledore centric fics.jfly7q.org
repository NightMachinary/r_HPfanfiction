I would prefer he not be totally dark / evil, but totally fine with him being a gray character. He doesn't have to be the main character, but at least prominent would be good.

No preference as to era and if there is any romance or anything.

Thank you!

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent][Phoenix Insurgent (by BolshevikMuppet99)]]* features a well-intentioned, yet very grey Dumbledore playing the role of the protagonist. The fic's likely to become genuinely /dark/ at some point in the future, if BolshevikMuppet's previous works are any indication. It's very well-written, and Dumbledore actually feels like his canon self, despite being vastly more ruthless.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magics of the Arcane (by Eilyfe)]]* isn't exactly Dumbledore-/centric/ - Harry's the protagonist - but Albus does play a very prominent role in it, being Harry's mentor. I consider it one of the best fics I've ever read.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light (by enembee)]]* and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] also have Dumbledore acting the role of Harry's mentor. The main focus of both fics is on exploring the magic system above all else, but interactions between Harry and Albus are very well executed.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip][Albus and Harry's World Trip (by ZebJeb)]]* isn't particularly well-written, but /is/ fun to read anyway. Mentor!Dumbledore, only much more light-hearted than the two fics mentioned before.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3169718/1/Chocolate-Frog-cards][Chocolate Frog Cards (by Bagge)]]* is a fun one-shot, if very short. *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942462/1/The-Headmaster][The Headmaster (by Lizzy.fics)]]* falls in the same category. The former features a manipulative (yet good) Dumbledore, the latter attempts to explore canon Dumbledore's personality and his motivations is the context of Draco's assasination attempts in the Half-Blood Prince.
