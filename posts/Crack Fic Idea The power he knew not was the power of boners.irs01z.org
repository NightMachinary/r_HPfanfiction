Basically Harry's one and only motivation for /everything/ he does is exclusively to get laid.

-Voldemort is trying to conquer the world? If stuck up Purebloods rule the world I won't get as many chance of having sex!

-Someone is trying to kill him? WHAT!? I can't have sex if I am dead!! This will not be tolerated!

Snape is trying to get the PS? Well, if he gets it chances are that he won't teach anymore... and without him looking over my shoulders... I will get more chances of getting some! Yay! Actually, maybe I should go there and get the stone for him, the earliest he goes away forever the better.

*** Hm, good point. I was actually thinking more along the lines of how it is on weeb where Harry is obsessed with getting an Harem but since he is still a kid.almost no one takes him on it or seriously consider it, so it turns more on a character trait rather than anything else for the longest time.

**** I think there's a fic like that out there, I've seen it pop up in some fanfic libraries but never read it. The description reads something like "Harry is a weeb, wants to be a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic."

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.
