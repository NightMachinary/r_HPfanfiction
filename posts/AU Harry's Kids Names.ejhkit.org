I thought it would be fun to come up with AU names for Harry's kids. A random mishmash of people's names crammed together just like the epilogue, and then it might be fun to think of the backstory.


** Roonil Wazlib Potter : Ron's godson Gred Potter : In honour of the Weasley twins Forge Potter: ditto Brian Potter: A better way to honour Dumbledore Ronald Bilius Potter: AU where Ron did not survive the War

Crookshanks Potter: AU where Crookshanks starts eating Scabbers only for it to transform into a half eaten corpse

James Dobby Potter: Two people who died for Harry

Sirius Regulus Kreacher Potter : To honour their contribution in the war

Severus Page 394 Potter: AU where one of the Golden Trio is killed by Greyback who is then killed by Snape

Barty Potter: for the amazing bouncing ferret

**** /at the sorting/

Professor Flitwick grins as he calls out, "Minerva Crookshanks Potter."

At the head table, Professor McGonagall sighs, "Did he have to use the middle name..."

** “Gilderoy Lockhart Potter, you're named after the most helpful DADA professor I ever had. It would have been too much work to destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and then defeat him in a duel, so I just obliviated him instead to render him completely harmless.”

** I kind of like the idea of a Harry rebelling against Wizarding Naming Conventions and just naming his kids the most Muggle names he can possibly find. Just, like, Bob Potter and stuff like that.

*** Harry's kids were born in the 2000's, so Bob would be a pretty strange choice and it's never been that popular of a name in the UK anyway. However, the year James Sirius was born (2005), his first name /was/ actually the fourth most common name in the UK, so your idea is already kinda canon.

But are James, Frank, Alice, Fred, Bill, Arthur, Molly, Ron, & George not "muggle" (by which you mean traditional white English, I'm assuming) names? They're all purebloods. Canon has no actual wizarding naming conventions, other than the Blacks.

**** He was born in 2005? I don't think I ever quite realised the epilogue was in 2016. That's rather weird to think about. If Harry and Ginny were the typically... liberal-minded parents of that era that tended to disregard age warnings on video games, James could've been playing Call of Duty by that point. Or be utterly devoted to Fifa games. Or goddamned Pokemon Go. There could be kids hunting pokemon in Hogsmeade. Jeez.

***** The epilogue took place on September 1, 2017 actually (James Sirius's second year, Albus's first). Pretty weird to think about, I agree. Every next gen fic I see without them being addicted to smartphones seems off lmao.

****** Heh. God, could you imagine? 2017, September comes along and... not a single Muggleborn child turns up. The Teachers panic, think it's a third blood war, go to find out what happened only to have a hundred kids tell them that "Of course I'm not going to Hogwarts. You people don't have WIFI!". Then they work out the Electricity issue and the Muggleborns get the Pureblood kids addicted to Flappy Bird (Flappy Phoenix?) or something. :D
