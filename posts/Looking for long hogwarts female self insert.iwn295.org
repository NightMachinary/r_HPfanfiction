** [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/195541056-the-slytherin-royals][The Slytherin Royals]] is an 80+ story, unfortunately there is a romance aspect, but there is also a ton of word building from the POV of a Slytherin Pureblooded OFC. It is on Wattpad and soo much fun. It also goes through all seven years and multiple POVs (but mostly OFC).

***** *Warning:* There is a load of bashing on the Weasleys (specifically ron and ginny), some pureblood supremacy, Dumbledore bashing, and Slytherin cunning. It also has a good plot but it also seems Mary Sue at times, but super entertaining, and not at all boring at any point.
