"Have we met yet?"

Any (reasonably) long and well-written fanfics where characters meet each other in non-linear chronological order? Example: the relationship between The Doctor and River Song.


** A few Tom Riddle focused ones:

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/][Lilly and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] - (*Frequently Updated*) Eleanor Lilly Potter (the incarnation of Death and Girl-Who-Lived) meets the erstwhile Dark Lord (and his various horcrux incarnations) in the present before at some point going back in time to befriend his childhood self. It's a great surreal fic.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8534027/1/The-Time-Travelers-Husband][The Time Traveler's Husband]] - (*Unfinished*) An accident with time turner dust curses Hermione to repeatedly jump backwards to certain moments in time. Everything goes sideways when Tom Riddle starts to meddle in the process.
