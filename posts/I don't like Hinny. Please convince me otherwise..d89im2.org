** "Messing With Time" by slythernim had probably the best description for why Harry and Ginny work as a couple that I've seen in /any/ fanfiction. The tragedy is that this is a time travel fic, and by getting dropped into the past, Harry pretty much immediately sets out to ruin any hopes of them ever getting together (knowing full well what he's sacrificing).

Short answer is that they're broken in complementary ways. Long answer... well, here's the opening paragraphs to the fic.

#+begin_quote
  It was six o'clock in the godforsaken morning, thought Harry Potter, as he trudged wearily through the front door of his little house in Godric's Hollow. At least he didn't have to deal with people trying to talk to him; Hermione had put such powerful protective charms on his house that even people who had license to visit and could see the building if they stood near it usually couldn't actually remember where he lived. But seriously, it was way too late. Ron was still in the office yelling at people, because when the Chief Auror and his Deputy got into a fight like that with no warning whatsoever it meant that someone somewhere had royally fucked up, but someone had hit Harry with some kind of exhaustion hex, and he wanted to be asleep eight hours ago. He didn't even bother turning on any lights, just stumbled groggily into the bedroom, tripped over Arnold the Pygmy Puff, and swore slightly too loudly.

  Ginny jumped as if electrocuted, and three seconds later Harry was flat on his back on the floor with her foot on his ribcage and her wand at his throat, feeling suddenly much more awake.

  He held very, very still. "Ginny. It's me. It's Harry. The war's over. You won. It's okay."

  Sometimes people at Quidditch games gave him these ridiculously hateful looks, like getting the Harpies' star Chaser to marry him by being Harry Potter was somehow cheating. As if they thought if only they were rich and famous enough, they could get famous successful Ginny Weasley to cook them dinner and be their decorative social event date, or whatever it was they expected. *The vast majority of people, Harry found, did not even consider the fact that famous successful Ginny Weasley had been possessed by Voldemort when she was eleven, had co-led a violent resistance movement when she was barely sixteen, that she had spent her sixth year of school being assaulted at random moments and fighting for her life against, in some cases, her adult professors. There was a darkness in her, a sharp poisonous bite of vengefulness that didn't quite go away with the end of the war. She slept with her wand and had a faster draw time from a cold start than most Aurors. She flinched at sudden noises and cried in her sleep.*

  *She sat awake with him when he had nightmares, too, and sang him gentle lullabyes. She tutted at him about the state of his poor broomstick which had seen entirely too many firefights, and fixed it for him when he wasn't looking. Ginny was terrifying and a little broken, but so was he, and he loved her like nothing else in the world. He cooked for her, usually, and the way she smiled - sudden and bright, like fire catching - was one of his favorite things in life, somewhere up there with unassisted flight. Still. He suspected the strangers who gave him hateful looks when she jumped into his arms straight off her broomstick did not actually realize how frightening Ginny was if you woke her up unexpectedly.*

  Harry didn't move. Ginny was shaking all over, but her wand hand was very steady. "I love you," he added, in the same even, soothing voice. It was still mostly dark and she couldn't actually see him very well, he knew, but the look on his face right now was probably unbearably sappy anyway. Sometimes Ron made affectionate fun of him for it, because he wasn't actually doing it on purpose, but generally only after it had sufficiently done its job of convincing Ginny that he was, in fact, Harry and he did, in fact, love her and he was not, in fact, going to try to murder her in her sleep. "I love you and you're safe and please breathe, okay?"

  Seven AM found him lying in bed petting Ginny's hair, and no one had been injured and everything was okay. It was fine, he'd skip work tomorrow, Ron had things under control, Ron was great like that. Right now he had important things to do. He drifted off to sleep to the sound of Ginny murmuring, "Love you."

/edit/: thanks for the silver! It took me ages to track this fic down again because I stupidly hadn't favored it, and then FFN didn't wanna let me copy from it. So, bit of work to put this post together, and I appreciate the validation. =D

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Shadowed Patronus by deadwoodpecker) - This is a recent one, started and finished last year. The author does a great job with Harry and Ginny's relationship (along with the trio friendship), and puts a lot of effort into expanding the lore and making and interesting and suspenseful mystery. My number one rec to be honest, though fair warning, there are sexual situations.

linkffn(Taking Control by fake a smile) - A classic independent!Harry fic. An alternate sixth year fic. Harry is tutored by Sirius in the spirit world after his death and learns a lot of magic this way. My favorite part about this fic actually isn't the H/G elements (which are great, imo) but how Harry teaches the DA.

linkffn(The Thorny Rose by Brennus) - In this fic, Ginny gets all of Tom Riddle's memories after the Chamber experience. In Harry's fourth year, after Ron abandons him, she uses her knowledge to help Harry. Features a slytherinish Ginny that still has a heart, but is jaded by what she has experienced. It'd be easy to give Harry no agency with this premise, but the author does a good job of avoiding that for the most part.

Also, I've got to recomend Nightmares of Future Past, but it has been tragically removed from [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] by a bogus copyright claim that the website is refusing to acknowledge. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=9305][Link to the siye upload that is missing the most recent three chapters.]] Your standard time travel fic, but its done really well.

** hgfan111 was probably one of the best Harry/Ginny writers. She deleted her accounts, but I have an archive, I can PM a wetransfer link.

Yellow Submarine is quite OK, it's different from a usual Harry Ginny fic - linkffn(4464089)

Wendell that Wasn't is a must for a Harry Ginny rec - linkffn(4396574)

Aspirations is a very old fanfic, by megamatt, but it was one of the fics that set a lot of people on the Ginny/Harry train - linkffn(4545504)

Strangers at Drakenshaugh is probably the best canon compliant fanfic out there, the author has a whole set of fics - linkffn(6331126)

If you can help her - this is not a good fic, but it's old and it might be fun, it's basically a study of the old HP fandom - linkffn(2788096)

I think this gives you an overview of why people kind of dig Harry/Ginny. She's kind of hated by a part of the fandom, but this doesn't mean that there aren't any good fics with her as the protagonist.

** I also dislike this pairing, and I found out the reason for it is that it always felt as if they were "meant" to be, not to mention the whole "Potter curse" stupidity.

That being said, a couple of the fics I've enjoyed with this pairing are linkffn(Gothic by Brennus; Harry Potter and the Nameless Man)

Yellow Submarine is also good, but someone already rec'ed here.

*** I think you're referring to an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex][Oedipus Complex]].

I get so baffled every time people reference this (or anything about Ginny looking like Lily) as a negative, because:

1. We know nothing about whether they look alike beyond their hair color (and I don't see people out there crucifying 'men who prefer blondes' or anything like that)
2. From a genetic perspective, I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the type of features you're attracted to are passed down in some shape or form, though [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-more-attracted-to-people-who-look-like-our-parents/][there's been no evidence to support this that's stood up to even cursory scrutiny]]
3. Even if the Oedipus Complex were actually a thing and were shaped in part by the person BEHAVING like your mother/father and not just looking like them, an orphan is a case where that's NOT creepy. You're essentially saying "Hey, this random adult who you never met, barely knew anything about, and never saw a picture of until you were ALREADY in the middle of puberty, is your mom. It's creepy that you're attracted to her!" It's not like Harry has any familiar memories associated with Lily, so I don't get the logic behind it in this case...
