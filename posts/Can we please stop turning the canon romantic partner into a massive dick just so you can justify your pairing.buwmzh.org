Was recently reading that Fleur/Harry penpal fic where Bill was suddenly an obnoxious prick that tried to force himself onto Fleur, called her a whore when she turned him down twice, apologised and blamed it on the Veela aura and then may or may not have gotten her fired as a result. This was at the very end of the fic so Fleur and Harry were already together but it still pissed me off. It honestly makes me think less of their relationship when you have to make someone out be be such a monster to make sure the ship stays afloat. I really enjoyed the fic up until then but this is what sticks with me. The author could've made Bill out to be more like his canon self but still have Fleur come back to Harry but they didn't. I see this so often whenever Hermione is paired with another character. They turn Ron into an abusive asshole, sometimes even a rapist, as a means make the fics chosen romantic partner more appealing. It's exhausting.


** I just read linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent) and Harry/Ginny doesn't work out in it. Ginny isn't bitchy, or evil, or love potion wielding she just accepts it and moves on. It was all weirdly refreshing.

I'm just annoyed at the many post-war fanfiction with bashing. If you really doesn't like a character you can just kill them using the war as an excuse, you don't need to find some obscure reason to bash a character.

As was I. So many fanfics try to make their characters extreme either from lazy writing or for dramatic effect that reading well written characters can be a bit of a shock.

The other bit I thought was great and perhaps unique is that in 99.99% of Haphne or Harry/Slytherin you get Harry being told "Be more Slytherin" "Do the political schmoozing." "Come up with a sneaky plan." Etc. Your fic subverted that completely and had Harry's honesty be a major positive and, when Daphne embraced the Gryffindor lifestyle, she became happier and more fulfilled. It was a genius bit of writing.

Great story overall.

***** Thank you and it's great to hear that because what you cited was what inspired me to write the story in the first place. I'm not a fan of "super political/conniving Slytherin Harry" stories because they (for the most part) suck the life out of what makes Harry such a great character and he ceases being Harry along the way. The goal was for both characters to evolve...Harry becomes more confident and ambitious thanks to Daphne and Daphne becomes more unguarded and honest thanks to Harry. They bring out the best in each other.

***** Not being the paragon of chivalry is a far cry from being abusive or a rapist.

Sure he yelled when it looked like Crookshanks had killed Scabbers. Scabbers was his own pet. His. Coming from a poor household with 6 siblings, he got attached to the few things that he had, even if he never really showed it. And when Hermione refused to respect his possessions by continuously ignoring his requests and demands to keep her pet /cat/ away from his pet /rat/, is it any wonder why he'd be pissed off at Hermione?

It's why he was also mad at her for taking away Harry's Firebolt. Ron doesn't like see things being taken away. He's stingy like that. Again, stems from his family life.

Also remember that Ron has issues. He's the last person to believe that anyone isn't good enough for him or think he deserves anything.

His deep, deep insecurity and low self-worth means he's always afraid that he's not good enough for anyone. Not good enough to live up to the expectations his brothers made. Not good enough for his two best friends. Not good enough to be attractive to anyone. It's a belief that's so ingrained in him, that he'd never try to do anything like what the fics try to portray him as. And when /he/ gets emotional he yells, and he's stubborn enough that he'll hold a grudge for ages, but he's never even attempted to harm one of his friends, no matter how angry he got, as far as I recall.

Hermione though? Miss Hermione "I'll set a flock of birds on you" Granger? Her, I could see, if she was angry or hysterical, and her perception was that she was teaching him a lesson and correcting his behavior.

Just to note, I don't think either one would be abusive with their canon personalities, but out of the two, Hermione would be the one who is closer to that extreme.

And calling it a pest is a bit unfair. Magical Britain has a lot of pets not considered normal by "Muggle" standards. They sold rats at a pet store.

If you ignore the fact the rat was Pettigrew, Ron definitely should have taken better care of his pet (a cage or something) and Hermione should have tried to keep her cat out of the boys' dorm (as it kept attacking Scabbers even when it was on Ron). There's some Owls that feed on cats (however rarely). If Harry had the same issue (an OWL that tried eating Crookshanks), would it be the same?

They were both in the wrong is what I was saying from a responsibility standpoint.

They are only 13-14 year olds, so I'd cut them some slack for being middle schoolers. Pettigrew pretty much played them both by faking his death (it seems to be a theme).

Just as you need to get the proper habitat for say a desert lizard, you need to get a safe habitat for your rat.

Especially Hermione cat who is a half-kneazle which a species of cat who are highly intelligent compare to normal cat, she could ask her cat not to hunt Ron rat and the cat WILL listen, if Hermione cat didn't realize Scabber is animagus who is a secretly a death eater.

So not only Hermione didn't give a fuck about his best friend pet rat, she probably doesn't give a fuck to any pet that got "eaten" by Crookshanks. That includes, Harry pet, Hedwig, fortunately for Harry and Hedwig, Hedwig is an actual owl and not an animagus, but Hermione doesn't know Scabber is death eater animagus, Peter Pettigiew, so I highly doubt she care enough to tell Crookshanks to stop hunting Hedwig let alone Scabber.

Hermione's inability to respect personal boundaries, her own stubborn attitude when it comes to admitting her own faults, and her dismissal of things she doesn't agree with or like, all contributed to A) Ron blaming Hermione for Scabbers' death, and B) the weeks of them not talking afterwards, because Hermione couldn't admit that Scabber's death could have been her fault, nor did she try to offer her condolences for Scabber's death. That's literally all Ron would have needed, but she didn't do it. She couldn't own up to her mistakes or admit her own flaws, but she still managed to point out flaws in other people. This is a persistent pattern throughout the series for her, and while I love the character, I also freely admit that Hermione was a busybody arrogant hypocrite, with tendencies of both neuroticism and neurosis.

Again, though, why point out the fact that she has issues? Literally does nothing to help your case. Just because she has issues, does not excuse the fact that Hermione is the one who has a history of attacking her friends.

I remember you, though. You're the person who insisted that Harry and Hermione banged in the tent in book 7, despite the presence of a Horcrux that literally eminates evil and negative emotions; despite the fact that Harry and Hermione barely talked at all, and eventually brought out Phillius Nigellus' Portrait, just to have someone else to fill the void of Ron leaving; despite the fact that Harry could hear Hermione crying in her bed for /weeks/; and despite the fact that the only contextual evidence for any sexual content in that tent is Harry staring intensely at Ginny's dot on the Marauder's Map, and thinking really hard about her.

Listen, I get it. You're not a fan of Ron, and you are a Harry/Hermione shipper, and that's fine; but you have /got/ to think through your arguments better before posting.

***** Hermione in canon would be more likely to be physically abusive than Ron. I'm not saying Ron is perfect, they'd definitely need couple's counseling, but Hermione is the only one of the two to actually hit the other.

Mind, I think canon Ron is still a bit of a dick. But he's not evil. And canon Hermione is possibly the most loyal person to Harry. I like to think they both mellowed out in adulthood. Half Blood Prince Hermione as a coworker would be a nightmare.

********* I completely agree. I probably should have said is a valid excuse.

While I like the concept of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as a trio, I have major issues with their characterization in canon, even with them being teenagers.

Harry is a bit lazy. As of first year, he knows Voldemort is going after him, and almost did kill him and stays stagnant. That is not alright. He might not be able to beat Voldemort in a straight duel at the end of the series, he should have been a much better match for any lieutenant.

Ron is characterized as noble and insightful. Which promptly gets laid to the wayside in book 4 and book 7. I'd like to see a Ron that similar to a mix of Bill and Charlie. But instead we end up with a character that coasts on Hermione's intelligence and Harry's reflexes and luck.

Hermione I feel never really grew as a character. Her heart is in the right place, but her questionable actions are never really commented on. She never really had tact in the books. She dismissed Lavender's pet dying for a vendetta against Trelawney, she was a know-it-all to Ron in book one (I'm not saying Ron was right to insult her, but a more socially aware person would have helped Ron without being rude), she shows disbelief at Ron being prefect (I'm not saying he was a bad alternate choice, but Harry deserved the bad first and foremost). Prisoner of Azkaban had the whole scabbers and broom incident. Half Blood Prince shows her petty side with Ron dating, ignoring Malfoy's suspicious behavior, and an annotated Potions book, and she's dismissive of correct theories in Deathly Hallows. Each of these incidents is fine, but she never really learned from the incidents in question. As it was, I hope Rowling had her mature after the books significantly, because I could never see canon Hermione as a Minister, more of a department head or senior undersecretary.

I say none of this as bashing, but more of things I wish they could have done better with the characters. I have fond memories of Hermione breaking the rules to help save the day, Ron defending Harry in multiple books, and Harry's goodness. I just feel part of it for plot was forced. I don't mind Hermione and Ron having a spat in book six, but both should have confronted the issue, and the pettiness was awful.

IIRC, green is the least dominant of all eye colours, so the gene requires 2 copies in the one person to be expressed, and any other colour present in the genome will be expressed rather than the green. So really, Lily and James could both have brown eyes and Harry could still get green.

** I wish I could upvote this more than once. Seriously though, this is such a problem especially with the Harry/Hermione ship. It's gotten to the point that when I see that pairing it's an automatic turnoff even when the rest of the fic actually seems interesting. It's not even that I particularly like the Ron/Hermione ship, but I just have too much ptsd from seeing the Weasleys get bashed over and over again to push Harry and Hermione together. In my mind, Harry/Hermione has become synonymous with bad writing and OOC, and it really ruins for me stories that I otherwise would have genuinely enjoyed.

** Yeah I've read this. There is a story called "Relationships Change" where Hermione and Draco are head girl and head boy and have to share a dorm. Hermione is dating Ron and he tries to force himself on her and she says no. She's crying and Draco ends up comforting her in his own awkward way.... and Ron busts in on them and starts calling Hermione a slut... says she will end up pregnant with an AIDS baby with Draco. Hermione reports Ron to the Head Mistress and he ends up expelled... he turns all dark and revenge plotting. Now I am not much of a fan of Ron but damn, this was harsh.

** The irony is that if you need to bash anyone, it probably should be the people actually in the pairing. For example, if during DH, Harry and Hermione actually did get together when Ron was gone, /they/ would be the assholes. If you wrote a Draco/Hermione story and summarized it in its simplest terms as Hermione leaves Ron for Draco, Hermione would more likely be considered the asshole in that situation. While I rarely read fics like this, one of my pet peeves regardless is how they never handle such a situation in a realistic manner, where the partner that cheats or gets with a former Death Eater is treated as the asshole.

But even if you think someone's entitled to some hold over their ex-partner's love life after a breakup, in the scene in question, Harry had broken up with Ginny months before Ron left the trio during the camping trip and Ron and Hermione hadn't been together at all. So why would they be viewed negatively?

******** First off, agreed that isnt cheating but the world doesn't work like that. They technically wouldn't be wrong, they'd just be assholes.

What bothers me about your view is you seem to just be removing the entire context of the H/G and R/Hr backstory. You leave out that both Ginny and Harry were really broken up over the break up and neither lost those feelings, even while they were apart. You forgot that Hermione was coaching Ginny on how to eventually be with Harry. You leave out the fact that Ginny and Harry shared that post-break up kiss that was a promise to be together when the war was over. You omit everything Ron and Hermione shared leading up to the final book and that everyone, including Harry, knew they had feelings for each other. You're also omitting that Ron's biggest insecurities revolved in part around the idea Hermione who choose Harry over him.

It really isn't this black or white situation. It's not like because they weren't officially together, than it's not a shitty thing to do to a friend or an ex. It's called being a human and being empathetic and not a sociopath.

In summary, if Harry and Hermione hooked up during the hunt, they wouldn't be wrong, but they'd still be assholes.

Harry and Ginny were still very much a thing, and both clearly still loved the other.

You're acting like a robot where things like ethics and moral behavior don't matter in the face of one's self-interests.

I also noticed you didn't answer my specific situations on potential asshole-ish behavior, so I assume you actually do agree that its perfectly ok to date a sibling or best friend of a recent ex, or its ok for an older man who is best friends with a guy to date his 18 year old daughter.

- While Ron and Hermione were not "together", they turned around each other for months, in not years by that point. Hermione getting with Harry (who had never showed any sign of attraction for her), or even Ron getting with anyone during this timeframe would be a pretty bitch moove.
- In Harry case, he may be "technically" single, but he and Ginny both know that the breakup was just to protect her while he is chasing Horcruxe. Both would consider the other getting with some as cheating.

***** 1. Not convinced.

Even if Ron and Hermione could be considered some kind of unofficial item - which would arguably not be binding in any case - Ron pretty much lost any right he may have had to complain when he walked out on them. In a situation where all their lives and the fate of the country was at stake, for selfish reasons. If that's not enough to qualify as a breakup, I don't know what is. Harry and Hermione were free, at that point, to do whatever they wanted romantically and call it none of his business.

1. Partially right, but overall no.

There is no way that Harry would have considered Ginny dating someone else to be cheating. Sure, he didn't want to break up with her, it was about her safety. But he did it, and he wouldn't be so inconsistent as to consider her still obligated to him. Dating someone else could actually make her safer, so I would expect him to be academically pleased and verbally approving while emotionally hurting. He wouldn't call it a betrayal, not at all.

I'm agreeing that this one is partially right because if, after their breakup for security reasons, Harry immediately went chasing after the next skirt he saw, then Ginny would likely feel betrayed, that he had lied to her about the reasons for their breakup. On the other hand, if the stresses and shared experiences had simply pushed him and Hermione together over time, and they arrived at the Battle of Hogwarts as an item, I don't think Ginny would call that cheating.

****** It's not about whether it would have been cheating. I agree it would not. It's about whether it would have been wrong of them to get together, given the entire context. And I'd argue it absolutely would have been wrong and Ron and Ginny would have been totally justified in despising them over it. Now, if Ginny and Harry didn't get back together after the battle, and they decided not to resume their relationship, and then Ron wound up deciding never to make it official with Hermione, and then Harry and Hermione got together, then I would agree it would no longer be an asshole move, though some heads up to Ginny and Ron would be appropriate. But that is an entirely different scenario than the one I'm describing. Anyway, agree to disagree.
