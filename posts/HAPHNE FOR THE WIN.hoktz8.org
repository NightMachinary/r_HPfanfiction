Now a days I don't despise the animesque moments.

*** Many fanfics are pairing-driven. People wanted a pairing that would push Harry out of his comfort zone and add some new dynamics, force him to take a fresh perspective on things. And to do this you can pair Harry with a Slytherin.

And then when it comes to picking said Slytherin girl, there are only two of them that don't have negative pre-existing characterizations that you would have to explain away or change before moving on with things. With Pansy Parkinson, you would have to break her away from Draco and explain away her being a bully, first. The less said about Millicent Bullstrode's canon presentation, the better. So you're left with Daphne Greengrass and Tracy Davis, and between the two, Daphne sounds like more of a pureblood, which supports the narrative of pushing Harry out of his established comfort zone better.

Basically, you can write a rather interesting fanfic if you pair Harry with a Slytherin, and despite her lack of canon characterization, (or perhaps, because of it,) Daphne is the best choice.

The possibility for conflict and drama without the author forcing it is there too.

The fact she's a blank slate so you can write her any way you want(even if the fandom has already 'formed' a character) also helps immensely.

Even her appearance is up to debate, you can have her be like Astoria OR just make it up, I prefer blonde because I am used to it, but some people just make her look like Ashara Dayne for some reason, like they do with Bellatrix(I am trying to think of anyone with natural purple eyes in canon and I can't recall anyone)

***** All memeing aside, the fact that she's not established in canon as being a racist, classist, entitled bully who, as much as fanon likes to ignore it, never actually renounced any of those views or took any action which would indicate that he's rethought them, probably helps. Need I remind you that his last three canonical appearances (not including the epilogue where he does nothing but nod curtly at Harry from a comfortable distance) were him trying to capture Harry to bring him to Voldemort, begging for his life by explicitly telling a Death Eater "I'm on your side," and eating in the Great Hall after the battle ends like nothing happened.

******* Yeah, no, you can totally enjoy it, but if you wanna talk shit about a pairing that /doesn't/ put the protagonist with a wizard nazi on the grounds that it's "too het," or whatever, then you shouldn't be surprised when I talk shit about your preferred ship on the grounds that the canon character of Draco Malfoy is an utterly contemptible human being.

*edit: also, "it could be worse" is a poor defense of "it's really bad as is."

*** I was looking through my old comments and found this thread again.

Seriously though, /why is that?/ I can NEVER find a well-written wlw/femslash story, Harry/Slytherin!Girl stories read like self-inserts, and harmony always sounds cringe to me, like "oh they met when they were five and the Grangers adopted Harry and for some reason this translated to them being /in love/ at frigging five years old, instead of a sibling-like feeling or something". Any non-drarry slash pairings I've tried my hand at were either one-shots or Harry/Adult!Man, and the idea of Tomarry/Snarry, which were fine to read when I was, like, /13/, now at 30 sounds so /horribly pedophilic/ I'm not even going to get into it.

I mean, what else is left? I've started watching Killing Eve as an alternative to Drarry.
