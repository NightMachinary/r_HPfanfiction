In the sadly unfinished linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12534241/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hidden-Kingdom][www.fanfiction.net/s/12534241/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hidden-Kingdom]]) Harry finds a fenced in area behind some thorn bushes that no-one's been in in a while, starts using his gardening know-how to grow plants there, and eventually starts basically living there, earning his own money, buying his own schoolbooks, growing his own food, and keeping all his stuff there. The only thing he does at the Dursleys' is sleep, and after he finds out about magic and gets a wizarding tent, not even that.

Basically, a form of Indy!Harry where he has a ton of life skills, enjoys cooking, gardening, and building, and spends as little money as possible.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.

#+begin_quote
  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

** Hey me too! Just finished it. There was a fic I read a while back that was pretty good with similar ideas. Sort of. linkffn(11933512) And linkffn(13182877) loosely has the same ideas.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  What if Dobby bound himself to Harry without Harry knowing about it? How would that influence the story? [Harry/Hermione]
