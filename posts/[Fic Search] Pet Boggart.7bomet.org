In an old thread concerning Boggarts, someone mentioned "a fic where Neville befriends a Boggart". That sounds fascinating, so does anyone know what fic they were talking about?...


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue) - Warning, this fic goes terribly off the rails in later part.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

** I'm just here wondering what kind of sick fuck would befriend something whose sole purpose seems to replicate your worst fear.

*** Well, the Riddikulus Spell's whole point is to "force" the Boggart to assume another, non-scary shape, so presumably they're shapeshifters who normally turn into their strangers' worst fear because that's an effective defense mechanism against most things that'd want to hurt them, but can turn into other things as well (and could be said in a story to be capable of being trained to assume certain non-scary shapes).
