Does anyone know of any fan fictions that are basically the same as the original books but the only difference is Harry and Hermione end up together? Thank you!!


** That's pretty much what linkffn(Notebooks and Letters) does. I didn't finish it, but more earnest Harmony fans tend to highly recommend it.
