Succumbed to the terrible prose that is Fifty Shades and looking for something better written using the HP universe. Anything will do as long as the Dom-Sub relationship with one completely controlling the other's life down to what they can eat and when they can sleep is maintained.


** You may like linkffn(The Safe Word is Devil's Snare). It's got Neville and Hermione as the main pairing and there's an actual plot and backstory. It's probably not quite as intense as you're looking for in the "total control" sense though there is some of that, but its backbone is romance which I really appreciate in a BDSM-centric story! And it actually does BDSM well and safely, rather than 50 shades which portrays a full on abusive relationship which is NOT what BDSM is.

** [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=9325][Whatever Therein is Promised]] is a SS/HG fic that is 100000x better than Fifty Shades in terms of both character development and prose. I personally dislike reading stories that make Severus a true evil ass, but I have to admit this one is compelling.

Edit: To clarify, this isn't actual BDSM smut. This has non-consensual sex and abuse, which is similar to the theme of Fifty Shades in my opinion (a worldly asshole taking advantage of a na√Øve and curious girl). NSFW with lemons

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/39333][Cambiare Podentes Series]] by Jordan Grant. It's a Snarry fic, and the writing (from what I remember as it's been several years) is pretty damn solid. The entire series (two parts) is 604k.

  A new prophecy comes to light, one that promises death for Harry Potter and enslavement for the wizarding world, unless Harry himself consents to being sexually enslaved--irrevocably and for life--to Severus Snape.

*** Love this series but it's not really BDSM. It's more of a literal slave/master thing with a love story thrown in. That said, it's really really good. I rarely read Snarry but I loved this!
