what sort enchanted Clothes could there be to help help learn to do something properly ?

enchanted socks,shoes( and if other cloths) that teach you to walk silently ?

An enchanted martial arts Gi's that make you do the Kata perfectly?

what other things could tehre be that you could learn with enchanted clothing?(I assume you cant use it for wand moments because the magic in the cloths helping you move would interfere somehow)

and cloths that Put you in a sleep walking state while you exercise so your mind can sleep while your body trains.


** linkffn (Make a Wish) uses a few such things. There's a lot of potential in such items, but it might be a way to make a character OP more easily, which, if popular, you know is going to get overused.

A handwriting glove or robes to correct posture or movement seem really good though.

*** I think they would be the sort of things that the pure-bloods would hoard and try and keep to themselves. and then I Imagen the Weasley Twin would come along and break the Monopoly and sell them to the general public.
