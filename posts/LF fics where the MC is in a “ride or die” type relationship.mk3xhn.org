Looking for fics where the MC (preferably Harry or OC) is in a “ride or die” sort of relationship, preferably het but feel free to rec slash for those browsing who like the theme but prefer slash relationships.

I've read far too much fanfiction but the only one that comes to mind is the Thorny Rose series (if I'm remembering correctly, it's been a few years since I read it). Looking for more!

Cheers!


** Sorry, but what the heck is "ride or die" even supossed to mean?

I doubt everyone will know, too, so you should add some more details to your post about what you actually want.
