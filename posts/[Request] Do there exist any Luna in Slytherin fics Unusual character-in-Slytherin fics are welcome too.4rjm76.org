I know she's an unusual character to be in Slytherin, but I've been thinking something along the lines of an ambition to change the world for the better or to solve a mystery.


** So, not luna, and I don't know if Ron counts as "unusual", but it sometimes feel that way in ff. Linkffn(choices by random-fruitcake04) is a fic in which Ron is both a Slytherin and a seer. A wip but it just updated

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. 2nd chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

** This one is short, but does unusual-characters-in-Slytherin big time. I'll not say more for risk of spoilers. Just don't drink coffee while reading it.

** There's one on Space Battles, but it includes an OC in Harry's year in Slytherin. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lovegoods-guide-to-lovecraftian-horrors-hp-oc-si-ish.388120/][Lovegood's guide to Lovecraftian Horrors]]. It's definitely a different fic, and Sol is hilarious.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
