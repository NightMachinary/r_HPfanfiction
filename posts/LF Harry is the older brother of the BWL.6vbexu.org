Looking for a Harry where he is the older brother of the BWL doesnt matter if his brother is the BWL or WBWL for pairing any pairing but Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione if possible

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.

I remember really liking this one when I read it, abandoned I believe though. Harry is pretty OP in this one.

Has the standard parent neglect you see in these types of things, don't think it was too bad though. Quidditch plays a big part as well I think.

Might not have aged well though.

Not sure of the pairings though.

Edit: kind of refreshing though, he doesn't like, super crazy hate his brother. Also, his brother isn't the worlds biggest douche. Kind of a nice change from the standard mega hate stuff.

Edit 2: Though though though though. Man, I need to read a thesaurus.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
