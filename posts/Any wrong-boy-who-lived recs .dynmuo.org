I'm looking for some wbwl fics. I only read complete fanfics that are over 50k words (the longer the better). I also prefer slash fics or fics with no main pairing. I don't mind bashing, overpowered Harry or dark harry. I also would prefer it if Harry was in another house besides Gryffindor but I don't mind that much.


** Linkffn(Antithesis) is generally considered pretty good, though I personally dropped it pretty early on, since it honestly read more like a punched up outline than a story.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** linkffn(prince of slytherin) is pretty much the standard other WBWL fics are held to on this sub, but it's not complete. I actually can't think of any I've read that are complete. Linkffn(family bonds) is the other one I can think of, but I can't remember an ending off the top of my head, so it may not have one yet

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  When, after that fateful Halloween night, the wrong Potter twin is hailed the Boy Who Lived, how will Harry's life turn out? With a power he knows not, an ancient prophecy and one Severus Snape practically raising him, interesting at least is a given.
