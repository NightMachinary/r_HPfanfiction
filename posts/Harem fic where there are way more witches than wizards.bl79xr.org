:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic some time back where most magicals are girls and wizards are rather rare. It included a gender swapped Justin Finch-Fletchley as one of Harry's love interests. When Harry is introduced to the magical world, he goes to a muggleborn meeting and meets a bunch of people and starts, like, touching their chests because he can sense their magic or something? I'm pretty sure he ends up with 4 wives - Hermione, Astoria, Ginny?, and Luna. And they take a trip to America to learn how to make their own wands? Does anyone know what fic this is? Or am I mashing more than one fic together in my brain? TIA!

It's a trilogy.
