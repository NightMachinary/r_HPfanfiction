I was doing some research for my own fic, and according to the wiki:

‚ÄúOrion and his son Regulus died in the same year: 1979. It is possible that Orion and Regulus's deaths, Regulus's defection from the Death Eaters, Orion and Walburga's disillusionment with Voldemort's methods, and Orion's preoccupation with the defences of 12 Grimmauld Place coincide.‚Äù

Are there any fics that use this speculation? It sounds super interesting to me.

Also, bc this quote made me laugh:

‚ÄúIt was my father's. Kreacher wasn't quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father's old trousers last week.‚Äù


** I always thought there was something shady about this deaths - because it weren't only Orion and Regulus who died in 1979 but also Cygnus Black who died at age 41. Then there was Alphard Black who died 1977 at age 52. Four male Blacks dead before their time (in a family who inherits through the male line) and the only one of the younger generation left standing was Sirius who maybe only survived who ever wanted the Blacks dead because he simply wasn't there.

Then there is also the fact that Regulus was the one who figured out that Voldemort had a Horcrux - the only other wizard who did the same was Albus Dumbledore. Regulus at this time was barely seventeen, and while I do believe he was clever - you don't just stumble over the fact that somebody has a horcrux.

Maybe more than just one Black found out what Voldemorts secret was - and that was what killed them. Think about it - first to die was Alphard who made Sirius his heir - the only Black who at this time stood openly against Voldemort. Somewhere in between we have Cygnus and Orion dying because we know that Regulus has died at the tail end of 79 (he was in Hogwarts until July). We know for fact that Voldemort didn't have a problem to let people disappear who knew to much - even if they were loyal. It is strange that Voldemort has moved his horcrux at this time (the reason he needed an elf) - maybe it was because somebody found out about them. Maybe that's what happend to the older Blacks. Then Regulus found what they found out and got himself killed while trying to get the horcrux.

I really would love a fic that deals with this.

*** That's a good point. And it's not only Blacks who die around that time, but also Fleamont and Euphemia Potter and (presumably) Abraxas Malfoy. The Potters and Malfoy are stated to have died of Dragonpox. My headcanon was always that these families had been supportive (maybe not the Potters) to Voldemort's cause but when he revealed that he was willing to commit terrorist acts in the name of them, the older witches and wizards got scared and they backed away. Voldemort got upset and assassinated all of them by releasing a Dragonpox strain of virus (which is canonically mentioned to be deadly to older people).

*** In the last book Voldemort goes bonkers when he hears the cup Horcrux has been stolen. He starts killing people just for hearing about its existence iirc. I think you have a really solid point here about how suspicious it is that all those family members die in a short span of time. Voldemort couldn't risk anyone knowing of the Horcrux. Additionally, he was probably infuriated that a young, seemingly loyal pureblood (who could have gained so much) would turn his back on him.

May I ask where you found that information? From the Family tree I remember it didn't show any birth dates for those that were disowned/burned off.

** This is a plot point in the canon-compliant Regulus fic I'm currently writing!

Orion (and many of the Blacks before him) had always treated Number Twelve more like a fortress than a home - it's a natural conclusion of a family that hates muggles so much being surrounded by muggles.

But after Regulus reveals that he has joined the Death Eaters and taken the Dark Mark, and his parents, to his complete surprise and horror, are decidedly unimpressed, Orion ramps up his efforts to conceal and protect his home as much as he possibly can. Orion had always been interested in protective enchantments and might have pursued a career in curse-breaking had he been born anything but the first son of the main branch of the Black family - but his interests come in handy when he promises Regulus that he will do everything he can to remove the Mark and the connection to Voldemort.

Unfortunately, Orion is killed before he manages it. Regulus doesn't know whether Bellatrix found out that Orion was trying to lock her out of Number Twelve, or whether Voldemort himself found out that Orion was trying to untangle the magic binding the Dark Mark to Regulus, or whether his father's death was an accident, an unfortunate circumstance, a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

What he does know, is that he needs to get out. Fast.

*** Sirius says in OotP that his parents were happy with Regulus becoming a Death Eater until they realized what Voldemort was capable of. Regulus died later on. At the time, prior to knowing about the whole RAB thing, it was quite clear that there was a rift at some point between the Blacks and the Death Eaters since Grimauld Place is stated to had been heavily protected even before Dumbledore added his protective spells and the Fidelius Charm.

**** Sirius actually says he 'bets' his parents were happy. He doesn't know for sure, because he wasn't there - he'd already left home by that point. And we also have to remember that he hates his family and is therefore a very biased source. But even he admits that his parents were never Death Eaters: he thinks that they agreed with Voldemort /in theory/, but not with his methods.

Going by what we know of the Black family, and Walburga in particular - that they were very proud and haughty, considered themselves above everyone else (including other purebloods) - I can't conceive of a world in which they'd be happy that their last son, their /only/ son and the heir to the entire family, had submitted himself to another wizard. And not just to another pureblood, but to a complete unknown, who dared to style himself Lord!

The heir to the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black, subjecting himself to another wizard's whims? Wearing another wizard's brand, that allows him to be summoned like a house elf? Nah, they were /furious/.

***** The same could be said about the Malfoys. In my headcanon Voldemort recruited only from the generation of his peers' children whom he brainwashed into believing that being in his good graces was the best thing. His peers might have followed him in the "he is so cool" way but by the time he starts to rise to power they are sufficiently mature and proud (some of them heads of their respective houses) to not allow themselves enslaved by a half blood. As I was saying in another comment, there is an indication that at some point prior to Voldemort's first fall there was a Dragonpox epidemic that killed at least Abraxas Malfoy and the Potters. Also the elder Black's died around the time. I think it was not a coincidence.

****** I wouldn't call Orion an 'elder Black' - he was only 50 when he died if you go by JKR's family tree (which I take with a pinch of salt since she's notoriously terrible with dates and there are some questionable ages on there). Is that what you're using when you talk about the elder Blacks dying around the same time as Harry's grandparents? Because from the version I have, there seems to be a bigger loss in the early 90s - Arcturus, Pollux, Cassiopeia, Lucretia and Cygnus all die 1990-2, whereas I can only see Orion and Regulus from 1979.

Interesting point about his peers - that's another reason why I don't think Orion and Walburga were followers/pleased with Regulus, actually! Since they were at school with Tom Riddle and presumably he would have tried to get Orion, especially, on side. I'd love to read a fic set around that time. I've seen a few posts on tumblr of Walburga and Lucretia hogging Myrtle's bathroom while Tom's trying to get into the Chamber that made me laugh!

******* I was indeed referring to Orion and Cygnus. I would also like to read a realistic Tom Riddle in his school years fic. All of them depict him as this despot that ruled his gang with an iron fist and his peers would cower in front of him even then. I think that it's unrealistic. He charmed his peers indeed and probably even intimidated them with his heritage but I don't think that his peers were ever his slaves. Dumbledore says that he controlled them tightly but also that he kept to himself. In my opinion that means he was the brain behind their cruel pranks on muggleborns but he remained in the shadows doing his thing. Even later in life when he rules the magical Britain, he doesn't really give himself any title of authority but allows the Death Eaters to rule as they please, while he gains this reputation of a godlike figure who represents a threat to anyone but no one knows for sure what he is up to and no one but his victims and his most loyal followers know for sure that he even exists for real. He only takes charge in critical situations.

** Delenda Est goes into something like this very very briefly, if you haven't read that already. I don't think it will satisfy you though.

Speaking of the prompt in general, this is why I get so enthralled by the Blacks. Loads of loose ends and a very interesting family to boot.

** linkao3(8495269) includes Orion Black reforming the Circle of Agastya, a secret society of dark wizards opposed to Dark Lords on principle. It isn't a major focus of the fic, but there's a few great scenes about the Circle, why they exist, and what happened to them (also explaining how Sirius managed to inherit the House while being "disowned").

*** Well that's just a great fic overall. And yeah, it does explain the downfall of the Blacks, partially in opposition to Voldemort, and partially from its own actions (disowning so much of their family), though it is not the focus of the fic.
