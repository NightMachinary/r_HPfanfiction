Self explanatory. What other sites other then fanfiction.net and Archiveofourown.org do you all read good Harry Potter fanfic on. I have also used: ultimatehpfanfiction.com Siye.co.uk


** Sink Into Your Eyes, like you mentioned. It's a Harry/Ginny site that has been around since /OotP/ was released in 2003 (if not earlier), so it's one of the oldest fansites that is still around (and yes, the main page still looks rather similar to [[http://web.archive.org/web/20030806010908/http://www.hgnetwork.co.uk:80/siye/][how it was back then]]). Its activity may have reduced somewhat, but compared to quite a few other HP fansites and fanfic archives that have been dropping like flies in recent years, it's still going strong.

*** Good old SIYE. I really wish Checkmated had stuck around, but such is the way of things.

**** PhoenixSong.net is also another "oldies but goodies" H/G site that is somewhat active, and that has also been around since 2003. However from what I've seen, there is a lot less activity than on SIYE.

** I used to use Mugglenet Fanfic all the time and absolutely loved it. Tried to go back and published a few things last year but spam reviewers have absolutely killed the site. Such a shame.

*** I think they're working on fixing it, luckily. You can't publish currently because they're updating the servers.

**** It's been like that for about 2 years now though, so they've lost their audience. I don't see how they can survive.
