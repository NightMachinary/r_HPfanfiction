I'm writing a fic from Ginny's POV over Christmas of HBP. It's a really fun fic to write, because canon doesn't go into a lot of detail other than the scene with Scrimgeour, and we skip straight from Christmas to the first day back. Also, I really like writing Ginny's internal monologue.

So here's the thing: at the moment, it's in diary form.

It would only be over the two weeks of Christmas holidays (the idea is that Ginny finds it in her room and starts writing in it, then leaves it at home when she goes back to school).

I like the diary form because it gives Ginny the chance to go off on tangents about random things and doesn't require me to set the scene too much.

However, I do feel like the diary thing is really cliché. Like just typing “I'm writing a Ginny diary fic set in HBP” makes me cringe a little bit.

The other option would be to rework it as a normal fic. But I feel like it would lose something in the rework. But if that means that people would be more likely to actually read it, I'm willing to rework it. I have written Ginny in non-diary form before with another fic that has kind of a similar tone, so it's not like I couldn't do it.

I've got about 13k words written (will probably be 20k-ish).

I know that some people here don't read Harry/Ginny or don't really go for a lot of canon compliant fics.

But for those of you who would normally read H/G, would you be more likely to click the back button if you saw it was a diary fic?


** a few things, with the grain of salt that I generally don't read many fics with Ginny as main character so I don't have a wealth of comparison points but...

A) Ginny. Diary. After her experiences in COS? Then again, she /is/ a Gryffindork. Maybe she addresses them all as "Dear Diary that is totally better than Tom," ?

2) Stream of consciousness Ginny is usually pretty entertaining, and a diary format lets you include the things she realizes later but missed at the time, but there's no reason you couldn't interrupt a future event with her happy/horrified realizations about a previous event even if its in a more normal ongoing narrative.

iii) linky? Now i'm curious.

*** First of all, I love your numbering system. A+

A) This is true. I start with her writing something about it's a /journal/ not a diary and if it writes back she's chucking it in the bin. But I feel like as long as it doesn't write back, it should be alright. And she did become a sports writer later in life, so she's not completely opposed to, you know, writing things out.

2) Stream of consciousness is definitely possible with a normal fic, but you do have to get to the point eventually. I feel as though when you're reading a diary fic, you're more okay with a four paragraph tangent about the perils of sharing a bathroom with eight other people.

iii) It's not published yet, though I did do another Ginny fic with a similar tone [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11116443/1/Birthday-Surprises][here]]. It was sort of a test run.

** I've noticed that very few authors get Ginny's sense of humor right. She shares Ron's sarcasm but her sense of humor is more biting than Ron's, and she's far less blatant than the twins. Since you're writing in a Diary format, make sure you get her character voice just right.

You should probably include some teenage girl stuff. Also, Ginny seems to be the kind to discuss sexual stuff freely, so might as well put in a bit of innuendo. May be put in references to sexual experiences with Dean, it is very plausible that she went all the way with him, so don't be shy in putting that in if you want to.

Deal-breakers:

1. Ginny crying every other chapter. Ugh. Especially seeing that in canon, Harry notices that Ginny rarely cries. This is why I've never been a huge fan of Andi/hg111's fics. Ginny cries far too much.

2. Every other line Ginny writes being something or the other about Harry, especially when she's not dating him. If you put in any variation of "I love Harry sooooo much but he doesn't notice me", I'll quit immediately. She's grown up from her eleven year self, thank you very much.

3. Don't make Ginny any sort of grand academic. She's not. Don't make her Hermione 2.0. That's not her. If anything, she seems to care more about Quidditch than her studies, but that's only my headcanon.

That's all, I suppose. Good luck with your fic.

*** The first and third dealbreaker I'm definitely safe.

The second I'm iffy. I definitely try to strike a balance, because she does like Harry and her personal journal is somewhere where she would be more likely to talk about it, but she's still her own person. I feel like it's important not to let her feelings for Harry take over her personality, and I hope it comes across that way in this.

**** My timeline knowledge is a bit iffy here, but isn't Ginny happily with Dean at this stage? I'm pretty sure that in canon she rejects Harry's company for Dean at least a couple of times, much to Harry's jealousy. I don't think she would care much for Harry's attention at this stage.

I'm mostly against the "loves" part. I don't think Ginny's nearly juvenile enough to think she loves Harry at this age, especially when she's already dating someone else.

***** It's hard to say. We only know what we see from Harry's POV, and there's no telling how close that is to reality. They do seem relatively happy pre-xmas. Ginny meets him in Hogsmeade and Harry/Ron catch them in a corridor.

The first time we see visible schisms in the Ginny/Dean relationship is literally the day they come back from Christmas:

#+begin_quote
  Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, "There's a table over here... Coming, Ginny?"

  "No, thanks, I said I'd meet Dean," said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic.
#+end_quote

Obviously we're seeing about 2% of their relationship, but that seems like a pretty deliberate move on JKR's part. Ginny is less than enthusiastic to rejoin her boyfriend after spending two weeks in Harry's company. I don't really think that's a coincidence. It could have nothing to do with Harry, but it still suggests that things aren't perfect for Ginny/Dean.

The next mention we get of them as a couple is Ginny/Dean rowing over Harry of all people.

#+begin_quote
  "Never mind her," said Harry, a little impatiently. "What did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?"

  "Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you," said Hermione.
#+end_quote

The next mention of them as a couple is the night they row because Dean helped Ginny through the portrait hole, which apparently turned into a larger argument that lead to them breaking up.

So clearly all was not well in Ginny/Dean-land after Christmas, and it sort of seems like Christmas might have been the turning point where Ginny sort of lose enthusiasm for the relationship and started feeling guilty for her secret not-so-tiny crush on Harry.

** The drawback of the diary format (aside from the pitfalls of accidentally typing dairy) is that everything written has already happened, as the writer is retelling their experience with self-centered goggles in place.

You can leverage the first-person narrative without actually using a diary format, which affords the chance for surprises to happen. Ginny can be interrupted mid-thought to find that she's covered in a bushel of pumpkin innards and then reacts to that, later reflecting on what might have been a better way to handle the scenario for next time.

Also, I'm with [[/u/Ruljinn]] that Ginny writing in a diary again pretty much declares 'the main character is stubborn and doesn't learn from her mistakes'.

On the contrary, this is exactly something Ginny should do. If you fear something, facing it headfirst might help you control the fear. This is exactly what Harry did with Dementors after all -- he kept facing the dementor-boggart till he learnt to control his fear. I cannot see Ginny doing things very differently.

** I think this would be a fun read, and don't have a problem with diary format as long as you at least address in passing that Ginny is weary of the diary. Would probably add to the story as well since I think it could be done with a lot of humor. 'My writing from yesterday is still here, thats a good sign.' Could be some good character building too, since it could be about her trying to overcome what happened instead of just ignoring it.

I like that line haha. I wanted to imply that her mother had given her the journal for that very reason, but didn't want to spend too much time on it.
