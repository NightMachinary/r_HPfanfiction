** Have you read the Resonance Trilogy by GreekGecko (Resonance - Revolution - Restoration)? I've gathered all of it, including a side-story and bits from her website, and put in a single file with a green font on black background, and made it available. Her Harry becomes able to cross into other realities. It's my all-time favorite fic. Snape as adopting father, trying to manage Harry as his powers may be getting out of control. It's only slightly unfinished -- abandoned with only one minor plot line to finish. I wish she would just come back and finish it. Here's a link:

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  Harry won the war against Voldemort but at a terrible price.Fawkes gives him another chance in a new world where he died as an infant and where Voldemort still lurks in the shadows...but not for long, because when one exists the other cannot survive. AU
