Many one of those were everyone else died but any is fine

I don't care if it's the Maruders or Tom Riddle, I don't even care if it's neither of those

So basically any Ginny time travel fic, solo or with anyone else


** linkao3(left hook) is great. Uncompleted but not abandoned, I don't think.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.

** Many of these I've read years ago, so there's no accounting for quality. But just a few:

linkffn(8076284)

linkffn(4740107)

linkffn(5251301)

linkffn(4175909)

linkffn(6386016)

linkffn(6356344)

These all have Ginny in them, a few have many characters going back(A second chance and past, present, future) a few are just harry and ginny (bonds of time and gift of time) and a few have ginny returning by herself (ginny returns and furious angels).

please note that I'm only 70% sure furious angels has ginny going back in time but I might be wrong.

Happy hunting
