So i came across shadowcats in some quest or another and thought, hey, i like cats. I like shadows and stuff. I also like both of them together, which means i like shadowcats.

So now I'm dreaming up a Harry Raised By Shadowcats premise that I'll probably never write, but it's fun to think about anyway. Then I thought about how Toph from The Last Airbender learned earthbending from giant moles. Then i realized that all shadowwalker!Harry fics are universally shit, and thought, hey, wouldn't it be fun for him to learn shadowtravel from the shadowcats? I don't think shadowcats can actually shadowtravel, but eh. Different universe, different rules.

What do you guys think?

Some quest in what? There are at least several things called shadowcats, some of which are not literally cats or don't have actual magic, and a little more information on your premise would be helpful.

*** In what i was reading, they were simply dungeon cat monsters with magical stealth. In my premise they would be cats, anywhere from the size of a house cat to a full grown cougar, whatever you prefer. They would at the very least be able to travel unnaturally quickly while in shadows. I think it would be fun to have full on magical shadow-manipulating shadowcats in HP though. Pretty much all shadow magic in hp fanfiction is super duper OP special magic, and it would be nice to see Harry learn it from a more natural source.

** I don't get it. You acknowledge that shadow walking is a shitty idea, and then immediately you decide you want to write a fic using the idea? It doesn't matter how he gets the skill when the end result is the same.

*** I like the idea of shadow walking. My complaint is that all the fics that use it have no restraint in their use of it. Execution matters of course. The idea of learning it from the shadowcats is not to learn it as a weapon, but a way of life. Use it from the perspective of a kid that grew up with it, not an adult that needed a power fix.
