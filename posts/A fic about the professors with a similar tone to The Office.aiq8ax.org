#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

*** +1 on this, I wish it continued through Wednesday and Thursday and maybe a few more days... or better yet, timeskipped around to various days when big canon events occured... but it's still fairly long for a one-day fic, so I'm not complaining.

*** I loved the first chapter so much! It actually got me excited and motivated (somehow) and I got my shit together (for a day). Although, I felt like it got progressively worse. I kind of struggled through the 2nd chapter and the 3rd one only became good again closer to the end.

The fic was interesting, though. So thanks for the rec. I am thinking of checking out more stuff by this author.

** Not quite the office, but the best adaptation I've seen of this is olivieblake's "Hogwarts: The Real World" series. It's posted as part of linkao3(7183676) her Amortentia "fic", Hogwarts: The Real World starts on chapter 26, and the spin off (?) The Ministry of Magic: The Real World starts on chapter 76! Both absolutely hilarious and they definitely include some funny moments with Professors as well.

  Will they or won't they? Oh, they will. Fluff for when you need it. Romantic short stories, multiple pairings, mostly Dramione but some by request. Includes Bachelorette, Reunion, and The Real World: Hogwarts series.
