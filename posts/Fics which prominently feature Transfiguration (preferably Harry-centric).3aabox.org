Excluding HPMoR and Harry Crow?

It's an interesting subject (a core one at that) which receives a fraction of the attention that Charms do (which is fair enough considering their versatility).

Harry incorporating Transfiguration into his duelling approach is something I find especially appealing, but I don't seem to be very good at finding it. Many thanks in advance! :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/10/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] focuses more on Transfiguration and Harry also makes a crucial discovery in that field

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) has a protagonist who uses a fair bit of transfiguration speckled with animation in duels.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

**** The first couple chapters are rough, but it really hits its stride. The humor is fantastic.

Not a fic, just something designed to illustrate the way in which magic could be something complex without borrowing from science.

In case you missed this post or ignored it, that fic is very much focused on Transfiguration. Harry and Hermione make some discoveries. It is used in battle
