Been trying different searches all morning looking for a fanfic I read years ago:

Lily and Sirius were a legit couple until Dumbledore intervened to make Lily and James be together. There was making out in front of fireplaces and I think some time travel, too. Probably been 7-8 years.

Help me find it?
