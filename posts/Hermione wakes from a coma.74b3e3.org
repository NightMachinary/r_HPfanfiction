I don't really care when, where or why it happened. I just want to read a fanfiction were Hermione falls into or wakes (or both) from a coma. I don't mean her petrified situation from CoS, but a legit coma, natural or magic. Hermione-centric is prefered, but no Hermione/Ron please.


** Hermione's reactions after waking up in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), are hilarious.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** What aspects of the coma are relevant to you? What's the difference between a "legit coma" and being petrified? Asking because I have something in progress I can start posting, but I'm not sure it's relevant.

*** The change is relevant for me. Although she is in a coma things change, not only around her but she herself as well. She grows older, her hair and nails grow longer. For me being petrified was always more a situation of stasis. Like, the time for Hermione just stopped running in CoS, although it continued for everyone else. This is probably only my headcanon, but that's how I saw it.

Edit: On second thought though I think I'm open for everything I can get. So being petrified is okay, as long as it's over a longer range if time.

*** Does she spend time in a coma in that fic? I've never managed to finish it and it annoys me terribly, because /it's the kind of thing I like/ and yet...I just can't focus long enough to finish this damn story.

**** No, there's no coma in this one. I'm almost positive the story Meiyou was thinking of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2056132/1/Heart-With-No-Companion][Heart With No Companion]] linkffn(2056132), which is all about Hermione's cursed coma and Snape's attempts to revive her. It's been ages since I've read it, but I remember enjoying it quite a bit.
