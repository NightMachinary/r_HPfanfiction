Summer after Sirius' death, Draco is sent to live with the Dursleys for the the protections of the blood wards and finds out he doesn't know the real Harry Potter at all. Privet Drive is home to a new fear, that of Muggles. A budding romance. A dark, twisted reality. A white feathered plea for help. Good and bad intertwine: Snape is neither, blood spills and hope rises. TW:abuse

New slowburn Drarry story- rather dark, hence the mature. Will be VERY regularly updated. Covers themes of abuse (and the effect, unlike the books), Severus' twisted reality of being a death eater, homosexual romance and far more. Twisting ending, slowly revealed plot. This will NOT just be about their slash relationship, rather it will hold an actual plot as well. Hope you take the time to visit.
