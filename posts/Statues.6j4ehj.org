** Very likely. I can see Dumbledore getting one in Harry's lifetime -- Harry, probably not until long afrer he was gone, because I don't think he'd want a statue. But he'd definitely get one, after he wasn't around to protest the making of one anymore.

** Who says there are many statues? I know the Potters have one on Godric's Hollow but I can't recall any others. Why would they have statues when magical paintings are so much better anyway?

*** My impression is that the paintings at Hogwarts are more of the fictional kind

**** Really? I think almost all of the paintings I can recall are non-fictional:

- Headmasters' Portraits - Non-fictional

- Fat Lady or Violet - Non-fictional

- Barnabus the Barmy - Non-fictional

- Walburga Black - Non-fictional

- Arianna Dumbledore - Non-fictional

- Sir Cadogan - Non-fictional

- Phineas Black - Non-fictional

- The guy who communicates with the PM - Non-fictional

- The pictures of Gilderoy Lockhart in his room - Non-fictional

I can't think of any fictional ones but would happily be proven wrong.
