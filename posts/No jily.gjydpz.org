Does anyone know any long fanfics where jily never happens.


** There's that one with Sirius and Harry as main characters, but most of them are Snape/Lily (time travel) stories. So if that's your thing you should look through stories with those tags. Let me see if I can find the former.

Edit: Hermione and Harry MCs. I've never read this mind you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/30/Stages-of-Hope]]

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
