My interest for the Warcraft (3) Franchise has awoken a little and the Nightelfs Language is Beautiful and even sounds kind of seductive...atleast in some scenes (maybe it depends on the Voice Actors too).

Now i wonder, if there are Fics that have them appear in the HP universe or some character might be dragged into a (Night)elf universe (doesnt have to be Warcraft). I dont know if "Elfs" use the same language as Nightelfs or in the same manner, so i refer to the Warcraft ones.

Im especially interested in femslash Fics, so Hermione/Ginny/Fleur or maybe even Lily Evans paired with a female Elf is welcome. Sex scenes are fine, but its also ok, if it gets intim and the act is skipped.

I can really imagine that the HP characters are so enamored by the Elfs tongue, that they ask them to use it, when they are alone.

I would also accept Harry or Ron paired with a Female Elf.


** There is plum's work. I cant remember the fic's title. There is also linkffn(stormreaver). However, he's Horde :(
