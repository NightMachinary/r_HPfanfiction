Whether he wins or loses or whatever, I want to read about Harry dealing/interacting with Sauron. Or Morgoth.

I've already read linkffn(The Power He Knows Not)

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

** You might like /Forging a King./ I can't recall if the sequel was ever completed. I liked this one well enough (it got rather fluffy at times), but the sequel was, when I stopped reading, not so good. It's fine to read without the sequel, though. linkffn(8250381)

  Fifth year, Harry's been banished into a painting by the despicable Umbridge. Now he has to find a way back home, and the only way he can do that, is by finding the scattered jewels of the Wizard's Crown. Can his new-found friends help him, or will being with them end his life and chances of ever getting home? Based more on the LOTR movies than the LOTR books.
