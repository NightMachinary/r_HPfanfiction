:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading this fanfiction the other day where Sirius becomes lord black and harry is able to command both black and potter family magic. I have been unable to find it so I was wondering if anyone knew what fic this is?


** There's a few that do something like that, but the one that immediately springs to mind is A Marauder's Plan.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
