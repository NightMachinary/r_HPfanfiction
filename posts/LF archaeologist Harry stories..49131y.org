***** I already tried a few chapter... 5 times.

First person or third person. Anything else and I'm out.

**** You kind of adjust after a few chapters and stop noticing it. It helps if you read lots of the "Choose Your Own Adventure" books as a kid, maybe.

Also recommend skipping the first chapter entirely (or until its proper place in the narrative). I'm not big into action scenes and to have one where you don't know the context just sucks.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** If you have a high tolerance for bullshit and bad writing, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5563863/12/Harry-Potter-and-the-Root-of-all-Evil]] - the later chapters feature Harry travelling around and finding neat things like the Fountain of Youth. There's some interesting concepts, but the executions leaves a bit to be desired.
