It's a common trope of fanfiction that House Elves are literally unable to survive unless they are enslaved by a wizard. Sometimes they draw their magic from the wizards, sometimes's it's just hand waved as a thing that happens. There are evidently some stories which parody this trope, but it's still incredibly common. In my more uncharitable moments I'd suggest that the authors either can't stand the idea that there's something incredibly rotten in wizarding society and so decide to justify slavery.

So, ignoring the fact that Dobby still manages not to be enslaved (he does get paid, even if it isn't as much as he should be paid), shall we analyse what this really means?

I'll put out a few starting thoughts. There seem a few possibilities for how House Elves, if they are actually unable to survive without wizards, came to be:

a) a symbiotic life-form which evolved after humans (and which humans then decided to take advantage of)

b) created by wizards as slaves

c) at some point were bound by wizards with magic which would kill them if they tried to be free

Out of these options (please feel free to add more) 'a' would naturally be the best, but it seems rather strange (even by the standards of magic) that the House Elves are then able to be 'freed' by given clothes which whilst they have a symbolic value aren't exactly universal.

If they were parasitic what consequences should this have? Magic would appear to be a limited and personal currency, for one thing (which would bring us back to magical cores). How would wizards stop there being plagues of House Elves draining them of their magic?

Anyway, hopefully that's enough rambling to start this thing off ...


** I am going to give you the cut and dry of why this often comes up from *narrative* perspective:

When authors include this trope in their fics, it almost invariably not about house-elves; it's about /Hermione/.

Most fics that use this trope do so as a result of some aspect of the story related to Hermione's character.

1. They want to show her as simply ignorant and trying to change things she does not understand.
2. They want to show Hermione as a misguided crusader; she fights for something she believes but does not understand how other people think or the magical world (ex. this was just stated almost verbatim in The Mind Arts chapter released yesterday).
3. The author does not want Hermione to suck the focus away from the story with house-elf rights and the like, so they use this to quickly shut down her moral grandstanding. Authors have a story they want to tell, and this only adds words to something that almost /never/ goes anywhere anyway in fics.

In other words, the trope is a way of shutting Hermione up about this, while trying not to change her as a character (or how the author perceives them at least). Their is also the aspect that the author wants to rationalize the way the magical world works (i.e. it appears inconsistent and ridiculous to muggles because muggles don't understand magic).

On a side note, my favorite iteration of this trope is actually Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). House elves don't need to bond with wizards/witches, but they do need to dwell in a wizard's home, or more accurately a dwelling which has been occupied by magical beings for long periods of time. So they need the homes, not necessarily any given wizard/witch.

I hope this helps clarify, at least in my thoughts.

Note: I am not lambasting Hermione, she is mostly correct from an ideological point-of-view in canon, but she does not have a good idea how to go about issues like this (at least initially).

**** Now I completely agree with that personally. Those definitely tend to be the reasons authors seem to do it, but I just don't think they really think through the consequences.

That sounds like an interesting idea and I think I might have to try it out (as much as I hate practically any bashing).

I didn't think you were lambasting Hermione by the way, she definitely doesn't get everything right in terms of how to go about it, there are disturbing parallels to the way in which British women treated the fight against slavery. I think occasionally the authors might have picked up on that and just turned it up to eleven by forcing her into situations where she's wrong.

***** Well people rarely think through the ramifications of certain story points. Case in point, look at Mrs. Rowling:

- Book 3 Sirius was sent to Azkaban, a prison run by soul-sucking amortal monsters, without a trial when he was innocent. Rowling set up a list of contrived plot elements to essentially force Sirius to be seen as guilty when he was actually innocent. The nature of the Fidelius Charm, not telling anyone else about the switch, not trusting Lupin because /werewolf/, Sirius is laughing like a maniac and saying its his fault they died, Lupin absolutely believing it. Sirius ALSO didn't have the Dark Mark, which wasn't a problem because ROWLING HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT YET.
- Book 4 Rowling introduces the concept of Veritaserum, a truth potion controlled by the Ministry that compels the drinker to tell the truth. She created this as a quick way to simply /force/ Crouch to spill his guts and not show the torture or more adult methods you would expect. This was not used on Sirius or seemingly even considered. Nor was this used on the "Imperius-victims" to find out whether they willingly served Voldemort, for apparently no reason.
- Book 5 Rowling introduces legilimency, which allows users to examine thoughts and emotions of individuals, view memories, and possibly induce false images. She created this as a way to allow Voldemort to trick Harry by way of his scar (project images to him) and get him out of school. More importantly, Dumbledore was a legilimens and potentially there were others who could have simply examined the memories of others, including Sirius and potential Death Eaters. But this was never done, also apparently for no reason.

What I'm getting at here is that many authors, including Rowling herself, introduce elements as quick ways to resolve plot points in a story that they want to tell. You want Harry to become powerful quickly? You make him the descendent of Merlin or give him a super wand or suddenly become a master of wandless magic. But these things essentially break the world they are setting up.

****** You're definitely correct, and almost everyone introduces an idea which they shouldn't. I think that maybe some of those instances weren't so bad.

Book 3: almost all of that is true, barring the Dark Mark, which surely even Voldemort can't have decided to mark all of his followers with if he intended any of them to operate effectively as spies. I suppose he might have done, but it's such brain-bashingly awful idea that I have to hold out hope that he didn't.

Book 4: I agree, and it's about the only time I'm willing to accept her 'word of God' statements, namely that it isn't actually foolproof.

Book 5: That one I'm a little more forgiving of because there is no way that legally I'd be happy with allowing people to look inside other people's heads and then claim that such and such was the case. Especially in a world where as the sixth book suggests memories can be faked. It would establish a really disturbing precedent unless you were 100% certain of the investigator being utterly neutral (not of their morality, which could complicate things, but of being completely unbiased).

*** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin does it. They go into some detail about it relating it to the concept of Wild Magic(which I found pretty interesting). Although they explore the origin of house elves being created by ancient wizards ages ago, so far their relation to wild magic has been intentionally ambiguous. From what I understand, Wild Magic is forbidden/taboo and was what existed before Wizards "tamed" magic with the use of runes, arithmancy and foci such as wands/staves.

Tbh, I just reread it and it still remains one of my favorites from the last few years. Worth a read if you're interested in a solid Slytherin Harry. Though it is still a WIP, it is extremely dense, packing a lot of story into the first few years.

** If they were parasitic, we would see different behaviour from the elves in canon.

The only thing we actually see is elves /need/ a home, which they can change without too much difficulty, and /wanting/ a family so deeply and pervadingly that they suffer profoundly if they get one and lose it. Winky turns to drink, and Kreacher becomes a surly, misanthropic little shit worshipping a dead woman's portrait. We never learn what became of Winky, but we see that once Kreacher starts getting acceptance as a member of Harry's little ersatz family, he becomes a lot healthier in his relationships with others.

They're not parasitic, they're /dependent/, to an extent a human couldn't be. The relationship isn't, to them, slavery, it's clinging to family through thick and thin because the alternative is worse. They won't leave until they're kicked out in the proper ritual form.

*** I have to entirely agree with the first part of that. I merely mention the parasitic idea because fanon often has them drawing on the magic of wizards to survive.

We don't know /why/ they need those things though, or under what circumstances they could still be happy. Wizards may have ended up taking advantage of an incredibly benevolent species. Why does giving them clothes cut them out of this household community? Winky and Kreacher's reactions could be put down to the fact that the House Elves seem to have incredibly strong emotional bonds to people.

Even if the relationship isn't one of slavery to them (which it may well not be), there is a question of exactly how they got into this position in the first place, and plenty of reason to urge the importance of treating them well. How did a species become so thoroughly dependent?

** I wish I could find it again, but there was a fic in which the symbiotic relationship between human and elve was explained rather well. It started off even before humans evolved, establishing elves as an even older race of beings that feeds on sources of magic. That may be the mountains, the forests, the waters,... . Those elvish species split eventually on the evolutionary tree and became dwarves, goblins, nymphs, merpeople,... . It established humanity as an oddity among magical beings in that the hybrids between elves and homo sapiens have developed to become the only species of sentients that were simultaneously a source of magic and independent from any source - free to roam all of the earth. The Houselve was just a logical evolution of the predecessors they share with dwarves and goblins, to latch onto human magic as just one more source of (magical) nutrient.

The story went further in that Hermione had a point. Even though they were sentient, highly intelligent thinking and feeling beings (since according to this fic they basically built human society alongside their Masters), they were treated worse by the law than animals who have entered similar symbiotic relationships with humanity (in the fanfic it was kneazels and owls, all being protected from abusive mages). She gave up on them freeing themselves (as that /did/ severely hurt them and in some cases, kill them), but she pushed through protective laws (adapted civil rights) for houselves and a "Houselve Adoption Process".

In any case, I like the idea, if done properly and in an interesting way.

On the other side I find the story possibilities behind it being just straight up slavery interesting too. How were they enslaved? Is it some sort of species-specific curse or just cultural between the elves. Are there places where houseleves live freely? Have free houseelves gone exctinct?

** The 'house elves need to be bonded or they die'-concept is increasingly annoying to me. Mainly because I find it to be a cheap justification to portray the magical community (at least the upper echelons) as less archaic and rooted in classism and racism as it is originally described as. People tend to whitewash their own rationale to establish it as the moral high ground - often without realising it. Unfortunately in the course of that all the moral nuances often get 'lost in translation'.

I can not argue this scientifically, but I find the idea of them being symboitic creatures that draw on their masters/families magic to survive implausible. For one because - hopefully I don't confuse canon with fanon here - it is well established that the magic of house elves is very different to the magic that human magicals use. If they'd draw the magic from them, I believe their magic would have adapted and assimilated to be much more similar.

Also I am working under the premise that magical cores are not a real thing. That means that magic is a natural energy that is generated by world around us [1], meaning that magical beings are mere conduits but no sources. Therefore Elves could, like everyone else, just draw the magic from the world around them, making the bond to their families not vital.

Personally, I believe that the enslavement of the elves had no magical reason at all. The wizards saw a magically powerful race without any inherent pride, ambition or political agenda, what they had was a deep seated need for community and they took the opportunity to employ them for their own advantage. An unkown amount of time later, this need for community has developed into the deferential attitude we know today. The original employment would not even have needed to start out as blatant slavery.

[1] There is a Avatar/HP-crossover that developed the theory that magic is the excess energy that was generated by the planet, and as the planet slowly died, everything magical died because all energy was needed just to sustain what was left. I like that approach very much.

** The easiest way I find to look at the origins of house-elves for me is look at what else wizarding homes have. They have mirrors that comment on their appearance. There is a least one incidence of a clock that keeps track of how people are doing. Is it outside of the realms of possibility that a wizard one day decided cleaning is too much effort when he could magically create something to do it for him? So I guess b) but I don't think slaves were the original plan. More just magically created help. An enchanted broom isn't versatile enough, same with a mop or any other household cleaning tool. In the end they created something that can use all of that. I would find a sentient mirror creepy as fuck honestly, watching over as I sleep etc. I don't think I could sleep fine.

With that in mind I think its not unreasonable, for authors who go with B ) to have house-elves genuinely enjoy their work. With B ) they have a purpose in life. a purpose they were created to fulfil. Having a purpose in life is more than we have so really who are we to tell them that we regret their creation and that they should find new purpose. I think A) or c) don't make sense for me and if they're used in stories then you have more of a slavery thing going on. At least with B you know full well that they're a very different species who don't think the same as us. That don't have the same standards as us. Something that annoys me a bit with this fandom is when it tries to humanise things that are proud not to be human. Goblins for example, we see they have their whole law on inheritance and ownership, how I take this is they have a very different but equally valid view. Most importantly they don't think the same as we do. They're fundamentally not human. Does that make slaving them okay? No, of course not. That being said, if you created a magical being to serve you then chances are if you made it right then it wants to serve you and could find no higher purpose than serving you. Now debating the ethics of creating something to serve you is a whole separate debate, but lets be honest, the ethics of the wizarding world are terrifying at the best of times. Obliviation is terrifying.

** The thing about fictional worlds like HP is that they're supposed to be, well, fictional. Different. Something to flavor the palate. So, personally, reading about muggleborn-ish social justice warriors that storm the evil wizarding world with their blinding righteousness (with inevitable triumph) has always left a bad taste in my mouth, because if I wanted to read about the evils and abolition of slavery, then I might as well spend my time on The Life of Frederick Douglass, or one of the other 10 gazillion original books on the subject. It's a horse well-traveled, and, in my personal opinion, the authors who decide to ride it usually do so due to a lack of staffing in the imagination department.

Because there is such potential here, both in world-building and in the exploration of human folly. You can play on hubris; have a character like Hermione free an elf -- only for it to die before her eyes, because her own preconceptions of right and wrong were based on the wrong values. You can create a rich history, where -- just like you mention in option a -- there was a symbiotic bond that wizards gradually subverted over time. You can even imagine that elves were demons that were summoned by some ancient wizard to serve -- and their current propensity for submission is a trace of the original order.

I also love the idea of parasitism, because then you can create a history of an ancient struggle, where elves used to hunt down and capture wizards for their magic, sell them on auctions and the like, until some wizard came up with a way to fight back, led a Spartacus-like rebellion, and the current hate/desire to humiliate elves wizards hold toward elves is a remnant of their fear from so ages ago.

There's a thousand possibilities! But going into a magical world with the mind set of 'evil pureblood wizards enslave elves cause evil' is...plausible, sure, but also mind-numbingly BORING.

*** Of course one should hope for something new and original. Imposing one society's values on another's is naturally rather counterproductive when one hopes to create an original fantastical world. However, I fear that in order to avoid falling prey to that particular habit the authors who decided to make the House Elves actually /need/ to be in service went the other way. They decided that they had to make the wizarding world conform, but fail to tell any muggleborns. A problem compounded by the failure of wizards within those worlds to give decent living conditions to the House Elves.

Let Hermione be wrong by all means, but if you're going to it should have consequences beyond that and be more than a straw-man argument to throw at her. So, the Elves can't be freed, but as you point out there are a number of reasons why that could be the case. If you take the ancient struggle story, are the people who used the Elves to hunt wizards still out there? How come the Elves served them? So Hermione was wrong to want to set them free, but was she wrong to want the wizards to treat the Elves kindly? You could have a shades of grey story, and yet we're often left with the first conclusion in which the foolish muggleborn's concerns are simply shrugged off. Yet, no matter how you cut it there's almost always something a bit disturbing about the idea of an enslaved race who were 'meant to be that way'.

If we take the demons idea, often one of the better played concepts, what if some of those demons are actually trying to get free? What if we have a Bartimaeus Trilogy type story around House Elves going on in the background? Are demons naturally things which like serving? In some ways you kind of have to argue not, and if so, does that mean that Wizards have effectively crushed their minds? What does that mean in the grand scheme of things? How are the forces of Hell responding? Can you justify binding demons? Yes, we think of them as evil usually, but then we've already said don't take the cultural norms of one society and impose them on another ...

Basically, just making the purebloods good guys is equally BORING.

**** Oh, I absolutely agree. It's the shades of grey that tantalize the imagination. A 'good guy pureblood, silly muggleborn that doesn't understand world' story can be just as cringy (albeit, I'd say less common), if it's not fleshed out properly.

Ultimately, it's how much originality the author can bring to the world -- while remaining laconic.

For example, one of the questions (was Hermione wrong to have elves treated kindly) can have a number of answers.

1. The elves could be secret masochists that derive pleasure from pain and take a perverted delight in disobeying their masters just to be punished.

2. Or maybe pain and punishment serve as a better conduit for them to "siphon" magical nourishment from their masters.

3. Finally, playing off the parasitism idea, maybe wizards initially subverted elves out of self-defense, normalizing abusive treatment as a barrier to anyone forming bonds with house-elves and freeing them -- because, once freed, they rampage through the world, enslaving the wizards back.

And that's just one tiny aspect.

And, sure, the idea of a race /pre-destined/ for slavery can be disturbing -- or liberating, if a reasonable explanation is found.

The idea of the demon story-line (with some individuals yearning to cast off the shackles of servitude) can also be very inventive. Every one of the questions/ideas you posed can lead to a great plot expansion.

But, personally, I will always gravitate towards stories that try to turn around contemporary social mores and present something alien.

***** Again a series of interesting suggestions, though again there doesn't seem much evidence for most of those. Though all could be interesting if ACTUALLY explored. However, the authors virtually always use it as a way to handwave things. Not to consider contemporary social mores, but just to bypass them.

The life unexamined is not a life worth living, but it needs examination.

I personally don't really mind if they keep contemporary social mores or defy them, provided they have a good reason for doing so. Otherwise it just feels like lazy writing.
