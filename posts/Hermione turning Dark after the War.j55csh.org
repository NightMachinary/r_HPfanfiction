Does anyone here have a recommendation for a fic with Hermione turning dark as the lead character after the death of Voldemort? The stuff I find for the dark Hermione topic all are complete AU stories unfortunately.

I'm thinking of something like linkffn(11858167), just with Hermione as main character and not Harry.


** That's a really odd deficit to exist. Honestly, I'd think a Post-War Hermione would be the most likely to go full Knight Templar to get her way or fight her fight. I can totally picture her just throwing her hands up at all the incompetent Ministry folk and their nonsense then concluding that the best option would be Murder. Sort of Yandere Activism, basically. Do to the Ministry what she did to 'ole Rita Skeets and Malfoy.

EDIT - Also, you might get more response if you flair this appropriately. You want 'Request', not 'Recommendation'. Request is asking for fics, Recommendation is when you're recommending fics.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
