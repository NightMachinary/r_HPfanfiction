*There's a correct time and place within (fan) fiction to use exposition to describe historical events or as an active time lapse to progress the story.* Often, exposition is the only way to covey certain types of information or actions. Some great authors rely on it heavily and fit it into their writing style.

A great example of this is in the Lord of the Rings where Tolkien uses exposition to describe the movement of large parties and armies where it's not practical to delve into the minutia of hundreds or thousands of individuals within large multiday movements.

One constant within his writing style seems to be these little peeks into notable moments within the exposition. There will be a few paragraphs of descriptions of where some host is moving to or from, and then in the next paragraph the action will “zoom in” to focus on an individual who shares important some insight into the exposition.

This is the way I've seen exposition effectively used: intermittent, brief exposition sections which feature impersonal descriptions of events over a long period of time (hours, days, or weeks versus seconds or minutes) interwoven with an ongoing thread of live action dialogue or intimate scenes between important characters (or vice versa).

*One of the classic new author mistakes is trying to fit way too much history, character backstory or time lapse information in a contiguous block of exposition* (10+ paragraphs) that lulls most readers to sleep. This is commonly known as an infodump, and it's usually considered to be bad writing.

It was made known to me yesterday that some people actually enjoy reading these huge blocks of exposition, so I want hoping to hear from others on this sub what their thoughts were on this topic.

*tl;dr: How do you feel about large sections (10+ paragraphs to a full chapter) of exposition and backstory?*


** Exposition has killed a lot of stories for me. I never made it past the first chapter of Emperor because I was bombarded with six-odd paragraphs of exposition about the backstory /in the author's notes/. I also recall quitting out of Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle in the second chapter for similar reasons.

I do understand the infodump, from a writer's perspective. It is a very easy and clean way to convey information, and a writer who has invested many hours planning, imagining, daydreaming about his or her fic may believe that the several unbroken paragraphs of exposition they are writing are going to be interesting to the readers.

From a reader's perspective I find them utterly obnoxious. I won't criticize an author too heavily for typing up the odd paragraph just to get that little bit of information across that they might need, but I usually like to see it handled in such a way that it never feels like the author is providing information to me.

I almost entirely agree with this, though with the addition of masking as much as possible the author's need to provide information, as I said.

The exposition could be done through dialogue, as long there's not too much of it and the author takes care to not lose track of character voice and the action surrounding the dialogue, so that it's not just exposition masquerading as dialogue. You could have a character that seeks out and finds information that is both A. pertinent to the character's goals and motivations and B. somewhat expositional in nature, and I would be happy with that even though you may have only included the scene because you needed me to know a certain piece of information.

Basically what I'm trying to say is, if it's ever noticeable that the exposition is coming from the /author/ rather than the characters or the narrative, I am not going to be a happy reader.

** I don't want to ramble, but some of my favorite stories (be it fanfics or novels) are those where there's zero noticeable infodumps. Of course certain scenes are constructed just to give me information, but they never feel that way.

Fanfic authors severly underestimate the ability of readers to piece together a picture... as long as you have a clear vision of the world you are describing you can just let characters act naturally in that world and it will convey exactly what you had in mind. Like, if in your AU Voldemort never heard the prophecy... don't say it! Just don't. Don't mention any prophecy. Just write your story. James and Lily are alive. Everyone goes "Huh?! I wonder why those are alive!" and the more you write the more information will trickle down about it. You don't need the infodump. The reader doesn't need to know every little detail at all times.

As a published author who started out as a fan writer (and makes the very rare, very not edited fanfic for fun):

I dunno, but be sure to tell me when you find out because I would love to do all that smoothly in one go without needing more than five drafts to figure out how to rite uh gud storree.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Depends. Is the writer one of those rare souls who is any good at dumping out those things and making it entertaining?

(Okay, now that I've got the impishness out of the way, I'll answer seriously.)

*Ahem*.

The balance between story and exposition is like determining if something is obscene: /you know it when you see it./ What I mean by that is that the more you read and the more you write (doing more of both is necessary if you want to do the second one), then the more you start to get a hang of what is info is "useful" and what is not, and often, what is useful is one of several things, including 1) being informative, 2) contributing to worldbuilding, 3) fitting the style of the story being told, and, finally, it is always, /always/, *always* 4) entertaining to the reader in some way.

It's difficult to explain it any better than that.

*tl;dr version* - If it's not entertaining in some way, your exposition has crossed over into infodump territory.

** If it is the author speaking as the author, then the story ought to be closed immediately, and burned with fire. An author should never speak except through the medium of the characters, or songs/books in the story itself. Author's notes are right out.

Tolkien's method of doing it is, of course, the ideal to which authors should hold themselves. I'm more forgiving if it is presented as an internal monologue, or a well-written dialogue. I'll read about several pages of that, especially if it is important information. If an author breaks it up and disguises it well, I may even read what is essentially a whole chapter of exposition.

** I have one fic (not published yet) I've been working on with a friend in which we've had to walk that line. The fic is very AU, to the extent that an info dump was fairly necessary. We decided to write it, however, not as a bunch of paragraphs or as Hermione spewing information, but as a series of newspaper articles, book excepts, and interviews. I feel that something like that, where you get all the information you need but have a way to break it up to keep the reader engaged, is the best way to go about it. Thoughts?

*** Stuff that the characters interact with and comment on doesn't count a a classic infodump, and if done correctly is one of the decent ways to do it.

Now, if those excerpts and such are added onto each chapter's beginning instead, well ... for as long as they are not too long, that too is a decent way of dealing with it, as they enhance the immersion instead of breaking it and the fluff it would have to be dressed in will be enough to keep it interesting.

That is, of course, assuming that it is done correctly, and working under the assumption that this info really is necessary to the readers and cannot be given in the story proper by any of the characters.

I'm of the opinion that infodumps aren't ever necessary. They are only necessary to the extent that the author doesn't know how else to give the information. That or the author either hasn't or won't take the time to blend the relevant information into the narrative and dialogue.

There's nothing that says the audience needs to know everything (or anything) about the world before they begin reading. Consider the first time you read the Philosopher's Stone you knew nothing about the Harry Potter universe and you still enjoyed the book well enough.

There are ways to distribute information about the world without dropping it all at once. It gives the reader a chance to learn about the world slowly and over time instead of all at once.

That said, the strategy you're describing with newspaper articles etc. isn't a bad approach as long as these articles aren't more than a few paragraphs long and the reader doesn't have to read all of them at once before the story really starts.

Adding a /short/ excerpt at the beginning of each chapter with glimpses into this AU seems like a decent approach.

** If exposition goes on to the point that it bores me (And it will if the topic doesn't interest me immensely), I'll just start skimming until I see dialogue and start reading again.

If I can do that, and keep up with the story I don't care. That's definitely not a good trait for a fic to have. If I can skip all that and still understand what's happening it clearly wasn't crucial enough for you to risk boring the shit out of your reader, but it isn't a deal breaker.

I have issues with long winded authors in general. Too much exposition, or just description in general, will result in me putting down the fic/novel. I don't read a lot of popular authors just because the /way they write/ bores me to tears. I tend to have better luck with YA authors who seem to have adjusted to having less focused readers.

** Hmm ... I can deal with those things if they give out information that you don't actually need and the chapter with the exposition is marked as such so that those who cannot get through it can safely do so. Likewise, I can deal with them if they are packed into an interesting dialogue or some character's musings that are both in-character and appropriate for the situation they are in. Otherwise, no, please take a lesson about the flow of writing.

A lot of stuff given in expositions of that kind (i.e. walls of text) is not really necessary for anything in the story and is only there so that the readers would have a better idea on the writer's perspective on a given thing or on things. While that in itself is not inherently a bad thing because /a little bit/ of extra info won't hurt anyone and it can be used as one more tool for creating the atmosphere of the work, there is a tendency for people doing that to go overboard with the amount (and uselessness or redundancy) of the information required, break the immersion while doing so as it is revealed neither in a dialogue nor in narrated thoughts of any of the characters but instead in an out-of-place infodump, and make the infodump dry as a desert which makes it even more jarring.
