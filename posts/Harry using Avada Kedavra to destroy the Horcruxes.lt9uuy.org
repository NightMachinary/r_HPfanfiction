Of course, the whole "quest" in Deathly Hallows (DH) is pretty pivotal to character development and the plot, but couldn't Harry just use the killing curse on the Horcruxes. From what we understand in canon and even in "Fanon," the killing curse severs the soul from its physical shell--whether it's in an organic body or something artificial. Seeing as a horcrux is essentially a soul-piece inside of a physical body, it serves to reason that a simple killing curse should sever Riddle's soul from the anchor and/or destroy the anchor in a manner akin to Fiendfyre--see Voldemort throwing Avadas at statues in OOTP.

So...why not just fling an Avada and call it a day?

Well, we know that the unforgivables require hatred and intent--much like other forms of emotion-powered magic. We also know that Harry is perfectly capable of performing the unforgivables in DH as evidenced from his use of both the Imperius and Cruciatus curse. Thus, it stands to reason that Harry should have the ability to cast Avada Kedavra on Tom Riddle (soul-piece) and destroy the horcrux with relative ease.

What do you all think? And also, I've read a couple of fics that used this premise, but I'd love to hear some recommendations.

I'm pretty sure that's purely fanon. In canon, the curse just kills you. And your soul does leave your body when you die, but that's just a side effect. When a dementor kisses someone, it does remove their soul, but they stay alive.

So I don't think it's a given that the Killing Curse could destroy a nonliving horcrux. I wouldn't complain about a fic that decided it does that work way, but it's not canon.

This 100%

But also the proposed mechanism directly contradicts everything we're told about horcruxes. There's a pretty detailed description of them in DH that everyone just seems to ignore:

1. A horcrux is not like a person, but its opposite. A person is a soul with a physical body; a horcrux is a physical body with a soul.

2. This has a fundamental impact on the relationship between body and soul. A person's soul is not affected by what happens to their body, because the soul is primary and the body secondary. With a horcrux, on the other hand, the body is primary, meaning the soul shares the fate of its body.

3. This is why the *only* way to destroy a horcrux is to destroy its physical body, because the soul and physical body are one (unlike a person, where the soul and body are independent). With a horcrux, there is no way to directly "access" the soul, because it does not have the dual body/soul nature of a person. Rather, the body is the soul and the soul is the body.

So no, using the Killing Curse on a horcrux would not work, because it does not destroy the physical object beyond magical repair.

The only counterpoint I'd have there is "living Horcruxes", of which we have 2 examples: Harry and Nagini.

The soul-fragment within Harry was, in fact, destroyed/sent to the afterlife by the Killing Curse. However, there exists a counter-argument in that that soul-splinter was never confirmed to work by the same rules - after all, unless Voldemort went the full length in preparing Baby Harry as a Horcrux vessel, he wasn't exactly made to be one.

The real question, then, is whether the Killing Curse would have worked on Horcrux!Nagini - and that, I'm actually not sure about. The fact Voldemort did bring Nagini into battle suggests he was at least comfortable enough with his Final Horcrux being in the thick of a warzone with Killing Curses (and all manner of other nasty spells) flying all over the place, but then Voldemort did suffer from a terminal case of hubris.

***** Well, it's the same principle. It just so happens that a Killing Curse renders a living vessel damaged beyond repair. Because for a living thing, being dead is that. It's still not the case that the curse is killing the soul fragment directly, it's just that in the case of living containers, the container is able to be destroyed with the AK whereas inanimate containers are not.

** I remember having the same thought when I first read the book. To me it was the obvious answer to their Horxrux killing problem. But as you said, it would probably have been a pretty boring solution compared to the whole Basilisk venom and Sword of Gryffindor thing.

As to whether Harry would be able to cast it in the first place, that's up to debate. Personally I think at least canon Harry doesn't have enough hate for Voldemort to use Avada Kedavra successfully. Plus he's probably afraid of using it as even when face to face with Voldemort he still goes for Expelliarmus.

If you're thinking of using this solution in a fanfiction, I'd say go for it. Just be careful to spin it as believable (make Harry sound generally more hateful/vengeful towards Voldemort).

*** Yeah, lol. Two words compared to the whole "Sword of Gryffindor" quest isn't too interesting.

I agree, there are good arguments for both sides. I think, for me, it seems like canon Harry could cast AK successfully in Deathly. He's dealt with child-abuse, terrible situations, deaths of classmates, lost Sirius, lost Dumbledore, ruined his relationship with Lupin (he's in the tent so he hasn't met with him again yet), and has the general pressure of ending Voldemort. He's definitely set on killing Voldemort and isn't disturbed by the concept so I think it stands to reason that he could cast AK successfully when the horcurx's influence pushed him over the edge. The whole Expelliarmus schtick is a bit comical at times imo. Yeah, it makes sense in the final confrontation with Voldemort since he just talked to fairy-godmother Dumbledore and was "enlightened" and whatnot, but in other situations? My two cents at least.

**** You know that would actually make a good prompt: Harry is able to cast AK but /only/ while wearing the locket. So in order to destroy Voldemort's other Horxruxes he has to keep the locket alive until the end.

***** Yeah, definitely. But maybe after he starts destroying the horcruxes, the locket tries to merge with the scarcrux. Then you could go either way with Harry absorbing the horcrux(es) or gets AKed.

*** Personally I think it's the only unforgivable he shouldn't be able to use, more in a traumatic block than a emotional one, in the prisoner of Azkaban he's afraid of dementors because they made him relive the death of his mother in a green flash so it could be logical that the killing curse would be the only spell he's just unable to cast

** I don't think the Killing Curse could "destroy" an Horcruxe. While it was never confirmed, the Killing Curse seems to attack the target's soul (it kills the target while leaving the body intact), while an Horcruxe is supposed to work as the opposite of a soul. The Horcruxe is supposed to be fine as long as its vessel is intact, so I don't see why a spell that is not supposed to do any damages (though I guess they broke some things in canon) could work.

Also . . . I think it kinda feel cheap. I know that Canon Harry is not a Dark Wizard, and using the Killing Curse would be extremely hard for him, but it would still be relatively easy to cast for most people looking for Horcruxe (usually Dark Wizard wanting to kill concurence). But Hermione read the explanation on Horcruxe (and how to destroy them) in /Magick Most Evile,/ an extremely dark book. Most people who read this kind of book would not be adverse to using the Killing Curse, so I don't see why the book would not mention such a convenient way, and rather send the wizard on a quest to look for Basilisk Venom, or to learn the very dangerous spell of Fienfyre.

*** Definitely the soul. You're not killing the object; you're killing the soul. However, in this instance, Harry would probably also hate the object because of the memories associated with its acquisition. Eg: Inferi cesspool and losing Dumbledore associated with the locket.

** A Horcrux is not truly alive and therefore cannot be killed.

The killing curse's effects on objects are variable and unimpressive, sometimes it bounces right off, other times it explodes. I'd imagine Horcruxes fall into the bounce of category, but even if it does explode, blowing up horcruxes just doesn't work.

It'd work on Nagini of course, she's very much alive and killable.

** "There's only one thing left to try, I think." Harry said quietly. Ron and Hermione, who had been arguing loudly about what else they could try, fell silent. Hermione, always the sharpest of them, choked as she cottoned on. Ron wasn't far behind. They both turned to Harry, whose gaze was locked on the Horcrux with an intensity that terrified them.

"You don't mean that, Harry! You can't mean that. Those curses, especially that one..." Ron started. "... Are completely unlockable. There's no magical protection from them." Harry interrupted. Hermione thought furiously as Ron gaped, coming to a sobering conclusion. She gripped Ron's shoulder, turning him around to face her. Hermione didn't need to say anything; ever the chess master, Ron had came to the same conclusion. They walked to Harry's side, bracketing him silently.

Harry smiled for a moment, then frowned as he asked the question. "How...?" Harry tried to ask, trailing off uncertainly. Hermione understood anyway. "The Killing Curse requires but two things to obtain an outcome that is certain and final. Hatred, and intent. The successful caster must believe, with all certainty, that the world would be better served by the target's death. He must be willing to take the ultimate act without hesitation; he must, in the end, desire to be the hand of Death himself." Hermione recited clinically. Harry nodded, and closed his eyes in concentration. This would be painful, he knew.

What did he want, really? Was Voldemort's destruction merely a means to obtaining a better life for himself? If Voldemort had never heard the name Potter, would Harry want to kill him? As he pondered this, Ron's shoulder brushed up against his, and he knew the answer. So many people had lost everything due to that monster. Ron's brothers had nearly been killed at various points in the years that Harry had knew him, as had Ron, and Mrs. Weasley, sweet and motherly and strong, had lost her brothers, Gideon and Fabian, to the war.

Hermione, who he could see nervously shifting next to him, had given up much, as well. Her parents, who Harry had only met in passing, had not understood the danger their daughter was always in because Voldemort had stirred up violent bigots against people with heritage they disagreed with. Hermione had done the unthinkable; she had erased her parents' memories of her and their life together, moving them to Australia so that they could not be targeted by Death Eaters, Voldemort's followers. Here she stood, never knowing if she'd ever see her parents again, all because of the Dark Lord. Harry understood that pain.

Neville, whose parents were tortured into insanity.

Dumbledore, who fought against the dark, killed by his command.

Barty Crouch, killed by his own son who Voldemort had twisted into a cruel mockery of himself.

Sirius, the white sheep of the Black family, killed before he could truly live.

Voldemort had caused all of this. Harry's wand slipped into his hand of its own accord, the holly and phoenix feather creation responding to the rage of its Master. His friends noticed his movement, and stepped back and away from him. Harry spoke once more, raising his wand to point at the cursed locket. "The wand movement?" he asked. "Like your scar. Sowilo, the rune of victory." Hermione answered.

Harry once more locked eyes with the Horcrux, and raised his wand another fraction of an inch. Then, Harry spoke two words that all present would remember for the rest of their life.

"AVADA KEDEVRA."

*** Well, to be fair, it was Harry's first time ever casting Crucio so even if he felt an enormous amount of rage and hatred, it's unlikely that he would've gotten it perfectly on the first time. Even then, he still knocked over and surprised one of the most dangerous and powerful witches to ever live.

With the Carrows, I agree that there are quite a few events that resulted in his success but even still, the point is that Harry had sufficient hatred and intent to cast the Cruciatus. And from what I could tell in the books, that hatred arose when Amycus insulted and spat on McGonagall--a very different trigger to say, horcrux-fueled anger. I wouldn't personally call it a failure as Harry very clearly caused Amycus excruciating pain and then threw him ten feet across the room, knocking him unconscious. Not a bad second attempt at the spell. I don't think it's fair to compare Harry's Cruciatus with Voldemort's and Bellatrix's as those two have spent /decades/ utilizing and perfecting the curse. I mean, it was said that Bellatrix was a master of using the Cruciatus, able to modify and intensify the spell at will. For his second attempt, judging the intent and purpose of the spell, I'd say Harry performed admirably.

Even if Harry didn't want to hurt or kill anyone, using the Imperius /properly/ required Harry squashing the victim's will with an intent to control them. Given the similar intent-requirement for the other two unforgivables, it is evident that Harry /could/ utilize them.

An intent to kill? To sever the soul and defeat Voldemort? I think it's fairly possible that, while in the tent, tensions could have easily and DID rise to the point where it's definitely possible that Harry, fueled on aggression, hatred, and Horcrux-inspired rage could've AKed the locket properly. I doubt that the other two members of the Golden Trio could've accomplished it (like you said) but I'm certain that Harry, after everything that has happened to him, could've accumulated enough hatred to try and destroy Voldemort with an AK.

That said, why is AK considered the most terrible unforgivable curse in the Wizarding World? Compared to losing control over your body and debilitating and mind-wrenching agony, painless and instantaneous death doesn't seem so bad...

***** Yup, just one minor irritation could've pushed him over the edge to AK the locket in a fit of rage.

Yep, definitely agree. To be fair, however, Harry's gone through and experienced far more than the average civilian or Auror (who could cast AK successfully). Hell, didn't Harry feel the Cruciatus every time Voldemort cast it during his dream-vision things? Pretty crazy.

True, the victim could survive, but imagine the emotional and physical trauma. With the Imperius, imagine having killed your entire family with your bare hands or something equally horrific. Living after that happened would be an exceptionally cruel reminder of what happened. And with the Cruciatius, imagine the damage caused to your nervous system after, say, a few minutes. Even Voldemort never used the Cruciatus for more than a few seconds when punishing his servants and even took breaks in between for minor recovery in the hopes of preserving homeostasis. And this is Voldemort! AK is far more tame imo.
