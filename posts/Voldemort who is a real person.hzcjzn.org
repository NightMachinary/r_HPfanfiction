it always bugged me how Voldemort doesn't really have a purpose beyond killing everyone and forcing the world to bow before him. Can we get a fic where Voldemort has actualy goals and reasons for what he does beyond "dads a dick and mums a bitch so I'll make the world burn". Give him motivation, a target, a belief and a vision for the future. You can't tell me someone as smart as Tom Riddle didn't realise the world wasn't going to work if he killed everyone in it.


** Dude...

Voldemort did have motivation and it was not killing everyone. You didn't see him going about mass murdering muggles.

He wanted to be the most powerful wizard ever. Greater than Dumbledore. Go where anyone had never dated to go before. Erase his ties to his muggle father. Understand why his mother didn't save herself, even when she was a witch. Not just have HP dead, but be he the one who did it. He wanted to prove that he, and only he, was the most powerful wizard there was. Above all, Voldemort had a pathological fear of death.

He couldn't deal with the fact his mother had died instead of lived to take care of him. So, he decided he was not going to accept death himself. That's what brings about the whole Horcrux stuff. That's what makes him a perfect foil of Harry. Voldemort reluctance to accept death. And if you're looking for personality, that's ENTJ.

*** His fear of death was also a huge factor.

** Kind of reminds me of Emporer Palpatine. He wanted to control the galaxy, but we don't really know why, other than he wanted power over people.

*** It's kind of implied that the irresistible urge of seeking power was a consequence of going to the dark side, but I honestly never actually understood how the whole Dark Side of the Force works. Then again I never really went deep in the Star Wars lore.

** Maybe not exactly what you were looking for but in this one Voldemort main goal is kind of just to be the best and part of the elite (and prevent nuclear war) and the Dark Lord thing was actually mostly to take his mind off how scared he is of nuclear war.

** Most evil people in the real world have some fairly petty motives.

*** For our perspective, maybe. But it's tricky to say for sure because we have to take in consideration many factors that we may not have access, such as psychiatric anomalies, cultural norms obeyed at the time, belief-systems the person ascribed to, what preceded the so called reason (was it the drop that broke the camels back or something sudden), the person's relevant previous experiences...

For example, when I was a kid I thought that Aristotle's was an idiot because his theories about the ether and about the elements being the basis for life is wrong. It was only later that I stopped to think that considering the low-level of technology he had at the time and what was believed at the time the fact that some of his theories (like the idea of objects moving because they wanted to be in a given place) were even close to reality was already a pretty big feat.
