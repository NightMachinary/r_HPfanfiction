  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** A damn shame that it seems to be discontinued. Although the Merlin arc is complete and could be its own story, and it's magnificently written. Fem!Harry could discourage some people from reading it, but I guarantee you that it's a great fic. Mainly because it's not about Harry (Jasmine, in this case), but the people around her.

** Wow, I'm posting this link a lot today. This is the fourth time for a different reason: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]]

Also, Merlin ‘does' exist in this story too, as well as ‘morgana' but I don't know of it counts, MoR divergent fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755550/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-cryptographic-key]]

And ‘merlin' and ‘morgana' also exist here, trying not to spoil anything: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10851278/1/Nobody-told-Me-the-rules]]
