Hi. Exactly what's in the title. Everything about ministry of magic conspiracies, or even the particularly good plots of a well done evil!Dumbledore, though it's better for a conspiracy if it's led by a group rather than one person...

Something about the kids uncovering the plot of a very dangerous organisation. Crack welcome.


** I've written "The Dark Lord Never died", an AU where Lucius Malfoy fakes Voldemort's survival after Halloween 1981, and takes over Britain in the Dark Lord's name - but he has no intention to share his power should the Dark Lord actually return. Or share it with anyone else in Britain, and is plotting to ensure that no one can topple him. Dumbledore has fled to France with the "Blood traitors", but he plots to use Voldemort's return to destroy both.

Hermione's an investigator in Malfoy's new Britain and stumbles upon a conspiracy while hunting down a traitor in the Ministry. Ron's a spy for Dumbledore - in Britain. Harry's hunting Horcruxes. And Snape's a triple-agent.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Did you ever wonder why Death Eaters prefer to throw stunners at purebloods and more dangerous and deadly ones at half-bloods and muggle born? Why do Aurors only use non lethal curses even when faced with lethal ones? - Harry finds out. Chap 28 up! H/HR

** There is the one where everyone is all bound up by oaths to the MoM, and Dumbledore circumvents his to warn Harry by writing a book by an "anonymous author" and dropping it near Hermione. Cant remember the name though.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.
