  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person at the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG

  Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire but no one could have foreseen that written on that same slip of paper was Draco Malfoy. Resented by their houses and forced to participate in the Triwizard Tournament together, the two once rivals form a grudging alliance in their struggle to survive the trials ahead. Rated MA.

  5th Year AU - "There are those who believe that we should obey the 10 Commandments. But as our names suggest, Mr. Potter, Ms. Greengrass, we decide to follow an 11th commandment: Thou Shalt Not Speak. You have piqued our interest. We will be watching." The Dementors weren't the only ones to show up that day. NOTE: This story is not about religion or religious circumstances.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.
