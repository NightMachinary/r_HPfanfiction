Thanks!


** I forevar will find it amazing that in over a million fanfics, some of the most obvious ideas still haven't been done in favour of the 98123rd edition of Harry saves the universe, defeats the evil Weasleys and bangs every woman with no exceptions.

** That sounds like /The Seventh Horcrux/ by MelindaLeo. If I remember correctly, this is the one that people thought was a leaked copy of DH.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

** I requested something like this back in the summer but no one had any suggestions. :( I couldn't find any either. The closest I came to it was a story where Hermione left the tent with Ron and couldn't get back then Harry saves Ginny from Hogwarts soon after and they continue the Horcruxe hunt on their own. I can't remember the name of that story though Edit: I hope someone takes this idea and writes something like this soon. I always thought it could be at the wedding when Hermione and Ron are trying to grab Harry to apparate, he sees Ginny about to be cursed across the room and he either jumps in front of it or pulls her out of the way. Then Hermione grabs him and to apparate away unknowingly taking Ginny with them.

Me too. I might write one then over Christmas with this as how it starts. She's still 16 so it's illogical to bring her along. I'll follow canon.

*** That would be *Unintended Consequences*, linkffn(6365342). I find several plot points implausible in that story though.

Another one would be *Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum*, linkffn(8286141). This story is better, but mostly about Harry's actions.

  When Ron stormed out of the tent, Hermione went after him to stop him and disapparated with him. What will happen following this small change to DH ? What will Harry do without his friends?

  When Ron and Harry got into their fight while out hunting Horcruxes, Hermione ran after Ron leading to some unintended consequences. Even with the best of intentions, things can still go wrong.
