  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Hagrid wins a dragon egg...only what is inside is no dragon. Harry is the first to make eye contact with the creature inside...and ends up with a most unusual familiar. Watch out Hogwarts...things are about to get prehistoric!

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** The Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862).

Harry becomes a cat Animagus at the ripe old age of 5 and runs away from the Dursleys. He ends up getting adopted by the Granger family and gets an early introduction into the Wizarding World when Albus realizes he's better off not playing at manipulating people.

Basically everyone gets a power and competence boost, including the villains.

Fair warning for kid-politicians, but it's one of the few stories that's good even with that trope.

Taking Control: linkffn(2954601)

Harry becomes an Animagus under some post-mortem training from Sirius (via dreams) after Harry's 5th year. There's a completed sequel on SIYE somewhere if I remember it right, the sequel on FFN is incomplete.

The Refiner's Fire: linksiye(8104).

Harry gets a /massive/ power boost from surviving a magical disease. It's easier to say which form he /can't/ take in this one. Written pre-HBP, so keep that in mind.

Harry Mewter: linkffn(4826372)

Harry's Animagus form is a Legendary Pokémon. That is all.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.
