:END:
Hey Guys

I am looking for some Stories that break from the class "harry goes through hogwards" idea that most authors pursue

i would love for the Stories to have some Epic magics that are different from the normal "Avada Kedavra to win your day" trope. or if it is mostly with "classic" Magics than a unique setting where harry is thrown in a situation where he has to use wards/runes/arithmancy/elemental magic/... to get himself to safety

Here are some Fanfic that would fit into what i am looking for:

linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe)

linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure by jbern)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee)

linkffn(The Life He Leads By GeneralStarfox)

And the newest one of the list and in my oppinion the one with the most potential:

linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries By Mr.Omega573)

​

Would really love to read other fics like these but they are damn hard to find imho

​

Kudos!

** It's not there yet, but in about 5-6 chapters I'll be moving in a mythological direction. The Arcanist was a big inspiration for me.

Less specific exploration of magic and more violence than The Arcanist, but foreign travels and it moves AU pretty heavily after 1st year (currently in 3rd).

  A Death Eater finds Harry two years before he leaves for Hogwarts, and that assassination attempt sets Harry on a course that will shake the Wizarding World to its foundations. Pulled in two directions by opposing sides, Harry must decide which path to walk. Super!Harry (eventually), pairing still undecided.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.
