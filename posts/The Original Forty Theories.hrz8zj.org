Thanks to some information from JKR and other fans' articles, we have an (almost) complete list of the 40 students in Harry's year.

*Gryffindor*

1.  Lavender Brown (Pureblood)
2.  Seamus Finnigan (Halfblood)
3.  Hermione Granger (Muggleborn)
4.  Neville Longbottom (Pureblood)
5.  Lily Moon (Muggleborn, Halfblood, or Pureblood; became Lily Evans and Luna Lovegood)
6.  Parvati Patil (Halfblood or Pureblood; Pansy knows her so she can't be Muggleborn)
7.  Harry Potter (Halfblood)
8.  Sophie Roper (Muggleborn, Halfblood, or Pureblood)
9.  Dean Thomas (Muggleborn; actually Halfblood)
10. Ronald Weasley (Pureblood)

*Hufflepuff*

1.  Hannah Abbott (Muggleborn; became Pureblood; then split the difference into Halfblood)
2.  Susan Bones (Halfblood)
3.  Michael Corner (Halfblood; became Ravenclaw)
4.  Justin Finch-Fletchley (Muggleborn)
5.  Anthony Goldstein (Halfblood; became Ravenclaw)
6.  Wayne Hopkins (Halfblood)
7.  Megan Jones (Halfblood)
8.  Ernest Macmillan (Pureblood)
9.  Sally-Anne Perks (Muggleborn or Pureblood)
10. Georgina Smith (Muggleborn or Pureblood; became Zacharias, so likely Pureblood)

*Ravenclaw*

1.  Terry Boot (Muggleborn; at Hogwarts 7th year, so became Halfblood)
2.  Mandy Brocklehurst (Halfblood)
3.  Stephen Cornfoot (Pureblood)
4.  Kevin Entwhistle (Muggleborn)
5.  Sue Li (Halfblood)
6.  Morag MacDougal (Muggleborn, Halfblood, or Pureblood)
7.  Roger Malone (Halfblood or Pureblood; became Roger Davies)
8.  Padma Patil (Halfblood or Pureblood)
9.  Oliver Rivers (Halfblood or Pureblood; became Oliver Wood)
10. Lisa Turpin (Muggleborn, Halfblood, or Pureblood)

*Slytherin*

1.  Millicent Bulstrode (Halfblood)
2.  Vincent Crabbe (Pureblood)
3.  Tracey Davis (Halfblood)
4.  Gregory Goyle (Pureblood)
5.  Daphne Greengrass (Pureblood; her original first name, Queenie, was used for Queenie Goldstein)
6.  Draco Malfoy (Pureblood)
7.  Theodore Nott (Halfblood or Pureblood; most likely Pureblood)
8.  Pansy Parkinson (Halfblood or Pureblood; most likely Pureblood)
9.  A. Runcorn (Halfblood or Pureblood; became Albert Runcorn, but the student would have been female)
10. Blaise Zabini (Halfblood or Pureblood)

Any theories on the unknowns? For example, Sally-Anne Perks was probably the extra Muggleborn in Hufflepuff (there's 3 in every House except Slytherin). I think she dropped out of Hogwarts after CoS and that's why she wasn't mentioned in OotP.

/Note: If anyone haunts the main sub, yes I posted it there as well. I forgot just how much of a stickler they are for 'but JKR said!' and how well they get off-topic./


** Aaaand once again I'm here to actually answer the question instead of argue logistics when we all know the majority of JKR's world-building is illogical and inconsistent. Plus the Original 40 and their potential as characters is one of my favorite topics.

(Also, to that one user who feels the need to drag in an argument from another post... That's poor conduct and bad taste.)

So, some of my theories:

- There /are/ only 40 people in Harry's year. If there were more, we would have heard more about them. Plus the teachers/staff wouldn't be able to sustain more students.
- Tension from the on-coming war started in the early seventies. While Harry's year is one of the smallest (I imagine Ginny's year even smaller), the others aren't much bigger until 1983, when there's a baby-boom.
- Hogwarts is the main school, but there are two other schools in the UK which draw a relatively large percentage of students plus some other, smaller schools. A lot of Harry's classmates begin attending these after the events of CoS, so by the time of OotP, there's only ~30 in his year.
- Gryffindor has the highest percentage of purebloods after Slytherin, although Ravenclaw isn't far behind.
- Tracey Davis was bullied for being a halfblood and dropped out of Hogwarts. Millicent was also bullied, though to a lesser degree; her family name helped protect her.
- Blaise Zabini doesn't know the identity of his father. He could be a halfblood or a pureblood. No one dares to ask him for fear of his mother's reputation.
- ETA: Dean Thomas' father was a wizard who left Dean's mother to protect her and never knew about him.

** See this list to me is redundant. A couple of these people never even made it in the books or they are placed in different years and different houses. Sue Li became Cho Chang, Oliver Wood became a couple years older, Luna became a younger Ravenclaw. BUT!!!! It's quite a possibility that a couple of them transferred to another school or were essentially homeschooled when Voldemort started gaining more power once again.

Tracy Davis is a prime example for this because of her Halfblood status, but others such as Susan Bones had people in her family go missing and die because of their stance against Tom Riddle during the First Wizarding War. So it's quite possible that homeschooling was a prime candidate for this situation. Can you imagine Molly trying to teach Ron anything at home? Yeshhhh

Uh, no. Some of these names don't even appear in the books. JK Rowling has stated that this is not a complete list of students in Harry's year, but rather a list of names she could pull from whenever she needed a new character.

***** It's /supplemental/ canon, like the Black family tree, and a good basis for writing fanfiction. Which is the point of this sub, as I hope you know.

Anyway, this is off-topic from the original question.

A headcanon is composed of ones beliefs about canon that aren't confirmed by canon. People use their headcanons in order to supplement canon where canon is lacking.

  While I imagined that there would be considerably more than forty students in each year at Hogwarts, I thought that it would be useful to know a proportion of Harry's classmates, and to have names at my fingertips when action was taking place around the school.

********** You were talking about rejecting Canon, my comment was that you cant by nature of the word reject Canon.

As for the term Headcanon it is pretty much universally(like you can literally just google the term) accepted as individual interpretation of lore in a way that makes sense to you.

By its nature you cant intentionally contradict canon through this because it would automatically stop making sense as an interpretation of the story.
