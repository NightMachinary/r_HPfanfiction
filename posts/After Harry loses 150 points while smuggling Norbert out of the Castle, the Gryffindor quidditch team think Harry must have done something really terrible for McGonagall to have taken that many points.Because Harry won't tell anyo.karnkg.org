Only for something to go wrong with the truth potion and the Gryffindor quidditch team end up finding out about Harry's home life. Harry doesn't forgive them immediately and he only stays on the team because when he tries to leave the team McGonagall who is already in a bad mood with him says she if he leaves the team he will have to hand over his broom because the exemption that allows him to have a broom as a first year is only applicable if he is on the quidditch team and if harry leaves the team the exemption is no longer valid.(Harry doesn't tell her about the truth potion incident because his trust in her and adults in general is at a all time low).

Edit: mabye I have to be a bit more blunt.

Harry's trust in adults in general being at a all time means he is not going to suddenly run off and tell any of adults about the Gryffindor quiddich team interrogating him under truth potion.

Nor would they be dumb enough to out themselves to adults. Harry is already going to be distrustful enough of them as it is without them immediately running off to spilling his secrets and if they did Harry would probably never forgive them. It would be like when Hermiones ran to Mcgonnagall about the Firebolt in third year but worse. If they did immediately run off and spill Harry's secrets I doubt even the threat of losing his broom would be enough to keep him on the team.

The whole idea of him not being about to leave the team if he wants to keep his broom was to force him to interact with them, because if Harry left the team he would just cut them out of his life completely and if he does that there is no story.


** "You should talk to her," Hermione spoke softly to his right. He caught her sneak more pieces of cut pineapple onto his plate. He didn't protest it, he had just accepted that it was something his friend did.

"No." He shook his head, fist gripping his fork, "no, She'll just brush it off or get mad or something else. I don't know. Nothing ever goes as planned."

He was actively avoiding looking to his left. He could feel the states from his teammates. Their whispers always seemed so deafening lately, probably because he knew what they were about. They had started to treat him differently too. It's as if overnight he had turned to glass. It made his jaw clench.

"I'm sure Professor Mcgonagall will help you. She's a teacher! She has to believe you!" His friend squeaked out. He frowned thinking about the times he did tell a teacher. The pitying looks that turned to disgust after speaking with Vernon would forever be seated into his mind.

Ron chose that moment to loudly slam his bag down on the table across from them. He looked tired and fed up. Randomly grabbing spoonfuls of food, Ron harshly whispered across the food. "George and Fred are going to be sending a letter to Mom after classes. They are going to risk getting in trouble." He leaned back and stuffed a spoon in his mouth only to spit the food back onto his plate. He looked down with a scrunched face to see he accidentally served himself mushrooms. Spitting his tongue out, he grabbed some bacon slices.

Across the table, Harry's breath picked up. Instantly the room became unbearably loud and a ringing had started to fill his head. His chest tighten and his vision became warped and blurry. By the time he stood up to leave, tears were starting to drip onto his collar. The first steps caused him to stumble, his legs felt numb.amd his body felt to far away to properly control. At some point Hermione attached herself to his side and led him out the hallway. He didn't realize he was no longer in the Great Hall until he felt two heavy hands push against his shoulders.

Katie was pushing him against the wall and downwards into a sitting position. She didn't say anything just pushed his head down to his knees while drawing light swirls on his back. He wasn't sure how long he was stayed in that position. When the ringing faded and he was able to pull his head up, he noticed there were more people are him. McGonagall and Pomphrey were talking to Katie. He couldn't focus on the words, they didn't process in his mind.

Hermione was crouched next to him tapping light rythms on the back of his hand. She wasn't talking to him or anyone else. Neither was Rin who was standing behind her glaring at his brothers. Those two were taking turns explaining something to McGonagall. When Harry thought back he would realize that they were describing the truth potion event.

"It'll be okay," Katie softly told him. "I've been talking with my Dad. He works as an Attorney and charges have been brought against them. It'll be okay, just give it time."

If it wasn't to your taste that's fair enough - but if you specifically wanted strictly Canon that's something to add to your prompt.

For example, if you'd posted along the lines of "I didn't personally like the way you took this as I prefer canon boundaries on the Dursley's behaviour, but I appreciate you taking the time to respond to the prompt." that's a hugely different ball game to "it's cringey and overdone"

********** Call0013 is right. What the Dursleys did was morally reprehensible but not illegal. They fed him (just not the good food), they gave him a place to sleep (yeah, I know its a cupboard, but it was technically save and warm) and let him go to school. For the laws of the 80ies this would have been enough. And OP had written about first year. The frying pan incident didn't happen at this point. Also didn't they outright starve him or tried to hinder his education. What they did was awful, but obeying the law sadly isn't the same as doing the right thing and they didn't cross that line until CoS. Also, they only cross the line one time later when Vernon tried to choke Harry in Book 5. Everything else is, as sad as it is, not illegal.

** I actually think a bit of a modification on this prompt could make it into a very funny story, maybe suited to an older Harry but it could work with a devious! Or- whatever other trait you want to throw an exclamation mark after-Harry.

Harry sat there in the Gryffindor locker rooms feeling a mixture of complete betrayal and terror. These people were supposed to be his /teammates/ what sort of team used a sticking charm to glue their seekers butt to a locker room bench before forcefully drugging them with truth potion?

“Clearly a team out their bloody minds” Harry hissed under his breath as the gathered group stepped back, obviously worried that the boy who lived had other tricks to make the process obsolete-such as hurling the entirety of his stomach contents up.

Alas it was not the case, Harry was feeling no worse off after having his mouth forcefully gripped open and 3 drops of what apparently was an extremely potent truth drug dribbled down his throat, assisted by a spell to ensure it went down the right way. That said, Harry wasn't exactly feeling the urge to spill the reason Gryffindor was down 150 points either...

“Harry.” Oliver Wood, looking much more intimidating and shadowed under the light of a single lumos, spoke up.

“Are you going to answer truthfully?” The Scot asked, voice a harsh whisper that the younger had never heard him use. It was unnerving but Harry's terror and the possibility of being drugged had now been replaced by fury at the attempt as for whatever reason, it had not worked. For a moment Harry thought about spitting in his face and calling him every swear under the sun, regardless if he stayed on the team or not. However that hidden Slytherin side the sorting hat had talked about made a sudden emergence and instead of anger, Harry attempted to make his voice sound forced but clear.

“Yes”

The team looked between themselves, clearly nervous now that they had the boy in their hands. Oliver gulped and licked his lips before inhaling deeply and plowing into the million dollar question.

“What did you do that caused Gryffindor to lose 150 points in a single night?” He asked. The first time this question had been asked it had been in suppressed rage, Oliver had been shaking as he stared down at Harry sitting in the common room, the flame of the fire reflecting off furious eyes. Now it was nervous as the clear length they had had to go to seemed to have made the captain nervous about the true answer. But he wanted an answer.

So an answer he would get.

Shifting his face into what was hopefully a sincere look of resignation Harry took a deep breath before giving his explanation.

“Sex. I got caught having Sex.”

A heavy silence fell over the room as the team looked at each in utter disbelief. Oliver just stared at him for a few seconds, mouth moving but no sound emerging, finally he shakily stepped forward before getting down on his knees a gripping the bench either side of Harry with a whit knuckled grip.

“Y-you're having-you're /eleven Harry/ ” he almost wheezed as if physically hurt.

Similar looks of disappointment and pity were being aimed at him from the rest of the barely lit crowd but Harry ignored them in favour os staring straight at his captain.

“I know but I'm good at it, my cousin Dudley says I've got an arse built to fuck.” He said without any difference in tone.

3 things happened.

Oliver lost his grip on the bench and fell on his arse, eyes wide and mouth agape, Katie Bell fainted, no one physically aware enough to grab her and Fred Weasley slammed into the nearest cubicle to throw up loudly.

Oliver, looking like he might cry just shook his head.

“Harry, oh Merlin Harry no-”

“So i thought, I can use this, and i did...” Harry continued softly, before leaning forward as much as he could to get into Oliver's face.

“Oliver-I've been shagging the Slytherin Quidditch team. I've had all of them inside me Oliver: Higgins, Pucey, Warrington, /Malfoy/ ” he listed almost airily before letting his eyes widen, trying to stare impossibly deeper into Olivers now wet eyes.

“And Flint Ollie, I've had him inside me-I've seen the way you look at him on the pitch, how does it feel knowing that his dicks been inside an eleven year old boy-”

Harry didn't get a chance to continue as Oliver turned and vomited on the tiles at the same moment George Weasley lost his own lunch, Angela started crying and Alicia just covered her mouth with her hands, horror etched all over her face.

“They agreed to let us win Ollie, I just had to give them my arse, isn't that what you wanted Ollie? To win?” Harry continued As Oliver began to sob into the floor on shaking hands, a cruel smile made it's way to raven haired boy's face despite how his nose was badly protesting the smell of vomit.

It was at that moment that Harry discovered the sticking charm had worn off and he shakily got up, the thrill of revenge running through him. But he did have a sense of justice and decided this had gone on long enough.

“Well that was fun!” He laughed lapping his hands together loudly, drawing the attention of whoever wasn't mentally broken to him.

“So how did I do? Did you believe me?” He smiled brightly.

The wailing and sobbing began to die down into distraught confusion. Harry just looked over his team as innocently as possible.

“What? I thought we were playing pretend?-the fake truth potion enhances it doesn't it? Like um-method acting!”

Utter silence penetrated the room until finally, Oliver, with a red, tear streaked face spoke in a shaky voice.

“What's my name Harry?”

Harry just smiled down at him.

“Massive twat.”

** Harry stiffened as a shadow fell over him. It was Dumbledore, had to be. He'd...had he told them about the dragon? Was Hagrid in trouble? ‘Mr. Potter,' Dumbledore said, and it sounded as if he was pronouncing his doom; he'd be expelled, along with Hermione, and if he got on the train without being horrifically murdered by either Hermione or most of Gryffindor for the points that would surely be deducted - because of course a dragon was worse then the original event -, he'd have to live with the Dursley's. They would lock him into his cupboard for god knows how long for daring to come back early and getting himself expelled. And what would become of his friends? He hadn't told them about how Ron would've joined in had he not been bitten, had he? He winced. He probably had. ‘- come with me, Mr. Potter. Minerva?'

‘I'll be right behind you,' he heard McGonagall say. He felt rather numb all of a sudden, as he followed Dumbledore. So this was it, then. He was well and truly done for. ‘Do you remember what happened, Harry?'

Dumbledore asked casually, as they made their way upstairs. Harry shook his head. Whether Dumbledore saw it or not, he continued, detailing how his team had gotten ‘rather curious' about the loss of points. How they didn't teach truth serums here for a /reason/. How one of them had gotten a dodgy recipe, and how they had brewed it in secret. ‘In spite of their natural talents with Potions, something went wrong. This amnesia is one side effect,' Dumbledore explained. The other factor was that they were not precise enough in their questions. Harry's heart sank.

‘And rather unfortunately they had decided to conduct this... interrogation, in the Gryffindor Tower,' McGonagall told him, rather briskly and helping him keep up - he wasn't being particularly slow, just reluctant and unable to keep up with the adults' larger strides -. ‘So everyone heard of your... unfortunate home life.'

** People finding out about Harry's home life is god thing in the long run for Harry. People can finally see what Dumbledore actions did to Harry all those years and Harry can live somewhere else. If Harry is safe enough to go to the Weasleys for weeks in the summer after second and third year and be around Diagon alley before third year then the blood protection at the Dusleys doesn't really matter that much.

*** "Dumbledore's actions" are what ensured Harry is alive and relatively well. Yes, sadly at the cost of being mistreated. Which I am sure is a whole lot better than what Bellatrix Lastrange and her cohorts would have done to ANYONE who housed Harry and they could have gotten their hands on. Dumbledore didn't leave Harry there because he wanted him mistreated - it was literally the only place safe for him where he could have something even approaching a normal life.

**** if Dumbledore really wanted too he could have made sure Harry was treated right by the Dursleys he just chose not to, he abandoned Harry on a doorstep with a letter and then didn't bother with him for 10 years, it would have served him right if Harry hated Muggles and went down the same path Tom Riddle did.

A normal life for Harry would be growing up with magic not Muggles, i disagree with the fact that Harry needed to be at the Durleys to remain safe. I still don't know a valid reason why was he made to go back to the Dursleys every year. Every year he was allowed to spend summers at the Weasley house where the Dursley house protections didn't exist, he even went before sixth year when Voldemort was back and in the open.

***** It could be fanon but didn't Harry have to spend a certain amount of time living with his blood relatives for the protections to remain? He couldn't just live with Andromeda or the Weasleys full-time or else the protections / wards / whatever Dumbledore did would fade away and both Harry and whoever he was living with would be vulnerable.

****** The blood protection excuse for Harry having to go back doesn't make sense it only ever worked at the Dursleys so every time Harry was at the Weasley house , Diagon alley, Hogsmeade, or even at the world cup he was vulnerable to Death eaters or anyone else who wanted to attack him. Like I said there isn't a valid reason to send him back there every year when he is allowed to other places where he can be attacked at any time.

Lily protection and the Dursley house protection are two different things, Lily's protected him from only Voldemort and the Dursley house protected him only protected when he was inside the house. He was even attacked by Dementors close to the house.

The Durlseys are scared that wizards were watching them and gave harry his own bedroom after the letter came , Harry didn't need to be abandoned by the entire wizarding world Hagrid, Mcgonagall, Dumbledore even Diggle the wizard who Harry met at a shop could have all visited if they really wanted to but they abandoned him for ten years
