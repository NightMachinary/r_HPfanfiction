basically a H/Hr fic that is lengthy(preferably a word count of over 70k), has good-great and preferably canon story. but contains a boat load of smut and a bit over the top lemons. don't care much of the romance only be it fluff-based and believe(if not close enough)

Edit: i apologize for not wording my preferences properly and clearly, what i mean by "canon" is that the story still retains the same plot of the novels for the most part meaning no AUs or scenarios where it significantly changes the outcome of the original story. and as for the lemons, well they don't have to be over the top just as long as theres plenty.


** According to my husband, who reads Harmony, what you're looking for does not exist.

** I had this down in my smut folder but I'm not sure if there's enough plot for it to qualify. It is driven by Harmony but ends up more Harem-y.

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

** I don't want to be Deputy Downer but 'preferably canon story' is incompatible with 'H/Hr'. 'Over the top lemons' and 'believable' aren't on speaking terms but have been known to occupy the same story at different times.

Aside from that, take a look at this: linkffn(Harry potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents)
