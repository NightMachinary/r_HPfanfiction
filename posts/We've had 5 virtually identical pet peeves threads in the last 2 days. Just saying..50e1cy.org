** I guess the big question is, have we run out of pet peeves already? Have our Peeve Cores been emptied, leading to Peeve Exhaustion? Have we Sworn on our Peeves one time too many? Have we been manipulated into having these peeves, or are they independent peeves?

Peeved minds want to know.

** Honestly I feel like that is pretty typical around here as of late. I use to visit this subreddit every day, now I visit maybe once a week. The same 5 or 6 stories are recommended, every post is either a pet peeve thread or a slight alteration to a story request thread in the hopes that something other then the same 5 or 6 stories will be recommended. I rarely find anything new that is good, which includes from here or just browsing the random sites.

It's all so toxic as well, the fandom is slowly dieing, and while I had my issues with Cursed Child I was also really excited for it. More material to inspire writers, new thoughts, rules, and insights into the universe. I should have known better though, instead of rejoicing new material people toss it to the ground and proclaim it not real. Same thing happens every time something comes out on pottermore, fun backstory for Harry's Grandparents? Nope the community calls it trash and ignores it. Umbridge invents the Blood Quill? Well we don't like her and were going to ignore this. New school system in America? Let's just not even bother.

It's really a turn off of this community, that we would rather bitch and moan about minor grammer issues then embrace giant swathes of new material. Yet I am still hopeful for the new movies, though I am sure I will log on here and just see three more pet peeve threads and a thread about how the new movies are garbage and not part of the actual story.

*** Pottermore has allowed for the addition of great details to the HP world. I'm sad to see that people bemoan some of the new content instead of take advantage of it. This is JK's world. I'm sure she'd love to be able to please all of her loyal fans, but at the end of the day canon is her brain child and fanfiction is our sandbox. Ah, If wishes were unicorns, and we all got our wish, we'd be knee deep in unicorn shit!

Unicorns aside... While I might have not been a fan of CC's plot, I did enjoy the adapted script for what it was. I mean it took seven books to tell Harry's story. That was seven books worth of world building, character development, and plot. CC was a play, limited to the medium. I'm surprised the Cursed Child was able to do what it did in terms of character development for Draco and Harry's sons in the first place. Would I have liked to have seen a few books that developed the plot and characters more carefully and fully? Yes please! However, it was not JK's wish to do so.

I'm looking forward to fics that develop the wizarding culture in other parts of the world. Hopefully there will be some Ilvermorny based fics soon. I'm also intrigued by the concepts of Mahoutokoro and Uagadou. While I expect most authors to insert a cannon based character into the mix, I will be keeping an eye out for ones where the author makes the content their own.

*** I like this idea. We can assign a number to each peeve, say,

1. Magical cores
2. Manipulative!Dumbledore
3. Suave!Draco
4. Snape romance with a student

etc., and then, whenever someone posts a peeves thread, we can just reference them. For example,

*Topic: When reading a fic, what sorts of things make you want to scoop out your eyes with a rusty spoon?**

#+begin_example
  Redditor A: 34! Definitely 34.
     Redditor B: Seconding 34. Especially in combination with 6.
        Redditor C: Hey, 6 is totally canon!

*** I get the joke, but for the record I'm the opposite. Unless you're really diving into his back story or something, he's kind of a terrible character and people almost always use him poorly because of it.

He was a joke in the first book, imo, never correctly executes, who hung around too long. Much like his life story.

All the fanfiction subreddits that I've been subscribed to have less recommendations and more discussion and requests as they get more subscribers. Most of the latter are the same topics reposted over and over and over again, and I don't really know why that is.
