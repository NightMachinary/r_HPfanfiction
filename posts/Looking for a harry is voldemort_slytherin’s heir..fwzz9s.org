Looking for a harry is voldemort/slytherin's heir. And is dating daphne or will in the future. The daphne bit isn't necessary it would just be extra points. Thanks!


** I remember one where Voldemort came back and started off of a clean slate due to some law passed because of a necromancer that past souls crimes don't count if the soul managed to get a body or something

He then took on the mantle of Lord Slytherin and adopted Harry and made him his heir because the only requirement was to have the parseltongue ability.

I can't remember the name or find it
