Bonus points if someone actually finds a fic where Harry willingly changes genders, no metamorphagus shenanigans.


** linkffn(11396276; 4606270; 11862560)

To Reach Without is the best written and most serious of these. Unfortunately its main focus is angst/armchair psychology and the gender change is largely ignored in favour of working through overblown Dursley-related emotional issues, something which could have been done equally in a male Harry fic. It also introduces concepts which rob the genre of some of its most interesting elements: for example, the author introduces the idea that the wizarding world does not have any nudity taboo, removing the dilemma over whether it's okay for newly fem!Harry to occupy women-only spaces (e.g. dorms, changing rooms), and how the women (and Harry) will feel about that.

Effects and After Effects is an angst-filled slog filled with loads of indy!Harry tropes besides (plus Muggle wank). But you can skim through 95% of the fic to just read the genderbender parts.

Chosen One Has Knockers is crackish smut but is enjoyable for its lack of angst.

  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

** There is "Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool", which is a fem!Harry x Tonks fic I remember to be enjoyable (despite my usual dislike of first-person POV) linkffn(8175132)

Also has Harry as a teacher, which is interesting. The whole thing is... out there, but entertaining.

I think there isn't much good around in regards to this premise (after what Taure already posted), so if you're interested, here are some links to Google Docs of my own /mediocre/ attempts at the genre to blunt the edge. They're all unedited, first sketch, so be prepared for that, if you decide to click.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbSh1Y2n_3g_xIIG32VkWvNgKssKGLfIDWgQNhR8qsE/edit?usp=sharing][Virgo Potter]] (Harry is trans, changes voluntarily), [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9RJLmXcPJx7iJc4hbmFBJgTY_aOum0rjJgIOiwEFwg/edit?usp=sharing][A Witch's Problem]] (involuntary, but Harry copes quickly), [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBAaNj5RWAp0-85l1c6VzyjAUDrU8rLbjE7GcvFhfGU/edit?usp=sharing][Old Worlds, Modern Souls]] (Harry is reborn in medieval times in the body of a many-times great-aunt, Alrun. Has the sex-swap element in there, but isn't really focused on - so much so that I had considered to eliminate it completely.)

I honestly don't know. I kinda lack a plot... as you may have noticed. I literally just wrote scenes concerned with the premise of the genderswap, but haven't really thought about any plotline to go with it.

EDIT: Oh shit, I didn't see "no metamorphamagus". Well, in SoP-DoB, Harry's a meta, but isn't like Tonks with free range, its only always a full transition, and the fic is divided by his transformation, "first" book is Harry, "second" book is Melania. Its quite good though, if you can stomach the idea of a meta Harry.
