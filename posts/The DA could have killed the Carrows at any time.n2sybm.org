I'm certainly not the first to realize this but: it's incredibly easy to kill someone with magic.

The Carrows decided it would be a good idea to take on an entire school of magic users with the paper shield of... what exactly?

(This should all be prefaced by the knowledge that the professors- read: adults- should have long since gotten rid of the Carrows and Snape. And locked down the school full stop. There's no way /former dueling champion/ Flitwick and certified badass Minerva McGonagall couldn't flatten the likes of the Carrows with one arm tied behind their back. Especially since we get a hint that McGonagall could take on Snape and send him skittering.)

No matter what way you look at it, there are at least a hundred (perhaps several hundred if we go by Rowling's figures) trained teenagers being taught the Dark Arts and encouraged to use them, children who are running an underground rebellion.

Which created a massive plot hole when I was writing a chapter from inside Hogwarts set during DH. I got about a third finished before realizing... why don't they just kill them?

An incomplete list of ways the DA could have killed/seriously injured the Carrows:

1.  Ambush (so many options here) the easiest might be in detention (which it seems more likely Gryffindors will be the main occupants)- *these blithering idiots give students wands and teach them torture spells**-* did it never occur to /anyone/ that these lessons might be turned against the teachers? Or barring that, a dozen stunners would take them out permanently?
2.  The House Elves: they can go anywhere, be invisible, and apparate through Hogwart's enchantments. (clearly also on the students side since they came out guns blazing at the Battle of Hogwarts). Slip some razors in their food, drop an anvil on their heads, apparate them into the middle of the Black Lake as squid food, for Merlin's sake!
3.  *There's an entire class dedicated to poison!* It's called Potions, and after that there's Herbology! It's clearly easy to break into the potions supply (if second years can pull it off)- take some aconite, belladona, monkshood, or one of the other dozen poisons. The Carrows have to eat at some point. Give them Draught of Living Death, perform a switching spell on their food/drink, the possibilities are endless.
4.  Shove them down a flight of stairs- send Tripping hexes at them when they're at the top of staircases.
5.  Make a pact with Peeves (who seems to work with the students in DH against the DE) to dump them over a bannister on the 7th floor.
6.  Have Peeves steal their wands- snap them. They're no stronger than Muggles without their wands.
7.  Use the portraits- break into their rooms and lay in wait.
8.  Have a series of 6/7th years disallusion themselves, follow them around the school and curse them
9.  Lay a trap on the third floor, stun them, tie them up, and shove them down the trap door.
10. Do #9 but drop them off in the Forbidden Forest without their wands for the: werewolves, acromantulas, or centaurs to get to.

Snape is a silent specter, far more frightening than the Carrows because he's the power behind them. But we also know that Snape isn't always at the school, and that all the other teachers are on the students side.

It's a 100+ against 2, they don't need to use hit and run tactics when they could overwhelm them by sheer numbers alone. It seems they're under a prohibition against killing students (not hurting them) so that seems like a limiting factor they should take into consideration.

Conclusion: For my own headcanon (and sanity), I've decided to write it this way: about a month in, the DA realized that if they killed (or seriously maimed) the Carrows then other, more intelligent (just as sadistic) Death Eaters could be assigned to the school. They "lucked out" by getting some of the most incompetent teachers in the Death Eater ranks. So, they keep their attacks painful but non lethal to terrify the Carrows into walking a little lighter around the castle.

When Amycus develops a twitch two months on when she hears loud noises, that's a bonus.

Lavender gets to play around with some delightful cosmetic charms to try and /improve/ Amycus's complexion.

When they manage to replace their wands with trick wands for a day, the Carrows beat a hasty retreat at the sight of several hundred armed students who'd like to paint the walls with their blood.

--------------

NB: This annoyed me, I ended up restructuring Ch.4 with this in dilemma in mind, and wrote two pages of notes trying to imagine all the non lethal ways they could make the Carrows time at Hogwarts.../uncomfortable/ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29808174][Breaking Taboo]]


** If the DA killed them though, Voldemort would just pay a visit, regain the school & kill whoever had participated. The same result if the teachers killed them. It would have failed and just gotten them killed in the process.

**** No, what you wrote and what [[/u/Lys_456]] wrote are not quite the same. [[/u/Lys_456]] wrote about Voldemort retaliating; you wrote about Carrows being replaceable.

Given that Voldemort was supposed to be a Magical Hitler, he probably wouldn't stop at killing just the perpetrators, either, but would probably do something like kill 10 students for every Death Eater killed, in addition to the culprits, since that's something the Nazi occupation forces were fond of doing.

**** So first, you need "dozens" of people capable of casting the Killing Curse, which even most Death Eaters don't regularly use.

Suppose that you found them. Great! Now, you need to set up an ambush in which they are all casting at Voldemort in synchrony and without getting in each other's way.

But, suppose, you've arranged that. Great! Now, you need Voldemort to walk right into that ambush and be caught by surprise, despite all the tools of magical detection available.

But, suppose that you've miraculously found a large number of anti-Voldemort wizards and witches, all capable of casting the Killing Curse, gotten them into a position to all cast at Voldemort at once, /and/ Voldemort somehow didn't see any of those dozens of people.

Then, Voldemort just conjures some physical shields and other obstacles (as he did in his canon duel with Dumbledore) and blocks all those attacks at once, then retaliates with some large scale spell, wipes the ambush out, and thanks you for saving him the trouble of having to track his enemies down individually.

*Edit:* Also, Voldemort isn't necessarily going to tell you in advance when and where he will be coming, and good luck organising an ambush involving dozens of people on short notice.

*** I think that a lot of the DA put their lives (at at the very least their safety/well being) on the line. Neville's a wreck when we see him, and he talks about how Michael was tortured terribly for saving a first year. It seems like they're willing to risk quite a lot to help their friends and younger students, I don't think it's a stretch that they'd be completely capable of seriously injuring teachers that are torturing them. Protecting themselves is the entire reason Harry, Ron, and Hermione created the DA.

Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurt teachers when they were in similar situations to protect themselves/friends knowing retribution would follow- they've all attacked teachers with force. And at this point in the book Harry crucio's Alecto for /spitting/ at McGonagall, it doesn't seem a big leap to conclude that the DA would want to hurt the Carrows for torturing children.

On that point I have to disagree. If McGonagall, as the caretaker for students for 9 months out of the year, see's children being tortured and doesn't do anything- that's beyond the pale.

The children shouldn't need to go begging for help from the adults. Its the adults responsibility, their /duty/ to help them if they're struggling, much less being tortured in public.

***** I did consider that dilemma when I was writing the chapter, and I know on a meta level that (along with /plot)/ is almost certainly the reason.

But after spending years in boarding school, kids are /vicious/. We had a bad Algebra teacher freshman year and multiple classes sent her crying from the room. Looking back, she wasn't a good teacher (couldn't offer help/answer a lot of questions/punished students when they provided alternate answers, etc..) but the woman had a breakdown and I've never seen a class (that didn't like each other) work so seamlessly together.

Mix teenagers who aren't fully capable of empathizing yet, and truly horrific wrongs done to them- I have no issue believing that they'd sent a tripping hex at the Carrows and knock them off a staircase. Kids are creative- the rebellion the Weasleys wrought on a much larger, more serious scale. Whether they fully would intend to kill them, or just didn't think it through... we see Harry do the same thing after Bellatrix knocks Sirius into the Veil. It's utter insanity to run after her, crucio her, but he does it. And then does something similar to Snape, but actually tries to kill him.

McGonagall was willing to put an unconscious Amycus Carrow under the *Imperius curse* just to make him /stand up, fetch his and his sister's wands and then stand next to his sister./ Imagine using an unforgivable for this instead of summoning charms and a /Mobilicorpus/.

What was she thinking? /"Yeah, I can use an unforgivable too, Potter!"?/

She could have used it to make them "visit" the acromantula colony in the Forest without their wands. There would be no proof that it wasn't an accident or stupidity on the part of the Death Eaters.

It is (unfortunately) predictable that they've allowed Hogwarts to be overtaken... and it really doesn't make sense logically.

It never should have been the students who had to deal with this problem (like you said, the full trained professors should have taken care of business). It seems bewilderingly unlikely that an entire school can be ruled by 2 incompetent (but sadistic) teachers, and Snape. Even if all the Slytherins support them 100% (which isn't likely), the established professors could have destroyed the Carrows, and I don't see why they didn't (except /plot/).

The Carrows and Snape were known evils at that point. You figure out how to deal with them. Killing them just means punishment and even worse evils coming in. Snape was sending students for detention with Hagrid, and while it sucked for everyone having him and his predictability as headmaster was a lot better than someone like Bellatrix being put in his place.

** Yeah, it's pretty fucked that all the so called good guy professors just STOOD BACK AND LET FIRST YEARS GET TORTURED. They could have all ganged up on the Carrows and Snape and secured the school, sent the students away to safe houses or some shit. But instead they just were passive as students got tortured. It's disgusting and pathetic. Fuck McGonagall and Flitwick. Not surprising though is it? These are the same doormats who just let Umbridge do whatever she wanted too. Fucking doormats. Student safety really means nothing to these people. Same with Dumbledore letting Draco run around in 6th year with all his near murdering of innocent students...and he has the gall to say to Harry's face when confronted that "I hope you aren't suggesting that I don't take my students wellbeing seriously." When he fucking knew the whole time. Harry was right, he didn't care about student safety.

And then what? Voldemort just says fuck it yall can have this one? Oh yeah setting up dozens if not hundreds of safe house for students and their families is totally realistic, anything short of the Fidelius charm was worthless against Voldemort especially when he has the full might of the ministry behind him at that point, they broke through all the Orders safe house except for like 2

**** Then they could've set up the Fidelius around Hogwarts! Seems like it got thrown around pretty willy nilly in DH anyway, with Bill and Arthur both making separate ones around their homes. There were so many other options than to stand back for an entire YEAR and let two people torture an entire school of children. Especially when they massively outnumbered and outskilled them. And it shouldn't be that damn hard to make spacious safe houses considering Newt's trunk, the magic tents of fuckery, and the Room of Requirement itself. SO MANY OPTIONS with magic, it's not even funny. They just chose to do nothing instead. They didn't even try.

That's the part that seems particularly painful to me. Neville says that they can tell the other professors hate the Carrows even though they don't say anything... /(in the strongest sense)/ *that is not enough*. That is not even the bare minimum.

***** They didn't outnumber the dementors standing at the secret passageways and probably the entrances, too.

As we know the Fidelius Charm isn't infallible. One of its flaws is that if the original SK dies, everyone in on the secret becomes a Secret Keeper. The likes of Crabbe wouldn't be afraid to kill someone and the entire house of Slytherin would be in on the secret.

** Dawlish went after Augusta Longbottom because Neville was causing problems. If the Carrows are killed, so are a lot of family members on the outside.

You're also forgetting the number of Slytherins loyal to Voldemort, who, more than likely, were the ones able to cast those torture spells.

*** Erm... that's kind of what I said in my conclusion:

#+begin_quote
  Conclusion: For my own headcanon (and sanity), I've decided to write it this way: about a month in, the DA realized that if they killed (or seriously maimed) the Carrows then other, more intelligent (just as sadistic) Death Eaters could be assigned to the school. They "lucked out" by getting some of the most incompetent teachers in the Death Eater ranks.
#+end_quote

That they were at risk if something happened to the Carrows. But in canon that's not why they stop, they stop because Neville says they can't ask people to go through the torture that Michael did. Neville is specific when he says that

#+begin_quote
  then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they'd chained up, *and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off....*‚ÄúYeah, well, *I couldn't ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts.*
#+end_quote

then

#+begin_quote
  ‚Äúwell, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave. I s'pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran.
#+end_quote

but it doesn't work:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúDawlish is still in St. Mungo's and Gran's on the run. *She sent me a letter*,‚Äù he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, ‚Äú*telling me she was proud of me, that I'm my parent's son, and to keep it up.*‚Äù
#+end_quote

It doesn't mention specifically (outside of Crabbe and Goyle) who is able to cast torture spells. I think it was more that they refused to even try. Afterall we know that Harry made a halfway decent attempt at 15, and then a successful one at 17. Like Bellatrix said, you have to mean it. I doubt any of them wanted to mean it.

** With regards to the teachers, I think they were probably under strict instructions to hold the fort until Harry was ready, and not to risk having a big battle with multiple casualties until Voldie could actually be killed. Also, they probably weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the students being terrorized but alive versus being on the run and possibly dead.

*** The moral side of that seems to be: sacrifice the health/safety of several hundred children against a possible future of Harry winning this thing.

It's all well and good (since we know it turns out ok) but none of the teachers know when/or even if Harry is going to win. It certainly seems like Voldemort has already taken over every institution in the Wizarding World. At what point do the students become acceptable losses to an uncertain future?

But, really I don't think we can be certain Dumbledore told them to do those things. None of them seem remotely "in the know" about his upcoming death/that Snape would turn "traitor." It was essential that it come as a shock for the plan to work, if they were under strict instructions it doesn't seem to make sense

** This sort of thing happened in real life plenty of times; dictators that overthrow Governments and send their people to schools to make sure the little ones are taught what they want. When students disrespect the Leader, they get punished. It is still a thing in some countries, TODAY.

No teachers can fight a government, magical or muggle. If McGonagal had tried to help Terry Boot, they would have tortured Terry worse; maybe even more children.

If you get rid of the Corrows, you'll wake up with Bellatrix teaching the next day.

It's like asking why slaves (who greatly outnumbered their "owners) didn't kill the household, because they were like 100 to 3.

Like others pointed out, a lot of those people would be fence sitters, would keep their nose down, shut up and perfectly avoid torture that way. And the DA...i don't know how many would be ready to kill anyone. I don't think it is easy to kill people.

And the teachers knew better- if they fought, they would be replaced with more Death Eaters and that would make it even worse for the students.

It is perfectly understandable why it happened the way it did. There would be no fighting against Voldemort, from that position.

Even Dumbledore, when he was alive and the ministry wasn't under Voldemort, could not get rid of Umbridge and she was torturing students under his nose.

It really is hard to fight a Ministry as a school teacher.

Your head canon that you reached IS canon.

That being said, McGonagal, Flitwick even Dumbledore were terrible teachers anyway when it came to caring about their students well being, in all the books. The Chamber incident was treated very poorly, the Tournament, the monsters in the school etc. So there is that.
