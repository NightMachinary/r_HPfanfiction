- It must be long, 80k words at least
- I don't mind if it isn't finished, but I don't really want to read anything abandoned
- I'd prefer something that takes place during the first war or before
- I like to read about family and friendship dynamics
- I like morally ambiguous characters
- My two favorite fanfics are slash, but I'm not want to read exclusively slash
- I'd prefer to read some lesser known story

Things I don't like:

- overpowered characters
- explicit sex scenes
- romance, if it is the main focus of the story

My favorites are:

- The Other Side by ChapterEight
- Words Fail by Nea Marika


** Linkffn(Delenda est by lord silvere) Its one of my favorites. Starts kinda wonky but some parts are just absolutely beautiful. Has a lot of family and friendship dynamics. It's set before the first war. Has morally ambiguous characters. I hope you give it a chance.

** I could rec some stuff to you, but honestly? Just check the HP stuff in my favorites on my fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3049623/thelegendarysupernerd][profile page]]. If you want something specific, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]. Don't let the summary stop you, it's one of my favorites. If you still don't like it after the first 3-5 chapters then don't bother, but I think it's well worth the read.

*** It's fairly well written, but not everyones cup of tea. Definitely contains morally ambiguous characters. Picks up after the first couple of chapters, worth at least a look at.

***** From my prospective it's like a Chekhov's antimatter plasma cannon.

I mean /everything/ is relevant in the future , that fiction fused my brain. But i enjoyed it , rly. I think it's mostly apreciated by transhumanist minded people.
