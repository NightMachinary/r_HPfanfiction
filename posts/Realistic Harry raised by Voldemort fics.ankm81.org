  Realistic...

  ...Harry raised by Voldemort...

Here's one:

Voldemort *raised* Harry above the tiny cot, looking into his prophesied enemy's eyes before clubbing his head in. He Apparated away a few seconds later.

** "In Death, Standby" is one of my favorites. I've read many fics with Voldemort in a parental role to Harry, but most of them have him enter Harry's life after he has already reached Hogwarts age.

You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][Lord Voldemort and the Intricate Plots]]. Similar to "In Death, Standby", it starts with Voldemort abducting Harry when he is a baby and raising him in seclusion. It also has a similar relationship dynamic of Voldemort mostly aloof and indifferent to Harry's childish antics.

  Prophecy brings nothing but ruin, and half a prophecy is even worse. Lord Voldemort is neither fool nor weakling; he vows to break away from the prophecy's accursed magic. He is ready to defeat Albus Dumbledore at his own game. After all, Harry Potter is just a boy. AU, sort of Mentor!Voldemort.

** The Darkness Within, where Voldemort doesn't kill Harry, but rather raises him as his son. It's the first book in a complete trilogy.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

It's a bit different though, cause Harry isn't really Harry, he's practically an OC by the time you reach chapter 10. I absolutely love this story though, I recommend it to every Potter head I come across.

** HPMoR does have Voldemort as a mentor for Harry but it's not exactly what people call realistic.
