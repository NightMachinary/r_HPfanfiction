Harry-Wonder Woman pairing (traditional, not the recent gal gadot but lynda carter)


** Given the standard age they are depicted at (11-17 Harry, 20-30 for Wonder Woman), at least one of their characters would be out of their cannon time period...

'course if you stick to Cannon WW is an unaging woman who fought in WW2, which makes any pairing with her kinda squcky... :P

*** DH-period 17-year-old Harry could easily be shaped with Diana, I think.

*** I'm pretty sure classically WW is like hundreds to thousands of years old by the time she leaves Themyscira the first time.

*** But that's boring, why lock Harry to being a Teen? Like add 4 years after DH and you have a 21 year old War hero Auror and a nigh ageless Amazon. Harry is still Harry as he would of gone through his own story so it isn't like he is some completely new person

** I wonder what a crossover between HP and WW would even look like. Like, canonically, how would that work? There'd prkbably be both dimension and time-travel in there. Sure it's out there somewhere; it's just not a pairing you usually think of. Thanks, OP, I'm looking this up now but I can't promise no Gal Gadot fics because she's so recent.

*** Given Diana's parents, a MoD Harry would probably work best.

** Best of luck finding it, I'd read it.

I can't even find much Harry/Supergirl.

**** Ehhh not really. My favorite is probably linkffn(2565609) chapter 127.

But it's just a cracky one shot. There really isn't much out there, at least not that I've found. The pickings are slim.

  At the end of 5th year, Remus whisks Rose Potter away to America to rest and decompress, far from the demands of wizarding Britain. In Las Vegas, she meets someone else dealing with serious personal problems: Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman. The two get drunk together, and the next morning they find that they made bad decisions while inebriated. Or maybe not so bad after all?
