so, I was looking for some new Hermione Centric Fanfiction (first published within the last 3 or 4 months), and all i could find was things I'd already read all of them, so, do you guys have any suggestions?

Bonus for stories that don't revolve around romance!

Thank You!


** There was a Hermione story that was finished not too long ago, called "Nocturnal," by Red Garden Gnome, but it centers around a Hermione/Charlie romance, yet has some good action sequences in it. Not sure if this is your cup of tea, but I liked the story a lot, and the author seems to have a good grasp at crafting an original story, along with good dialogue. Just in case you want to check it out:
