** That's an interesting site, but as a bit of a heads up, it looks like it uses a cached version of the fic you input, meaning that any fic that was published after the inception of the site (approx August, 2015) won't be recognised, and you won't be able to get any recommendations for it.

** You are an utter darling. I've only been on reddit (with an account?) for about two weeks now, so I definitely wouldn't have come across this otherwise haha. I am on [[/r/fanfiction]] though, so yay for that! Anyway, this is love. I'm the queen of loving obscure stories (somewhat), so this will just. Ugh, yes yes! Thank you much for making this!

*** I think it's a great service! Unfortunately, I'm not awesome enough to have made it, that would be [[https://fn.lc/][This person]].

**** Ugh. Now I feel like a dork for gushing when you weren't even my intended audience. :/ Haha well regardless, thank you for making this accessible!

** This got posted over on [[/r/fanfiction]] a while ago, so for those of you who have not seen it before, I've linked to the original post. [[https://fn.lc/ficrecommend/][Here's the link directly, if you'd rather]]. Basically, just put a ff.n or AO3 link in and it will suggest similar stories to you.

I've been using it for months and I really enjoy it. I thought I'd crosspost for the new folks/those not on [[/r/fanfiction]].

*** I don't know. I put a Harry/Ginny story in and one of it's recommendations was Harry Crow.
