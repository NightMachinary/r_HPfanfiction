Nothing is more important in the snake pit than politicking. Deals that would rock the school are made before first period. Alliances are forged through the cunning manipulation of the masses with misinformation during lunch. Heirs and heiresses are establishing their future success through networking and getting detailed, private information on their rivals by any means necessary.

There is no greater power in Slytherin than getting what you want while destroying your enemies.

If only the other houses understood the great game and how difficult it is to play. Of course that would never happen, because as everyone knows, what happens in the snake pit never leaves the dungeon.

Except...

Every other house DOES know, and they all think it's ridiculous. Children playing dress up as adults.

When a Slytherin thinks they're being oh so clever and asking probing questions looking for “actionable intelligence”, Ravenclaw feeds them nothing but lies, and then brags to their friends to see who created the most elaborate scheme.

When a Slytherin tries to drive to drive a wedge between two friends in order to enhance their position, Hufflepuff smiles and says “thanks for the information,” just before turning around and laughing about how the Slytherin could ever come between the two good friends.

When a Slytherin personally attacks someone with vile insults in order to get that person in trouble and thus out of their way, Gryffindor pretends to get all huffy while making more and more outlandish descriptions of reprisals, all while thinking of the story they'll get to tell their common room.

The Slytherins are the absolute masters of manipulation and politicking at Hogwarts. All you have to do is ask them and they'll be more than happy to tell you.


** This should be told from a Slytherin's POV, who, like Cassandra, can see the truth but is never believed.

“Slytherin is the laughing stock of the school! They gaslight us into believing we're super subtle!”

“Sure, Roy. Keep believing what you'd like, but leave the /real/ politicking to the smart ones. At least we can see what's actually going on.”

*** Hello, an actual autistic person here. (Asperger's if you want to split hairs.)

I'm not even offended. I'm just amazed at how dumb you are to think this is an okay thing to post.

*** Decent interpretation of the prompt. Really, really, really offensive execution. Autism is more than this. Autism is an entirely different way of perceiving the world. The way an autistic mind functions is so different from neurotypicals that so many major inventions and discoveries most likely wouldn't have come about without them.

If you want to write about Autism, go ahead. But do your research. Whether you're autistic or not, do your research, and never - *NEVER* - call /anyone/ ‘retarded', let alone autistic people. It's offensive - and so, so wrong.

***** At the end, you have, ‘God have mercy, they were a bunch of autist and inbred retards.' The sentence very much reads like you're saying that both autistics and inbred purebloods are retards, which is not true in either case. Simply being inbred is not going to result in all births being impaired children. Some will be perfectly ‘normal' or average.

Aside from that, ‘retard' is no longer the correct term for people with significantly lowered intelligence. ‘Retard' is considered offensive and politically incorrect, and the terminology has therefore been changed. The correct terms are now: ‘Developmental Disability', ‘Learning Disability', ‘Intellectual Disability'. You should not refer to anyone as retarded. If anything, they should have been referred to as ‘Slow' or ‘Special'.

I understand that your inclusion of autism came from a place of love, but it was very poorly executed. I shudder to think how your wife might feel if you showed her this little drabble. She obviously knows you and your intentions better than a bunch of strangers on the internet, but that doesn't do much to change how the piece feels for an autistic person to read.

Now, for the record, I am also autistic, so this is an autistic person telling you that what you've done, however well intentioned, was really, really offensive to me personally, and probably a lot of other people.
