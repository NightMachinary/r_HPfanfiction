/This is an idea I've had for a while and have just recently penned down a few sentences for. Appreciate any feedback and if there is any interest in reading more./

*Prologue*

The snow was falling faster now, the sky had started to darken and the wind was picking up speed. The man wading through the snow pulled his collar higher up and whispered a few words into the wind. His footsteps were slowly fading away and it got harder and harder to see more than a few meters ahead. The man looked to the world a perfectly ordinary traveller apart from an ornate metal mask peeking out from under the hood. He picked up what seemed to be a small pocket watch, pulled out a stick from under his long robes and tapped the watch twice. He swore under his breath, turned on his heel. A small crack echoed through the snow-covered valley and the man was gone.

The man appeared as if through thin air in a small clearing in a nearby forest. He had been trudging through the icy landscape for over an hour now and the clear arctic weather from this morning had at this point turned into a full force blizzard. He was close though, he could feel it in his bones. Faint traces of magic filled the air and he couldn't be far off from the observation point. He had been sent out by the Dark Lady to relieve Graham from his post. After all, one month in the Siberian tundra was more than enough for the young whippersnapper to have learnt his lesson. Never. Ever. Talk back to your those of superior office and blood status. It had been an unfortunate series of events that lead up to the promising recruit being tortured for days, his screams under the Cruciatus curse filling the small hideout. However as stallions needed to be ridden in, he knew the value of breaking down newcomers to then build them back up again. After all, had the Dark Lord not done the same to him once upon a time.

A small shimmer between the trees caught his eye and broke him out of his bittersweet reminiscing. He stopped for a second, pulled out his stick as one would pull a gun from its holster and approached slowly. A few meters ahead he could see a small shard gleaming in the snow. As he got closer he could see it more clearly. It was a broken off shard of a mirror. It was curious how a mirror found itself in the middle of nowhere, far away from where it had any reason to be. More curious still, how did it reflect light with the sun long gone in the blizzard? Then again, he was used to things that would befuddle lesser minds. As alarms started ringing at the back of his mind, his curiosity got the better of him and he creeped closer to the mirror. The sound of footsteps came from his right. He moved swiftly, turning his body, crouching down and throwing his arm and stick out in front of him. In front he saw nothing but white flakes, whipping around him and stinging his cheeks. He felt a small pressure at the nape of his neck and a low voice.

“Dolohov. Fancy seeing you here. Come around often?” the voice snarled.

This was bad. Backup was miles away probably freezing their balls off in a small observation hut.

“Not really mate. But I heard there was a fine piece of ass around these parts so I thought I'd come check it out” he replied. Bad situation or not, appearances had to be kept and he sure as hell was not going to be intimidated by some filthy half-blood.

The voice made a small chuckle.

“Once a dick always a dick.”

Then the world was pain. It was pain and fire rising from the depths of his very soul tearing him apart from the inside out. He tried to hold on but a scream was finally wrenched from his body and he fell over. The cold snow melted under his pooling blood and darkness overcame him as his voice was screaming itself raw, wishing for a mercy that he knew would not come.

The last thing he saw before succumbing to nothingness was bright green eyes under a faded scar.

*** It really means a lot that someone is interested! It would be Harry centric. It would disregard Deathly Hallows as a lot of things I've thought of in the story would not fit in with DH.
