It seems like all the story's I read these days have all the women being bisexual, it's getting out of hand, just yesterday i was reading a story and Hermione was Harry's girlfriend but she was cheating on him with Daphne for months, but he wasn't mad about it at all, i want a story where Harry won't put up with things like that, because cheating is cheating it doesn't matter if it's a man or a women


** I don't like that the premise seems to be based on the fact that "his woman" is, you know, "his," but I do like the premise that he wouldn't be happy to jump into bed with the two of them. She betrayed his trust. She broke faith with him.

***** in canon the only women with any kind of power is amelia bones that's it and she had a hard time keeping it, even dolored umbridge was only a secretary, i could be wrong because i haven't read the books in years, but i'm sure no other women had any real power, it's a male patriarchy

****** the first female ministers of magic was elected in 1798 and was followed by many others. for example Millicent Bagnold who was fudges predecessor and of course hermione. Minerva McGonagall became headmistress of hogwarts which is a position of power. Umbridge later became head of the muggleborn registration and bellatrix clearly had a position of authority under Voldemort. Not to mention that there is no sexism in the books.

******* Magic is the great power equalizer. Men's physical strength doesn't have nearly that much advantage in the Magical World. I expect domestic violence to be evenly distributed among genders.

I always laugh at that ridiculous abuser Ron bashing trope. Canon showed very clearly that while Ron complained more, Hermione was by far more physically abusive, and she generally beat him in a duel.

Umbridge was an undersecretary, which has nothing to do with what you think a secretary is, but actually means she was the second-in-command behind Fudge.

******** Like [[/u/The_Truthkeeper][u/The_Truthkeeper]] said, she was second-in-command. Undersecretaries are executive government officials that work to enact the policies of the chief, often running entire departments. That's like saying she was "only" his chief of staff or deputy secretary of state. And before that she was the Head of the Improper Use of Magic Office.

****** I'll agree that the magical world isn't really a champion for gender equality the way Rowling wrote it. There aren't many females in major positions of power. The heads of governments in the canon timeline, and the Darkest wizards of the past 100 years or so are all male.

But I don't think it's nearly as bad as you seem to think it is. I've not seen a male character treat a female character as his property in canon before, and have the women just go ok. That's cool. When she started dating Dean Thomas, Ginny didn't just roll over and say okay, I'll stop when Ron started being a shit about it. Hermione didn't stop talking to Viktor because Ron said she was 'fraternising with the enemy'. And when Snape called Lily a Mudblood, and James rushed to her defense, she didn't need James' help. She told both Snape and James exactly what she thought of them. Even in their everyday lives, these women assert their independence and don't let people silence their opinions.

Those are just small things, though. I'll admit I don't really have many examples of women making big decisions in canon, only speculations. For example, when Amelia Bones was killed by Voldemort personally, why did he bother? Clearly, she was important, or Voldemort wouldn't have cared. It's because she could have made a huge difference in the war, and he was a threat to his cause. Compare that to Fudge, who is so incompetent it's a surprise he can breathe. Rowling's universe may not have overtly affirming moments for women in power, but it's implications like these that show that the wizarding world isn't a male world where women are expected to do as men say. Another example is Narcissa Malfoy staring Voldemort in the eye and lying through her teeth.

Tl;dr, sure, the wizarding world isn't completely gender equal. That doesn't mean that women are treated as property or aren't allowed to voice their opinions. You say you're tired of reading stories where authors bring in modern views, but I think you've also got a really skewed view of 'how it should be'. I'd like to see some examples where women are treated as property in canon.

** This sounds less like a "not ok with his women being bisexual" and more like a "not ok with his women being cheaters" problem, tbh. Because yeah, cheating is cheating, I'm just not getting how bisexuality has anything to do with that.

*** I think it's just silentgord saying that cheating is cheating and that some authors are basically saying cheating is ok if your bisexual women cheating with other women rather than a man so it's not really about bisexuality itself it's just some hetero-normative men (and lets be honest women) thinking that because it's with someone of the same sex as their partner cheating is ok
