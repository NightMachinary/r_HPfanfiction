Preferably with a minimum of cringe.


** This isn't anything like /Happy Tree Friends/ is it?(if you don't know what it is, and you do not like gore, for the love of Merlin, avoid it like the plague).

*** Oh god I had almost forgotten. 0.o Ya, don't look that one up.

That said I assume OP just meant snake buddies for potter, which request I can get behind. :)

Edit: or maybe they meant happy slytherins who are friends with each other? That is rare, now I think of it.
