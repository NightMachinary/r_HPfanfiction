Harry somehow gets the Flamels to befriend/watch over him which leads to Albus getting put into a mundane nursing home with his magic bound. Any help would be greatly appreciated.


** This happens in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
