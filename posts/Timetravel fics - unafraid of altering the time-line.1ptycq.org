Now I've read quite a few time-travel fics, and I have enjoyed some of them more than others. Those I tend to favour all throw the notion of preserving the time-line out the window.

Show me the ones you like - Whether they be fics of Harry sending memories back in time, or him traveling back in time.

Personally some of the ones I've liked the best have been with Harry going back in time as a DADA teacher in the 70ties, but they have a tendency of not changing time, and I often find myself abandoning them halfway through. Just having him angsting a bit about not being able to change anything is quite annoying to say the least. What I would really like to see, is him trying his hardest to change things for the better, but keeping up the role of a fighter, not a manipulative bastard.

*** I am always wary of stories that use titles such as princess, queen, master etc. as they almost always turn into a cliché mesh of unappealing drivel. I know it's harsh, but I really have to get it off my heart from time to time. (I mean really... it a) you don't get anything out of grandious titles beyond inflating the man/woman depicted, without anything to carry it b) It's usually titles given to people who don't deserve it in any way (come on, why the heck are people suddenly claiming Hermione is some kind of Gryffindor princess? c) Heir of such and such is just a cheap way of getting around the fact that you don't know how to advance a character without using lame platitudes and easy-fix sollutions based on fandom ideas with no backing in either canon or reality. (seriously.. the heir of all the founders or merlin is perhaps some of the poorest excuses for good story writing I have ever come across))

So is this some kind of attempt to portray Hermione as some kind of overinflated star, while leaving her character woefully inadequate of following up on it, or is there something about Hermione in this that makes the title give any sense?

**** Author here. All those are fair complaints about power fantasy nonsense and trope misuse and abuse, something I try to avoid falling into.

Still, /Witch Queen/ uses some of these ideas in some odd ways. Maybe best described as starting at the end of an unwritten future AU story (something that confuses basically everyone), the fic immediately goes into a canon-compatible '91 Hogwarts. I play with those power fantasy tropes and partially show what might happen to the HP 'verse to result in Dark Future Hermione Granger walking a path almost as dark as Voldemort. This happens slowly in a series of dreams/visions that Harry has over multiple chapters.

As for the thread topic specifically: Harry travels back in time and instantly and accidentally changes something by having Dumbledore find out exactly how bad the Dursleys treat him. He then has to use his slightly AU sixth book knowledge to defeat Voldemort, all while having to deal with personal issues and an innocent little girl who hasn't done any of those dark things he remembers, and hopefully now never will.

Minor spoilers for my story: after Halloween '91 (coming next update, chapter 12), no canon events will occur, though some goals will obviously be the same. I don't push some kind of fate nonsense, but have characters act based on their goals to create new events in a slightly AU 'verse.

As for power levels, canon Hermione is good, really good. I use that and turn some things up to 11, but try to remain rational about it.

I leave any quality statements to others, but I try to write stories I would like to read.

***** Hi!

I've just finished reading your story and wanted to thank you for it. If it would be ok to keep discussing it here, instead of opening another thread, here are some discussion points:

1. Were [[http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Willow_Rosenberg][Willow]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ender%27s_Game_characters#The_Wiggins][Ender, and Val]] used as partial prototypes for your characters?

2. (spoilers, somewhere early on) Why wouldn't Harry step in and defend Hermione against Snape?

Praises:

1. (spoilers for Ch. 10+) I really liked the collective consciousness motives --- both the spell itself and the less “powerful” emotional bonds between various conscious agents. Thanks for implementing it, because for some reason it's really hard to find [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_%28science_fiction%29][stories --- (and not only fics either)]] --- that truly touch and explore the implications of a group mind.

   2.1. anything particular on this subject that you could recommend reading?

2. (spoilers for Ch. 4) I've really liked the “cuddling environment” that you've created for the heroes too. Also thanks for keeping it innocent with young-Hermoine.

3. Later on your story manages to keep its original spacing intact, which I couldn't say, for example, for HP:MoR (EY really starts cheat-modding the reality in favour of Harry). So props to you for this also.

And for possible points of criticism:

1. eye rollings --- if you backtrack-edit some things later on, can you consider changing the amount of eye-rolling the adult-Hermione does? Imho, it seems to be an OoC for the character that you've been describing --- both in regards to her priorities at her point of decay, and to her lack of physical organs of vision.

2. keeping the rat on freedom seems too risky and just begs for a disappointing trope abuse later on. I get that Voldy will later be needing an assistant, but things like this are specifically where idiot balls are being rolled in time-travel fics. There are really so many things that they could do instead of just letting it be free that the whole story starts losing credibility because of this.

3. Regarding the power levels, that you've mentioned: it's not only Hermione who gets OP'ed. Harry essentially gets also a super-Luna and a super-Nevill in your story, based on the early introductions for the characters. Will there be any equivalent counter-forces introduced later on?

--------------

And for the last question: which one or two [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/4223774/TimeLoopedPowerGamer][of your favorite fanfics]] would you recommend also reading and why?

****** Thanks for taking the time. I love getting reader reactions. I think as long as we keep it about time travel fics that should be cool, but I'd like still like to continue this on my forum - [[http://www.fanfiction.net/topic/127267/80220856/3/#99829059][link]] -, as it might get long.

--------------

In brief, for those who are allergic to FFN forums:

#+begin_quote

  1. Were Willow, Ender, and Val used as partial prototypes for your characters?
#+end_quote

Sort of. I liked the look of EvilModeWillow from Buffy, and used that feel. DarkFutureHermione doesn't have any physical eyes at all, though, so it is a little different. Hermione is obviously a Val-esque character in intelligence, but she'll go full win-at-all-costs Ender Wiggen if things get bad enough. Her moral framework is held together by logic and reasoning right now at 12-years-old, not deep emotional conditioning or positive life experiences, so this is something Harry needs to support her on to avoid a potential future TPW (Total Planet Wipe).

#+begin_quote

  1. ...Why wouldn't Harry step in and defend Hermione against Snape?
#+end_quote

At first, Harry was shocked and trying to figure out what was going on. After that, it is a mix of not having a solution and being sort of conditioned to be non-confrontational with Snape. Though there are only hints so far, in this story DH never happened in Harry's AU future, and HBP went off the rails before the end of that year. Harry doesn't have a solution for Snape right now but he also knows the potions professor isn't a threat yet, so he just supports Hermione and waits. And watches. And keeps score. For now.

With Hermione knowing how bad Harry had been treated in class last time, she's taking this one on as her own battle, and as a way to figure out what he's up to. Like in canon, there is no "magic rule" that will fix this, and speaking up against an adult in a Victorian era school setting (which this sort of is) doesn't help at all. This doesn't mean Harry likes it but, as in canon, there isn't anything an 11-year-old can actually do. Maybe once everyone knows who A Student at Hogwarts is...

In other words, Harry can't just yell down a potions master in his own classroom, like in some fics. This isn't realistic and doesn't fit the canon HP themes of fate and death. As this isn't a critical issue compared with some Harry needs to cover, he's just doing his best to comfort his friend instead of being some alpha male power fantasy idiot.

--------------

Thank very much you for your praises! I also think your critical points are very useful feedback. I'll be responding (positively) off thread in more detail, as that isn't really on topic.

Draco's ultimate goal in the story is to win the war while being on the +right+ winning side. He came back for totally selfish reasons, essentially: his life was ruined, so he decided to cheat and make it better.

It's not slash, and nothing I write will be. I have nothing against slash, but it's not my cup of tea to read and I don't the the perspective to write it. There will also not be any actual shipping until Draco's new fourth year - he's naturally a little squicked out before that.

I've never really been a fan of Draco, however I have been a fan of the way J.K.R. writes about the changes his character goes through by starting out the pompous git, getting high and mighty and then crash and burn in the end, being tormented by outside pressure and filth that just slowly erodes him.

****** No - he saw Potter win and lived through the Dark Lord living at his house, plus was sitting listening to Riddle say things like "After you're dead, I can attend to Draco Malfoy"; it's safe to say he will never again play for Voldemort's side. Draco is out for himself, but after seven years of character development and having his worldview challenged, he's finally realized that the only way for Draco Malfoy to win is for Voldemort to lose.

First year is all about making allies. He only has an outsider's view of how Potter's group won in the first war, but he's trying to move things forward on that front. Unfortunately, the other side reacts by moving things forward as well.

As fair warning, this uses the fanon that Snape is Draco's godfather; I am well aware that it's not canon, but I needed Draco to have an adult ally, and Dumbledore certainly wasn't going to be it.

Changes are minor in the beginning, and have been slowly snowballing since then. Right now, he's trying to bring Slytherin House over to the not-Death Eater side. We'll see if he succeeds.

****** Gotta respectfully disagree with the Delenda Est hate (proof [[/u/Bulwersator]] isn't just an alt of mine?), though I do understand it. Maybe I should reread it from the start to make sure I'm not twisting thing up in my mind.

As I remember, the first chapter was...well, rough. I didn't get it. Almost quit there, as it wasn't a normal action or romance fic start and seemed really self-absorbed and stylistically stunted. But I kept reading and it turned into a very unique story. Overall, it is quite well written. Some of the only convincing alt-history and Marauder-era characters I've ever encountered, and ones that I actually cared about. The plot is sort of all over the place, quality wise, but does come together eventually. It is primarily a character piece, though, and should be approached as such.

I guess that the worst parts are that the summary is only barely informative, there are no genre tags on it, a 17 year old student falls for her teacher without horrible moral repercussions (though he does get fired for it eventually), and it doesn't have much in the way of early power fantasy (though that does happen later, with her help).

Harry is weak at first. That can really bug people. I should know. This is a failed Harry, one who lost his war. He loses to essentially everyone in a straight-up fight, at least for the first quarter of the story until he finds his true powers or whatever, and he makes some stupid decision. And, sort of like canon, without a strong goal he himself isn't a very likable or exciting character. Some people I've talked to don't like the moderate age gap between the romantic partners.

So, maybe not for everyone? If those kind of things are a deal breaker, yeah. Avoid it. But it isn't horrible (and I should know, I've seen things, maaaaaan) and it has some unique timetravel stuff without going totally overboard about it. That's my take.

******* I agree that other characters seemed well-written in it (even non-canon Bella, which was quite an achievement). In fact, I didn't have problems with almost everything that you've mentioned. Age differences are not what I care for even IRL, a weak hero can provide grounds for an interesting plot, and a failed one can be a good [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor][sour-armor knight]].

What I can't tolerate however is downright stupidity. This story's Harry is incompetent in potion making, and yet he accepts the teaching position for the potion's class. Okay... may still be good, keep reading. Then he starts trying to hide his incompetence from Dumbledore without trying much to improve his knowledge on the course material. He is a milksop for Bella, and very soon she has him wrapped around her finger. He tolerates the way she speaks with him in classes, submits to her blackmail and loses further respectability from other students. Then they have a duel, one of his crappy wands gets ruined (who buys a crappy wand? it's a serious security risk), he doesn't replace it right away (what wizard moves on without any wand whatsoever?) and when it actually bites him back in the ass, what he does is go to some crappy shop and buy several more crappy wands.

That was where I stopped caring for the stupid character and dropped the story.

But since it's being recommended so often, maybe I'll give it another try if I'll enjoy the Beacon one [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1ptycq/timetravel_fics_unafraid_of_altering_the_timeline/cd6xolj][that you've also recommended earlier]].

** I like a good time travel fic now and then, but my biggest issue with most of them is that the author doesn't acknowledge how mentally painful it would be to go back in time to what is essentially middle-school (for Americans at least) and try to not stand out. If you think about it, there is a /huge/ difference between seventeen year-old thought processes and eleven year-old thinking - and the effort it would take to hide the extra maturity 24hrs/day would be exhausting. And the classwork itself would drive just about anyone crazy. Think about yourself when you were seventeen (or however old the time-traveler is) re-learning how to do basic algebra, or learning how to spell, use contractions, and the proper use of "and" & "but". It would be nuts and while the American school system is very different than Hogwarts, I still can't help but think it would be mind-numbingly boring and very difficult to hide for an adult wizard to be re-learning basics of magic. Anyway, that's my rant - it's just something that not a lot of time-travel authors either think about or expressly acknowledge in their stories. Too often the time-travel is just like "well, I guess I'm off to school again, /shrug/".

That's why I have him not even bother to pretend very hard in my story, /Harry Potter and the Witch Queen/. Harry returns to '91 and immediately simply /is/ as knowledgeable as everyone expects him to be as the boy-who-lived. It helps that he works with Hermione to make her just as good at everything while also working on non-classwork topics together so he doesn't go insane from boredom.

I do give him a strange issue with his magic (for plot reasons) such that he can't cast many (or very powerful) spells without almost passing out, but that isn't what most HP classwork is about, or Neville and Ron would have flunked out by year three.

In other words, Harry initially spends most of his time tutoring already scary-smart Hermione Granger while breezing through schoolwork, and people just think that's how a (currently tragically ill) legend and his genius best friend should act.

That is the SECOND most common point of confusion with this fanfic, but is also totally not your fault. This is a tale about Harry and his problems, though *not* about him /destroying his problems/ with a flick of his wrist while playing kinky S&M power games with school-age kids (I mean, really...). I repeat, this is *not in any way that kind of a story.*

He is meant to be the focus of every single chapter, with a slightly AU twist to some canon elements and magic everywhere turned up to 11. Dumbledore, Snape, and Ron have had a couple of brief POV moments (though I don't say "<POV DUMBLEDORE>" like some lazy authors), but otherwise it has been all Harry all the time. Anyone else getting any attention is just for flavor so people can see better what is happening to Harry. Some readers have even requested more Ron and Neville, who are secondary characters right now (sort of like Ginny in PoA). I think Chapter 12 (coming in Dec.) is the first time I give the readers a look into my Hermione's slightly odd headspace. And even then, it is in a scene /intensely/ about Harry.

Now given all that, this first year is focused on Harry dealing with young genius, and possible existential threat to the planet, Hermione Granger. Hence the story title. Right now (like in canon) Harry doesn't have much momentum and lives in a semi-rational world, so don't expect him to hit school with three wands, two magic trunks, and a tame succubus (or really, any).

This changes some after the first few chapters (...not the succubus part, still no on that...), but don't push through in reading it if it isn't something that catches your attention by the end of chapter two or three. I'd like to say to read until Hogwarts, at least, but that isn't something I can promise will change everything.

I do really like the part with the snakes, though.

I'm wondering if there are any time-travel fics where Harry "dissappears" from time for several years, and re-emerges into a world where things have been shot to hell.

I know there are a lot of dark AU fics, and fics where Harry Travels back to change things for the better, but are there any where he travels forward to find the world in shambles?

I ask because I'm currently working on a fic along those lines, and I don't want to retread anything that's already been done to death.
