OK so, my latest obsessions had been Male!Hermione and it seems that there simply isn't enough stories about it.

Its either One Shot or paired with Fem!Harry or Fem!Ron or complete cliche where Hermione is either Trans (not that I have anything against them) or have a a**hole no good parents that force him to be a girl and then BAAM! He gets sorted to the Slythering! P.S.: I think this story was "Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn".

Sure this story is simply AMAZING and all, Character Description and reasons to their issues is written Breathtakingly, but i want Male!Hermione Story where Hermione is the MC and NOT Harry.

Do you know any Multichapter Male!Hermione stories? Can you link them to me? Or can you write it AND then link it to me?


** This isn't exactly what you are looking for but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff side) does have a male! Hermione. It's still Harry centric, and the reversal of gender roles is a little on the nose, but the male! Hermione is still a central part of the story from what I can remember.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

The reversal of gender roles is governed by Rule of Funny rather than any attempt to be realistic about it. It's a good story, though, and I look forward to Clell getting his oomph back to finish it.
