**** One alternative implementation of his soul anchors is the Dark Mark. As long as one marked Death Eater survives, he can always come back. He uses up only a tiny fraction of his soul essence for each Dark Mark. Theoretically, he can hundreds, if not thousands of such soul anchors.

Similarly, he can still use objects, but again he uses only a minuscule amount of his soul in each one of them. He would select a mix of artifacts and ordinary items, and hide them in most inaccessible locations around the world.

Under both scenarios, canon Horcrux Hunt would have totally failed.

****** Furthermore, it draws our heroes into a very uncomfortable position. In canon, Death Eaters could be imprisoned or take plea deals, or even repent. In this version, the only way to end the war is the wholesale slaughter of the Death Eaters.

Considering that most of the Death Eater ranks were made up of purebloods (and canon hints that Voldemort had /a lot/ of support from the purebloods), you're looking at what could be considered a pureblood genocide to end the war.

There would be no redemption for Snape, no change of heart for Draco. Only the government- organized murder of a significant chunk of the wizard population.

The socio-political scars that come from something like that would run deep, and that would have to be addressed.

**** I think there's a fair bit of evidence that she had at least a basic idea of Voldemort and the fact that he had multiple horcruxes from the beginning of the series. Not only the diary, but the fact that horcruxes are a tribute to a really to a long and rich history of very similar things in literature and myth. The One Ring in LOTR and a finger bone in one of the Prydain novels just to name two of the examples in the modern era of fantasy literature.

As for themes, I'm not sure what could possibly have more thematic resonance and depth than the hunt for the horcruxes gave us. The entire series is immensely rich in that regard, but none are more so than the last two books. Basically that's all to say that I couldn't disagree more and I'm curious to know what's led you to that conclusion.

****** I'm not familiar with Vento Aureo so I can't comment in respect to that.

In respect to the entire HP series we get the obvious ones. Love, Death, Loyalty, Heroism, Good vs Evil, Growing Up, etc... But we also get particularly significant and somewhat more book specific ones. With Voldemort's second rise to power and the Ministry's response we see strong themes about Injustice (plot lines about house elves, bigotry from the likes of Umbridge and Fudge, and hell, society when it comes to deeper insights we get into what Lupin and other werewolves have had to deal with).

We see themes of Totalitarianism and Power and Corruption, not just in Fudge's suppression of truth and attempted arrests without due process earlier on, but extreme in-your-face outright totalitarian fascism when the Ministry fell to Voldemort. Later on, particularly in Deathly Hallows, we get themes not centered merely around Death but around the Difficulty of Loving the Dead. Harry in particular dealing with feelings of Betrayal in light of what he learns about Dumbledore's history. The search for the Horcruxes, particularly the earlier portion of it, has all sorts of stuff going on. Choices, Losing Hope, Loneliness, Isolation, Individual vs Society, Fear of Failure.

Later in the book we get Reunion, Home, Sacrifice, Rebellion, ...

I could go on like this for a while, not to mention choose any given one and go deep on it, so I'll cut myself off here. There's a great Podcast called Harry Potter and the Sacred Text where the hosts pretty much do exactly this. It's a Chapter by Chapter analysis of the entire series with the framing of reading it as they would a religious holy book. Analysing the central theme of each chapter and pulling from it instruction and inspiration. Not only is it extremely well done, but the fact that the series can support this level of reading is testament to the richness I've tried to convey.

******** I'm torn between a few I think. There's some overlap and feeding into one another. I'd go with something along the lines of Lies & Secrets, Justice / Injustice, and Compassion & Forgiveness.

To break them down a little ...

Lies and Secrets:\\
We get this nearly from the start. Harry has to keep the secret of his magic from Aunt Marge. Substituting lies. Fudge and others are lying to Harry about their belief that Sirius broke out to kill him, and keeping the secret that they believe Sirius to be responsible for a mass murder and the deaths of Harry's parents. There's Harry's coming into secrets about Hogwarts by way of Fred, George, and the Marauder's Map. Malfoy trying to get as much out of deceiving people about the severity of his injury from Buckbeak as he can, not to mention his lie about the situation being unprovoked on his part. Lupin's secret regarding being a werewolf. Hermione's possession and use of the timeturner.

​

Justice and Injustice:\\
Many of the above plot points get double duty. As always, we're treated to an inside look at the start of just how unjust Harry's situation with the Dursley's is. Lupin's ostracizing by most of society. The discussion of the morality or lack thereof of the Dementor's Kiss. In tandem with discussion around Sirius' fate and history, we have Buckbeak's trial and subsequent unjust sentencing. The look at the climax at the real guilty party having escaped justice, while the innocent one was punished. Sirius' self loathing belief that he was on some level guilty, having been the one to advocate the switch in secret keeper. The conclusion of all of this containing some wins for justice and some losses. The belief of the Ministry that Sirius is still guilty, but his and Buckbeak's escape of further direct punishment.

​

Compassion and Forgiveness:

We get some of this throughout the book. Ron and Hermione fighting but eventually managing to reconcile. The trio's compassion toward Hagrid and what's going on with Buckbeak. Interplay around grudges, old and newer. The most significant example of this of course is in the climax. Lupin's ability to understand and forgive Sirius, Snape's inability to do the same toward either of them, or toward Harry for that matter due to past injustices against him. Harry's compassion allowing him to be somewhat merciful toward Pettigrew and prevent his murder by Sirius and Lupin, his upholding of his personal idea of justice rather than revenge.

And for all we know, maybe there's some magic that strengthens his hiding places because they're connected to him, or maybe he literally could /only/ hide Horcruxes in places that were important to him in some way to keep them active.

***** It's not just Horcruxes, though. I'm speaking to a more general tendency where fics will actively try to munchkin something, but where they have to add extra (often non-canon compliant) material to justify their munchkinry.

For example, I see so many fics where it's like "wow Harry here's a book that teaches you Occlumency" and "replacement potions professor teaches you how to modify potion recipes from the start," or "Dumbledore should've done X to prevent Z from happening." To a point, I think those are interesting angles to explore. Snape's a terrible person, and Dumbledore can be hard to dissect but is fundamentally trying to do good.

But many of these are definitely fanon ideas that have basically transformed into headcanon for so many people through numerous fics. I liked that PoS basically went full AU for Occlumency instead, and its potions explanation was that the class is basically structured so you could create any required potion on an actual OWL or NEWT just through drilling the basic skillset and ability to make a potion by following written directions. Or Sine Qua Non has time traveler Harry mention that modifications to potions are complicated and dangerous- so Snape was skilled to do them as a sixth year, but it's not something that was ever actively taught in classes.

Not every magic system needs to be formulated by Brandon Sanderson. Often, the justifications are extra bloat. One thing that HP canon does exceptionally well is show us a lot of throwaway magic in the background, like magic sweets, toys, backdrops, and trinkets, that add a layer of texture to the world of HP magic that feels lacking in many other fantasy texts. That level of texture is not really something you get in many other fantasy works.

This works to explain the objects, but not so well the places. The Gaunt ring and Slytherin's locket are both hidden in meaningful places. Arguably Ravenclaw's diadem as well, if sitting in Hogwart's lost-and-found room counts as being in Hogwarts. But the diary and Hufflepuff's cup were both given to followers to hide.

***** Mysterious Figure is easy if you remember not to bring more than 4 curagas and the other setup needed to avoid proc'ing his spammy AI, even without spamming Thunder Surge.

It sounds like you don't like HPMoR, and I'm honestly not a huge fan of it either. Your comment about the earlier parts of the fic are unrelated to the issue, though, and the author doesn't forget about the required murder- Quirrelmort is pretty explicit about having killing hundreds of people. But regardless of the context, it does something interesting- it both runs with the Horcrux idea and modifies it in an interesting way, subverting the reader's expectations twice and extrapolating some consequences from that setup. It lets Voldemort actually hide his Horcruxes, but shows that being well-hidden wasn't the perfect solution.

And nothing in canon actually tells us the Horcrux needs to be made right away with the murder. The soul is internal, so my interpretation has always been that it's more that the murder creates a small tear in the soul, and whatever ritual needed to actually create the Horcrux is what fully rips apart a piece and stuffs it into the pseudo-phylactery. Hence why not everyone is walking around with Horcruxes, even if they're mass murderers. It's popular for fanfics to mix it up a bit as well, especially when you have weird deaths (Myrtle, Morfin+the Riddles, Hepzibah Smith) where the murder is either indirect or obtaining the necessary doesn't necessarily allow time for him to "use" the murder straight away. And it's not unfair to assume that Voldemort didn't make multiple Horcruxes before talking to Slughorn- we generally assume that the Diary was first (June 1943), and he also already had the Ring when he talked to Slughorn in the memory according to HBP, so if he didn't actually make a second Horcrux until after that the timeline is more lax.

Sure, why not? Also the voyager probes were launched 1977. I doubt there was as ubiquitous of a video surveillance at NASA as you might think.

- Maybe Horcruxes have to be bound to significant places in your life, otherwise over time the magic binding the soul to the object fades as your soul gets pulled towards those significant places like a ghost (or some explanation to this effect).
- Something about arithmancy.

None of these were actually explored in canon, so you're totally correct in that for the explanations we received about them, Voldemort's hiding policy was asinine.

Arrogance leads to assumptions. Lack of understanding leads to continuing blind spots to those assumptions.

Voldemort banked on Lucius remaining utterly loyal to him, remaining in fear of him.

He laid defenses for the locket thinking only of the challenger he imagined, someone around his own level of magical power, never thinking that person would ever be teamed up with an underage wizard. He probably never gave much thought to the magical powers of house elves, merely considering them inferior and unworthy of his attention.

** I don't like the way they were done, to be honest. They introduced more plot holes than they resolved, and the way Dumbledore wasted an entire school year on Pensieve memories was asinine. All he had to do was say /"Harry, the diary you stabbed had a piece of Voldemort's soul inside. I think you have a piece as well. Let's hunt them down before he, I don't know, takes over the Ministry and all."/

My worst pet peeves center around Harry the Accidental Horcrux. Thousands of years of magical history, and Voldemort is the only one with the bad luck to accidentally split his soul because a mother loved her baby? Harry nearly dies from basilisk venom, but that doesn't destroy the Horcrux? Why doesn't the Voldemort-soul inside Harry ever try to take over, like all of the others do? Why does Harry get Parseltongue, but nothing else from it? Why does the Horcrux only die if Harry lets himself be killed like a chump? Why does Voldemort have to do it? Can't anyone kill the Horcrux?

I have tons of problems with the other Horcruxes, but I'll leave it at that. In the end, I disliked the last book and a half because Harry barely does anything to defeat Voldemort. He doesn't even have to learn new skills, like cursebreaking; all he does is steal or find the easily accessible Horcruxes. He doesn't have to work for his victory, he just has to listen to Dumbledore and the convenient bit of exposition (Rita Skeeter's book, the radio, convenient photos of Grindelwald, Hermione's reasearch, Kreacher, the Gray Lady, etc.), and the answers are handed to him. It doesn't make for an interesting finale. I was much more invested in the resistance movement at Hogwarts.

*** Sometimes there are plot holes. And sometimes people just haven't read the books properly.

Horcruxes 101:

1. You can't directly affect a horcrux. *That's the point of a horcrux*. You can't kill a horcrux with a killing curse, a Dementor can't suck a horcrux out of its receptacle, and certainly there aren't any medical procedures that can extract it. Even when you do something to destroy the horcrux, like stabbing one of Voldemort's horcruxes with a basilisk fang, you're not directly affecting the soul piece. The basilisk venom doesn't kill the soul, it destroys the physical object, after which the soul must move on. *The only way to destroy a horcrux is to physically destroy the receptacle*. This is such a basic point that so many people fail to understand.

2. Horcruxes don't have default invulnerability. Something being a horcrux does not in itself grant that object any special invulnerability to damage. The Dark wizard creating the horcrux must enchant the receptacle to resist damage separately from the process of making it a horcrux.

3. There isn't a default set of horcrux-protecting enchantments that all horcruxes possess. The wizard creating the horcrux puts the protections on the receptacle, and what things that wizard chooses to protect against depends on the wizard's choices and capabilities. *Different horcruxes will therefore be protected against different things*. This is what it means to put a horcrux beyond magical repair (and thus destroy it): *you put the horcrux beyond that horcrux's specific ability to magically repair*, not beyond some abstract concept of magical repair in general. Basilisk venom for example, does not necessarily put something beyond magical repair: if you have phoenix tears, you can repair the damage of basilisk venom. So the horcrux in Harry wasn't destroyed by basilisk venom, because he wasn't put beyond magical repair by it, but it does destroy the others because Voldemort didn't protect them against basilisk venom. It's specifically stated, however, that had Voldemort had access to phoenix tears, he would have been able to protect his horcruxes against basilisk venom. *Basilisk venom is not some set-in-stone horcrux-destroyer, it destroys horcruxes simply because the ingredient necessary to resist it is so rare*.

All of this was explained explicitly in Deathly Hallows chapter 6.

Horcrux being tied innately to its physical container:

#+begin_quote
  “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”

  “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.”

  ”Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,” said Ron. Harry laughed.

  “It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. *The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival*. It can't exist without it.”
#+end_quote

Protections on a horcrux are put there separately by the Dark wizard making it:

#+begin_quote
  “No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because *it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them*.
#+end_quote

Efficacy of basilisk fangs in destroying horcruxes depends on horcruxes not being protected against it, due to the rarity of its single counteracting force:

#+begin_quote
  "From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”

  “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.

  “Oh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”

  “It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be *something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare* --“

  “-- phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.

  “Exactly,” said Hermione.
#+end_quote

Another misconception is that Voldemort and his horcruxes are in some sense equal in terms of their claims to being Voldemort. But Voldemort is specifically referred to by JKR as the "master soul". Even if he wasn't, however, I think it would be strongly implied. The fact that the horcruxes act as anchors for Voldemort but do not anchor each other, and the fact that Voldemort's soul does not anchor the soul fragments in the horcruxes, demonstrates that the relationship between the horcrux and Voldemort is very much a subservient one.

This is true in general for the Horcruxes we see in the story, but I don't really see it for the Horcrux in Harry's scar. Even though Harry's body wasn't destroyed beyond repair when he was hit by the killing curse, the Horcrux in his scar still died.

The other living Horcrux, Nagini, was cut apart by a sword coated with corrosive venom, which understandibly killed its Horcrux as the physical object was destroyed. I don't think Harry has so much as a papercut when he 'died', so something must be different in his situation.

I can think of maybe two possible explanations right now. Either the Horcruxes /in/ living things die when the living thing dies (but isn't necessarily destroyed), or Harry's protection from his mother had a funky interaction with Voldemort's killing curse, which removed Voldemort's Horcrux. If the first one is the case, I don't know why Voldemort would ever make a mortal snake into a receptacle for his immortality. Harry wouldn't necessarily have had to die to Voldemort, as anything else would do. The second explanation seems also unsatisfying to me, as the Horcrux scar got there in the first place because Harry was hit by the killing curse way back then (and also had the protection from his mother). So it shouldn't be any different in this case.

I might be missing something here.

A living being is considered destroyed when it is dead. A living thing is not just a collection of matter; it is a life. The Killing Curse does not kill you via any cause of death, but it does still make you physically, biologically dead.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Harry wouldn't necessarily have had to die to Voldemort, as anything else would do.
#+end_quote

Any being could kill Harry and destroy the horcrux in him. The Voldemort killing him part was about the coming back to life afterwards element.

Per JKR:

#+begin_quote
  SU: So, can I ask this? This is kind of a random question but if Harry had this Horcrux in him, of course, sort of, would he have actually have died, like say when a dragon could've killed him, or when he was falling during Quidditch, or anything?

  JKR: Well, you've got to-- if his body had been irreperably destroyed, he has to die to get rid of that piece of soul. His body has got to be irreperably damaged. So a lot of people asked, and I think I've answered this since... but a lot of people immediately said, having finished "Hallows", "(gasps) But then, that means, in Chamber of Secrets when he was pierced by the basilisk..." But no, no, no, no. He didn't die! He didn't die! That was stated right at the beginning with the Horcrux. The receptacle has got to be destroyed. His body wasn't destroyed. He got a bit poisoned, and then he got the antidote immediately. So, you know, that's not gonna drive out this piece of soul. Sorry if I sound frustrated but occassionally, (overtalk) occassionally, you feel some frustration. People, please, just read the book, because it's there! And then ask something that's not there! Which plenty of people do, don't get me wrong. But on that one I felt... there was a certain feeling of weariness. (laughs)

  JN: Now I'm nervous.

  JKR: No no no no. Don't be nervous. Because I was so careful with this stuff. I don't know if you've seen on my website, I recently did a small number of updates, and one of the things on there was... It's about the end, and how Harry survived right to the end. He doesn't fight and Voldemort uses the Killing Curse on him. It was important for me to say on the website, I never saw this, as in the finale, the deneouement, the moment when Harry faces Voldemort prepared to die and doesn't die-- that isn't like a scientific equation. Harry-- it's not guaranteed, there has to be space, to make Harry truly heroic, for free will. It has to be his choice. The whole thing's his choice. He chooses to sacrifice himself just as Lily chose to sacrifice herself. He chooses to pull himself back to life, and that's his own will and courage. So ultimately, those things, all of them were more important than the magic.

**** Your wall of text only answered /one/ of the pet peeves I posted about the Harry-Horcrux, and saying that Harry was "destroyed" as a vessel sounds ridiculous when he's up and walking around a few minutes later, but whatever. It's just like magic!

That still doesn't explain why Tom's diary Horcrux tries to get itself a new body, sets a monster loose, and tries to kill Harry, but the one inside his own head does /nothing/ except give him a helpful language skill (and can coexist with Lily's love-shield for years and years). Harry has a chunk of Dark Lord in him, and he's pure as the driven snow until the OG Voldemort starts sending him mood swings in OotP! The trio didn't allow the locket Horcrux to possess them, and that one /still/ found a way to screw them all up and send Ron packing, prevent them from using the Patronus Charm, and all sorts of angst ensued.

You could argue that the older the Horcrux, the stronger it is and the more powers it has, but that creates its own problems. If the diary has 1/2 of a soul, but the ring only has 1/4, the locket 1/8, and so on, that would mean that the "master soul" is 1/128th of a soul, and weaker than ALL of his Horcruxes bar one. Voldemort should be more of a joke than a villain at that point, since mathematically he's even more unstable than the chunk that went into Harry accidentally (1/64).

He's a wizard with a wand, a Firebolt, the Invisibility Cloak and nothing left to lose. Have him die going on a suicide run against the Death Eaters, using every ounce of skill and cunning to sneak behind enemy lines and disrupt their attack. Have him attempt to assassinate Voldemort from behind, only to fail because Voldemort has decades of skill and experience over Harry. Have Harry die in a hopelessly outmatched battle with nothing to save him this time- no Lily Potter, no blood wards, no twin wands or Dumbledore.

Voldemort uses the Elder Wand against Harry and it will not kill it's master, but Voldemort's soul shard is not it's master, despite being attached to Harry. Instead of backfiring, the Elder Wand fires the killing curse like in canon- except it kills the soul shard with Harry merely being collateral damage, thus giving us a logical explanation for the King's Cross Station scene. Now that he's defeated Harry in combat, Voldemort is the true master of the Elder Wand, so Harry can't count on that in the final duel.

Lastly, in the final duel in the Great Hall, Harry manages to verbally unsettle Voldemort enough to expose a weakness in his defenses- not enough for him alone to exploit, but enough for everyone else together to. The Elder Wand is powerful, but it is not unbeatable- especially in the hands of a distracted wizard. Voldemort dies under a hail of spellfire cast by dozens people. Harry's greatest strength throughout the whole series was his friends. Not his strength or his skill or his courage, but his friends- the power of love. Voldemort could never understand risking your life for a friend's, or being willing to do /anything/ to save the ones you love. It's only fitting that his defeat is at the hands of all the people who love Harry.

There. A version of Harry's death that stays true to character while still meshing with canon.

*** I don't mind the concept of Horcruxes (Horcurxii? whatever) either, it feels like a variant idea of the Phylactery, which itself is almost always associated with evil magic users (ie: Liches). As for Harry being one or not, I go with him being a pseudo-Horcrux, where Voldemort was originally intending to use baby Harry's skull as a Horcrux (possibly as a trophy showing his defeat of the one destined to destroy him), and had therefore prepared his soul for the creation process before he even arrived at Godric's Hollow. Then, when his body was destroyed by whatever it was that Lily Potter actually did (I can't remember off the top of my head if her final moments were ever elaborated on or not), Voldemort's pre-split soul fragment latched onto the scar on baby Harry's head, while the rest of his non-corporeal form fled for parts unknown.

In my interpretation, there isn't enough to the fragment in the scar to contain any form of consciousness, or to influence Harry's personality by itself (so none of that 'the Sorting Hat wanted to put Harry in Slytherin because of the scar Horcrux' like in canon), and merely grafts into Harry the Parseltongue ability, and providing a way for his mind to be connected to Voldemort, allowing for some emotional feedback and, eventually, glimpses of what the other is doing. Which then in turn leads to Voldemort figuring out a way to send dreams to Harry, because the Dark Lord is crazy smart with magic like that.

As for him being revived, you can just claim Lily's magic didn't actually kill him, but merely get rid of his body. His soul remained intact and anchored to Earth, either because of the type of magic Lily used or some other protection Voldemort had devised for himself.

So, while yes, you have to come up with believable, well-thought out explanations that are interesting, that doesn't mean it's not possible.

And besides, there's no reason to include the diary or him dying in the first place, either. One, you can write or explain a different kind of adventure for Harry in his second year, and two, Voldemort may have not even died for certain, merely disappeared. Perhaps he was extremely weakened and took all this time to recover, not daring to show his face to Dumbledore and his followers. Or perhaps someone found him in this state and kidnapped him for their own reasons. Or maybe he time-travelled. Or dimension-skipped. Or maybe a whole new quest opened before him once he failed to kill Potter, such as Death showing up and offering him a deal to reclaim his wand, cloak and stone in exchange for Immortality.

  A million and other things could have happened. The beauty of fan fiction is you can change any of them. You're not as constricted by canon as you might think you are.
#+end_quote

Obviously, but changing those fundamental parts of entire years means you either have to cover it in some detail (which can be tedious) or come up with an alternate scenario (Malfoy slips Ginny a dark artefact, the Weasleys are bankrupted, Harry and Ron do not get their bonding duo adventures and so on) and then explore it. Which can be very tedious if you are trying to tell a sixth-year AU story but are caught up in all the changes.

And you always run the risk of losing the HP vibe if you change too much.

****** I haven't yet written a fan fic, so you'll have to take what I say with a grain of salt.

That being said, as a reader, I don't think you have to cover anything. You can just write sixth year as you want to, and damn any explanations. Maybe nothing of note happened in second year, or any other year. What does it matter. You write your story, and if glimpses of the past do come up, write them as you like as well.

As for the "HP" vibe, I'm not sure what that is, to be entirely honest with you. Or if I do, I don't see what it has to do with plot changes. I really think the magic itself is all you ever need. The rest is up to you.

P.S. Think about a story where Voldemort did die and never came back. And now you want to write about Harry Potter in his sixth year. His parents are still dead, he still survived, but no Voldemort. What changed in your mind? Who are his friends now? And, what adventures or dark wizards await him instead?

**** The diary behaves very differently from the other Horcruxes as-is. Canon kind of implies that had Voldemort succeeded in reviving himself with it, there would likely have ended up being 2 Voldemorts. So you don't really have to explain away the diary at all.

***** I don't think that's what was supposed to happen in Canon, at least the way I understood it, but feel free to disagree. Rather, I think if Diary Riddle had managed to resurrect, that's would have become the same Voldemort as we witness after fourth year.

Otherwise, you have to wonder, how does this whole horcrux business actually work? Say they killed him again, but without destroying the other Horcruxes. What now? Would he still be a sort of spirit, capable of possessing people? Attached to which horcrux in particular?

This is why I think the projection of Voldemort that we witnessed in CoS was only the Horcrux, but had it been brought back to life, it would have acted as Voldemort's main soul container, so to speak. It would have held his essence. The actual Voldemort. And the spirit that had wandered the world prior to this would have settled itself in this new incarnation - that's his actual consciousness, and not some self-aware Horcrux. The Riddle-Horcrux may or may not have been aware of this, but this is how I think it would have worked. And the same for any other later successful incarnations.

****** I assumed that the Horcruxes prevented him from dying, but inherently (Diary aside) did very little. The Diary is the only Horcrux that seems to have a true sentience, but I always figured it wasn't truly Voldemort. Tom Riddle from the Diary didn't really seem to behave like what we see Voldemort do in canon, but rather as an actual teenage Riddle.

******* I believe that's because the Diary was personally enchanted by him to gain some sort of self-awareness, or rather to be a kind of copy of his at the time he wrote it in or made it. Or maybe the fact that it was a diary allowed the piece of soul in it to more easily possess someone else who wrote in it. Either way, we have to remember, these are pieces of his soul, and I would expect them to have some sort of power other than merely keeping him alive.

As for that, that's not how I saw it. I always thought they acted as fail-safes in case he died. As in, if he managed to get himself killed, he would always be able to be revived so long as a Horcrux containing a part of his soul remained undestroyed. After all, he died to his own Avada Kedavra. So why didn't the Horcruxes keep him truly alive during that?

***** But you still have to explain a Horcrux without it being a Horcrux or make the diary the only one around. Which could work, there's no question here, but it would require some mental gymnastics.

****** Like I said, there are 2 other options, not that this one is that hard. You don't explain it.(As in, Q: hey, remember that weird diary and it's ghost? What the hell was that? A: I don't know mate; or simply not mentioning it). Or it didn't happen.

** I always got the whiff of deus ex machina from horcruxes.

I think they were a detriment to the series.
