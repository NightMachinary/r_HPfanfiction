Harry is like Barry in that him being super and wanktabular can be done cool but wanking to his power list that he never uses is always fucking terrible. Barry is often a crackhead and the avatar of an outer god Harry is a wizard with I believe in fairies magic and becomes the avatar of an outer god. Barry is a teenager out of his depth lauded a genius though he's a fucking moron, Harry is a teenager out of depth lauded as a genius though he's a fucking moron. Barry when done right is really good, Harry, when done right, is really good. do you see the similarities.

Super!Harry in fanfiction follows the philosophy (sorry for taking a naruto fanon phrase) not godlike, will get beat up sometimes. Super!Harry bitches and moans about how his life sucks and he can't do anything about it because he is either a sadist, a moron, barry Allen 2.0, a supervillain, a superhero, not Deadpool enough, or he left his Chekhov's gun at home and is too lazy to go pick it up. he gets all angsty about his problems that he won't bother fixing in any logical manner. Barry like Harry just does not bother beating the bad guy instead of sitting around doing drugs all day.

Honestly, if people would learn to write Super!Harry and JustBarry!Barry fanon and Flash would be much nicer.

btw I was talking about +Yog-Sothoth 2.0+ Barry Allen or really any incarnation of the flash.


** Um... Not to be rude or something, but... what the fuck are you talking about?

*** People bash super!harry as always being shit while I'm saying that super harry is shit because super harry is never super because fanfiction generally holds to a rule of not godlike, will get beat up sometimes making for shit stories where harry angsts about how he hates life and refuses to deal with his problems even though he is generally the avatar of an outer god( I am referring to him being the master of death as well as Barry Allen literally being speed incarnate. The purpose of my post is to see why people would disagree and continue to argue that godlike!super!harry sucks or elaborate on their views of super!harry because for every super!harry reccomendation or compliment I see someone bash he very idea of harry demonstrating even a fraction of the potential in Rowling I believe in fairies therefor fairies bullshit magic and often times him being the incarnation of an outer god.

Also I thought my post was funny in a lame you know kinda Seinfeld kinda mad ramble kinda way

**** I'm, uh, not gonna disagree with the funny part... I was just extremely confused by it.

Regarding the super!Harry trope, well, it depends heavily on what the story has as a counterpoint to him. A story that has a standar villain with no special power whatsoever will fall flat because there's nothing to challenge the main character who is overpowered. A story that, instead, has an extremely powerful and/or dangerous villain will provide some entertainment, but will eventually fall flat since the only focus that matters will be in those two characters (The Supervillain and the Superhero) and the others will fall by the wayside. Inherently, the Super!Main Character (Super Harry in this case) is not a good story device unless you make /everyone/ super, which defeats the purpouse of Harry being this godlike (or simply very strong) being that can challenge the best of the best. There is also the problem of how the Super!Harry is created, which most authors simply fail to deliver besides "Oh, I just studied a bit more than usual" or "Hidden superpower that no one else has and no one else even heard of but Harry has absolute mastery over it at the ripe age of eleven", in between others. To me is not an atractive trope, as you can easily glean from this post, and there is little leeway to the author once they fell into it.

***** Honestly, harry is a character best looked at as an emu version of zelretch, deadpool, Barry Allen, or azathoth's left nut: His character cannot be reasonably based around conflict because even in canon he felt in turns to powerful and intelligent and too much of a punk ass bitch which is made mildly acceptable because Harry Potter is a children's series with later books being about sympathizing with angst teens without insulting them. If super!harry were treated more like zelretch or Barry Allen fan on would be much better because while the fight with the moon and the fight with boomerang bastard were kinda cool it's much better to enjoy immortal multidimension omnipotent omnipresent antics than god squashing an ant or baby neowalker

** *Turns post upside down and studies it*

Okay, so let me see if I'm understanding this right. You're saying that the problem with Super!Harry is that he never actually does anything with his Super!Harry powers, because writers can't come up with a way to challenge the superpowerful Harry they've created?

Meh, it's a fair cop.

*** Basically though I should have elaborated that godlike antics and character problems would make super harry actually good rather than basing fics around the fight with the big bad. Because zelretch is a better character than the main character of whatever CoD game the kids talk about these days even though there is only one fight he ever does more than ignore/curb stomp the enemy
