That Which Holds The Image is a Doctor Who/Harry Potter crossover. I probably shouldn't spoil, but the question of what happens when a Weeping Angel and a Dementor cross paths is addressed briefly in chapter 7.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

** As I understand it, Weeping Angels don't really feed off people's "life force" in the same /sense/ of "life force" as the one you can liken to a soul; rather, they feed off the power of potentiality left behind in the timeline by the people they send back in time (if sufficiently /Who/ savvy, think the stuff that killed Akhaten when he tried to eat the Most Important Leaf).

A better bet for a /Doctor Who/ equivalent to Dementors might be Quantum Shades, who also take people's souls.
