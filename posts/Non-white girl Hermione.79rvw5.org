I just realized that it was never explicitly stated that Hermione is a white girl, or at least I can't remember. As far as I remember it was only said that she has frizzy hair and brown eyes. Now, I'd like to read a fanfiction in which she isn't white. I don't care what she is, she can be Korean for all I care, but it should be actually mentioned somewhere that she is something else than white.


** Wizards didn't care much for skin colors so I fail to see how a nonwhite Hermione would in any way affect the plot.

In FB, the President of MACUSA was nonwhite when Jim Crow was all the rage in Muggle America. Later, Kingsley Shacklebolt became the British Minister of Magic, while Blaise Zabini was very well in cahoot with Death Eater spawns at Hogwarts.

*** And from the casting for FB2, we can infer that the the Lestranges are non-white. (Remember, Bellatrix is only a Lestrange by marriage.)

**** I forgot about that!

If the British Pureblood powerhouse Lestrange was not white, then it would render 'Black Hermione' even more inconsequential for the plot.

***** Shacklebolt - and the very foreign sounding Shafiq - are two families of the Sacred 28, which is the closest the magicals get to a "master race."

Of course, we don't know whether Kingsley's complexion is of a more recent influence, but still...

*** Well, Hermione might get even more intense about house elf freedom since they're intended as analogues for black slavery in the first place.

Also her Yule ball makeover would likely involve awesome braids.

**** She was quite radical in the Books already, without understanding the whole issue completely. On the other hand, Dean Thomas, who was black, Muggle raised, and sharing a dorm with Harry, didn't exhibit nearly as much outrage as Hermione about this issue.

*** I wouldn't say it's inconsequential. Hermione being black will have had different experiences in the muggle world - she would almost certainly have experienced racism and bigotry. That could change how she reacts to Malfoy, for example.

**** I think a Black Hermione would be more sympathetic to the Magical World that lacked ethnic discrimination, but then the other side was trying to exterminate her based on blood status, which went magnitudes worse than discriminations.

**** But how prevalent is racism in the UK (esp in the 90s)? There's a new fervor over the Islamic population (and to that extent even some other Middle Eastern/Indian cultures) but were black people shunned or treated differently than white people during that time?

Racial history in the UK is very different than the US where Hermione being black would have been a very different thing.

*** I don't care if that would affect the plot or not. I'd just like to read something different. That's all. It can be just mentioned somewhere. It's just easier for me to imagine something while reading when it's actually written somewhere during the story.

** Well, it's never /mentioned/, but most believe it's unlikely to be canon. For one thing, knowing the Dursleys, Harry can't have interacted with many people of color in his life, so you'd think unusual skin color would be one of the details to strike him when he first sees her.

Beyond that, I agree with InquisitorCOC's point that since the wizarding world does not at all discriminate based on ethnicity, a POC!Hermione is a pointless change as it makes literally no difference for the plot.

** Her mother is black in the perfectly normal series. hermione says she identifies as caucasian but gets offended when people attempt to justify house-elf slavery because one of her ancestors was a slave. but its only mentioned in the third story because harry thought shes white with a tan [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]]

** Just picture her black I say.

I think I've seen the term POC!Hermiony appear once somewhere though. Maybe you can search for that on ao3, might bring up some stuff that has it explicitly.
