** I do something similar with the Riddle family of Little Hangleton here, although it's the 1920s and a muggle, not a muggleborn. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418]])

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** I can just imagine aristocratic wizards finally finding someone who out-snobs them

"Lord? /Lord?/ I have never seen your likeness or name in the Chamber or the lists, commoner. By whose grace do you dare declare yourself noble?

"Wha-the Wizengamot! Merlin!"

"/Merlin?/ Are you daft? the House of Hannover rules now, any titles given by those barbarians had to be renewed, your family's certainly wasn't"

"How dare you? My father will hear about this!" A Malfoy ancestor.

"What do I care about some jumped up commoner? The /King/ will hear about this! I will have your lot flogged for treason and falsification of noble titles"

*** I like that, except the OP said in the 1800s, so it would be the House of Hannover, and it would be the Queen if the story is set between in the 19th century after 1837.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.
