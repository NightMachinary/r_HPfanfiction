Crossover char dosen't need to be MC. They could change canon even by just being a mentor for Harry or just straight up adopt him.

** linkffn(what's her name in hufflepuff) The SI starts drastically changing cannon pretty much immediately. Also the story is well written and the SI is actually likeable for once.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
