A long line of merry-faced students lined up facing the grand stairs of the Entrance Hall. The heavy monsoon battering the lake outside had flooded the antechamber. With that and the piercing wind, it's a wonder that all of the students had made it to the school safely. Now they had, their excitement grew as they knew what came next: The sorting into one of the famous Hogwarts houses.

Ignatius had studied in great detail the qualities sought by each of the noble houses before stepping foot on the Hogwarts Express. Of course, everybody wanted to become a Gryffindor. To follow in the footsteps of Harry Potter was a dream to many. Not to mention Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom and half The Weasley family, all heroes of the Great War that took place 25 years ago. He also wouldn't mind being in Ravenclaw. To be surrounded by intuitive, bookish people might set him on the right track.

However, he had come from a long line of Slytherins, giving him a prickly, defensive side he often showed to those who immediately assumed his family to be Dark Magic sympathisers. It's true that they had not fought against Voldemort in the Great War but no more had they sided with his Death Eaters. That said, Ignatius would be the first Runcorn in a century not to be placed in Slytherin - out of respect of those who had died fighting Voldemort, Slytherin house had been abolished and replaced by 'Lidderjig'.

Just then, Professor Longbottom appeared from a door above them and beckoned the students forth. In threes and fours they made their slow ascent towards him and through to the Great Hall. It was hard not to be overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the place, and indeed a few of the more meek-looking children down front seemed intimidated by the hundreds of glares from the older students flanked on either side of them. Ignatius' eyes flicked, almost involuntarily to the unsettling darkened sky above them, bewitched to reflect the environment outside.

Headmistress McGonagall strode forward and placed onto a stool a ragged, careworn hat, that he knew to be the sorter of all students who step through the school doors. Jolts of excitement zipped through Ignatius' body; this moment would determine his next 7 years:

"Appleby, Peter!"

Prof. McGonagall called forward the first student in line - a small red-haired boy with more freckles than could be counted. Tentatively, Peter walked towards the stool, whereupon the Hat was dropped onto his head, slipping beneath his ears and hiding his eyes. The Hat sat musing for a moment before exclaiming to the Hall: "Hufflepuff!". The Hufflepuff table to the immediate left erupted in applause and welcomed Peter to the table. Elated, he ran to the table, settling himself next to two older boys, waiting for the next student to step forward.

"Beatrice, Alicia" came next, a stout little girl with a rather hard-looking face. When called upon, she marched towards the front with purpose. The hat barely stroked the hairs on the top of her head before crying a call of "Ravenclaw!".

The next student was sorted into Lidderjig, sat at the far end of the hall, leaving Gryffindor the only house yet to have scored a new addition. The following pupil, a plump, kind-faced boy was given to the Hat. Maneuvering his way onto the stool, the Hat gave a moment's pause, deliberated the decision and shouted "Enfarbeitis!".

A note of confusion ran around the hall. Had the Hat malfunctioned somehow? Nobody had quite picked up on what was said and the boy sat underneath the exclamation seemed unsure as to what his next move should be. The teachers look similarly bemused but McGonagall called down from the middle throne: "It's fine dear, it's a new house. Due to size limitations in the Hall they're just through that door to the left", she pointed.

The boy wandered over to the left side of the hall, opened the door and disappeared behind it.

As the formalities wore on, students were divided mainly between the four main houses, but the odd one or two were sent to "Enfarbeitis". None of these students then re-emerged during proceedings. Finally it was his turn on the stool: as a cry of "Runcorn, Ignatius" reverberated around the Hall.

Ignatius sat on the stool for a little over a minute when "Enfarbeitis" was heard once more. It was the thing he wanted to hear least but, at the same time, he was curious to find out what was behind that door. Without further ado, Ignatius whipped off the hat and walked towards the left of the hall, every eye on him as he did so. Pulling open the door, he found the stairs descended immediately, and steeply, to the left. At the bottom was a narrow corridor, light purveyed by torches in brackets held against the hard stone walls. The end was out of sight, giving off an eerie atmosphere that made Ignatius uneasy, but he started to walk on as he realised there was no other entrance or exit leading away.

At the end of the corridor, another, larger door was situate. He knocked before entering. Beyond was a circular room, lit in the same way as the corridor before. Despite being filled with only nine students, the room was still rather cramped.

Behind him entered a tall, skinny professor whose name he did not know. He had a short crop of black hair flecked with grey streaks sat on top of a hard-lined face, a face which was clearly accustomed to skeptical scrutiny. His overall was fairly comical but he certainly did not look like a man you wanted to cross.

Wordlessly, and without introduction, the man began handing out parchment to the gathered students - four boys and three girls. He gave each a quill and clipboard and set himself on a knobbly looking chair in the corner of the room.

"I am Professor Dowling, and I am here to welcome you as entrants into the new school programme - 'Enfarbeitis'.

Whilst residents at this school, you will not strictly speaking be students. You will not attend classes, you will not sit exams and you will not do homework. You will not sleep in the dormitories, you will not eat dinner in the Great Hall and you will not join any societies or teams. You are here for a very specific purpose".

He pursed his lips, weighing his next words very carefully.

"Minister Granger passed new legislation this summer supporting the promotion of the basic rights of house elves. This means that house elves cannot be forced to work for any institution or organisation without their express consent, and it has led to an overture in Hogwarts support staff. You see, house elves were responsible for the cooking, cleaning and general upkeep of the castle, now we have been forced to dismiss our menial workers, we have had to seek other methods".

At this, Prof. Dowling drew his wand and gave it a wave. Words appeared on the parchment Ignatius held, headed as "contract for work".

"What you hold is a consent form for work here in at Hogwarts Castle. You will sign this here tonight and bed down in the camping beds besides the kitchens. While you work you will remain invisible to the students here in the castle. You will not interrupt their studies and you will not reveal your purpose here to anyone else. You will also not be allowed to correspond with your families back home and we will preclude your access to The Owlery. You will be nothing more or less than the property of Hogwarts School".

"What if this is not what we want? We came here to be students!", shouted the little round boy who had been the first to find his way down here.

Dowling toyed with his wand before raising it sharply and pointing it at the boy.

"Avada Kedavra!", he yelled.

The boy dropped to the floor as quickly and effortlessly as a puppet with his strings cut.

"Anymore dissenters?", enquired Dowling. "Good. Now, you have work to do, those beds in the dormitories won't make themselves. Welcome to Hogwarts".


** Huh. This isn't something I wanted to read before bed.

So, what inspired you to come up with this somewhat twisted idea? I know I saw a horror one-shot once where Magical Britain became tyrannical and authoritarian after beating Voldemort, and new students who the Sorting Hat sent to Slytherin were instead put in an electric-chair-like thing and had their magic 'zapped' away, might that have been it?

How do you imagine this snippet continuing? Would 'Minister Granger' be aware of this systematic enslavement-or-murder of 11-year-olds? Is McGonagall, even, or does she think that Enfarbeitis is a private-tutoring house for kids who don't do well with normal school environments or something?

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

*** Hi there, so sorry it took me so long to come back to you (been very unwilling to engage recently)

I guess I just thought "what if Hogwarts had a darker edge" or it full into the control of a a corrupt establishment - such as the Ministry circa DH. That first point sounds interesting, almost akin to 'Muggleising' wizards.

I guess on the face of it, Harry Potter is too light and fluffy and needs to be darkened, ha!

I imagine that if this post were to continue, eventually the more compassionate staff would find out about Enfarbeitis and would endeavour to have it stopped. Waits to be seen!

Thank you for your comment.
