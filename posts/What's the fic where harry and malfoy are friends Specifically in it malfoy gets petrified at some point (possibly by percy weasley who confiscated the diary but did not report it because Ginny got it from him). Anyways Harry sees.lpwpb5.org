*** That sounds right. I'll note that Draco has an older brother in the series who basically takes on his canon role of unreasonable bigot - which actually makes sense, because it turns out that Lucius was deliberately raising them that way, and Draco turned out differently because Lucius decided that with two sons, he could afford a bet each way in case Harry turned out to be important, and conditioned Draco for Gryffindor so he'd have an in to spy on Harry. With Draco having no idea about what he was doing or why.
