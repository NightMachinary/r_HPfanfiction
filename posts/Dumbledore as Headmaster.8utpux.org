So I have read a lot of fics with a range of Dumbledore portrayals, ranging from Machiavellan-manipulator to political mastermind to fun loving whacko.

But I have yet to really come across a fic that deals with Dumbledore's day-to-day life as headmaster of Hogwarts. His interactions with students, his relationship with the teachers and staff, as well as managing his various other side-positions (e.g. Supreme Mugwump, Wizengamot Head, research related organizations for things like alchemy or transfiguration).

Additionally, one possibility might be a story following Dumbledore during the interim between the first war and 1991 as headmaster, or maybe a fic following him from PS to HBP.

But I will take whatever I can get.


** Can I get some fun loving whacko?

*** The whackiest Dumbledore is probably in linkffn(9818387). I can't decide if he is more funny or crazy, but he nails his scenes. Ironically, that author also has what was probably the pure /craziest Dumbledore/ in his other longer fic linkffn(Sixteen Years). Not good, but jeez Dumbledore was scary.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Two new tasks. Tiny amount of femslash. Sort of complete, sort of abandoned.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
