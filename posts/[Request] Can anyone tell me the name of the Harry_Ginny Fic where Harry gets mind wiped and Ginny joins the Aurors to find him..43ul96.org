I remember some parts of the fic: There was an attack on the Minister and it looked like Harry had been killed, but he had really been abducted to the US and Ginny joins the Aurors to find him and she meets some mercenary who helps uncover an inside plot in the Ministry to topple the current administration.

The title had the word *sun* in it, but I can't remember the real title and I accidentally lost my hard drive with all my saved fics.

Please help me find it, you are my only hope
