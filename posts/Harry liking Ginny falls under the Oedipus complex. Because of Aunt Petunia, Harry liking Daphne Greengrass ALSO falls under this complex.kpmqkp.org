*** There's another reply in the thread that sums it up. To paraphrase: stone-faced, upperclass, rude to everyone, overly concerned with being "perfect", worships her family over everyone else's, etc.

Its a bit of a joke, not actually saying Harry has the complex, but it falls under the same argument people use for him having it because of Ginny.

**** Petunia isn't upper class though. The argument kinda falls flat with the presumption that Daphne Greengrass has a unified character. I've read an equal number of fics where Daphne hates rather than worships her family, and thats assuming the argument can be taken seriously at all.

****** A little. I was more contending the notion that Petunia was in any way Upper Class. She grew up in Cokeworth, in the 1960s and 70s. A fictionalised industrial town in the Midlands, near Spinner's End, where Snape lived. That is not Upper Class. She's far too knowingly pretentious to be so. No amount of ‘new money' will make you upper class. She's a middle class pretender. A social climber.

**** Ginny is described as having fiery red hair, freckles, and brown eyes and she's sporty. Lily has auburn hair and green eyes and is seemingly more bookish.

The only things they have in common are being pretty and popular.

***** This WAS just a joke, but Ginny and Lily do have a lot more in common in the narrative; they both have zero time for anyones shit, were brilliant in their respective subjects and both filled a wholesome, "break from the stress" role in Harry's life, etc.

But I'm not arguing Harry DOES have the complex, nor am willing to die on the hill that Ginny and Lily are similiar (mostly repeating others arguments), I'm just drawing the fun comparison between Lily/Ginny and Daphne/Petuina

****** You say that Lily has zero time for anyone's shit but she herself says that she has been making excuses for Snape for ages and none of her friends understand why she hangs out with him given his DE association. Sounds like she put up with a lot of shit until he finally attacked her.

I'm also not sure how she provided a break from Harry's stress, he doesn't remember her and when he does it's her horrifically screaming and begging for his life.

****** No.

Ginny is far more like James, while it's Hermione who shares a lot with Lily: Headgirl material, Muggleborn, don't appreciate pranks (their attitudes toward Marauders and the Twins respectively).

It's true Ginny and Lily both have a temper, but so do many other girls, and especially Hermione.

**** No I agree that there are similarities but I'm saying that most of the fandoms critism of the Oedipus complex stuff comes from the fact that Ginny's ginger. Just because they share a hair colour doesn't mean that Harry wanted to fuck his mam.

******* Did it say anywhere *in the books* that he was actually a director? I thought always he was some kind of middle-management type still working real deals (the dinner in the second book), so he was not actually 100% manager and even less the director of the company.
