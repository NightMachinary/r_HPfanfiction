** There is this fic where Vernon gives Harry a gun. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die]]

*** I started reading this but the story was too unbelievable (characters saying things to make the story change the author wants it too without any discernible reason). I love the idea of Vernon helping Harry kill “freaks” though!

** Gun wielding Harry is rare, even in fics where guns are used on a large scale, he tends to stick with his wand. The last chapter of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290), is the only time I see Harry using guns in combat.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** It's long, and very AU, but [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] features a Harry who is basically learning how to be the next James Bond. Hogwarts in this universe is a school for the Community, the secret world of super spies and mad science. There is no magic, but the general themes translate pretty well. My one knock on this story is that Hermione is all but a Mary Sue. It's still worth the read, though.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
