Somehow I stumbled down the hole that is great dramione fanfiction. So far my favorites have been Reverse and Isolation.

I've also read The bracelet, scales and a tail, and turncoat.

I prefer darker fics, ones where Draco isn't just a "secret good guy" but someone who has views that he is questioning/will go on to question.

I feel like I'm running out of the good fics, please help!


** Recently, I finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027125/1/The-Green-Girl][this fic]], which was really good. Couldn't put it down.

  Two years after the war, a young stranger pays a visit to the burrow. His arrival alone is baffling, but the news he brings of an upcoming war turns the world upside down. Hermione's quiet, post-war life will never be the same.

**** The Fallout is beautifully written - I haven't read it in ~3 years or so (actually, that sounds like it's about time for a re-read!), but I remember the prose being lovely. Gravity is my favorite redeemed!Draco. And I've read We Learned the Sea like 3 times... I think it's a great fic that doesn't white-wash Draco's past. It's another redemption fic too, but I definitely think it has its darker elements.

** I really like /A Writer of Fictions/ and its sequels, can be found on both AO3 and HaV. Mainly because it's canon compliant to a degree. No excuses are made for Dracos previous bullshit, but rather we get the whole change of heart catharsis thing in a reasonably believable way.

- linkffn(lost images by evilgu) <- this was the first Dramione I read.
- linkffn(vengeance by elizaye)

These Dracos might be a bit too nice for you (especially the last one), but I really liked them. I haven't read half of the stories you mentioned yet, so I will check those out myself, thank you for those :).
