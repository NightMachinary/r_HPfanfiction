** linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss) is excellent (and complete). While Lupin hooks up off-screen with multiple people in the story (not named Tonks), it's 'T' rated, so no lemons.

#+begin_quote
  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

** [[http://web.archive.org/web/20081109051347/http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/emily_anne/COTDLW01a.html][Christams on the Dai Llewellyn Ward]]: Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley. It's the happiest day of the year, and the bleakest time of his life, until a complete stranger reaches out to him.

link's pretty bad (from the way back machine) but don't have another link at the moment.
