Weather as a mentor-student, Friendship or grandfather- grandson relationship. As long as they are closer than what is potrayed in canon.

I really appreciated this one, in it Dumbledore is a mentor and a grandfather figure that let's Harry figure stuff out with helpful hints to guide him there. It actually feels like a mentor apprentice instead of Dumbledore teaching him a bunch of spells and Harry being a beast right away.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.
