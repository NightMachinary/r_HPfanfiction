What if Harry was a girl? Would she be hot? Would Ron have a crush on her? Would Cedric ask her for the Yule Ball instead of Cho? What about Snape? So many questions!

  What if Harry was a girl?
#+end_quote

As a first, one could think about how the Dursleys would raise her. There are a couple of ideas there, but in the end I think their hate against magic would win out and Iris would be just as neglected and mistreated as her male counterpart.

#+begin_quote
  Would she be hot?
#+end_quote

We know that Harry isn't bad looking. If Jasmine had the same luck in the genetic roulette, then she'd be at least pretty if not downright gorgeous as her mother was said to be.

#+begin_quote
  Would Ron have a crush on her.
#+end_quote

If Ivy has similar interests as Harry, then Ron would certainly see her as a very approachable girl. But I always liked when Heather had other interest than Harry. We are still in the 80's after all and Magnolia was raised in an arguably conservative and regressive household. Ergo she would probably be discouraged by society as a whole from doing some of the things Harry did. The author may decide.

#+begin_quote
  Would Cedric ask her to the Yule Ball instead of Cho?
#+end_quote

I don't see why he should. Cedric never so much as talked to Harry. And before the tournament, Aster was probably a non-entity in his life as well, being even younger than Cho. If you remind yourself, 3 years difference were half an eternity back in teenage years. Maybe Rose spoke with him at the Worldcup a bit more? It all depends on the story, really.

#+begin_quote
  What about Snape?
#+end_quote

If Clover is looking like her mother, I could see this becoming awkward really quickly. Maybe she is taken under his wing, maybe he tries to simply ignore her, maybe shes even more of a target.

However, I could also see her looking a lot like her grandmothers, or having some resemblance to the males in the family. Its a matter of establishing the details in the story. If we ignore the recently published "real" family tree of the Potters and go with whats actually interesting, then maybe Senna could look a lot like a Black through her grandmother Dorea Potter. Wouldn't that make for a nice 9 ^{3/4} scene; Narcissa seeing the mirror image of young Bellatrix in Calla?

Also, as you might have figured by now: *Flower names*. My vote in that matter: Poppy Potter

** I always imagine a Fem!Harry to be a massive tomboy since she grew up in a mostly male household and I highly doubt Petunia would teach her how to be a girl beyond "This is how a lady should act in public!" which would probably drive Fem!Harry further away from feminine pursuits.

She would walk and talk like a boy, dress like a boy when in casual, jeans and trainers and Dudley's baggy shirts, never wear makeup unless forced and be extremely hot headed, Lily was described as being quite vocal and forceful (not sure if it's canon or not but it's my headcanon at least) and Fem!Harry would most likely receive that trait from her

Since Sirius, Hagrid and Dumbledore are canon Harry's role models, then Fem!Harry would be even more driven towards the tomboy ways, only Hermione could possible drive some femininity into her, though Ron would probably exacerbate her tomboyish nature.

Living in the girls dorm wouldn't really help since she would look down on Parvati and Lavender for being /too/ girly and only caring about makeup and gossip and Hermione is too much of a nerd.

With Snape it really depends on how she looks, if she was like canon Harry with the Potter black hair and her mothers eyes nothing much would change, however if she had her mother's hair then perhaps Snape might go a little easier on her, I really doubt he'd crush on her though, to him she would still be half-Potter.

For romance since Ginny wouldn't be an option (unless she was gay but still unlikely) then either Neville, Dean or one of the Weasley twins would be a likely choice.

** I think she'd be good looking, James and Lily were both attractive (I think or maybe that's fanon) and their kid would get good genes. Maybe not the hottest girl at Hogwarts, but with her being a good seeker and famous she'd have a lot of male attention. Ron would totally have a crush on her, shes his female best friend who plays Quidditch and who he has a lot of fun with. I think Cedric would still go with Cho. Fem Harry would have probably been crushing on Cedric and be disappointed he asked Cho. If fem Harry still looked like James, Snape would treat her the same as Harry. If she looked more like Lily there might be some creepy perving on the Lily lookalike. I envision that relationship to be like Sansa and Littlefinger on Game of thrones. He'd help her but it would be creepy and there would be ulterior motives.

** A female Harry would not have the same core friends and therefore not experience the same canon events.

Dudley, Vernon, Petunia, Ron, Hermione, Snape, Ginny, and Draco would all treat her very differently compared to the books. How she was treated by them would also heavily depend how she looked.

Most stories assume she looks like Lily, but it would be interesting to explore other looks for her. She looking like James would definitely elicit the same reactions from Snape as in the books. She could look like her relatives from the Black line, for example Bellatrix, Andromeda, or even Narcissa. That would open up completely new possibilities.

** I was writing one, and anyone is welcome to pick it up and run with it, but she was physically the flip of Harry, she looked like Lily with Hazel eyes instead, with no glasses. As a result, Petunia treated her slightly better, but refused to have any close interactions, so she had thrift clothing in roughly the right sizes instead of Dudley's cast offs, although generally out of fashion/Weasley-ish. She also wore boots larger than she needed because Petunia could only show her so much decency without bringing it to Vernon and Dudley's attention, so the same large boots were to be for several years of growth. My plans for the fic were that she was going to be far more proactive than canon Harry, directly coming into conflict with Dudley because she realized early that he couldn't tell on her because if he did, he'd be beaten up by a girl. While Vernon obviously still would have done something drastic to her, he would also be disappointed in Dudley.

I think she'd also be far more reminiscent of James in attitude, although with a very justice based angle. The Twins would be good partners in crime, until they disagreed on a target as the twins prank indiscriminately, while Heather (my Potter) would prefer to target people she thought were doing wrong by others.

Magically she would be very powerful for her age, but with absolutely terrible control, as with a lot of normal fics. She would be magically a feeler, she could perform magic far easier in uncontrolled blasts based on her thoughts or whims, and struggle a lot with procedural magics.

I don't think Heather would be hot, but then again, I only really imagined her first few years at Hogwarts. Ron I think would not have much of a crush on her, because I think this particular fem!Harry would distrust boys a lot, and so hold Ron at arms length for a lot of the getting-to-know-each-other period. My iteration of fem!Harry was also going to be split between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, as she doesn't have a subtle or crafty bone in her body. She's ambitious, but all her ambitions have to do with saving people or keeping people safe, righting-wrongs etc. In her more confident moments, she might consider being a super hero as a possible profession.

Cedric would not ask her to the yule ball, she might consider going with friends, and if pressed by being selected in the tournament, she might ask Hermione early as friends.

Snape would be curiously passive to her, unless goaded (which Heather takes care of herself, standing up for Neville and the others), where his temper would be like a flash fire, exploding suddenly, and then sulking. Mostly he would try to ignore her, because she looks too much like Lily until he looks into James eyes, taunting him from death.

I can post the fic if anyone is interested, but I have no real intention of continuing it, and I think I was only two or three chapters in. I'm not dedicated enough to write on a schedule, and I feel too guilty not having any schedule at all, so I tend to not write at all.

Then Harry would be a girl. The rest depends on the author.

#+begin_quote
  Would she be hot?
#+end_quote

I don't think so; 35,6 degree Celcius is certainly warm but I don't count it as hot.

#+begin_quote
  Would Ron have a crush on her?
#+end_quote

Ron has a crush on his sandwich, so nope, because Harry isn't a sandwich.

#+begin_quote
  Would Cedric ask her for the Yule Ball instead of Cho?
#+end_quote

Nope, being a hufflepuff Cedric is very loyal to Cho so he wouldn't just randomly ask another girl to the Yule ball.

#+begin_quote
  What about Snape?
#+end_quote

Snape would not become a girl just because Harry had.

And that's it. I apologise if it's not nonsensical enough. Honestly though, if you change the character's gender to pair them with people, you kind of fail in my opinion; do it as a “what if” exercise and follow how it naturally progresses or if your plot actually requires it, but not for pairings, please; I mean, if you have a pairing, have it be a part of the story and come naturally, not be forced and the only focus of a “story” that doesn't even make sense.
