Might sound weird, but fics where Snape had Harry with Lily and raised Harry. No main character slash, preferably complete stories.

** Aw, man, I remember reading a fic with that exact plot, but I can't remember the name. I'll look through my files and see if I can find it. I remember one of the big plot points was a spell that made Harry look like James fading, and his appearance becoming more like Severus's.

My all-time favorite fic is the Resonance trilogy (sadly abandoned 95% of the way through the third fic) wherein Snape adopts Harry. It's the gold standard for me for pretty much every aspect of fanfic. linkffn(1795399)

Fitting more specifically to your brief is the second fic in the Psychic Serpent trilogy, Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions. Explaining it much beyond saying that Snape married Lily and adopted Harry would be to risk spoiling it, but it's really good, and for me the best of the trilogy. I /think/ it could be read stand-alone, but the whole trilogy is very good. linkffn(699701)

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.
