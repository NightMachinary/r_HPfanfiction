I recently got out of school for the summer, and my head is full of story ideas I'd love to develop. I've never gotten very far in writing a fanfiction, but I've read a great deal, love to write, and would consider myself reasonably good at the mechanics. I just think I'd be a lot more likely to finish and do a good job with someone to exchange and develop ideas with, collaborate on writing, and look out for errors and potential improvements. I'm envisioning working in a Google doc, maybe, where we could build on one another's work in real time. I'm not super picky about pairings - quality is my highest priority - but I do find the characters of Snape, Sirius Black, and Luna Lovegood quite compelling. Thinking of it, though, Harry Potter is wonderful source material - I see a good deal of interest in virtually everyone. Uninterested in bashing anyone and hoping to come up with an interesting plot that hasn't been too done-to-death. Too being the key word - HP is an old fandom, after all. I see so much entertaining eccentricity in the wizarding world, and I'd love to explore that! I suppose this is rather an odd request to post here, but if anyone finds it of interest, please do get in touch! :)


** I'm interested in helping, although most of what I write is nonhp and ASP focused right now.

** I would love to write up something with you! Send me a DM or email me at chay.dazure at [[https://gmail.com][gmail.com]] !!

I can use someone to make me actually accountable to write. I have this bad habit of slacking...

*** There's very few hufflepuff stories, btw. An entire house that doesn't get as much attention as it could.

** I'm very happy to do any 'Brit-picking' and general grammar/typo editing! I love the idea of Luna, Snape and Sirius - it's one I've never considered, but could be really sweet! :) Send me an email if you fancy! garbledslur @ [[https://gmail.com][gmail.com]] :)

** Once I got bored and tried to come-up with some story outline I haven't seen before in ff. I came up with a story about a Harry who cannot die but can't use magic directly due to it being automatically used by DH to keep him alive. The workaround is to engrave runes onto a body with some fun twists like him keeping replacement hands with different runes in stasis for quick replacement. Oh, and story takes place about 200-300 years into the future, there is no SS, magic is scientifically researched and government prepares the first interstellar expedition.

Sadly, I can't write if my life depended on it, always hated those writing assignments in school. Anyway, hope you don't end up writing another ff with minor alteration to the canon, I'm quite sick of them, honestly. Gl.

*** Happy cake day! 5 years congrats!

And damn that sounds interesting, but the "scientific research" and sci-fi elements might be a turnoff for people.
