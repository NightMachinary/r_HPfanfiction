The lore of it, what it's capable of, the way it works, etc. Whatever criteria you care to judge by.

Which fics have your favorite portrayals of magic?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] is my favorite for flashy and engaging action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter]] is my favorite for a canon-themed magic systems. There are aspects I'm not a fan of, but it's still far better than a fic with Harry suddenly not needing a wand and defeating Dumbledore with one spell.

** Every story made by Belial666. The author uses canon magic very well and often quite creatively for enjoyable outcomes and her additions to magic are very believable (as well as the power-scaling, particularly in Linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House)). The author shows how exploitable the magic system is as well as how lethal and dangerous magic really is even only at (start of) first-year level when in the hands of a child that just doesn't care about blood purists' bullshit (the violence escalation made by the OC is very, /very/ satisfying to one's sociopathic side).

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magic and Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting since it delves deeper into the whole dark Magic thing. Tom Riddle pov. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

  A magical accident in the Time Room leaves Harry and Voldemort stranded in the past. Harry learns that nothing about the magical world in the 1940s is truly familiar, and Voldemort discovers there's much more to Harry than he ever suspected.
