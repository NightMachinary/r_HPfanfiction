The little bits of interaction with a phoenix in /Cartographer's Craft/ was really compelling, and so I'd like to read more stories that have a focus on phoenixes or even just little elements of them.

I don't really mean Harry having a phoenix form, but more of him interacting with phoenixes, like maybe Fawkes becomes Harry's familiar after Dumbledore's death and he has to deal with the wacky and insane antics of a bird who is really more of a child than anything else?

Preferably Harry centric, but I won't complain or say no to others.


** linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings)

Harry spends a lot of time with Fawkes in this fic, and overall its just really good and expands on the universe's magic.

#+begin_quote
  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** linkffn(3000137)

On the Wings of a Phoenix involves a phoenix (not Fawkes) who helps Harry communicate with the outside world during his information blackout post-GOF. I am not sure if it's complete, but it is quite long and I enjoyed it.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

#+begin_quote
  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** linkffn(A Mother In Law's Love by Perspicacity) has "the power he knows not" be command over Phoenixes. This leads to tension between Harry and Fawkes (that comes back to bite him in the end).

  Distraught over Ginny's death in the final battle, Harry gambles desperately and travels back in time to set things right. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned. A twist on the classic Soul Bond tale.
