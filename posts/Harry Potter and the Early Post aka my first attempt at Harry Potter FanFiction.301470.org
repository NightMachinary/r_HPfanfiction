**** It depends on what story you're trying to tell. Is this going to be a good Dumbledore or bad Dumbledore? Is Harry going to be fiercely independent from the Hogwarts crowd or incredibly grateful that they rescued him? Is Harry going to have to go back there every year anyway or are the Dursleys going to be prosecuted for child abuse? Is the Ministry going to get involved and if so, are they going to help Harry or try to use him? Are the goblins going to be involved? Is Harry going to have some inheritance?

It goes on and on really. The fact that you don't even know what to avoid tells me you don't know where it's going and you're going to wind up rehashing the same clichés that have already been done.

You really should come up with a plot before you even start writing, especially since you're starting with a cliché off the bat. You'll never get any interest unless you show how it will be better, or at the very least different, than the rest within the first two chapters. It's even worse because the first chapter is 100% "Here's the cliché jump off point" rather than having even the smallest hint of where it will go.

Now I'm not saying you should just dump it and stop writing, because just putting the words down will help you get to the point where you're writing really original stuff. Plus, even though it's not original, it is well written mechanically speaking. The flow was good and there were very little or no grammar or spelling issues that I noticed. Poor mechanics will bleed readers faster than bad plot, so you've already passed one hurdle.

I'm just saying I think you should take some time to come up with a plot, then maybe ask around for stories that fit that sort of plot so you know what not to do.

***** heres what i've got.

The evil and mainpulative dumbledore has been done and done and done to death and i dont believe i have the skill to do it effectively. I want him, like in the books, to be manipulative but not unmovable.

Also I'm going for a more sympathetic dursley family. like don't mess with us i wont mess with you.

The only inheritance I plan on is the potter vault.

I'm not into bashing. I'm going for a realistic feel to how i believe characters would act.

On relationships, I'm still going to have the golden trio but Hermione will be in ron's place as the best mate as I want her to meet harry first. ron will be more of a third wheel but still useful in certain circumstances.

One thing I'm debating on is whether or not Harryshould be in Gryffindor or ravenclaw

****** None of that has to do with actual plot though. What celestial events are going to come to pass over your characters? Are you going to stick to canon? Are you going to have the trio figure out things faster? Slower? Are there going to be new situations or villains?

The only way Harry would be in Ravenclaw is if Hermione is, and even then it's a stretch. There's no way Ron can be anything other than a Gryffindor, which means that if one or two of the others are Ravens, then there's no Trio.

Also I'm totally confused by what you're saying for the Dursleys. They abused Harry, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. So you're having them do what?

******* I mentioned Ravenclaw because a reviewer brought it up.But reading this has me convinced that Gryffindor is best.

And with the Dursleys I'm talking about a self preservation deal. A sort of agree to disagree and ignore. Although I'm currently having trouble writing that effectively and when I attempted to write in abuse it quickly went to the point of no return and I would have had to either have the Dursleys obligated or have Harry move out

****** I do like fics with Harry in other houses and actually prefer it for the degree of separation it offers from canon. Just keep in mind that you will have to limit interaction more to Gryffindor characters like Ron and will need to establish personalities for students in Ravenclaw unless you plan on turning Harry and Hermione into hermits.

*** Well the letter shows that Harry knows next to nothing about magic. I'm assuming they don't normally send the half-giant gameskeeper that isn't allowed to do magic to go get students that need to be shown and have questions answered.

Hagrid getting expelled, in my book at least, makes him a less than credible source.

I believe Dumbledore sent Hagrid because, whether he knew better or not, most believed Harry would surely know about the mgical world and probably only needed a friendly face.

But in my story they have, in writing, proof that Harry doesn't know anything so surely they'll send someone more qualified. Originally I wanted to send Flitwick but then I remembered what he looked like and how that would be counter intuitive.

I am now considering either Snape or McGonagall. Probably Snape as he has previous experience with Harry's aunt. But perhaps sending the deputy headmistress makes more sense.

Nah, it was a security measure. After the original deluge of letters failed to produce a response, and the address changed to a "hut in the middle of a lake" (or whatever that was), Dumbledore grew worried that Harry and the Dursleys have been abducted by Muggles.

So, he sent the minion whose skin could deflect small-arms fire, and who could wreak havoc without casting any spells, so there's a smaller chance of SoS being violated.

...

That's my headcanon, and I'm sticking to it!
