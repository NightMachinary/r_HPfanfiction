I wish there were more stories out there that focused on the in canon abuse that the Dursley's gave to Harry and the consequences of their actions, instead of simply making their abuse of him worse.

Being placed in a cupboard under the stairs, when the Dursley's had a two story house, and at least one extra bedroom. While there is nothing wrong with wearing hand me down clothes, the fact that they were oversized, when they could clearly buy Harry clothes, even if they weren't new, irks me.

We only see Petunia throwing around the pan once in the books, but it felt like it was long practice swinging, the implications there aren't good.

Saying your parents are dead, died from a car crash, and not to ask questions, having adults he can't trust around, to help him. While they may or may not have starved him, they most definitely didn't feed him well.

Obvious signs of being touch starved and/or being rough handled. The Harry Hunting, Harry getting another room, only for Vernon to place bars on the window, cat flap on the door, and a lock on the outside of the door! Not the inside for privacy, but the outside, where he can't get out, like a dang prisoner is abuse. No matter how you slice it.

I don't know how much money Vernon makes, but they have a two story house, and they had Dudley going to a school, that seemed rather expensive, with their uniforms and the like. He and Petunia could have spared Harry more food, more clothes and the like. Petunia and Vernon didn't have to love Harry, but treating him better would have been good.

While I felt bad for Harry as a kid, as well as just growing up, the implications as an adult are even worse. I get it, orphan kid is a pretty normal trope, but it still makes it difficult, especially if the author doesn't read up on what can happen to kids with different types of abuse, which while I like Rowling's writing, I don't think she did.

And then having fanfiction authors making the abuse even worse, with no real reason why, other then to go: Poor Harry, when they might not understand the full real trauma can be difficult to read.

There are different kinds of abuse, it can affect a person differently, depending on their personality, in canon Harry hardly asks the adults for help, probably because of the Dursley's (and because of plot).

I don't mind people expanding on the abuse, making it worse, but even then it has to make sense as to why they are making it worse, and it would be nice if it was authors who studied up on the issue at hand, before writing about it, instead of just making it bad just to feel bad for Harry.

Edit: If anyone has believable stories of abuse, rather canon abuse or abuse worse than canon done in realistic/semi realistic ways/understanding, please let me know. Don't let it just be to bash Dumbledore and/or Weasley's or just to get revenge on Dursley's and the like.


** I don't remember what it was called because I've read so many fics since the pandemic started, but there was one that handled it really well. They didn't add any abuse, but touched on it more than Rowling did.

In the fic, Hermione pointed out that one of the reasons he didn't ask the professors for help is because the Dursleys taught him not too. I hadn't realized it before but it makes so much sense.

I also like when authors point out the food situation. Like Harry hoarding food or binging on it when he first comes. I'm sure there's psychological affects like these on children who have food withheld.

*** Also, Harry's aversion to studying is very possibly from the Durselys as well. While its not explicitly said in cannon, it would make sense that they wouldn't approve of Harry outperforming Dudley, and would discourage or even punish him if he 'upstaged' him.

***** I actually never really understood that one? In GoF, both Petunia and Vernon blow off Dudley's bad report cards and make excuses for him, which makes me think they don't place a lot of emphasis on education--- plus I can't imagine either one of them caring enough about Harry's grades to ask about them. It's used a lot in indy!Harry fics to justify his lack of Hermione-level studiousness, instead of him just being... a regular teenage boy, which is probably why I don't love the trope.

****** I can't see them doing it deliberately but I can definitely see it being a byproduct of the environment.

They put him in a cupboard rather than a bedroom to keep him out of sight and out of mind, so I doubt leisure time would be something that Harry was allowed. I also doubt that they would have let him do his homework at the kitchen table or in the living room like a normal kid, let alone helping him if he didn't understand something. Harry's cupboard in the book doesn't appear to have a lightbulb or anything of the kind. Dudley is also enabled and even encouraged to bully Harry.

Ergo, Harry has to do his homework at odd times, in odd places, without the benefit of light or adult help. His homework then has to run the gamut of Dudley, who would likely find it /hilarious/ to ruin it just to get Harry in trouble.

Obviously homework isn't everything, especially in primary school, but it might well prejudice teachers against him if he appears to be someone who regularly doesn't do his homework and comes up with lacklustre excuses as to why.

**** This is more of a fanon trope though, isn't it? Canon Harry isn't averse to studying, he's just not as fanatical about it as Hermione. He gets good marks, reads his school books over the summer, gets gifted DADA books and presumably reads them, and he does well enough to tutor older students in the DA.

Just because he's a teenage boy who prefers flying and hanging out with his mates to studying, doesn't mean he's averse to or traumatised about it.

**** Well... yes and no. For sure, not caring or blowing off Harry when he got good grades would discourage him from doing well at school. Even parents who try to care can fail at being encouraging enough, so that goes in the "neglect" part of abuse.

But fics take that and make Harry go "Ggrrr, I am actually super smart and a genius and actually really studious, but I always had to hide it because I had to pretend I was dumber than Dudley otherwise the Dursleys would punish me", which, just....no.

Even if they did actively punish Harry for getting better grades than Dudley (which is not canon for me, because Dudley is....really dumb. Like, so dumb. Like, the someone picking random answers would do better than him kind of dumb. And Harry is not dumb, so he probably has normal, non-amazing, passing grades, that don't bring attention to him at all. But anyway:), that outrage indy!Harry always has is hardly the emotional response someone would get from that kind of abuse, especially at an age where he's still being shaped as a person.

***** Yeah I like a Harry who isn't used to trying hard in school and getting the best grades but knows he isn't stupid because he always learned things at school easier than Dudley. So Harry who if he put in a bit more effort could be a good student but not beat out Hermione for top spot. Also playing on the canon bit of Harry being good at practical magic but not really an essay kinda guy!

The over the top ones are the ones where Harry is like ‘while I was in primary school I hid in the library and learned quantum physics, medicine and advanced maths'. These usually hit a load of other powerful Harry tropes and while they're fun in small doses, it's definitely becoming an overused trope.

**** Yup. They have a policy of "don't ask questions" in regards to Harry. That hardly encourages learning and curiosity; traits that need to be nurtured in children. They are also proud that Dudley doesn't have a clue what's going on in the country, exactly what they think a normal boy should be like. If Harry has displayed any sort of curiosity when younger, it would've been crushed.

** I think fanfiction in general can be a way of reimagining life, our own lives and the lives of characters we love. For many, writing about abuse (and often then healing/escape/survival from abuse) is a way of telling a story about things getting better. Many of us need those stories.

When people write about the Dursley's abuse in ways that are more "extreme" than canon I think it's a way of saying "things could have been that bad." Because they could have been.

I personally have rules for myself about what stories of abuse I read. Because I have to ask myself: how does reading about this sexual assault (extreme beating, etc...) of a child affect me, others, and my general view of the world.

**** My uncle was emotionally manipulative and verbally abusive, while my aunt took his side and was somewhat emotionally distant, in the sense that I didn't get many hugs. My two younger cousins were quick to realize that they could start crying, say i hit them, and then they'd be allowed to play my PS2 (my last gift from my mom before she died) while I was sent to my room.

To make a long story short, I could very much feel for Harry, even as a kid (I attempted self-harm from my 2nd story window when I was 9, and had my first existential crisis over morality right afterwards, but that was at least partially due to an ADHD drug-induced depressive episode). So even now when I'm in my late 20s, I still have bouts of depression and lack self worth, but at least I'm going to therapy. It doesn't look like wizard have therapy.

So yeah, I got fired for, apparently, watching movies while on the job, despite the fact that my phone never left my car, and for the week I was there, I'd get my work done and them ask around for more shit to do because as it turns out, my work ethic is rather high when I'm not treated like a dumb animal.

Me losing my job gave him enough leeway to outright kick me out, because before that my aunt wouldn't let him. I'm living with my grandpa now, and saving up to have enough to share rent on an apartment.

And while it may be a bit dark of me, I do take a certain amount of schadenfreude out of my aunt and cousins all going from "your uncle isn't mean, don't be rude!" to "well, alright, I guess he's somewhat tactless, and rude, and self centered, and likes to twist your words around until he can play the victim off the most innocent of comments..." I seriously don't understand why my aunt is still married to the guy.

But hey, he literally threw away his favorite verbal punching bag all on his own, and I don't have to deal with it anymore, so it's all a win to me.

One of the WORST things I see again and again is when abuse is discovered and the adults say "why didn't you tell anyone?" and blame the child. It's truly awful.

It's a difficult topic to bring up, because of the complexity that abuse can bring, and I know it might seem odd since I brought it up, but I do love those stories where Harry is freed from the Dursley's abuse, just as long as it's handled well.

Gratuitous violence and the "weak female character is raped and then becomes hardened badass" trope are lazy writing and generally appalling. If an author wants to include extreme violence, rape, or war crimes, then they have to be "earned" by the narrative.

Each time he wore a Hogwarts uniform to do anything Death Eater related was a count of perfidy (that alone was punishable by execution) and his chosen methods of assassination (poison, arms designed to cause unnecessary suffering) also violated the Hague Convention, nevermind that he forced civilians to do his dirty work (Rosmerta, Katie) and that he targeted a school full of children. Nevermind that assassinations are also a war crime outside of things like battlefield snipers.

** The reason why the Dursely's abuse is focused on so much in fanon is because its not sufficiently addressed in cannon. I mean yes, the evidence of it is all over the place and you can see how it's affected Harry in many different ways, but there's never resolution to it. There's no moment of healing, no scene where Harry opens up about his life pre-Hogwarts, no retribution.

This leaves us all with a sense of something being unresolved, which is of course what fanfiction is born from.

I have come across a few stories where it just seems tone deaf and gratuitous, and that usually leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But that's more of a case of bad writing than than the concept itself being bad.

*** I'm a huge fan of hurt/comfort, so I'm not criticizing writing abuse in fanfiction, I'm merely pointing out the issues it causes when you write about abuse without really understanding it yourself, and that includes making the abuse worse than in canon, other than to make us go poor Harry or to get excited whenever the Dursley's get what they deserve.

I love the stories that deal with the abuse, have Harry struggle to overcome what the Dursley's did, maybe still having trouble and not completely being 100% okay, but getting better. But all of it needs to be written with some sort of understanding, of different affects of abuse; because otherwise it can come off as preachy or edgy or trying too hard, which is what I had issues with in some stories.

**** The obvious answer is that canonical abuse levels were not enough to make Harry stand up for himself or seek help and therefore you neee something worse to get the ball rolling.

In my opinion, that's looking at the problem the wrong way around, but I can see why people exaggerate canon. Personally, I think that the better way to fix the Dursley situation would be to create someone Harry could trust since especially McG (Quirrel, monster hunting detention) and Molly (not taking the Dursley situation seriously, never intervening despite knowing how bad it was) dropped the ball there.

In my own fic, I use the Tonks family in that role, but based on canon anyone other than McG, Mrs Weasley, Snape or Dumbledore would work there.

** It's definitely something I'm interested in writing about in my current fanfiction, though the topic hasn't really come up yet.

Because that's the thing, I think. A lot of times when people write about the Dursleys, they are quick to "put them in their place" or dramatically save Harry from them. It's a cathartic fantasy, since Harry had no options in canon but to tolerate and negotiate with them. He was never able to fight back, so fanfictions often give him that ability.

But in real life, you don't always have that luxury. Sometimes these things are just in the past but they still haunt you. And even if you heal from it, those things never fully go away, you know? There's less stories about that though, because it's a more bittersweet thing than "Harry gets back at his oppressors and is now 100% happy and healthy".

Anyone who forces a child to live in a cupboard under the stairs are monsters. The Dursleys, like the parents of many of the patients I've had, fill me with righteous, but borderline violent rage. Part of my dislike could be my pessimism overly analyzing subtext, but I don't think its a stretch that they abused him in more than one way.

** When I was a teen I dabbled in writing fanfiction, and I wrote a pretty horrific fic where the physical abuse was blatant and terrible, and crossed over into sexual abuse. I hadn't experienced the specific things that my Harry did, but I was processing through my own trauma. Hurt-Comfort was a favorite genre, because seeing my favorite characters overcome trauma gave me hope, and seeing their friends and loved ones helping them helped me to heal.

It was gratuitous, I have since deleted it, and I very much believe in trigger warnings.

  And then having fanfiction authors making the abuse even worse, with no real reason why, other then to go: Poor Harry, when they might not understand the full real trauma can be difficult to read.

Exactly. Canon is bad enough. I think it gets too much when the Dursleys have special torture instruments and/ or knowledge. Vernon drinking and hitting Harry with his hand or belt is plausible. Drunk Vernon using scissors to remove Harry's voice box is utterly ridiculous. And Harry survived. He didn't bleed out or get infected and Vernon didn't nick an artery. That was from an actual fic, I'm not making it up.

In another one Vernon did so much that he would have killed a grown man, let alone a child. There was either acid or bleach involved. But one memorable moment was tying Harry up with barbed wire and leaving him for hours on end. Not only would the wire cause bleeding but when tied incorrectly you can lose blood circulation.

In short: keep it plausible and leave the outright torture to the professionals.

** I get the sense that a lot of writers amp up the abuse because Harry doesn't really react to the canonical abuse, so they make it worse to give him something to respond to. The abuse in canon comes across as somewhat cartoonish in the way it's addressed.

This fic: linkffn(12951919) is the best fic I've read that deals with the canonical abuse without amping it up even the slightest bit. It gives Harry's canonical experience the respect it deserves, and examines how it has affected him in a very realistic way. It's written excellently, and no characters are bashed, but they are called out when appropriate. It's a Snape mentor fic, but Snape is very much in character throughout, and he doesn't immediately turn into a teddy bear when he learns of Harry's home life. The characterization of Harry is also very compelling.

** I found myself wishing I had toned back a bit of the 'extra' stuff I had added. I ended up removing a part in the first chapter of my fic for the exact reason you were saying. It was over-the-top without purpose.

I've thought about it a lot during the couple years I've been writing it. I definitely went in with the intention of being representative, and as time went on I think I've gotten better.

All that to say I agree with you. Abuse as a means of simply saying 'poor x' is, at best, kinda lazy. At worst, it can poorly impact someone's reaction when they encounter an abuse victim in real life.

I realized after starting that I really had something I wanted to say with the story. I wanted people to be able to see themselves in the story no matter their relation to the abuse victim, and either take solace in any understanding they might gain, or learn how they might help the individual.

Sometime you're the friends who are an escape, and the person being abused wont tell you because they don't want that reality to infiltrate their safe space. Sometimes you're the one who gets reached out to, and need to be delicate with your reactions. And sometimes you identify with the abused, and need to be reminded that regardless, it's not your fault.

** im a bit late to the party here but I feel like i remember another passage in the books where "harry had long since learned to stay away from uncle vernon's hands" or something like that when vernon was being all pissed off over something indicating that he might get hit in a moment of rage but not necessarily beaten.

To me the casual yet occasional physical abuse combined with the neglect and lack of food (at least some times) is straight up too much to not have a major effect on a child. The way harry acted in the books just sort of ignored that whole aspect of his life as well as much of the trauma you might expect right from book 1 and the shit harry goes through.

To me, the harry of the books acts very odd.

All of this means i dont really mind how authors write their harry, from much more abuse to much less, or how much of an effect it has on his character development.

ideally i would like it to not be mentioned if it is not going to be important to the story as reading about abuse for no reason doesn't make me feel great. But if they want to take it into extreme land where he is straight up killed by the dursleys or beaten nearly to death, that's fine as long as it does something in the story besides being an extreme thing for a teenager to write on his first story or whatever.

there was a story i read a long while back where harry got to the dursley's for summer break and vernon hit him hard, knocking harry down. when harry fell he landed on the fireplace ledge or some shit and broke his neck. he was taken to hogwarts but couldnt be fixed quickly and voldemort ended up being able to sneak in and kill him and win the war.

that was a great story, not because the abuse was good, but there were consequences for it.

** I've abandoned a couple of fanfics in my life due to excessive use of abuse. There were one where the Dursleys were selling Harry to pedophiles and it went on to detail the sexual abuse Vernon was doing to Harry in such a way I felt it didn't bring anything to the story, if anything it felt almost too raw and too detailed that it reflected more on the author. Perhaps they used the story to write out previous traumatic experiences, who knows, but at a specific point in time it got too much for me to handle.

There is also the fics where the author goes into deep details about sexual and physical abuse of Harry as to underline that this child had underwent trauma and then slowly, painstakingly slow (realistically so even) helping the fictional character out of it. Which might be what some readers want. I abandon it because of it's slow pace and a lack of progress. Which is what I would expect of a real living experience but of which I have no patience for in a fictional story.

Then there is the authors which goes into excessive violence to the point of it being completely unbelievable. It's usually also a good indicator that the coming story is going to be rash and so obviously made up that it's almost caricature. With leaps of faith that doesn't work and huge holes similar faults that i can't handle out of frustration.

** Okay, so I'm on mobile so I had to type your points on another device to respond. I'm going to respond to specific paragraphs then give an overall that applies to most the paragraphs.

In your first paragraph you mention how fanfic abuse often makes it worse. I really see this come down to two approaches on the abused!harry tag. One is seeing canon Harry's rather lack of reaction and deciding to amp it up to justify the reactions. The other is has to do with how it's displayed. Simply put we don't see much of Harry's life with the Dursleys and we see a lot of abuse come from those scenes. Not to mention focusing on anything amplifies it, which when it's downplayed like it is in canon makes it seem much larger.

In your seventh paragraph you mentioned JK Rowling's approach. Her approach to abuse is generally one of my bigger issues with the Harry Potter series, but I've long since accepted the JK Rowling is not a perfect author. Imo she does majorly downplay the effects though.

In the ninth paragraph you mention what I do think is probably the most correct thing about abuse in stories. For Harry Potter specifically I believe it's meant to serve as the reasoning Harry doesn't get help from adults. The issue is that JK Rowling (and many authors, fanfic or otherwise) use abuse as a plot device without truly recognizing the ramifications of it and as such issues like underplaying it happen.

In your tenth paragraph I would like to disagree with you. While it certainly would be nice to have authors be knowledgeable about the topics, abuse is a difficult one that many authors whom do this for a living mess up. As you said yourself different types of abuse to different scales and different effects exist. While there are many things that we could reasonably guess, it's difficult (if not impossible) to get it exactly right. So I think it's expecting a bit much from fanfic authors.

Overall Response

Focusing on anything amplifies it's appearance, and this is exceptionally easy with the abuse in Harry Potter. In my opinion JK Rowling is nearly as bad as some of these authors who go way overboard, she has a habit of introducing things and seemingly disregards the consequences. This is why you can take the abuse and if you simply add realistic affects can make it seem ridiculous. For example, I had to write a few essays on abuse and it's effects. One was specifically on extended periods of time trapped in confined spaces, I can rather confidently tell you that there isn't a chance that a kid who's been looked in a cupboard underneath the stairs for 11 years would look to be even a short 11 year old. If I had to give a guess, at the beginning of the series Harry should've looked 8 or 9. Also while I do have rather specific things I'll mention in a bit I take issue with, I actually don't mind authors expanding on the abuse. As I said, we don't see that much time with the Dursley's and many things (while horrible) don't tend to be looked at past the surface or what happens then. We know Harry is neglected, and suffers Physical and Verbal abuse, the kid is even forced to do the housework of the place.

Personal Lines

1 - Sexual Abuse. I'm uncomfortable with this (as most should be to be fair). This doesn't include anything that isn't shown, so it being mentioned at the end of a (seemingly mandatory) diagnostic spell by Pomfrey doesn't count, as they are typically handled differently and better than when it's shown. I've only finished about a dozen of these (I dislike dropping books so I tend to force myself to finish them) and maybe 4-5 were decent and I'd only say that 1-2 have got it right.

2 - Vernon burns everything Harry owns. I just can't see any form of Vernon that would do that. I'd imagine the magical world is enough of a presence that Vernon wouldn't send him back to Hogwarts with everything he owns in ashes. Also I'm pretty sure that Vernon doesn't know about Harry's vault so he probably thinks he'd have to replace them too and we all know that he wouldn't want to spend that money on Harry.

Annoyed Post Script Rant

How is it that Harry is bad at potions? This kid does most the cooking for the Dursley's, people who beat him of it's not to their liking. Harry is seemingly made for Snape's class. Disregarding the obvious transferable skills between cooking and potions. The environment that Harry cooks in is a hostile environment, Harry surely recognizes that while Snape'll insult him he won't get beat on for a mistake, this environment seems like it'd be the best at Hogwarts as it's what he's used to albeit more toned down and less threatening. Even with Slytherin trying to sabotage him, I'd imagine he has enough practice from Dudley to be able to prevent most of them.

*** I don't think it's unrealistic that Harry is bad at potions. Yes, if he applied himself and the skills he learned while cooking for the Dursleys, he could probably overcome the environment. But why would he? It's just one class of many. He hates Snape, so he hates potions. I definitely remember disliking school subjects because I didn't like a teacher or their methods... and then realising the next year, with a different teacher, that the subject is actually pretty cool. But Harry doesn't get a different teacher the next year. It's Snape again, and again, and after a while, Harry is probably missing enough of the basics of potions that he would struggle to follow class, no matter the environment.

Presumably, it also requires understanding of some underlying theory, instead -- the way ingredients react, possibly the different ways the can be prepared, etc. -- which Harry might have no interest in learning (and Snape no interest in teaching).

But all that is almost irrelevant, because what is the basis for arguing that Harry is "bad" at potions in the first place? He is doing well enough in exams, and got an E for his OWLs. That's actually quite good!

**** For the environment I would think (in first year) that it would be ironically enough the most comfortable one for him. He's spent his whole life surrounded by people who hate him and now suddenly is surrounded by people who quite literally view him as their saviour. I think the transition to potions would be a lot less jarring, and make more sense to Harry.

Also, Petunia doesn't seem the person to want anything but the best for Dudley, especially on his birthday. Harry is the cook for Dudley on his birthday which leads me to believe he's have at least a couple of years of experience. Doing something like that everyday it becomes harder to mess it up than do it right, even if one isn't particularly trying. He's shown to be same level as Ron and while I may buy that year 3 and beyond, first year I find it odd.

I get the point about teachers (we've all had that experience), but there have been times where I've just coasted off previous knowledge and abilities. With a certain amount of practice and background in something you can still perform at an average level even without applying yourself.

***** Maybe potions isn't all that much like cooking after all. At the very least, it's a completely new set of ingredients, which react differently and unexpectedly with each other and their preparation, due to being magical (crush with a silver knife? stir counter-clockwise? Why does that matter?). I'm not sure how much of potions class is actually following a recipe to the letter, or just learning/knowing the ingredients' properties. It's always been kind of a mystery to me how or even why you would teach schoolkids some of the potions seen in the books. Are wizards expected to be able to brew their own healing potions as adults? Is it a common occurrence for a wizard to get poisoned so you should have a bezoar ready? Or would they buy ready-made ones at the apothecary, and bring their poisoned friend to St Mungo's?

As you point out, Harry is about the same level as Ron at potions. I'd guess Ron at least has some general knowledge of some ingredients and methods, since he grew up in the magical world and would have seen their day-to-day use, or heard his brothers' talk about classes, so he's not starting at zero, either. And while Ron doesn't usually apply himself academically, he's not catastrophically failing anything, he's just an average student, so if Harry is about his level, he's probably doing okay in potions. Harry even gets good exam results in potions... so probably Snape is just grading him really unfairly, and Harry is really doing alright.

** My starting point is that Harry is a kind, well-adjusted person who engages in normal social interaction. From there, the level of Dursley abuse needs to be adjusted depending on the type of fic you are telling.

If you are maintaining the fairy tale tone of canon, you're fairly free to do whatever you like, because Harry's emotional and mental resilience is an almost magical power of its own. You could probably have Vernon flay Harry to an inch of his life and the next day Harry would be back to cheerfully making jokes about Dudley being fat.

If you're telling a more grounded story, then I think you need to tone the Dursleys' abuse down to a level which makes sense within that grounded world. So, for example, Harry has the smallest bedroom and its decoration is extremely bare. Dudley gets £5 pocket money whereas Harry gets 50p. Dudley gets a ton of expensive birthday presents whereas Harry gets second-hand stuff from charity shops. Stuff that makes Harry feel like a second-class citizen and unloved, but with a basically acceptable physical situation.

**** This is why I singled out Harry's character as my starting point. For me, Harry's characterisation is a much more significant part of the HP story than the details of his situation at the Dursleys. Therefore if there is a conflict between that characterisation and his home situation, and in a fanfic you wish to fix that conflict, then the natural thing to do is change the details of Harry's upbringing, not change who he is as a person.

Of course you can write a fic where Harry is a nervous wreck. But I would consider that to be a much more significant AU than a fic where you adjust the Dursley's level of abuse downwards to be closer to emotional neglect.

**** Oh no, I totally get that. Like I said, I agree with your post - the Dursleys' abuse doesn't need making any worse in fics, it's bad enough as it is in canon. I was just curious why two-storey home = being well-off? I wondered if it's a cultural thing, because I'd say the majority of people in the UK live in two-storey houses, rich or poor.

EDIT To clarify: big cities are obviously going to have more people living in flats but anywhere smaller, or suburban, you're more likely to be in a two-storey house. The stereotypical poor man's home in smaller towns/suburbs/rural areas is a two up, two down row terrace.

** For me, the Dursleys' abuse is overdone the moment it becomes consequential.

In canon, the Dursleys are the cartoonish evil stepparents. They exist to draw a contrast between their dreary, uptight middle-class suburban existence and the colourful, whimsical, freewheeling magical world that Harry is invited to join.

To treat them as some sort of a serious threat to Harry or an actual impediment to his development as a person and as a wizard is to miss their point. To look for consequences of their abuse on Harry's personality is as silly as carefully studying Daffy Duck's speech patterns for evidence of brain damage after Bugs Bunny drops an anvil on his head.

** "Digging For The Bones" (year 3) is really good. (Note: it is a Snape adopts Harry fic, btw). In it, Hogwarts decides to start screening for child abuse (unfortunately only /after/ a tragedy) and Snape discovers the extent of the Dursley's abuse -- years of malnutrition and many, many injuries. The author did her research well. Harry tries to hide the abuse, purposefully misses his screening, verbally lashes out, distrusts all adults, and doesn't confide in his friends. He is also furious at Hermione because she, Fred, and George went to the Professors and told them they suspected Harry was abused.

There is also a bit of Dumbledore bashing -- including a glorious scene of Molly Weasley screaming at the Headmaster for brushing off all her concerns about the Dursleys -- and Harry looses faith in Dumbledore.

Harry slowly begins to trust Snape; Snape, above all, is consistent and a man of his word. Snape also softens considerably and those moments are incredibly heartfelt. Harry also starts on his road to recovery in slow, realistic steps with help from the adults who support and believe him.

In other notes, the Weasleys are awesome in this fic and mind healers are discussed. It is also established in this universe that wizards are quite behind the times in public attitude towards mental health.

Maybe I'm in the extreme minority here, but I actually don't have a problem with this. They refuse to explain what actually happened, but that's because they have no intention of ever introducing Harry to magic, which they feel is unsafe. They actually seem to be uncomfortable with Marge implying that James caused the crash because he was drinking and driving, and while you might assume that was because they were afraid of Harry retaliating, you'd think they'd have just forcefully cut Marge off if that were the case.

** I personally dislike the fics where the Dursleys' abuse is greater. A huge part of that is probably the fact that I despise angst fics with a passion, but it also just doesn't seem necessary to me. Harry being broodier then he is could easily be done by just having his reactions to the canon abuse be more realistic.

One exception, I suppose, are fics where it's made greater as a reason to turn him dark. But even then, it just doesn't seem logical to me. The Dursleys, a family that strives to be as /normal/ as possible, just don't logically seem like someone that would routinely beat the shit out of a child.

When it comes to the sort of fics with changes to the Dursleys I'd like to read, one that I remember reading but never managed to find again comes to mind. It had the Dursleys abuse Harry /less/ then in canon, but the impact on his character was more noticable. The fic had Dursleys raise Harry pretty decently, but without any love for him. No hate, just indifference Which is quite logical in my opinion because seriously, having the canon Harry around would make them seem a lot less normal then they wanted. Instead of keeping him in the cupboard, they gave him the second bedroom. Instead of Dudley's hand-me-downs, they bought him second hand clothes. Instead of punishing him for his grades, they made him help Dudley improve his. Stuff like that.

As for where I'd draw the line on overdoing the abuse... It's somewhat hard to tell because not everyone would have the same priority to draw a line on. I would say stories where they do anything that would do permanent harm to him. Savage beatings, starving him for extended periods of time. Rape, obviously, I don't get what sort of twisted fuck even writes those.

Also, a mite off-topic, but I would love to read a good full-length fic where the Dursleys are genuinely nice to Harry from the very start. All the ones I could find were just exact retellings of canon with Dursleys being nice and a different pairing.

** Well I mean in my opinion it's not only bad when they overdo the abuse but also when the effects of the abuse are not properly shown. Like I was reading a trilogy and the dursleys apparently beat Harry no less than twice a day, the only food he was allowed was a piece of dry, stale bread once a week and I think there was a part that said the only water he was able to drink was from the toilet bowl or something like that.

The only effects that it had on him was stunted growth and mind regression. After about a day in a coma in the hospital wing even though most of his organs were shutting down, it was perfectly fine. He also had long black hair and magically did not need his glasses. His gums were fine, his bones were fine and his muscles were perfectly fine even though he was supposedly severely malnourished. Also the description of how thin he was and how bony he was are literally the same as me who is at a perfectly healthy weight. Some examples are that you could see all the bones in his wrist, could feel all the ribs and he had very prominent collar bones. Other than that his features were described as being elfin and very beautiful.

But honestly, what they do in canon would already be enough to put them in prison and remove Harry from the house, if it all came out.

What they did would severely hamper a child's development, not only physical but societal, even canon Harry would be a lot different if the abuse was handled realistically.

My bet is that JKR needed a fairytale beginning with a Hero's Journey.

But realistically, a Harry that grew up there would be very similar to Tom in how he saw the world and muggles in general.

He actually doesn't.

Typical descriptions are the likes of this: (PoA)

#+begin_quote
  Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.
#+end_quote

.

Generally, I dislike creating extra-abuse, and this explicitly includes arguing Harry /should/ have shown more signs of /being/ abused in Canon. That is reading the story backwards. Clearly, Harry does not show many, if any, signs of being abused. *Therefore he wasn't.*

That is just about the only way to argue about Canon, because everything else is resorting to subjectivity and interpretation. I admit I also don't get the point of doing so -- Harry Potter is not the story of a survivor of abuse, so why try to fit it in there? If you must argue that Rowling made a "mistake" in her writing, then clearly, it wasn't Harry's reaction throughout seven books, but the supposed upbringing before that.

But as a side note, I also disagree with the original premise in the first place. Yes, abuse can leave traumata. However, it needn't. Typically, you get assertions such as this one:

#+begin_quote
  Despite some variability, overall, child physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect were found to approximately double the likelihood of adverse mental health outcomes when combined in a meta-analysis.
#+end_quote

(Source: [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507962/]])

, and as the baseline likelihood isn't all that high, it's perfectly possible to have a shitty childhood and be well-adjusted adult. The big one is sexual abuse. But that's not what anyone would argue happened here (I hope).

.

In FF, of course you can do anything you want. The "Harry is abused, and this story is about getting over it"-storyline doesn't appeal to me, but then, I don't have to read it, so all's fine. What /does/ make me roll my eyes, admittedly, is the gratuitous abuse, where it serves no purpose beyond showing how evil the Dursleys are. That's the equivalent of Dumbledore stealing money (indeed, sometimes they go hand-in-hand).

That statement of Dumbledore is why I deeply dislike him as a character.

It is not as clear cut as that. He obviously downplays the abuse, never or hardly ever mentioning the Dursley's. Okay I was wrong about the touch, but look at the other things I mentioned, he was abused.

Stucked in a cupboard under the stairs! A cupboard, how can you say that's not abuse? You don't need to hit, sexually or verbally abuse a child, neglect is also apart of abuse.

The Harry Hunting, Vernon and Petunia let Dudley do whatever he wanted to Harry.

Harry was finally placed in a bedroom upstairs, only to have a cat flap (why is a cat flap for a child of all things needed?) He has locks on the outside of his door and bars on his window. That is abuse! It's a sign of neglect, but it is also abuse, neglect is a sign of abuse and none of it is okay.

Harry is a quiet kid (likely because of the Dursley's) there can be sure tell signs of abuse like bruises, but sometimes there are none. Or at least nothing you can see outright, if you don't want to see it, that is.

The way a child holds themselves when they are around certain adults screams that something is wrong. How Harry constantly doesn't want to be with the Dursley's at all, hell he was willing to live with Sirius, after he offered, and he didn't even know him that well! That tells you something.

**** Without doing a deep dive, here are a few "competent adult" fics that I remember and like:

** I feel that the abuse gets too much for me when it becomes sexual. While the Dursleys are shitheads, they aren't that.

** I tend to like most depictions of the abuse in fanfic, whether it's more harsh or less harsh. JKR's descriptions leave room for interpretation either way - is Harry perceiving it as worse than it is, or is he internally downplaying the worse elements as a defensive mechanism?

I'm not usually a fan of when it turns into sex abuse, torture etc. - but tbh it's not like adults /don't/ do that to children, even their own children. It's just my personal preference not to read about that. There's even implicit canon support, given that its canonical that wizards heal faster and more efficiently than muggles, it /would/ be quite possible for Harry to be injured and still not show visible scars at school.

** What annoys me the most is when an author uses abuse as the reason for everything they don't like about Harry/his actions. Generally this is combined with abuse of way higher levels than in canon.

​

I find that this essay shows most of my thoughts even if I don't agree with all of it.

** For me it's two much when the abuse is sexual. I just don't like reading that kind of stuff. It makes me angry and half the time it goes on for too long until there's a resolution (if there's a resolution) to that part & I get tense & anxious.

If anyone wants to read a fic that mentions Harry being abused I wrote two.

The Potter Brothers (A story where Harry has an older brother and a younger brother. It doesn't go too deep into explaining the abuse & there aren't long, emotional abuse scenes. Currently on Hiatus due to writers block. Eleven chapters if I remember correctly.)

Harry and the Potter System of Multiplicity (Harry Potter has Dissociative Identity Disorder. Only has two chapters but I'm currently writing the third. The abuse is slightly more severe than in canon but I don't have any full scenes of it because I didn't wanna trigger anybody. I did explain at the start what happened to each alter for them to split off though.)

** I tend to try and avoid fics that focus on that as I don't really find it enjoyable to think about how terrible humans can be written as if the author wills them to be Physically Evil. From reading the books I always understood that Harry was never really wanted, that due to fear from being attacked the durselys couldn't really move out of their own house and that they were forced to adopt the estranged sisters child because she died. They resented him and it shows but I don't think they ever truly had malicious intentions for him. Dudely being a bully isn't great in cannon, but we see as he grows he learns himself that he was an asshole and takes steps to try and improve himself to being better than what he was/how he treated harry. In the case of Petunia and Vernon, while the arrangements of where harry was sleeping originally being under the stairs has many go abuse and distaste, we never get actual dimensions of the thing, and from what I can recall and from what I can imagine its possible that it while not great wasn't the most inhospitable thing on earth, especially for a child whos about or under 4 feet to 4 and a half feet. They never beat him, the chores while in fanfiction are made ludicrous but from what I can recall they weren't too different to things I did or helped with myself. Was exempting Dudely from doing them bad parenting, yes but then again something I know many of my friends had to live with in their lives.

​

Untimely I think if your fic has a plot point of the Dursleys being comedicaly evil its too much, most people try to make harrys origin from the one chapter at the beginning of the book to set his tone for the year into something much larger. I'm not saying don't write about abuse, but it should never be about how in this fic they made the abuse to be that Vernon removed finger nails instead of spankings if Harry was just a little to loud and instead being how harry felt about the fact that his guardians basically hated his parents and treat attacks on his liberties, as a valid way to feel in control of their lives.

From what we know of cannon, and of dumbledore is that he is fallible and that if given the option he probably would have allowed Sirius to raise Harry without issue had he know about the switch. People will try and make absurd plot points to stand out and I think over doing the abuse to harry is just something we see because its low hanging fruit and people who have been abused think Imagine if harry had to go through something similar to what I had to, and write it or they think Imagine if he had to go through this ridiculous trial. I'm rambling so I'll just end things here by saying J K Rowling isn't known to be the best at fully thinking things out, look at her attempts to create/explain an infrastructure for the magical population, with how she describes said populations size and its economy in relations to how their money is valued and interacted with in the markets visible in her official writing. So even if most is too much I still kind of just hand wave it away if the rest of the writing is good enough.

TLDR: I think its too much when a fic focuses about harry being abused makes it about what exactly was done to him than instead of how he reacts to it. Another way it could be done instead of just him reacting to it instead of how many just show the different one up man ship of cruelty would be just how no one really even tries to focus on the fact that it might not be true abuse that the Durselys ever did but the shitty parenting which they did for all under their care did in fact affect him to the extent that it became actual abuse.

** Canon abuse is to much for me. If a fic goes in depth on abuse I won't read it, I get to upset and angry. I like a story where canon Petunia and Vernon get what they is owed, a beating and prison time. Ideally, I'd like a fic where Dumbledore finds out early enough and takes both kids from the Dursleys. You don't need Petunia for blood wards to work only Harry and Dudley.

** abuse comes in many different forms but it always feel weird to read abuse written by people who weren't abused idk it just rings hollow to me. I 'm fine with how the books handle it because its a childrens fantasy book not Oprah Book Club. ( I like how in the books you can tell kind of JKR's darker life experiences in the series. Domestic violence is a recurring theme in the books because she's a survivor.)

** Ok first of all why didn't Harry call child abuse? I think it also would've been better if Harry was left in an orphanage because that's where Voldemort/ Tom Riddle was left do it would make sense if his equal had the same treatment growing up but Harry would be nice to the other kids instead of nearly killing them or stealing their toys. However the owners would still think Harry to be strange

*** That's like asking why didn't an abused married person call the cops? You are often brainwashed into thinking that the way you are treated is perfectly normal.

Harry is also a child, he had no idea or didn't understand what the Dursley's were doing to him were wrong, even in canon he tended to downplay things, or act like it wasn't a big deal if someone brought it up.

Emotional manipulation is a big thing, having a person or people have a certain power over you.

*** Orphanages weren't used in the UK after the 60s or 70s, which is before Harry's time either way. He would've been put in the foster care system.
