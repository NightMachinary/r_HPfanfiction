bit vague but i've been getting back into HP fic and going through all my favourites from years ago and reading them now that im older i've realised how full of plot holes and bad writing they are, seeing as i was 12 when i read them it makes sense. i'd like to find some long fics to hopefully captivate me but shorter ones or crack fics are welcome too.

i'm mostly interested in hermione centric fics, i don't mind any type of characterization, plot or trope as long as it's well written. i love love love slytherin or darker hermione fics, some of my favourite fics of all time are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7296376/chapters/16571095][temporal paripatetics]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][ACA]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11908664/1/Pocket-Change][pocket change]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11568740/1/Brilliant-Magic][brilliant magic]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11967877/1/The-King-s-Indian-Attack][TKIA]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11402812/1/Desperate-Measures][desperate measures]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11221036/1/When-She-Drowned][when she drowned]]. i'm also reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][six pomegrantate seeds]] which is really interesting and i've read the green girl by colubrina too which i didn't like. if theres anymore good ones out there let me know.

i also really love alternative family fics, whether it's born into or found family or some other variation, like desperate measures (again), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12272349/chapters/27892320][an unexpected malfoy]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13625910/chapters/31287798][yesterday is tomorrow]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12780890/1/The-Gnarled-Tree-of-Time][GTOT]], i really hope there are some more i just havent found yet.

and i love interesting concepts and magical theory, like the arithmancer, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5309891/chapters/12259118][oath breaker]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11800899/chapters/26618625][the demonologist fic]]

any ship at all is good and i'm a big big fan of unusual or bizarre pairings/friendships/triads/poly ships. the only one i won't read is snape because i hate him and think he's ugly. i don't mind darker characters, i read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3503700/1/][a cute lucius/hermione fic]] the other day which was fun and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11360093/1/Loyalty][a barty crouch jr one]] which was interesting and i really liked.

some favourite ships are:

hermione/fred/george

hermione/fleur

hermione/pansy

hermione/luna

hermione/harry/ron

hermione/viktor

again, sorry this is so vague i really am willing to read anything as long as it doesn't look like it's been written by a 15 year old in the middle of their teenage angst.


** Both [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Inell/pseuds/Inell/works?fandom_id=136512][inell]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2106788/Bedelia][Bedelia]] are very good writers who write mostly Hermione centric stories of various pairings.

Here's a couple of my favorites -- linkao3(4429844) linkffn(7383815)

** Recommending my own fic here (The Brightest Black), but the number of reviews and faves show that some people consider it well-written. It's Draco/Hermione but is completely AU starting with that Halloween back in 1981.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10654712/1/Lady-of-the-Lake][Lady of the Lake]] is one of my favourite dark Hermione fics - Colubrina has written a lot of dark/Slytherin Hermione or Ginny fics but this one is a favourite of mine.

** If you like Hermione/Ron/Harry, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(11858167;12076771), are must reads. “Sum” is a totally awesome fic and very popular here, and “Girl” is an interesting crossover featuring zombie battleship BismarckMort attacking Britain (Muggle and Magical).

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in a sci-fi universe with super powers. If you don't insist on magic, it's one of the best Hermione centric fics out there.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
