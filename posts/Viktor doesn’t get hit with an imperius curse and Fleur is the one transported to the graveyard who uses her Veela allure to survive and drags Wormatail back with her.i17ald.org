** Something fairly close happens in Hope and Healing: linkao3(13855500)

Harry and Fleur team up for the maze when Harry catches Viktor before he can take Fleur out of the competition. Fleur transforms in the maze, which comes in useful in the graveyard - she and Harry get portkey'd there together.

There is Allure usage in a later fight in the Ministry for Magic.

*** Do you mind explaining a bit what the author means by that the story deals seriously with abuse? I'm interested in it but not keen on an angst-fest.

**** There's trigger-warnings for graphical descriptions of it in a few scenes (chapter 13 and 14 specifically), and the fic explores some of the emotional repercussions of long-term abuse over the course of making things /better/ for Harry.

Not gonna lie, there's a few angsty moments especially around the aforementioned trigger-warning chapters. It's not a constant thing and Harry does have a good amount of /happy/ moments as well, so I wouldn't describe it as a full on angst-fest, but it is present.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. On Hiatus. Note in ch. 34.

** In my headcanon, Fleur mostly inherited the hotness from her Veela side of the family, but her effects were rather weak, only making Harry feel relaxed, as opposed to the full Veela who induce a completely different effect on Harry while they dance during the World Cup. They make him feel really happy (like under the Imperius) and worried that if they stopped dancing something bad will happen.
