I'm really keen on fics where Harry isn't the Boy Who Lived. I think I read most of the ones where he was a twin (who either is or isn't the BWL), but I haven't read that many where it's Neville (or some OC) or Harry travels to some AU and AU!Harry is the BWL.

So, I was just wondering if anyone knew of some good, completed fics with Harry going through Hogwarts without all the BWL attention.

It fits your criteria, and the writing is extremely good. It's not completed, but not abandoned either.

Harry is still the BWL, but it doesn't really come into the fic, which is focused on normal Hogwarts life.

** There's quite a few where BWL!Harry time/dimension travels to some other time/place where he's no longer the BWL. Are you looking for something like that?

**** That's a huge area then. You're better off searching through the subreddit yourself. You'll probably like most of the time travel/do-over fics regardless of Harry's status as BWL.

There are literally dozens more really good Harry and/or whomever go back in to their own bodies type travel fics.

As for ones where he's just Harry and not some time traveler and not the boy who lived... well I don't think you're going to find one where he just lives his life. I mean, he's either the central character and gets involved in those sort of plot elements, or he's ignored and non-existent. Unless you want twin-fics too, in which case there's even more of those. There's always a reason Harry's not the boy who lived and I haven't once seen one where it's neither because that universe's him died or he has a twin.
