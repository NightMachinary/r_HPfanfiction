Ok, I just need some Slytherin!harry, preferably fics where he doesn't just act exactly the same as he does in canon. I'd also prefer the story to start in first year though I'm fine if the story doesn't.


** Ao3

The Sarcasm and Slytherin series

Unfortunate it's been orphaned but the four and a half years of Hogwarts that we have are right up there with "On the Way to Greatness"

I'd link it but the last time I tried that it didn't turn out well

** LinkAo3(Prince of Slytherin)

In my opinion, one of the best Slytherin!Harry series.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. Where Harry is returned to a young age while also becoming Lord Slytherin because his brother failed twice to take his place in the prophecy and the higher powers are upset about it.
