Harry tries to go back in time to stop the manipulations of Dumbledore but instead he ends up in a world were he has a brother who's thought to be the bwl and lily and james are just shit parents


** Harry tried his very best to get free from the manipulations of Dumbledore. Unfortunately it was just impossible - maybe it would be easier if the guy wasn't dead (Harry didn't even know how Dumbledore kept manipulating him after death).

He had mastered the best and worst of magics, joined the Wizengamot gaining the Potter and Black Seats and even learned Occlumency which should have impossible for him.

He had researched even more into Horcruxes, the Dark Magic even Dark Lords feared. He had found out ways to extract Horcruxes from living vessels without killing them, found out ways to create Horcruxes with minimal sacrifice, found ways that even Riddle hadn't dared to tread into.

Still no matter how much he learned, no matter how much good he did - it always felt that he was Dumbledore's puppet.

He had cleansed the Ministry and Wizengamot of Death Eater sympathizers and made it impossible for Death Eaters to rise again - yet it felt as if it was Dumbledore's will.

He had implemented ways to make the Muggleborn integration into Hogwarts smoother and removed the monopoly of the Purebloods in the Wizarding World. Yet it seemed like Dumbledore's will.

He had learned the deepest of Dark Arts to spite Dumbledore, yet he found out that Voldemort was mistaken on the nature of Horcruxes. Dumbledore was probably smiling wherever he was.

No matter what he did, the vision of the white bearded bastard puppeting him never disappeared. Ginny's affection, Ron and Hermione's friendship, Susan Bones's likemindedness, nothing helped.

And so, he decided to use a ritual to go away. A world where Dumbledore wouldn't haunt him anymore. A world where Harry would never have these nightmares.

After making a will and entrusting his assets, Harry Potter went to a Saint Mungos and used forbidden magical arts to grant health to the patients at the cost of his own.

A art fragmenting the soul for immortality, a art requiring sacrifice. Harry imagined Riddle's face if he knew the true method of creating Horcruxes.

And as his life disappeared, the his pure soul with his consciousness bound by the ritual disappeared to awaken again in a similar yet different world.

+++

Awakening in the new world, he found himself facing familiar sights. His mother and father. There was also the twin of his, Ryan. Cute kid. If there was to be only one Boy-Who-Lived, Harry would prefer it to be his brother rather than himself.

Childhood went on as usual. He couldn't even speak, only gargles coming out of his mouth. Uncontrollable accidental magics only made his parents smile. He felt melancholic knowing that his parents would die soon and he could do nothing to help.

The countdown until Voldemort came began ticking. On that fated day of Halloween though, his parents disappeared and left Sirius to mind him and Ryan. That day when Voldemort came, Harry realized that there probably wouldn't be any Boy-Who-Liveds. He didn't really mind.

Harry felt the ward of Fidelius shatter first. After that, a battle of Dark Magic began. Sirius gave as good as he got, but his Godfather was no match. And so he died, years before he should have.

Looking at Ryan sleeping peacefully, Harry smiled as well, preparing himself for death. The magical chandelier on the ceiling sparkled with multicolored lights. Standing up on the crib, he awaited his would-be killer. There was no mother to sacrifice herself now.

Voldemort walked in. Tom Riddle looked more charismatic than ever... actually he looked more effeminate than ever. Long hair, slender hands, even the bob on his neck was invisible. If not for the flat chest, Harry would have doubted his gender.

The wand was pointed and the curse was whispered. "Avada Kedavra." There was nothing more to be said.

Accidental magic was somewhat slower than wanded magic. That's why, the chandelier fell from the ceiling a moment after Harry was struck by the green light of Death. Harry didn't know about his success in protecting his brother as he lost consciousness the moment he was struck.

When he woke up, he found himself outside a certain house in a baby basket. Motherfucking Dumbledore cast a few protective spells on him before ringing the bell and leaving.

Ryan wasn't there - Harry knew that his twin still lived. Harry knew his parents were alive as well. So why the fuck was he here? It was all that motherfucking Dumbledore's fault!
