I am terrible at explaining this but this scene from linkffn(Harry potter and the hero's prize) is a really good example of what I mean

spoiler

/I walk down the beaten earth path between the gravestones, lighted wand in one hand, and a single white lily in the other. The night is dark and cold, and the only noise is the wind through the trees. The memory of the warmth of a small cottage by the sea, and of the beautiful woman in it, keep the chill away from my bones./

/I kneel down at the gravestone and set down the flower. "Hi mum, dad." I let the silence stretch a bit, uncertain about what to say. "So much to tell... but I guess you know it all already."/

/I take the wand from my pocket. "Yew and phoenix feather core, thirteen and a half inches, rigid. I couldn't bring you his head, but this would do, I think."/

/I pull my own wand, brother to the one in front of me and wave it in a short circular motion. "Igneous". Stronger than "Incendio", the spell produces a fire intense enough to burn bone and melt most metals. Still, it takes a bit for the wand to catch fire. I keep it for a couple of minutes, and, at the end, there's only ashes and a dark stain left./

/I feel a tear coming down my face. "He stole so much..."/

/There's a touch of magic in the air. It's near midnight on Samhain, and this is the moment where the chasm between life and death is thinnest. The sacrifice is accepted and a lightness sets on my shoulders. The feeling is that I've done right, that they are proud and I am loved./

/For a while, I stay there kneeling. When I get up, I feel bone tired and cold, but more at peace, in some way, than I've ever felt./

/As I turn around to walk away, I cast lumos, I notice two ravens perched in a low branch nearby, looking at me. A large one, scruffy and with an eye missing and a smaller, young looking bird./

/The larger bird caws loudly and pecks at the smaller one, which looks annoyed and steps sideways a bit. I feel a slight, tentative connection poking at my magic, coming from the younger bird./

/I can't avoid smiling. "Hello, little one."/

/The larger raven caws again and flies away. The other one, which I sense is a male, looks at me sideways, in a hesitant way and makes a soft sound, like a muffled rattle. I can feel the curious, mischievous mind behind the beady eyes, my weird bird sense waking up after a long, sorrowful sleep./

/The excitable little raven is a sharp contrast from the pride and quiet intelligence of my beloved snow princess. He flutters and perches on my shoulder, pecking softly at my hair./

/"Are you a gift?" He caws, and I feel a subtle nod from the surrounding magic./

/"Thanks mum, dad."/

/Tom's wand was a fitting sacrifice, and magic responds to such things, sometimes in surprising ways./

basically I want magic to not be something you need to wave a wand for or some sort of weird ritual

another good example would be linkffn(Curls and kisses byluxsolis)

  Post-war fic, begins in the first Halloween after the Battle of Hogwarts. Some romance, a little drama, a little adventure, maybe some lemons. After all his pain, a hero deserves a little reward. Harry and Fleur endgame, maybe someone more.
