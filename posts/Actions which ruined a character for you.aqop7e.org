What were some actions which ruined a character for you, which put them firmly on your shitlist? Can be anything, from big scenes like Dumbledore's ten dark years confession up to throwaway lines like Ron assaulting his driving instructor to pass the exam.

*** I wonder if Snape ever realized that he became what he hated most - a bully, particularly to nervous/shy/dorky/not-fitting-in-well kind of kids like he used to be.

My thoughts on him can be summed up by that post that says something like "Lily and James fought FOR the light because it was the right thing to do; Snape fought AGAINST the dark because it had pissed him off." There's a world of difference in that.

**** It's been a while since I've reread that scene, and wow the line, "Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back," really sticks out to me now, because it's /so/ similar to how, in Snape's worst memory, the crowd was jeering and laughing at him.

(Also, while that line incites a very visceral rage in me, I think the real deal-breaker is the "After all this time?"/"Always" bit in DH, because it shows how Snape, to the end, only cared about Harry as an extension of Lily. It weirds me out how romantic fandom considers that line to be, because I think it's a pretty damning indictment of Snape's moral compass.)

****** It's not just that he doesn't like Harry, it's that, to him, Harry's life would have no intrinsic worth were Lily not his mother. Look at these other lines in the chapter: "I thought . . . all these years . . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily," and "Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe." The idea of keeping Harry safe for his own sake doesn't even occur to Snape.

Snape was cruel to Harry, he was cruel to Neville (Hell; he was what Neville feared the most, that's not a good thing).

He was cruel to Hermione; saying that he noticed no difference after Malfoy's attack.

He was an adult, he was a spy; yes, but he was an adult who attacked children (Verbally; yes, but it still doesn't make it right).

But the fact of the matter is, Snape is a terrible human being. Fighting to kill a madman does not make a person good. Neither does the fact that he was pivotal matter either towards that.

Snape may have had good qualities... But in canon he is a bully, a murderer, and arguably obsessive. He may have been brave, cunning and fighting for the Light, but he made school children cry, murdered someone infront of children, allowed the use of torture on children (if he didnt know about umbridge, look at book 7) and allowed the use of restricted potions on them. (book five). Morally, he isnt a good person.

Perhaps your reaction to someone killing someone you love is revenge, but iirc Snape was just... overwhelmingly guilty. He felt he fucked up with the prophecy and like he condemned Lily to death, which tbh he pretty much did (much accidentally). He had a pretty twisted sense of morality and justice though, to be sure, which is why he responds to that guilt only with actions he deems right -- like saving her son's life time and time again.

How he acted towards Harry, on the other hand, smacks of revenge, hatred, and general pettiness. But that isn't apparent in his reasons for fighting Voldie. His feelings towards Voldemort doesn't come up at all, pretty much ever. It's just always Lily. You gotta give a guy credit sometimes for unrealistic obsession

Yes, Snape was a bully to his students and should have never become a teacher in the first place, but he tried to do the right thing in the war and atone for his past mistakes. This two things aren't mutually exclusive, because people (and good characters) aren't black and white and can have complex motivations. You can be a jerk and genuinely want to free your world from a genocidal maniac at the same time.

Seriously, reading all those threads how Marauders's bullying was completely justified and how Snape is an absolute worst person ever with no redeeming qualities is starting to turn me into a Snape apologist, and I've never expected THAT to happen.

** Dumbledore saying that Malfoy's life matters more to him than the lives of all the students and staff of Hogwarts. Having the gall to scold Harry and lie to him when he confronts him about his inaction. He went as far as to taunt Malfoy for his "feeble attempts" on his life. I wonder how that conversation would've gone had either Katie or Ron actually died, knowing that an invisible Harry was an audience. Or how greatly his inaction could've backfired had Harry or Slughorn died to the poison.

The plot of DH makes more sense if Dumbledore's ultimate aim was to safeguard Snape's reputation and life rather than the war effort or Harry. Namely, his shitty plan that led to Battle of the Seven Potters that caused Moody's death and nearly killed Mundungus, Kingsley, George and Hermione; not telling Harry about how to destroy Horcruxes just to have Snape pass on the Sword; not telling Harry that he was a Horcrux and then having Snape tell him that he had to die by /Voldemort's/ hand for some inconceivable reason.

The trope is that Harry is 5'5 or similar which is no where near the book version and I don't consider the movie version to be a good guide for height just because the actors were picked before they reached their full height.

I don't want to be that person who says, /"Well, actually..."/ and then espouses some contrived nonsense, but, the 80% number is closer to the maximum variation observed, according to [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-of-human-height/][this website]], with the floor on genetic effect being around 60%. So 20-40% of variation in height is due to nutrition.

Keep in mind how short the average person was in the middle ages and how height in modern industrial nations have steadily increased since then faster than genetics could account for, and beyond the 20% disparity.

It is possible that good nutrition from 11-years and onward counteracts some of his malnutrition as a child, but the years through age 10 are probably the most important for development with the occasional growth spurt thereafter.

I do wonder why people obviously noticed the issues but never seem to do anything about it. It's a pretty common trope in fanfiction to have whoever is Harry's guardian come up with some nutrition potions / diet plan as a direct result of canon-characters' failure to do jack-all about it.

When it comes down to it, the Dursleys being abusive (instead of mostly neglectful which is still child abuse) would force the story into a much darker path since the 'light side' would be condoning/turning a blind eye that abuse while the 'dark' side are terrorists/prejudiced elites.

********* Well, actually the shift happened during the shift from Paleolithic to Neolithic culture and diet. The Paleolithic people were a lot taller than Neolithic ones, if way smaller in number. It had nothing to do with the Middle Ages (the Dark Ages fallacy is something of a pet peeve of mine, but I won't go there).

​

As to Harry, he was thin for his age but he was not starved at all. The Dursley abuse is almost always overplayed in fanon. All they did was yell at him, stunt his social growth (which didn't do much, Harry was a sarcastic asshole and not a meek child) and tell him that his parents were drunks. Not stellar, but not really child abuse (apart from the whole cupboard thing... but that's a children story device, that doesn't really fit with their depiction elsewhere).

​

As to why they did nothing... perhaps there was nothing to do? Harry is fairly tall, said to be the same height as his dad, who was spoiled rotten. He's not as tall as Ron, but definitely not described as short by the end. Also fanon writers forget that magic has limits: it couldn't fix Moody or George's ear, Wizards have to wear eyeglasses, Mundungus stank, Snape had oily hair and crooked teeth, the list goes on...

​

Of course most of that is due to JKR's laziness and poor world building, but still, the point stands.

*** I feel like this is mostly fanon. Percy, Fred, and George left for reasons that had very little to do with their relationship with their mother. We don't know much about Bill and Charlie, but they both have talent and (presumably) lucrative jobs that happen to require a lot of travel. Griping about things like Bill's hair is something plenty of mothers of young adults do, and being overprotective of her youngest child and the emotionally-abused orphan she's pseudo-adopted are only natural.

Couple that with some casual prejudice against her background and Fleur didn't have the best of times in Book 6 .Thank god she saw the light at the end but it didn't need for Fleur to "prove" herself worthy in the first place, And her treatment towards Hermione after Skeeter in Y4 was one of the Yikes moment as well

*** I don't know... I think I'm actually with Molly on this one. When Sirius decided to go after Peter he decided (whether consciously or not) to abandon Harry in favor of revenge. A Godfather is supposed to take care of their godchild if the parents are dead. Lilly and James would have never wanted Petunia and Vernon to raise their kid. Worse, its very likely that Sirius had met the Dursley's at some point and knew what kind of people they were.

I think that if Sirius had lived, there would have come a point in the series where Harry realized he was the adult in their relationship.

Having said that... I do think she's very controlling as well. And saying it at this point doesn't help at all.

Quote is Hagrid in POA. Sirius /didn't/ abandon Harry. He very explicitly tried to get custody of him first, before anything else, but Dumbledore stepped in.

Without Peter to prove his innocence, I'm not sure how Sirius was to have gone about convincing Dumbledore that he wasn't the Secret Keeper in order to get Harry back. Offer to take Veritaserum, perhaps? But, it's cheatable and at this point, Dumbledore would be thinking he in league with Voldemort. And even if he proved to Dumbledore he hadn't betrayed the Potters and was fit to get his godson, there's still the issue of /Peter and the other Death Eaters would want to kill them both./

Getting the rat first was like Occam's razor to his issues here. To say nothing of the fact that he's clearly in shock in this moment (quote before this talks of him being white and shaking with grief, and of course, the infamous laughing) and not acting rationally.

To take that scene and have Molly throw it back in his face is just really nasty for a supposedly nice character.

  Ron's the one that mentioned Malfoy being the Heir of Slytherin first, noteably by quoting Malfoy's comment on seeing the first blood message that Ginny left under Riddle's possession.

  Most of Sirius being a killer was from everyone else. He'd been seeing that Sirius was a criminal around on wanted posters and in the news, heck Shunpike mentioned Sirius being a murderer, when McGonagall, Hagrid and Fudge dropped the bomb of why he'd been thrown into Azkahban, namely he was suspected of being the Secret Keeper and murdering 13 people.

I don't see the distinction.

Cormac is capable of using magic, sure, but he wasn't in a position to expect to have magic used against him - let alone defend himself against it - at the time Hermione confunded him. Indeed, Hermione exploited the situation to use magic against him without his knowledge, for the sole purpose of unfairly disadvantaging him /and/ circumventing the rules/fair play. And she did it because she wanted to see Ron be granted a privilege that he probably couldn't have earned by his own merit.

In both cases, magic was used against a person without his knowledge or consent, when that person was unable to defend himself, and it was done in order to break the rules so Ron/Hermione could make sure Ron got ahead. Whether the target of the charm is also capable of performing magic is irrelevant to the analysis here, given the circumstances.

My whole point is that in both cases, it wasn't a “fight” at all --- it was an underhanded exploitation of someone who was not able/prepared to react or fight back.

Cormac is a wizard, but he didn't have his wand handy because he was participating in a sport tryout that doesn't involve wand use or spell work. Cormac is /capable/ of using magic in general, but he obviously wasn't prepared to defend himself from an unexpected and inappropriate assault while he was busy playing quidditch. Hermione knee that and exploited the situation and his vulnerability to use her wand against him to get what she wanted, without Cormac's knowledge (and to his detriment, seeing as he lost out on a coveted Keeper position that his skill probably would've earned him otherwise).

The Muggle driving test evaluator can't use magic at all, and doesn't even know magic exists, so of course he isn't able to help himself.

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter who the person is, it's still equally shitty to stab that person in the back when they are just walking around and going about their day. You're still sneak-attacking an unarmed person who is innocently going about his day according to the rules and expectations of that situation.

Book 5 was all about Harry realizing that HE had to stand up to Voldemort and be proactive in the fight against him, and in book 6 he just went back to waiting for Dumbledore to give him something to do.

Ugh, I'm sort of on your side for this whole argument so far, but here's something pertinent. OK, in brain development, there's a period of idiocy, where the risk-reward balance skews nearly /all/ the way over towards 'reward' and 'risk' is all but irrelevant, when making a decision.

It's a very dangerous time, especially because this is the same period when parental figures are cast aside, and peers have nearly all the influence. The teen drops being 'X's child' and becomes 'adult friends of Y and Z' as their core identity, a necessary part of becoming independent.

So, you have someone who does't care about risk because their synapses are being pruned and their entire identity is being reformed. Like toddlers, teens are basically suicide-machines.

He lost his one single father-figure and was put in isolation with the Dursleys again and adults are going on and on about the war when he's out of isolation and all working visibly on trying to keep a happy face despite that. I think that does have to be taken into account. There's a depressive period of grief, especially if you can't let it all out, and Harry never does except as anger. Being reactionary rather than pro-active is /very/ characteristic of depression. And depressed people can be just going-through-the-motions, rather than visibly depressed. Though you can say he shows no other signs of that and, well, I couldn't argue!

I mean, on the whole, I think you're right, he becomes very frustrating to read about and is nerfed horribly. He approaches greatness and then takes a hard turn straight back to mediocrity and passivity.

Except that Harry was more closely linked to Dumbledore (the closest thing we Harry gets to a father figure) As for Sirius, he and Harry weren't that close actually and he acted more like a friend than a father.While Harry was grieving it was more for the relationship that they never got to have.

There's an actual scene in the books where Harry /explicitly/ sees Sirius as a father-figure. He has a question and goes through how people would react to it. In the end, he writes to Sirius, realising now he has an adult he can just ask things like a dad.

I can't remember what the question actually was or which exact book.

Yes, there's very little interaction for Harry to cling on to, but he actually, in-canon, does. Iirc this is revisited in the tearing-up-Dumbledore's-office scene. (I... will avoid the rant on how Dumbledore handled that.)

**** I see it, actually.

She starts off as a Harry Potter fangirl, who has read about him in books. Follows him and Ron around, being bossy and annoying.

Then she's rescued, and becomes friends with Harry and Ron. Both, because you can't befriend just one of them.

Ron accepts her in a begruding way, but says awful things to her constantly. On the other hand, no Ron, no Harry, and Ron /did/ take down a troll for her. I see her being friends with the Harry-and-Ron gestalt. Given the choice (GoF) she chooses Harry. It was always about Harry.

Then Krum comes along, who is heroic and famous like Harry, but /better/. Actually intelligent and studious and interesting /and interested in her/. It turns out that Harry isn't jealous, but Ron is. So, of the Harry-and-Ron gestalt, at least Ron wants her, even if he shows it in an unhealthy way.

James and Sirius were best-friends-forever. Hermione doesn't like the idea that Sirius will make Harry be a substitute James, and condescends to him, copying Molly. But it does model for her the idea that close wizard friends stay friends basically forever.

And, Ron's a prat, but he's consistent in his not liking Hermione being with other people. From December 1994 to December 1996, that doesn't change. This half of the Harry-and-Ron gestalt likes her and does so reliably.

And, during the nightmare camping trip, he goes away, but he comes back, and in all that time, hasn't so much as looked at anyone else. He'll always come back to Harry, and if she stays with him, she'll always be close to Harry too.

So, she's like Harry's sister. Possibly her own feelings have been squashed down, perhaps she feels that way too. But, well, if she marries Ron, she knows what she's getting, and that it isn't going to change, and Ron /does/ mostly do what she tells him to, and doesn't attack her, even when she attacks him. He's a prat, but a safe one.

Pair this with all the shared experiences that no one else is going to ever understand, and you have the recipe for a dreadful but lasting relationship. I'm not saying that they had a nice marriage and the bickering '19 years later' is probably an entirely typical exchange and snapshot of their marriage. I'd find them exhausting to be around personally. But I /do/ see it.

Yes, she'd be better off with almost anyone else, but that doesn't keep her close to Harry Potter, and life around Harry Potter is bound to at least be interesting.

It's not about justifying Snape as he is, but the way it's presented as a whole idea. Like 90% of the book people think Snape is bad and no one trusts him. From literally everyone but Dumbledore, no one trusts Snape, or if they do it's literally only because of Dumbledore's word.

So I don't think it's out of character for Remus not to mention Sirius' animagus form to Dumbledore because he was afraid of facing Dumbledore's dissappointment. I imagine him growing more and more conflicted about that as the year progressed, but he kept silent because he didn't know how to explain why he hadn't said anything before.

I'm not sure /what/ Umbridge oozes, but I'm not convinced it's femininity. The pink, kittens, and cutesy voice seems more like little girl stuff, so it might be immaturity--or consciously projecting sweetness when she's anything but.

Casual use of magic on people without their consent goes a /lot/ further than Molly and love potions. In fact, with widespread use of Memory Charms on muggles, wizards have built their entire society on a foundation of this kind of corruption. How about the Ministry renting a field from a muggle farmer for the summer and not caring if they give him brain damage keeping him from noticing magic in real time?

If anything, I think the reason that Fleur is disliked, is that she's a snob. She scoffs at the idea of Hogwarts being a comfortable home, continues to wear her traveling shawl long after most of her fellow students have abandoned them (though maybe there are some biological differences being a part-vella), and calls Harry "a little boy" when he says he's a Champion.

Given that she is a metamorph and can do rather significant shifts of her face, giving birth would probably be a five-minute affair for her. And painless.

But her whole character is just inconsistent. I love her in OotP where she is that casual badass who is the only one not openly scared of Voldemort. I even get that she is depressed over Sirius' death in HBP. Survivors' guilt and the whole thing.

But the entire Lupin romance feels off. She could have pretty much anyone. Lupin has very few positive traits depicted in canon (he is always treated as a good person, yet his actions speak otherwise). He is neither some pick-up god like Barney Stinson nor does he look like Mr Universe. So what exactly does Tonks see in him? She takes him back after he broke their vows three months into their marriage. Honestly, the whole romance is nothing but a character assassination for her. And now I feel like writing a story where she and not Lupin shows up at Grimmauld.

Edit: Also, if the battle is lost, her life is forfeit. As is Teddy's. It is a shitty situation, but unless you want to go with an utterly anticlimactic battle (eg the defenders just mow down wave after wave of Death Eaters or "1 Mandrake kills them all"), the one way she can make Teddy's future safer is to fight at great personal risk.

Aside from Tonks being much more of a free spirit in Book 5, the biggest problem is that it happens almost completely off-screen. We don't know what happened between them (though I'd guess commiserating over Sirius's death was part of it), but it seems to come out of nowhere. It's more troubling to me in a meta-sense, since it feels shoehorned in to (1) foreshadow Merope's depression leading to a loss of magical ability and (2) leave an orphan behind after the war for thematic reasons.

Also, they have vastly different experiences in life. Lupin seems to be self destructive and defines himself through his curse. He makes three friends, all of whom are dead by HBP. Compare that to Tonks, who seems to be easy going and fun. She was 8 when the war ended. At that point, Lupin had spent his youth fighting. Tonks time at Hogwarts was also vastly different (with the possible exception of the Quirrel year). Then she went out to have a stable job while Lupin couldn't keep one.

And it's not like Tonks sat around Grimmauld the whole time. She had a full time job, so she might do the odd job for the Order, but she also has a life outside of it. Unlike what we see from Lupin.

It irks me to receive a favor when I can't just immediately balance that scale.
3. He's been at the "negative" end of that scale for most of his life. Dumbledore did him a favor, his friends have done him favors, his best friend and his wife died to save everyone, his other best friend is a perceived psychopath that betrayed everyone.... and when they reunite and truth comes out, his friend dies a year later.
4. He has to constantly rely on the Wolfsbane potion, which is brewed by Snape while he's at Hogwarts, further flaming the guilt and other complexes, especially given their past.

It's just a lot to deal with as a 20-something. Maybe Lupin tried to write Harry, but the letters all got blocked by the Owl-ward Dumbledore set up, and maybe he just grew more and more despondent to Harry's situation and never knew exactly how to broach the subject. Maybe he figured, like everyone else in the Order who worships Dumbledore, that the kid was fine and in good, caring hands, and that there would be plenty of time to catch up later. Maybe he figured his involvement in Harry's life would just inevitably lead to conflict or more bad times. What if Harry grew up hating werewolves?

I think Lupin tries, and he's at the very least a competent professor that engages his students and makes learning enjoyable. For his personal issues, the man could very well have demons eating him alive like everyone else in the story, but they are not readily obvious to a teenage boy's point of view, so we don't get to see them "on screen."

Just my random ramblings.

****** So, trying to put him together myself:

In canon, he hid who Sirius was, even when he was getting into the castle through secret passages that he must have known about, and in disguise in a form he certainly knew about.

Then he also hid the fact he knew Harry at all (I know, I said before). He was perfectly good with all the kids, but he didn't forge a personal connection until Harry was all on his own at the Hogsmeade weekend in the week of the full moon, and when Harry went to him for lessons. Then he drops that connection as soon as he's fired. Harry mentions/thinks about the fact he doesn't write.

Confronted with Tonks, he refuses a connection until he's worn down into accepting marriage. Confronted with fatherhood, he runs off.

He's skilled and capable as a caster. He's not stupid. He does what Dumbledore tells him to do, rather than stay by Sirius Black's side. He doesn't hate Snape, who brewed his wolfsbane, but doesn't like him either.

And, as a teen, he pretended to be reading rather than call out his friends for bullying.

So... I see him as being passive-avoidant. He does whatever draws the least drama onto himself, and has no personal ambition whatsoever. His instinct is to retreat or hide from difficult emotions or from being tied down. Telling anyone about Sirius would mean broaching schoolday wrongdoing and being interviewed, so he hides it, since he's the only one alive that knows.

His motivation is whatever leads to his not having to make difficult decisions or take on responsibility, but given the choice between an argument or responsibility, he'll go for responsibility over drama - then flake out on that. He is the broken reed that bends and cannot be leaned upon. Very agreeable and nice, since he's non-confrontational, but not someone you can rely on.

So, starting drama is OOC, but flaking out is very IC. I can see him being too busy for engagements he doesn't want to go to, rather than saying he doesn't want to go. Confronted with something, he'll go along with it. Dumbledore can obviously get him to act, then Sirius, then presumably Tonks. He'll say yes and fail, rather than saying no.

He was perfectly ready to help Sirius kill Peter, but I honestly see him as more being ready to go along with Sirius and rely on his wand to do the job, or hoping/knowing Harry would step in, than his actually /wanting/ to kill Peter.

At the battle, I can see him going along because it's expected, then mainly fighting in self-defence, or seeing off Dementors, but not really attacking, and definitely not making command decisions. It being a form of suicide makes sense, but so does his going along because his friends will all be very angry if he doesn't.

I like him better than any of the Death Eaters, but really /not/ as a parent at all, he'd be terrible.

The alternate answer is that Harry hadn't actually spent much time at the Burrow:

- After Year 1, he was there like two weeks.
- After Year 2, he wasn't there. The Weasleys themselves were in Egypt.
- After Year 3, he was there like two weeks.
- After Year 4, he wasn't there.

The Lovegoods might have visited, but Harry and we readers wouldn't know.

It was also possible that Luna became increasingly weird after her mother's death that she and Ginny (and Ron) fell out. With the stuffs Xeno had been spewing out in The Quibbler, Molly should have strong reservation getting too close to him, and Luna was super defensive of her father.

****** I'm not sure why Molly would insert herself into Luna's life or feel maternal towards her at all.

Luna's mother died, and that's very sad. Her father is a strange bird, that's for sure. But Xeno has a business (however disreputable his tabloid, and however modest the income may be) and a home, and Luna is generally cared for and happy. She and her father have a close relationship.

Oddity alone should not trigger intervention by a meddling neighbor with no particular prior social attachment to a widower and his daughter.

Harry is a different matter entirely. He was an orphan whose relatives neglected him. Molly first met Harry when Harry asked her for help getting to the platform - he was only eleven and completely alone. From that point he and Ron quickly became best friends, Harry got to know the other Weasleys in Gryffindor as well. And of course, for several years at least, there was literally nobody in the Wizarding world looking out for Harry on a personal level, outside of school.

Molly definitely has plenty of maternal instinct to go round, and she isn't beyond some meddling and intervention, but we don't see her step in to parent any and all of her children's classmates at random. Harry is a unique case, where Molly stepped into a major void in his life, and Harry needed that (and almost always appreciated her for doing it).

In Luna's case, Luna didn't have the same void that needed filling, and she never had the same relationship with any of the Weasleys to warrant that kind of intervention either.

Ginny probably fell out of touch with Luna after her mother's death - you could say that it was Mrs Lovegood's death that caused Luna to become more /Luna/. And in school, they were sorted into different houses, and Ginny had to deal with the possession in her first year, and recovery from possession in later years, so...it more or less makes a lot of sense when you look at it from that angle.

Sirius may have meant to send Severus down the Willow to see Remus as a joke, but it was something that would have killed Severus AND Remus. If Severus died, Remus is a goner. And a dead goner, because he would have committed suicide out of pure shame and guilt. Dumbledore would have been sacked as well. Luckily James pulled Severus out!

I'm not sure when the Willow incident occurred, but if it was before the events of Snape's worst memory, then its thoughtless as well in the part of the marauders (and tbf, Remus was careless too.) If someone held a secret against my best friend that could ruin or kill him, I'm staying out of that person's way, or try to be nice.

I believe this thread means "ruined" not in the sense that, omg this character became 100% awful" and such, but rather that it spoiled their feelings about the character. The opposite of rose-colored contacts, so to speak.

*** But it is a matter of perspective. For example, quite a few people dislike Lupin and Tonks for going into battle while leaving behind a newborn. Yet to me it is a necessary action because if the battle is lost, their lives are forfeit. So is Teddy's. Therefore, the best chance to ensure a future for their child is to fight.

Don't get me wrong, it is a shitty situation to be in, but depending on your perspective it can be unforgivable or a necessary evil.

******* A couple of things on that note, assuming her mother is a normal middle-aged woman, she's unlikely to ever have an in-depth enough look at her uterus (through ultrasounds, tests, whatever) to see uterine scarring. But if she had a untraumatic pregnancy, utérine scarring would be unlikely in the first place. Also, not everyone gets stretch marks, and even if she had gotten stretch marks, after nearly two decades they would be faded to the point of invisible. On top of that, stretch marks can come from gaining or losing weight or growth spurts, so there's a whole number of reasons someone might have stretch marks.

Not saying there's not a whole bunch of other potential issues with Hermione modifying her parent's memories, but I don't think physical evidence of pregnancy would be a huge factor 17 years after the fact.

I would assume they'd want a reason as to why they never had a kid. Presumably, the first place to start would be at the ob (who would likely know she already had a kid and tell her but tests could be run too).

Also, iirc they're dentists who don't have much sugar (tho I'll be honest and admit I can't remember if that was canon or not). That would lead me to think she wouldn't have a bunch of weight gain so the only stretch mark she'd have is on her belly and maybe boobs.

********* Okay, I went RL with this and asked my obstetrician Father in Law a hypothetical question lol.

An ob MIGHT identify a woman has been pregnant, because the nipple colour generally changes in pregnancy and doesn't revert, however that's inconclusive and would rely on the on previously knowing the patient (in which case, the ob would be like /a kid? Yes lol I helped you give birth like 17 years ago, should I call the cops?/)

Nearly 18 years on, after only one child, it's unlikely that a normal birth would have left any significant mark on the cervix/uterus that would conclusively say they had a child and the nipple change could hypothetically be caused by a miscarriage or puberty in the first instance.

Stretch marks, again in particular with a single pregnancy, would probably not be visible after that long, and if they were FIL says /'the brain is really good at rationalising weird things'/ and it's another thing that could've happened with puberty. My stretch marks will never go away but I know people who were back to smooth washboard abs in like 3 weeks after giving birth.

And the infertility/potential ob visit/other questions could easily be explained by the fact Hermione supplanted an entirely separate life in their memory. They weren't Mr and Mrs (Drs) Granger, they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins. Maybe Wendall and Monica never wanted kids. Maybe they tried for years but were never able to. Assuming Hermione isn't a complete moron with constructing their story, there's little reason why a probably 40+ year old couple (they were both dentists with an only child, seems likely they at least waited until they'd finished school to have a kid) would one day go ‘hmm, how bout that kid we never had, better check in with an ob'. Also Hermione made it their hearts desire to immediately move to Australia, so even if they did decide that, they'd be going to see an ob in Australia who wouldn't know she's had a kid and the only case for it would be circumstantial evidence that could be explained away because why wouldn't you tell your new ob that you'd had a kid before?

Tldr; physical evidence would be minimal and the human brain is whack w justifications, plus magic is also whack.

Numbers suggest 75-90% of women tearing so it's likely she also tore and maybe needed stitching. For me, this wouldn't be something I'd be able to dismiss (and something I'd doubt hermione would know to take into consideration).

I think England also has a folder with your pregnancy notes, which I would assume she'd keep as sort of a memory thing. That sounds like a weird detail to bring up in regular conversations and even weirder to keep out on the coffee table.

Have you ever interacted with someone who suffered from alzheimer's? My family has a history of it (we don't have great memories to begin with) and it's honestly my version of hell. I would think what she did was something like that, especially since so many of their memories and major decisions in the past 17 years would have revolved around her. She took away a huge chunk of their life. Honestly, her actions made me somewhat sympathetic to the witch-burning muggles. The Death Eaters weren't doing anything that muggle serial killers and terrorists don't already do, but Hermione felt free to traipse around people's minds and erase memories as if she had every right to decide their actions. Erasing a five minute event (accidentally witnessing magic, etc.) is one thing, but nearly two decades of life is something else.

Snape's impudence here is astonishing. He is one of the direct causes for James' death, and he has the audacity to gloat about it in Sirius' face. Sirius and Remus both know who leaked the prophecy to Voldemort - a prophecy is revealed, and all of a sudden, the Potters and Longbottoms go into hiding while Snape makes appearances in Order meetings, with Dumbledore's reason of "he has reformed"? Does not take a genius to figure out what happened and who leaked the prophecy.

It's only Molly who sees the worst in Sirius at this point, being the uncouth harridan that she is. And in hindsight, telling Harry of the prophecy was absolutely the right thing to do.

There is enough grounds to assume what went on - Mulciber's father was a Death Eater, Mulciber himself is later revealed to have an impressive control over the Imperius curse, Lily is thoroughly repulsed by one incident - far, far more than everything the Marauders have ever done, and she declares it to be Dark magic. Teenagers are quite capable of casting the unforgivables, as we see a young TMR and DM demonstrate. Juveniles are just as capable of rape and murder as adults - there have been enough and more violent crimes IRL to prove that.

From all those, it is not a baseless assumption at all.

*** I agree about Harry, actually, but I'd also kind of like to add Ron to the mix.

Hermione is by no means a perfect character either, but I always felt like she got the short end of the stick so many times. Neither is a very good friend to her. Forgetting the time in first year (kids can be kids and say mean things, I know), I can't forget all the stuff in the third book. Harry gets a new Firebolt, Hermione suggests they check it for curses - given that, you know, Sirius Black is roaming around, /and Harry's things have been tampered with in more than one Quidditch game./ They both stop speaking to her for days.

Hermione's cat may have eaten Scabbers. Ron stops talking to her, Harry doesn't bother to ever check that she's okay - for this one, more of my blame falls on Harry, because I understand being upset at someone for their pet potentially having been eaten. But why didn't Harry care? Hermione spends the entirety of the Goblet of Fire helping Harry when Ron doesn't, and then at the Yule Ball, he just leaves with Ron even when he knows she's upset?? I think the fact that Ron was Harry's prize in the lake rather than Hermione was kind of telling. I can't recall a single time when either have apologized to her for any of this.

Harry isn't good with emotions. When tensions flare between Ron and Hermione, he prefers to keep his head down and let them sort it out themselves. He also doesn't understand the difference in their banter, as they're both argumentative people, yet he thinks any arguments are going to come to a row. And just like with Cho, he doesn't understand a female perspective, so he doesn't try to comfort Hermione, as he can't empathize with how she's feeling.

And yeah - I think that's what I was trying to say, she puts more effort into her friendship with them, and it just rubs me the wrong way sometimes. There's so much evidence about how much she cares, but when I see Harry awkwardly walk away or say nothing, it makes me sympathize with her. Hermione's presence is often seen as a nuisance.

While it is primarily concerned in trying to show why Hermione wouldnt be a good romantic partner for Harry in future books, it does delve into how Harry sees both Ron and Hermione. There are a lot of annotations and examples to back up the claims too and I find it pretty revealing.

In many ways, Hermione's fatal flaw would be her lack of tact. Yes her smarts and knowledge would solve a lot of problems in the books it shows that being right doesn't mean being convincing. In many ways, Hermione's character could be a critique of the "socially-awkward" genius type that has been popping up recently because characters in story get irritated by her overbearing personality. So While Hermione and Harry are certainly best friends, Harry probably would be worn out by Hermione for extended periods in company. Of course it doesn't help that he has life-threatening problems every year in school and so he looks for whimsy and humor in trying to cope with the stress of school life and real life. So this is probably why Harry and Hermione wouldnt be too romantically compatible

On the other hand, it really highlighted some of Hermione's flaws that I hadn't thought about in a while. It's true that she invested /a lot/ into her friendships, but I kind of understand now why it was difficult for Ron and Harry (mostly Harry) to do the same in return.

I guess it's sometimes easier to sympathize with someone who appears overtly hurt although they clearly care, like Hermione, but reading this made me sympathize with Harry, too - he was dealing with a lot, and his main support group (Hermione and Ron) didn't really know how to handle his emotions.

  There is no evidence that the spell he used against James was Sectumsempra, especially as Harry did not recognize the spell in the next book and it did not have the same effect on James as it had on Draco.
#+end_quote

Snape cast it nonverbally, and a spell is more powerful when cast with the incantation. It also only grazed James' cheek, whereas it cut straight across Draco's chest. And I don't think Snape would have used a severing charm in a duel. Just doesn't seem his style.

****** The lack of evidence (although I think if the spell required special healing as Sectumsempra does Snape would have been expelled) leaves us with just that: opinion. I don't think Snape would use that spell lightly, even as a teen. It would just be stupid of him. The severing charm is more likely.

Hermione was held prisoner by Umbridge, not the other way around. And Hermione is not responsible for any actions the Centaurs commit. She holds neither a position of authority nor a position of power which could be used to stop the gangrape or brutalisation from happening. I mean,

- What was Hermione supposed to do without a wand?

- There were more important things going on than saving a woman from the situation she had gotten herself in through ignorance and incompetence.

- Centaurs are not humans. They are not subject to any UN treaties.

******** I am not opposed to teenagers having consensual sex in a story if they are above the age of consent (14 here in Germany, 16 in the UK) because I know that it happens. Random explicit scenes are not good for the reading flow, but fade to black or even implications work just as well to get the message across. I mean, horny teenagers + no adult supervision...

I am sick and tired of all these Hogwarts students suddenly acting as if they are from the bible belt because clearly sexuality is evil. I am also sick of the regular romance arc which ends with either the couple getting together, their engagement or marriage. Get them together by chapter 5 and show me how the couple faces hardships together.

Somehow, that apparently makes me a paedophile or something.

Edit: To further clarify, I don't mind such themes if they are naturally integrated into the story. I have no wish to ever read about teenage pussies or budding chests ever again. But you can mention and even depict consensual underage sexuality without fetishising it.
