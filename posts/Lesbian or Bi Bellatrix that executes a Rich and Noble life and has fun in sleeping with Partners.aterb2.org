It can even include all the evil characters are "normal" and there wasnt any conflict. So Bellatrix would life with her Families Rich and Noble lifestyle, but has the greatest Fun by sleeping with male or females. Im freely open iwth her persona. Well, i guess, she would be extroverted and funny, but also being seductive and gentle. Even a Snobbish behaviour (and if its just for the fun sake) is good. I dont know, if her Family members are ok with her "wildlife" style and would prefer, if she just find a Solid Partner, no matter the Gender, but Bellatrix refuse this, because (in her current state) this solid life is boring in her eyes.


** I don't understand all these hyperspecific requests? I too want a midget harry banging Minerva in front of femDumbledore while Snape claps in the distance, but maybe straight midget porn would work better. Y'feel me?

*** Sometimes a fantasy scenario just gets stuck in your head and you have to scratch that itch. But, you can't find anything to scratch with. So, you reach out to the community to see if anyone has seen it.

**** Well yes. But there's a difference between asking for let's say Slytherin femHarry with an X pairing and asking for a femHarry named Natasha who gets sorted in Slythering and fights with kungfu instead of spells and uses magic by expelling AK's out of her eyes randomly.
