Recently i have run out of fics to read, and found myself wanting something specific to read, namely a fic where a fanfiction reader is transported to the hp world, meets harry during the summer before 4-5'th year, and explains to a cannon clueless harry all the inconsistencies in his life, and convinces him to start taking his life seriously. (Studying/training?) Weasley/dumbles bashing would be loved too! (And no slash stores) Don't know if those type of stories exist but so far google has failed me :(


** There might not be a specific fanfiction reader one but I reckon there are many Self Insert fics out there, some of them might be what you are looking for.

EDIT:If it's not one then mb. It just seems like I've read summaries with this basic premise a million times as I scrolled through FFN.

*** It's not that common on HP fanfictions. It is super common on One Piece fics. I remember recently(as in, couple months back) every fifth fic was a Self Insert. Only two were any good.

** It's not really what you asked for but 'nobody told me the rules' is about a reader of harry potter is dropped into the world and befriends harry. It's funny and I enjoyed it even if it isn't the best fic out there. linkffn(10851278)
