** The Golden Trio Mystery/Detective Kids AU - It is one of my favorite ideas, but I haven¬¥t really found much of it anywhere. I think it is a great concept, because there is already so much to work with. Harry, Ron and Hermione are trying to solve some kind of mystery every book, and I imagine exaggerating and building that up in the style of childrens detective novels. There are many different spins you can put on it.

A darker tone, really digging into the strange happenings at hogwarts and giving it a creepy mystery atmosphere. Or making it more fluffy and funny, with smaller 'side stories' besides the main plot or even a world without Voldemort, where the Trio is known as the place to go with problems that you don¬¥t want adults involved in, solving cases for their fellow students. Or just using it as a plot device to introduce new ideas into the canon story by letting them discover them in their investigations.

Another one I would really like to discuss is the potrayal of magic in fanfiction. But I'm not great at putting my thoughts into writing, so I don¬¥t now what I want to ask or how to start a conversation on this.

** I haven't read a whole lot of fics with weird, unexplained magic / sentient magic, but JEEZ that stuff is soooooo good. I think a lot of people are drawn to fanfics to recapture old feelings of discovering magic so I love when writers push the boundaries of what it can do and really just put mysticism back into it. Magic as a sentient thing is a great plot mover too, tbh

*** I agree! I usually avoid Drarry, but I found a fic where Draco goes back in time and is chosen by Bellatrix's wand to be its master. The wandlore in the fic kept me riveted enough to suffer through the teenage romance. There are eventually a couple of blood rituals and interesting potions too. I'm so glad I kept reading and I would have if it weren't for the wand.

(Though I have to admit that it is refreshing to read about an actual teenage romance that's actually awkward and fumbling because that's what teenagers do.)

***** It's a looooong series (the latest fic is only six chapters in and already 50k words), but Draco is enough of a prissy asshole to make it entertaining where it could drag on. And Draco is overpowered, BUT he is an adult given an extra seven years to study magic AND I'm pretty sure the wand has soemthing to do with it. At one point, Bellatrix says that it will take just as much as it gives and it's got enough of a foreboding history to give her words weight.

The wand was initially created for Grindelwald and the most recent piece is called DM and the Prisoner of Nurmengard so I'm pumped for them to meet

  Draco Malfoy never asked for a second chance, nor did he particularly want one. But he found himself in his old body at eleven, and after a year at Hogwarts, he has a plan for the year before him: keep to himself, find Dobby, improve relations with fellow Slytherins to cordial but distant, get over this stupid obsession with Harry Potter, and no more jokes about controlling a Malfoy mountain troll. No one else thinks they're funny. And no more cursing people- well, only as many people as necessary...Draco Malfoy has never been very good at following plans.

** I wish there were more "strong MC" fics without harem.

This is a bit of a rant, and it's a problem I have noticed on every fandom I went to, but I'm tired of all these "Super MC" fics where he spends more time trying to bed every named female character in the story rather than deal with the plot.\\
I don't ask the MC to be some kind of assexual like Voldemort (if we ignore the whole Delphini thing), or unable to get other his youth love like Dumbledore, but it's annoying when every female character is willing to spread her legs 5 minute after meeting the MC, especially when this happens in a /School/ where characters are children (teens at best). Or when all the girls seem to lose their individuality after joining the harem, becoming some kind of hive mind only good to kiss/sleep with the Mc and always happy to see the arrival of a new "sister".

On a related note, I also wish the "Super MC" fics kinda scaled down on his talent. It's one thing to be a "genius", but Harry should not be able to duel every 7th year days after starting to learn magic, and should not be able to beat other genius like Dumbledore or Voldemort by his 3rd year. Partly becauseit makes no sense when compared to canon, but mainly because it makes a boring story where there is no stakes (and where more time is consacred to charm /another/ girl than saving the world).

** I really want more discussion about Hermione and leadership. People buy into the surface reading of the books about how Harry is the leader, but really, when worse comes to worst, it's Hermione who assumes command. It's even funnier because the Trio never notices it, not even Hermione herself.

Leadership comes naturally to Hermione in a way that it doesn't to Harry. Her natural instinct when trouble comes is to organize the people around her into action whereas Harry's is to forge on alone. She is decisive and proactive. She inspires people to move by sheer competence alone. She is kind and just and it makes people trust her.

God, I wished people talk about Hermione's leadership more.

*** You have made an interesting point. Would you mind giving any examples of Hermione being a leader?

I always thought that leading came more naturally to Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.

  ‚ÄúI should've recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,‚Äù he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man's eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and Hermione.

  ‚ÄúThat's Dolohov,‚Äù said Ron. ‚ÄúI recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one's Thorfinn Rowle.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNever mind what they're called!‚Äù *said Hermione a little hysterically.* ‚ÄúHow did they find us? What are we going to do?‚Äù

  Somehow *her panic seemed to clear Harry's head.*

  ‚ÄúLock the door,‚Äù he told her, ‚Äúand Ron, turn out the lights.‚Äù

  He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, *thinking fast* as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness.
#+end_quote

It's Harry who manages to keep a clear head (in contrast to Hermione, whose hand was shaking so much that she /"slashed open the knee of [Ron's] jeans, leaving a deep cut"/). He takes control, telling Hermione to /"lock the door"/, and telling Ron to /"turn out the lights"/. He then makes the decision to wipe the Death Eaters' memories.

#+begin_quote
  Harry shook his head.

  ‚ÄúWe just need to wipe their memories,‚Äù said Harry. ‚ÄúIt's better like that, it'll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it'd be obvious we were here.‚Äù

  ‚Äú*You're the boss*,‚Äù said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved.
#+end_quote

In /Order of the Phoenix/, it is Harry who acts as the leader in the Department of Mysteries, instructing the others, and doing his best to get them all out safely.

Hermione is very intelligent, logical, and does make lots of good decisions; there are multiple examples of her getting the trio out of difficult situations. That doesn't make her a leader, though. It's /Harry/ who can inspire people. While Hermione did a lot of the work in getting Dumbledore's Army started, it was Harry who instructed and encourage everybody. It was Harry who gave everybody hope, especially Neville and Luna, who both learnt a lot from Harry.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúI DID IT!‚Äù said Neville gleefully. ‚ÄúI've never done it before --- I DID IT!‚Äù

  ‚ÄúGood one!‚Äù said Harry *encouragingly.*

  [...]

  ‚ÄúWell, that was pretty good,‚Äù said Harry, ‚Äúbut we've overrun, we'd better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúSooner!‚Äù said Dean Thomas *eagerly* and *many people nodded in agreement.*

  [...]

  ‚Äú*That was really, really good, Harry*,‚Äù said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry, and Ron left.

  ‚ÄúYeah, it was!‚Äù said Ron enthusiastically.

  [...]

  ‚Äú*You're a r-really good teacher*, you know,‚Äù said Cho, with a watery smile. ‚ÄúI've never been able to Stun anything before.‚Äù

  [...]

  ‚ÄúI liked the D.A.! *I learned loads with you!*‚Äù [said Neville].

  ‚ÄúI enjoyed the meetings too,‚Äù said Luna serenely. ‚ÄúIt was like having friends.‚Äù
#+end_quote

I think there's a saying, which goes something like this: /"Ron kept Harry and Hermione sane, Hermione kept Harry and Ron alive, and Harry kept Ron and Hermione focused on the goal (or the bigger picture?)"./ I'll be honest, I can't remember if this is right or not, but it's something along these lines. I also disagree about Hermione being "decisive" --- she is often rather unsure/worried, and is the person who would rather spend months and months planning. It is Harry who usually makes the difficult decisions (for example, going after the Philosopher's Stone, or breaking into the Ministry of Magic).

#+begin_quote
  *‚ÄúI think we should do it tomorrow,‚Äù said Harry.*

  Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup.

  *‚ÄúTomorrow?‚Äù repeated Hermione.* ‚ÄúYou aren't serious, Harry?'

  ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù said Harry. ‚ÄúI don't think we're going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There's already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn't open.‚Äù

  [...]

  *Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.*

  ‚ÄúWe know everything important,‚Äù Harry went on, addressing Hermione. ‚ÄúWe know they've stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge's office is, because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate--- ‚Äù

  ‚Äú‚ÄòI'll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,'‚Äù Hermione recited immediately.

  ‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù said Harry. ‚ÄúAnd we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend--- ‚Äù

  ‚ÄúBut we haven't got any!‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIf the plan works, we will have,‚Äù *Harry continued calmly.*

  ‚ÄúI don't know, Harry, I don't know... There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance...‚Äù

  ‚ÄúThat'll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,‚Äù said Harry. ‚Äú*It's time to act.*‚Äù
#+end_quote

Hermione, while she is very clever, doesn't always react best in the heat of the moment.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúRight then,‚Äù said Hermione, checking her watch. ‚ÄúShe ought to be here in about five minutes. When I've Stunned her--- ‚Äù

  ‚ÄúHermione, we know,‚Äù said Ron sternly. ‚ÄúAnd I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?‚Äù

  Hermione squealed. ‚Äú*I nearly forgot!* Stand back--- ‚Äù
#+end_quote

Harry relies on his natural instincts, and is much better at making quick decisions.

#+begin_quote
  Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, ‚ÄúRelashio!‚Äù

  The cuffs broken open with loud bangs.

  *‚ÄúThis way!‚Äù Harry yelled*, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon.

  ‚ÄúHarry --- Harry --- what are you doing?‚Äù cried Hermione.

  ‚ÄúGet up, climb up, come on--- ‚Äù
#+end_quote

Of course, there are some examples of Hermione leading the trio; there are also examples of Ron leading the trio. However, I don't think that Hermione is a natural leader.

That being said, I would be interested to hear from your point of view, what you think makes Hermione a good leader. :)

**** I don't have electronic copies of all the books, so I can't pull up quotes, but here are some examples of Hermione's leadership.

Hermione was the one who concocted and led their plan to impersonate Crabbe and Goyle in the Chamber of Secrets. She cooked up the plan, figured out the necessary tasks, and assigned the roles of each member. She planned the plan well enough that the boys managed to pull it off without her.

It was Hermione who envisioned the DA and managed its logistics, communications, and operational security. Harry's role was primarily as instructor. The actual administrative tasks fell on Hermione. This is most visible in the Hog's Head meeting. After Harry managed to convince the assembled members of the veracity of his claims, Hermione once again took control of the meeting and settled the concerns and questions of the assembled body.

Hermione led them through their escape in Tottenham Court Road (it's right before the quote you pulled up). She got them out, commanded them to walk until they found a safe space, and then instructed Ron to change and Harry to hide. She led them through initial plans before the Death Eaters attacked them. Yes, she was shaking, but she managed to lead them anyway.

Hermione was the one who managed the resources during the Horcrux Hunt. With the exception of potential places for the Horcruxes, she was the one who decided where to go, how to get food, and how best to manage their resources.

Hermione was the one who led the planning in Godric's Hollow. Where Harry wanted to charge in, she made him sit and led the planning before they actually entered the town.

Hermione led them out of Xenophilius Lovegood's house. She created a plan, got Harry and Ron to follow, and they got to safety because of that.

When Harry got distracted by the Hallows, it was Hermione who kept them looking for the Horcruxes. She kept them focused and on track even when Harry stubbornly refused to cooperate.

There might be others, but these are the ones I remember.

--------------

The very first thing to note about DH is that Harry has singular access to mission-relevant information. It is this access that makes him the leader - he is literally the only one qualified for it. Not only that, he was literally destined to defeat Voldemort. They defer to Harry because it is quite literally his mission.

It's also worth noting that Harry is actually just as bad as Hermione at inspiring people. What he has that she doesn't have is an infamous reputation that is a mix of both deserved and undeserved. Harry wasn't charismatic in the Hog's Head meeting. In fact, he was quite abrasive and rude. But he was also the last person who saw Cedric alive and had allegedly fought Voldemort. This makes them eager to listen no matter how terrible his attitude.

Another thing to remember is that while Harry is indeed more nervy and decisive, he also rarely ever plans. He just jumps into the situation, and while this had led them to success, it had also led them to huge failures. Harry's failed leadership got Sirius killed. It is also this same failed leadership that lost them Grimmauld Place in DH. The decisiveness that saves them in combat is also the same impulsiveness that got people hurt and even killed.

This means that the moment his leadership is tested against something more long-term and dedicated than a firefight, Harry falters. We see this with how loss they were in the Horcrux Hunt. Harry has no plans or contingencies to fall back on because he never thought that far.

Hermione, on the other hand, is a planner. It means that she isn't the leader to look up to in a fight, but she is the one you need for long-term and more sustainable plans. She can get you what you need and where you need to go if you just give her the space and time for it. She can spot all the problems Harry misses and make the contingencies they need. Therefore, where Harry thrives in combat, Hermione is the one you go to to run an underground militia (ie. the DA).

Another difference between Harry and Hermione is that Harry doesn't know how to move as part of the team. His knee-jerk reaction to trouble is to forge on alone. We see this when they were trying to save the Philosopher's Stone, save Sirius in OoTP, and even in huge parts of the Horcrux Hunt. This means that he often fails to factor other people when making his plans (if he actually makes them). Not only that, he often thinks of others as liabilities instead of resources. We see this as late as the Battle of Hogwarts where he had to be convinced to let the DA help.

Hermione's instinct to trouble, on the other hand, is to organize. We see this with the Polyjuice plan, SPEW and the DA. She figures out what she needs and then seeks out the people who would be most instrumental in the attainment of her goals. Her recruitment of Harry in the DA is the best example. While Harry is indeed better than her at DADA their ability gap isn't actually big enough that she would struggle to tutor others. She knows from SPEW however that she would have trouble getting support, so what she does is get Harry to teach because his reputation alone will be a big enough lure to get the people she needs.

Hermione naturally thinks in terms of people. Her plans are all created with her members in mind. She works with them and places them in positions where they would be the most useful or, at least, least hindering. The best place Hermione could ever be is within a team she had personally picked because she manages to maximize their skills and talents.

Lastly, Harry hates leadership. We see him protest against it over and over again in OoTP. He chafes under the responsibility and had explicitly said that he didn't want it. He couldn't escape it because of the prophecy, but we know that he would have gladly let someone else lead if that's what it takes to gain himself some peace.

Hermione, on the other hand, not only enjoys the responsibility, she actively creates opportunities to lead. SPEW and the DA are proof of that. While power holds no allure for her, if leading is what it takes to achieve her goals, then she will take the leadership wholeheartedly. The responsibility doesn't scare her the way it does Harry.

All of this is to say that, outside of live-fire combat situations, Hermione leads much better than Harry does. She likes it better as well, and it comes more naturally to her than it does to Harry.

***** Thank you for the examples of Hermione taking charge! I completely forgot about the Polyjuice Potion one, and the escape from the Lovegood's. :)

*EDIT:* It was Ron who lead the trio while Harry was obsessing over the Hallows, not Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, that *Ron seemed to be taking charge.* Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry's descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, *Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other* */two/* *into action.*
#+end_quote

It was Ron who made the plans, and was busy during the evenings trying to figure out the password to the /Potterwatch/ radio, while Harry obsessed over the Hallows, and Hermione spent most her time /"pestering"/ Harry and /"[telling] him off"/.

--

*Harry definitely struggles with the weight of the prophecy, and you're right that he sometimes falters.* He isn't a perfect leader, and he does lack some of the important skills. This is seen in both /Order of the Phoenix/ and /Deathly Hallows/. But, in both instances, *he always rises to the challenge, and wins.* Not only does Harry take charge in situations, but /others look up to him as well./

Hermione is intelligent, yes, and she is capable of /"[managing] its logistics, communications, and operational security"/, but that doesn't make her a leader. She isn't very good at motivating others, or creating bonds with people that aren't already her friends. This is why she chose Harry to be in charge of Dumbledore's Army: not because he is smarter, but because he is a better leader.

*Harry is* */good/* *at inspiring people* --- whether he was rude or charismatic during the first meeting, it doesn't change the fact that many characters improved drastically under his teaching, and they benefited from his support and encouragement (see quotes in the previous comment).

--

Of course, like I said earlier, he isn't a perfect leader. In /Deathly Hallows/, he spends lots of time obsessing over the Hallows, and loses focus on what the goal is. But, after escaping from Malfoy Manor, he returns to his role as leader. He takes charge, and it is he who does much of the work from there /(for example, he finds out information about the wands from Ollivander, bargains with Griphook, realizes that the Horcrux is in Gringotts, plans to break into Gringotts, and then escapes on the back of a dragon)/.

Anyway, thanks for replying. It was really interesting reading through your comment!

****** I stand corrected on the Hallows thing. Thank you.

I disagree on him rising up to the challenge. He certainly tried, but he didn't actually succeed.

The DA to me was never leadership on Harry's part. He wasn't leading them anywhere. He was teaching in an organization Hermione built and led. The analogy I've seen others use for their relationship in the DA (and one I buy into) is that Hermione is the principal and Harry is the teacher. He's the one managing the students, but Hermione is the one managing him and the actual decision-making in the DA. The most Harry set was the schedule of their meetings.

Hermione's vision, her planning, and decision-making are what made her the leader of the DA (as well as a better leader in general).

I concede that Harry is an inspiring figure, but he is inspiring in the way a stone statue is as opposed to any skills he may have in the active inspiration of others. As I mentioned, he has a huge reputation that precedes him, and everything he says automatically becomes inspirational by virtue of that reputation. When DH happened, Harry had practically turned into a symbol.

I agree that he is a good teacher and he encourages his students, but that skillset is very different from inspiring people to action. Teaching is another skillset that is separate from the kind of inspiring necessary in leadership. I agree that Hermione isn't very good at it, but Harry is also no better.

The only other time Harry "inspired" people to action was at the Battle of Hogwarts. But while he did get them to help, he wasn't inspiring anyone to do anything. In fact, if he spoke louder, he would have been actively discouraging the DA. The most he spoke were instructions. And it's pretty clear there that it was actually Neville who was the one with the one doing the motivating.

His actual leadership was tested in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and he failed miserably. He was leader for all of five seconds before he ran ahead and lost track of his members (and boy is this emblematic of his leadership). And then Hermione falls, he loses composure, and Neville takes charge. He tried to get them to come together after, but their team had taken too much damage for it to be of any use.

I concede that he did better in the Deathly Hallows. I'm going to point out though that the parts he succeeded in were the ones that didn't need thorough planning, and where his nerve gave them the most advantage (eg. Post-TCR fight). His biggest decision were actually him overruling Hermione in the need for more planning.

I'd also like to draw your attention on the way they escaped through the dragon. He releases the dragon without communicating to Ron and Hermione, and they only figure out his plan after he started running to it. He forged ahead without warning his members and they are left to scramble behind him.

He does the same again in the Battle of Hogwarts. He tells no one of his plan to die in the forest. If that entire thing actually happened as he had expected, it would have been a massive tactical failure. As much as Neville, Ron, and Hermione believed in Harry, the other people don't actually know him and would have believed that he tried to run. We saw the immediate effect of his death, how the troops got demoralized. This could have been mitigated if he at least told one person of why he has to die. They could have countered Voldemort's narrative better.

But again, Harry neither planned nor communicated. And it almost cost them the war.

Harry isn't just an imperfect leader, he is a terrible one. I agree that he did well in Shell Cottage, but I'd also argue that that was a fluke. It was the only time where he managed the majority of the planning, actually made good use of the people around him, and made decisions other than that they should go attack now. We don't see it before, and we never see it again.

His only virtue as a leader is his decisiveness (which doubles as curse as I mentioned in the grandparent post). Everything else is luck. His reputation isn't something he can control, and even then, he doesn't know how to use it. The planning and foresight usually falls to Hermione. He is terrible at communication and doesn't have vision or ambition.

I agree that Harry TRIED to rise up to the challenge, but it was blunder after blunder, and his successes are arguably due more to luck and his friends' skills as opposed to his own ability. Fate and circumstance allowed Harry to succeed, not his own leadership.

It was nice hearing your thoughts though.

*** It's not surface reading when there's just as many or more examples of Harry assuming control, pushing them to move, and coming up with a plan on the fly.

#+begin_quote
  Leadership comes naturally to Hermione in a way that it doesn't to Harry.
#+end_quote

Disagree given that Hermione is the one who actually ran off without sharing her plans as late as OotP. I believe Ron even comments on it.

#+begin_quote
  She inspires people to move by sheer competence alone
#+end_quote

Now hold on. Does she inspire people to move by sheer competence or does she have to lean on Harry's name?

I don't think she inspires people to move all that much at all. SPEW is a glaring example.
