As the title says. Either Neville or someone else is the BWL or there is no BWL. Harry has to be a main character. Pls no harry/ginny or harry/fluer.

** Linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) No BWL

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) Harry's twin is the BWL. Also no shitty parent bashing and stuff.

Linkffn(in bad faith by steelbadger) someone else is GWL

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

** My go to rec (besides Certain Dark Things, which has already been recc'd) is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1140833][Ut Malis Melior]], where Harry's parents are at St. Mungo's and Neville is the BWL. There are a lot of politics in the series but I think it's done well and age appropriate (adults at the Wizengamot and children learning from them). Neville and Harry become friends, there's a lot of interhouse friendships and I think the story really picks up in Book 2. It does get dark by Book 3 and there's a ton of tension.

  Harry Potter grew up at Number Four Privet Drive. Harry Potter has never known his parents. Harry Potter is a wizard.Harry Potter is not the Boy Who Lived.--The Thrown Pebble is Book One of a whole-canon reimagining wherein Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the one targeted by Voldemort.
