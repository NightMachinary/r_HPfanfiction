I write this for three reasons. First, I don't know how to get a hold of the author, second, I want to see who agrees, and third, this issue is a significant dent in what otherwise might have been a favorite fic.

For those of you who don't know, I'm talking about the author of the Arithmancer series and the Accidental Animagus series.

I've noticed a trend across these fics that bothers me. Phrases like "the boys naturally gravitated towards fireworks," "he's a boy," "you're such a boy," etc., crop up over and over again in these fics. It really bothers me. None of it is accurate and all of it is harmful. That said, I'm aware that this ain't exactly turning people into Nazis, but it still merits discussion.


** What are you talking about? Do you know the context of the story?

It's taking place in England in the 90's. Not to mention that the wizarding world is established to be even more "backwards" that the normal world.

All those things you mentioned are perfectly expected in a story taking place in that context. That's simply how people acted back then. Do you disagree with that?

**** I'm not quite sure what you mean by teachers "agreeing and going along with it" but yes, it's quite common for teachers to treat their students in a gendered way. Splitting up students into boys vs. girls; measuring the length of girls' skirts to make sure they comply with uniform regulations while the boys walk around with their top button undone; expecting boys to tolerate a level of roughhousing which would merit an intervention if it occurred between girls, etc. This is all very common in schools.

Even within HP canon we see this: the girls can enter the boys dorms but not vice versa, because girls are considered to have greater sexual purity/innocence than boys.

It's also equally common for children to self-enforce gender stereotypes.

It's just a fact that we live in a highly gendered world, and /it's only getting more gendered/. A couple decades ago, the dominant social idea among progressives was that your gender shouldn't determine anything about who you are as a person or how you should be treated. A gender-blind society was the ultimate goal. These days, however, gender is making a comeback: it's now commonly accepted among progressives that certain characteristics /are/ gendered, and that it's identification with those gendered characteristics which defines a person's gender. Gender-blindness is no longer the goal; rather, the goal is a society where people of different genders are treated in accordance with the gender they identify with rather than the gender they present as.

She isn't held to a higher standard based on her gender anywhere in the fic. The only higher standard she's ever held to is the one for being a hardworking genius. Additionally, to say that we should ignore one piece of sexism because another exists is illogical in the first place.

That logic also supposes we can't fix women's issues because of poverty; can't fix poverty because of climate change; can't complain about one's day because of starving children in Africa.

You posted that quote about female bias thirteen hours ago, long before this little discussion between us began. So. By logical extension, my pointing out that the gendered writing goes both ways /is/ relevant, especially after all your comments about "but Hermione said THIS and nobody cared!".

In any case, the silly language you showcased is period and age appropriate. It isn't right by modern standards, but in the end it's harmless.

You're still incorrect about this, and thankfully it isn't my job to teach you why. Have a nice day.

******************** I believe the term was oblivious white boy. I consider the terms of equal severity.

It's a relevant point when considering the female bias I consider inherent in the story. However, given that you used female struggles of the time period to defend your point, I assumed you were intelligent enough to realize that the time period doesn't eliminate female bias in the fic itself and thus were describing gender struggles of the time period outside the fic, which is irrelevant.

It made me deeply uncomfortable, and thus logically speaking will do the same to others. That's why it's harmful. It's offputting.

The boys are portrayed as boorish, lacking self-control, and largely inept as compared to their female companions on the whole. It isn't a major bias, but it exists. That isn't to say the period was female dominated, as the fic is separate from the time period.
