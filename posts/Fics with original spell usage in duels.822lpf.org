**** What has White Squirrel written? I just made those suggestions from memory, and I don't remember most authors' names.

***** Yes, White Squirrel's mains tories are /The Accidental Animagus/ and /The Arithmancer/. As far as names you might recognize, he's also behind /Petrification Proliferation/, /The Philosopher's Red Herring/ and /Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue/.

******* It's all really good. Some see /The Accidental Animagus/ as having more clich√©s than /Arithmancer/, but really, it's pretty damn good too. The sequel also introduces some /great/ worldbuilding for foreign wizarding countries.

** linkffn(Patron) by Starfox5 doesn't go the White Squirrel route of coming up with named spells, but in the (many) battle scenes, the combatants often use an incredibly original range of magic, notably transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
