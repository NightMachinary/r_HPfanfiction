Hi guys! I wanted to know what are your favorite Snape centric AUs are. I am using Snape-centric loosely here, it can be a mentor!Snape with Harry in as the protagonist, time travel, romance.

Only thing is I enjoy magic AUs, so no modern AUs please.


** A Snape centered magic AU!??

linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

This is the best one. people can fight me. Snape is cunning and clever and sly. He's a spy with actual motivation and brains and personality.

It's a monster fic but brilliant. and you name it, this story has it.

A portrait in the Slytherin Common Room comes to life. Harry Potter goes missing. Things occur.

....I have no idea what else to say without spoiling it but it's good. It's very good ðŸ˜Š

*** Strongly agree. Of a Linear Circle is the best-written fanfiction I've ever seen.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4951238/1/Snapes_Worst_Memory]]

Snape's Worst Memory is an AU Snape/Lily fanfic, written by Darkglare. It's a long fic with a reasonable amount of angst and mostly realistic portrayal of characters. Focuses on Severus and Lily's friendship and relationship during their last two years of school. "Snape's Worst Memory" scene happened but with a twist in the form of Regulus Black and his plan to get his brother in trouble, so there was no "Mudblood" incident. Adult themes.
