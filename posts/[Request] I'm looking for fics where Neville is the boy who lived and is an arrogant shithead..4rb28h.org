** The Darkness Within linkffn(2913149)

Peter P kidnaps Harry instead of giving up James and Lily, it's a dark!Harry fic and Neville really does turn into a shithead. It's been a while but I seem to remember serious Dumbledore/Weasley bashing, which is annoying but the story is still good overall.
