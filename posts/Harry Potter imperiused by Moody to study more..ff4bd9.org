I think it was after his fifth year. It's also an Indy Harry story as well I think.

** I always figured that the reason crouch did the imperius class was that he wanted to to put harry under the curse, and that the reason he kept putting it on harry wasnt to train him to throw it off, but to try and get him under even though it didnt work the first time.

** By Moody , oh no If someone where to use the imperius to force someone to study it would be that know-it-all Hermione Granger. Alastor would imperius him to learn and use more effective magic in battle and to be paranoid “constant vigilance”

***** I don't have that, but this one ([[http://home.exetel.com.au/jaina/Unforgivable/Unforgivable.html]]) has Lavender asking Harry to help her learn to overcome the Imperius. It's unfinished, but there's a lot there.

****** Thank you! I spent too much time reading this wonderful story today. I don't suppose you know anything about what happened to the author after that website's last update nine years ago?

******* I'm afraid not. I corresponded with her in 2009, when she let me know that the site was not advertised anywhere; she just put it up for herself and a few friends.

Because of that, she was curious how I ran across the site.

I found it serendipitously, by searching on uncommon (in the general population) or secondary character name pairs that would indicate a specific cross, such as using Hermione and Nabiki in hopes of finding a Ranma 1/2 - Harry Potter cross, or Ranma and Hotaru for a Ranma 1/2 - Sailor Moon cross.
