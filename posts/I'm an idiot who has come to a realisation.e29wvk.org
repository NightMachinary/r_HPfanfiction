I was always confused why it was written as AO3 and never understood it. All behold it is because it is Archive Of Our Own, AOOO, A and three O's, AO3. Am I just an idiot or has this confused anyone else.

****** So I did some digging, and I'm pretty sure that it start back when Star Trek was popular, and particularly fics featuring Kirk and Spock.

Kirk+Spock friendship fics were referred to as Kirk&Spock, shorthand &\\
Kirk+Spock homoerotic fics were referred to as Kirk/Spock, shorthand /

For a while, known as 'virgule', the proper literary term for /, then changed to the slang 'slash'. From there, the term migrated to indicate all homoerotic fic, and femslash/femmeslash got started to refer to lesbian ships.

****** Back in the Buffy & Xena era of fanfic, it was called alt-slash. Femslash seems to have won over time though, probably because it's more literal.

****** It's out of a need to differentiate for finding stories, probably. Like how my favorite pairing is often a side pairing, and it's harder to find it as the main one, I have to sift through other stuff. Fics of lesbian relationships are just more rare, so harder to find if all under 'slash.'

Some sites call it femmeslash.

*** I think it came from something old (Star Trek maybe) where in the fandom 2 male characters were usually paired as either good friends or as partners, and slash or no-slash (as in the slash between names in a ship) was used to identify between the two. After that, it just sort of became used for male/male.

Edit: so I scrolled down and I'm apparently right.

*** No. In mathematics you often have things that don't commute, like matrices. So you have some string of matrices multiplied together ABCCCCD. You can then write ABC^{4} D. A3D would be A(D+D+D). If you instead used A+D+D+D then since you pretty much only use + for things that are commutative you'd have this be equal to D+A+D+D or to the other reorderings, which isn't the something you'd assume with multiplication.

Edit: Also, A3D=(A+A+A)D.
