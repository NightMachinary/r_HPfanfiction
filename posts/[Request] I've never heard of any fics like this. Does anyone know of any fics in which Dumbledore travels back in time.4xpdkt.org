** Assuming Dumbledore has a choice he would most likely go all the way back trying to save his sister.

*** If the premise allowed him to go that far back [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald#Friendship_with_Dumbledore][(1899),]] then for a good story (no abuse of bullshit tropes like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate][YouCantFightFate]] / prophecies) the author would need to come up with an original timeline diverging almost immediately:

- No dark vanilla!Grindelwald one way or another --- Dumbledore would kill him (OoC for him), try to make G. change his mind (not likely to work), Obliviate him or kidnap him, etc;
- no automatically acquired grand political capital for Dumbledore --- though his magical prowess would still give him a kick-start,
- possibly nobody with perfect match for TMR's DNA being born [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Riddle#Family_lineage][(1926)]] at all, or if TMR even does get born, he'll be another person due to Dumbledore's interference in his upbringing (hopefully not as ill-advised as in original TMR's and Harry's cases)
- possibly nobody with perfect match for James Potter's [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/James_Potter_I][(1960),]] Lily Evans' [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Lily_J._Potter][(1960),]] --- etc, etc --- DNA being born.

Antagonists in such a story could be random OCs that keep popping up as dark lord wannabes because of the poor socio-political climate. I don't think Grindelwald (or even TMR) was so special by himself --- it's just that the European / British magical community was chronically debilitated in regards to defending itself from their incubation.

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.
