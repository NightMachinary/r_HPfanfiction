It's a narnia crossover, I remember reading it on fanfiction net. I can't remember if the title was The Girl of Legends or Child of Merlin (could be both, one being the sequel)

It features a female Harry Potter and the end pairing is with Edmund Pevensie if I'm not mistaken. I think it was in the second book, Prince of Caspian arc, where female Harry (can't even remember the name) went searching for the founders. Gryffindor was Aslan, Slytherin was a snake named Abadon (or maybe not), etc.

I think there's was something like a soul bond thing between fem harry and Edmund but I can't remember. I do want to read it again, it's been on my mind for quite some time now.

Basically, that's all I remembered. I can't find the fanfiction anywhere, Nada. I tries using quotes and everything. Has the fic been deleted? If not, can someone link me to the story?


** Did you ever find this fic? It sounds interesting.

*** No, unfortunately. I did, however, find out that the story on fanfiction net was taken down.
