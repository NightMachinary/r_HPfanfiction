** The various Harry & Luna centric stories by Salon_kitty.

[[http://members.adult-fanfiction.org/profile.php?no=1296851847&view=story&zone=hp]]

Pretty close to the best believable smut I've read in the fandom. And it's interesting and inventive, unlike most HP-centric smut which consists of largely the protagonist going to pound town with every girl he meets and their mothers.

  Harry's world is flipped upside down when he is visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare type of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of his problems when he finds out just how drastically his life is about to change. How will young Harry manage an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive!

** For the most smut, I would think it has to be linkffn(The Breeding Ground by megamatt09). Very boring/repetitive, but the guy is continually updating it, so bonus?

For best written, IMO, linkffn(In the Thick of the Night by James Davey Smith), though that's mostly because it's a HP/LE/OC!Sister that isn't complete shit.

  A man who looked very much like Draco Malfoy walked into Hermione's office, brandishing a piece of parchment and a pitch-perfect insult. That would have been right before she grabbed him by the front of his robes and dragged him inside, silently thanking her husband, the inventors of Polyjuice potion, and anyone else who might have had a hand in making her secret fantasy come to life for Valentine's Day. That also would have been one hour and fifteen minutes ago.7,000 words. Draco/Hermione, background Ron/Hermione. NC-17. Explicit infidelity. Written for dysfuncentine, a comm that deliberately wanted dysfunctional relationships for Valentine's Day. Keep that in mind when reading. ;) February 2011.

** If you're ok with slash, I'd recommend anything by Frayach on AO3, especially Danse Russe. She does /amazing/ literary erotica, particularly when exploring some more extreme kinks. One of the best writers I've encountered in terms of quality of literary prose. linkao3(454721)

The most smut I've ever read was the Mudhoney Trilogy by Calanthe. Well-written but /extremely dirty/ BDSM. Kink-with-minimum-plot and dark psychological themes. You have been warned. [[http://fuckyeah-drarry.tumblr.com/post/70332157296/mudhoney-trilogy-by-calanthe]]

  True Love. Soul Mates. They're just words until put to the test. Harry and Draco have a bond that was forged in the hell of the post-war years and pulled them both back from an abyss of nihilism and self-destruction. Nothing can break it, or so they believed. But True Love can demand sacrifices too great to bear and deeds too terrible to justify.
