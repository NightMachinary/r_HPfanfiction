#+begin_quote
  This story takes the trope/cliche of Harry Potter working out to become a fitness buff to its logical and completely ridiculous endgame. Now it's time to meet Beefcake Harry, Dudebro supreme. Also starring his mentor, a great big buff guy... named Thanos. And stoner Dumbledore, because why not?
