Most people in the magical world can't figure out how to use muggle money, so there's no going to a grocery store for any of them. There's no magic way to make food. Are there magical farmers? Is there a specific company buying muggle food and then upselling it to wizards? The lack of any kind of brand recognition or any kind of understanding of muggles suggests that if they're getting food from the muggle world, it's only the raw products unpackaged and unprocessed. The Weaselys have a garden but that can't give you everything from that and there's no way someone like the Malfoys would grow their own food. And what about things like spices? Just, where is it coming from and where do magical people even go to buy it.


** Don't forget in Deathly Hallows when Umbridge and Yaxley question Mary Cattermole, they scoff at the idea of her parents being greengrocers as though no respectable witch or wizard would ever be a greengrocer. Yes, how wizards and witches get groceries is the question that keeps me up at night. If I ever meet JKR, this will be the discussion we have.

  "Yer a wiz- hnnnggg"

  Hagrid's face screwed up in concentration.

  "Hol' on a sec. Hnnngggg!"

  A dreadful, overpowering stench permeated the cabin as Harry and the Dursleys gagged and retched in disgust. Apparently, the giant man, with no warning or justification, had decided to push out an equally giant shit right into his pants as he stood there talking to Harry.

  Hagrid then produced a gaudy pink umbrella and, looking down over his shoulder, pointed the tip of it at the back of his trousers, which were now visibly bulging and seeping with shit.

  "Now then, what is the meaning of this?!" bellowed Uncle Vernon. Dudley, meanwhile, could no longer take the horrid smell, and began to vomit all over Aunt Petunia's shoes, while she shrieked in horror, "Oh Dudders, not on mummy's shoes!"

  "Er... /evanesco shit/," Hagrid muttered, giving the umbrella a little wiggle and a squishy poke to his bum.

  The shocking smell and the lumpy wet bulge both promptly vanished, and Hagrid beamed.

  "Yer a wizard, Harry!"

** We know that the Malfoys were granted a large amount of land by William the Conqueror.

We know that the Malfoys are very rich.

The main way to extract an income from land is to farm it. I don't see Lucius himself farming but that's quite common - the owner of a load of land will have beneath him a handful of tenant farmers.

So I think one of these 3 must be the case:

1. The Malfoy family grows crops/rears animals for slaughter via wizard tenant farmers

2. The Malfoy family grows crops/rears animals for slaughter via Muggle tenant farmers.

3. The Malfoy family uses their land for something else (magical animals/plants for potion ingredients, perhaps).

I think we can rule out 2, given the Statute of Secrecy as well as the Malfoy family's view of Muggles. So that leaves 1 or 3 - or possibly a combination of them, which is what I went for in Victoria Potter.

  “Aparecium!”

  The spell had been cast by Bertrand, just as the hippogriffs looked like they would gallop straight into a thick hedge. The greenery parted before them, forming itself into a tall arch, and they passed through onto a long dirt track. Fields stretched out on either side, as far as the eye could see, each one divided from its neighbour by a low stone wall. To their left, tall strands of golden winter wheat swayed in the wind; to their right, the field was dotted with burrows, out of which poked small reptilian heads.

  “They're mokes,” Draco explained, seeing Victoria's curious look. “Their skin's used for shrinking things... bags, gloves, stuff like that.”

  “One of our most valuable livestock,” Lucius said. “Sometimes I think Crabbe spends more time fending off poachers than actually looking after the mokes.”

  Victoria blinked. “The Crabbes live here?”

  “Indeed,” Lucius said. “They've been among our leading tenants for several centuries.”

  “The Goyles, too,” Draco added. Suddenly the way Vincent and Gregory followed him around made a lot more sense.

  They continued for several miles down the track. Wheat gave way to peas and broad beans; the moke field was followed by herds of hippogriffs and cattle. Here and there the track would branch, the side paths meandering across the rolling landscape to barns, stables, and rustic cottages with smoke rising from their chimneys.

*** To add to that, just to give a feel of scales:

Generally, it's fair assume a wizarding world of some 15k people in Britain, the size of a small town. 15k people eat 30 t bread/week? That's some 20 t flour or ~25 t wheat/week. That's 1300 t wheat/year. You would think magical crop yields at least as much as the best Muggle crop does, which is ~9 t/HA. So that's ~130 HA, the size of one small to average farm. You arrive at the same result doing price calculations. One farm is enough resp. more than one farm (for one kind of goods) doesn't really work out as a reasonable income for one as rich as Malfoy.

And, of course, Malfoy having a monopoly on, say, wheat, is just how they like it.

And using this, you can imagine two bakeries, one in Hogsmeade, one in Diagon Alley.

Enchanting it to stop and turn around at the end of the row, move on when the field is done, stop if there's a person or stray animal in the way, etc - much harder. And successfully milking or shearing a herd of animals without direction would be vastly harder again.

I can see how Malfoy, in particular, may not give his elves the necessary leeway for that, or how his elves may simply not do their best unless micromanaged. But then again, that's just speculation. Perhaps he has a more loyal elf than Dobby who's simply told to "tend to the fields".

** It's possible to increase the quantity of food by magic, although we can assume that this is fairly difficult, given that the trio couldn't do it in the seventh book. So beyond NEWT level. Or alternatively the trio did increase their food supply off screen, but there were limits to how much it could be increased.

Another possibility that was mentioned in the books was that you could summon food, if you know where it is. It's possible that wizard grocers are just stealing it from the muggle world via magic. Considering how much food muggles actually produce, this might very well go undetected, depending on how careful the wizards are.

Or perhaps they won't bother to cast accio all day long and as you said, that the grocers/government buy food from the muggle world and sell it to other wizards. That way only a small number of wizards would have intimate knowledge of the muggle world, while the rest would buy it with wizard money from magical stores.

There could be plantations, with house elf workers, that grow a variety of food and potion supplies. Malfoys could very well be growing all of their food, if Dobby or his replacement did all the actual work.

Important to note that the trio didn't lack for food in the literal sense. In the DH "Gamp's law" scene they have fish and mushrooms. The problem is that they don't know how to turn those ingredients into something palatable (to be fair, how many 17-year-olds know how to fillet a fish) and they can't use magic to just conjure up something palatable instead.

** I read in a FanFiction once that someone theorised that there were food cupboards that refilled with food every week. The payment was automatically taken from the gringotts vault. Idk seemed pretty muggle-inspired to me but maybe possible.

But tbh it seems like a lot of wizarding families have house elves so probably they just have some sort of house elf market where they can buy and sell produce.

*** I don't think there's anything in canon, but I think some sort of 'cold cupboard' makes the most sense. Or, like, the milk comes in charmed bottles that stay cold until about the time the milk'll be going sour anyway. If the bottle is warm, it's gone bad. Course that means of the spell breaks it'll go bad anyway and bottle returns.

Either way, I don't they're doing individual charms as they bring stuff home - people forget that kind of thing all the time.

Edit because my brain finished the think: Probably some combination of the two: specialized preservation spells cast by the producer on stuff that needs it and simpler cooling cupboards for whatever else you need it for.

As for where it comes from.

There's definitely some grow what you need going on - the Weasleys have a garden and, i think, chickens. That goes along way, especially with idk accelerated growth spells and a rooster. And I have doubts about the theory that the Hogwarts greenhouses are 100% medicinal and lesson plants - 1st years could definitely be getting the basics on... idk carrots.

But, unless the guy that runs the apothecary is VERY busy, there is a precedent for sourcing outside ingredients. I don't see why there can't be a standard market next door. Probably run by the same family.

*** It doesn't really matter. You can create spells, and the most powerful bit of magic shown in the books (as far as pure energy is concerned, anyway) is Gubraithian flame - perpetual fire.

If wizards can manage to create a spell for perpetual energy, they can create spells for preservation as well. Refrigerators have been around since the early industrial ages, so any enterprising wizard with a knowledge of muggle advances could have created such a spell in the 150 odd years of the refrigerator's existence.

A spell also does not need to mimick the refrigerator's cooling effect. Adding spices to food is a form of preservation, along with pickling food. A spell that does either of those things will suffice as well.

***** I think we are running into one of the plot holes that exist when you look at the various permutations of the issue. For instance, we are told under Gamps Law that food is one of the exceptions to conjuring out of nothing. Eg you can't conjure food. We are also told that you can't transfigure food, i.e., if you transfigure a rock into bread and eat the bread it will eventually return back to rock causing you serious problems.

We are told that you can summon food. We are also shown that you can increase the amount of food by using the Engorgement charm. But that begs the question of where did this extra food come from? It can't appear out of thin air as that would violate Gamps law, and if you transfigure non-food into food it will revert and cause problems. So if you have one lb of vegetables and use the Engorgement charm to now have 2 lbs of vegetables where did that new lb of vegetables come from?

So since canon really doesn't tell us how food is acquired or stored that leaves a lot of flexibility for fan fic authors to explore a lot of alternatives.

** I'm going to have to search to find the fics but one fic has the wizarding goverment stealing a portion of the muggle harvest and storing it in a central facility where it can be acquired by any wizarding family.

The other fic had elves going to a handful of squib owned grocery stores and acquiring the food after hours. I believe both fics hypothesized how the Malfoys would lose their minds if they knew they had been eating muggle food.

Life Sucks Then You Die by Radaslab discusses a central food distribution. I believe this is the story where they first steal the food from the muggles.

linkffn(6128181)

Harry Potter and the Freedom of Apathy by nonjon mentions an elf friendly store for groceries.

linkffn(2329599)

The Vanishing Cabinet of Time by Vance McGill mentions elves going to a wizarding marketplace to get food.

linkffn(11123742)

I'm not sure if any of the stories truly address why magicals are not aware of muggle brands if they are getting the food from the muggles. For families with elves you could believe that they never see the food in the package they just see the unwrapped food on a plate. (Finding out that Draco's favorite bedtime snack is a tasty little pastry his elf makes special for him otherwise known as a Twinkie).

For those without elves like the Weasleys you have a different problem about brand recognition. A possible explanation is that central distribution just eliminates the packaging and changes it to a clear package so you can see what you're purchasing and primarily keeping towards raw materials not finished products (eg no already baked cakes but flour, sugar, cream, butter etc can be purchased).

It's said that the magical governments know what's going on, and it's still technically illegal, but they don't do anything about it because one, they don't care about Muggles' property rights and two, without the pirates the population wouldn't eat.

** I headcanon that there are one or two pureblood families that deal exclusively in "import/export". And by that, I mean moving things between the muggle and magical world.

Exports? Alchemy made/separated metals and gems. Gems/ores found while mining/excavating. Magically crafted mundane items. Selling old items that would be considered antiques magic is great, ain't it?).

The purebloods may look down on muggles with contempt, but there is most likely one or two families (actual Slytherins, not this legacy sorting BS you see in canon) that saw the potential for gain and took it. Think about it, a wizard made... table (victorian era design), might go for 100-200 pounds in galleons (and be seen as normal in the wizarding world), but in the muggle world, they could go upwards of hundreds of dollars more, since they seem more authentic (and or could be considered antiques).

They have two choices here: A- convert the money at Gringotts and be done with it. Or B- use that muggle money to buy commodities to sell in the wizarding world at normal costs. This probably escapes a currency exchange fee too. That, and there is still profit, because they are selling something they bought at commercial bulk rates at consumer level prices. So this is still another profit.

Why not increase the price? Because this way the government backs off from their dealings with muggles and is a little more... relaxed in their selling of magically made (yet still fundamentally mundane) items to them. And most of the profits are made in the first step.

In a closed caste-based society like Magical Britain, there are only so many monopolies that can be made. And you can be damn sure that the pureblood families would claim their trade as a monopoly. Either by force, law, or by being economically better.
