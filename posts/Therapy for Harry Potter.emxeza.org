I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3545676/1/][*/Family Counseling With the Dursleys/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/378076/Harmonic-Friction][/Harmonic Friction/]] and really enjoyed it. Any fic recommendations where Harry (and anyone else) goes to counseling? I'd prefer it be the focus of the fic, and while Harry is still fairly young (15-mid 20s?), but that's not a requirement.

Thanks!

Petunia decides to send Harry to boarding therapy place.\\
Good snape, not good dumbledore, hermione's in on it (eventually)\\

** Harry and another character have regularly scheduled visits with a squib therapist in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10691892/chapters/23678604][Benefits of Old Laws]]. linkao3(10691892)

The fic revolves arround many plot developments running in parallel, and the therapy is only /one of/ the focuses of the plot, so I'm not sure it meets your requirements.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** I remember reading one recently where Harry goes to a therapist that works in both the Muggle and Magical world at Sirius' behest and eventually Sirius gets into a relationship with the therapist.

I think it was that one where Harry was thought dead in a fire but Sirius found him dying on a park bench later on. I forget the title atm, but I'm commenting so I'll remember to check in the morning.

  There is but one way to keep a secret: you lie. But how many lies can you tell, how many secrets can you keep, and at the cost of what? Harry's nightmares are back, and he finally decides that they're taking control of his life; he needs to do something bout them. And in the process of getting rid of them, who does he end up meeting but Mind-Healer Draco Malfoy?
