** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) isn't definitely WBWL but might as well be.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightening on the Wave's]] work? The first is linkffn(Saving Connor). A seven part completed series with 3 million words or so I think. The writing is good. The author is the lady who did [[https://curiosityquills.com/limyaael/][Limyaael's rants]] which are fun to read. People seem to like the Pureblood politics and Light/Dark magic. I did think it was repetitive. I did find the main pairing to be kind of sickly sweet.

*** Yeah every time I read that series I get stuck at the start of the 5th book. It feels so stale at that point but I still really want to know what happens, I just don't think I can slog through the whole criminal charges scenario etc. Is it worth reading on?

**** It sounds like it's not for you then! I made it to the start of the seventh book and just couldn't go on, like you. Everybody keeps making the same mistakes after speeches saying they've changed. The politics were boring to me. I thought the whole vates and Lord things were dumb. I don't know. I understand why others like it and I am happy I read what I did, but I don't see finishing or rereading it.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** Linkffn(Unsung hero) is pretty well written. It's rather well known too so I wouldn't be surprised if you've read it already

*** Everyone is so unlikable in that fic, Harry included. The premise doesn't really hold at all. If Harry was sick of people confusing him for his identical twin, why didn't he alter his appearance... like, at all!?

It reads like an exaggerated re-imagining of Snape's self loathing. Something about it is deeply self indulgent.

It makes so little sense that I couldn't even enjoy it as a crack fic.

**** True.

Unsung Hero was one of the first fics I read, but looking at your comment and looking back at the fic you are completely right.

  COMPLETED Harry Potter enters his 7th year at Hogwarts ignored and friendless because his brother Daniel is the Boy Who Lived. *** Badass Horcruxes. *** Read the author note on profile before you start. Thanks!
