I love Draco redemption fics, but I have a hard time finding fics that don't make him extremely OOC. Anyone have any quality, non-slash Draco redemption fics or fics of him working against the Dark Lord? Thanks in advance!!


** Would you mind a fic where that isn't the main focus? It's really quite good, the author has a few books published, even. It starts up in... I wanna say, the last third of the fic?

** Here's one you might enjoy. It's a Draco/Astoria courtship story, fully canon-compliant and it keeps him very close to his characterization from the books.

*** Canon compliant? I'm quite sure that I remember Snape dying in Book 7.

***** Yeah, I don't know why I said that. I think there was a conversation with a portrait of Snape and I mistook it for the actual person.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** I thought this one was quite good. It's AU but Draco comes out noble in the end.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/786310][Slytherin's Warning]] is a great fic about a post 6th year Draco choosing not become a death eater and subsequently getting trapped in a house with Remus Lupin. No slash. Very in character for both Draco and Lupin. It's a slow burn fic and the ending isn't a cakes and rainbows, but I think you would like it.

EDIT: Also, the fic is finished, but for some reason the author didn't post all of it on Ao3. The full fic is on fanfic.net.

*** This was good. Easy to read. Too many character deaths for no reason though, and I have a hard time with how easily Lupin seems to get over Dumbledore's death in the beginning, but oh well. Overall, pleased to have read it, thanks for the rec.
