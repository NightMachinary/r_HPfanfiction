:END:
Does anyone know the name of the fic where Harry's animagus is a Phoenix and he starts to take the characteristics of one, like eats mostly berries and nuts, etc. that's really all I remember of it...lol. I'm pretty sure it was an old Order of the Phoenix story. Thanks!

** Sounds like Dark Phoenix by SofiaDragon. linkffn(1881821)

I really liked this fic when it was just "Harry dealing with his new instincts" and "Snape unwittingly adopts Harry's new animagus form" but then it veered off into politics and got bogged down.

#+begin_quote
  Harry needs to take control of his life. Some very old magic is at work, and our hero finds hidden strength within himself. Snape becomes a major player. Better summary inside. Multiple pairings.
