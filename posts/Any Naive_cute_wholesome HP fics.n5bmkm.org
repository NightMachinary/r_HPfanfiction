Like full blown stories where harry is really kind and so and so on giving everyone chances


** Oh crud.

There's this one fic where Harry starts writing letters to Dudley and they actually become friendly without the influence of Petunia and Vernon hanging over them--Dudley even visited Hogwarts after the Stone Incident, but i can't remember the title.

** linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) is rather wholesome. Harry's just so resistant to all kinds of harm that he can afford to be quite mellow, and Voldemort never really manages to make himself more than a minor nuisance (well, there are a handful of casualties at the Battle of Hogwarts, but that's all). Draco's efforts to stir up trouble go over Harry's head so completely that he eventually gives up and pretty much has a heel-face turn. Most of the story is simply a magical school experience, learning spells and meeting other sapient magicall species and inventing magical rocketry.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
