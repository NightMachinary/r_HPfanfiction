There are many pros to having a mature/maturing fanfic fandom -- overall better writing quality, more mature topics approached with greater nuances, fewer Mary-Sues etc.

But what about the negatives, besides the general decrease in the number of HP fanfiction being written?


** People growing up reading fanfiction

Which translates to having a very developed fanon, with many people hating/dropping fics because the author writes something that conflicts with pre-established ideas. Even when it's never mentioned in canon

I've been guilty of this myself

Also newer stories get burried under old ones because fanfiction.net heavily favors old fic and archive of our own is confusing to navigate if you don't know where to look

*** It's too bad you can't set an date limit on fanfiction.net. you should be able to only search for fanfic that came out in 2006, or something like that.

** Over saturation of fics with tropes like Harry being the heir to a dozen houses having a harem of willing slaves evil dumbledore power blocks wozarding world is backward Characters start to get pigeonholed into certain roles like ice queen daphne or perfect hermione and stupid Ron Plus the disagreements on various fics like Methods of rationality is fairly controversial Finally there is the disappoint one feels when they find a great fic that is only a few chapters from the ending but hasn't been updated years

** Hive-mind leading to stupid shit like ice queen daphne or other stupid cookie-cutter fanon plots.

I also disagree about the overall quality of writing being higher now, imo it was better at the beginning, before all the books were published and a little bit after, back when the authors still had original ideas.

** People don't read the original books as much and they forget what happened in canon. /I swear to god if I have to argue with one more person about Draco Malfoy because of the movies/

** In some ways there is less creativity. For example, certain 'stations of canon' are kind of locked in if you still take the premise of the fic being 'fighting Voldemort post-1991.' In other words, how many of those fics set in the 90s that focus on fighting Voldemort /don't/ involve Horocruxes? How many of those fics don't involve Harry being a Horocrux? While those things are canon, it would be refreshing to see well written fics that involve Voldemort having secured his (assumed) immortality through a different path or with a Harry that didn't experience occasional headaches/visions due to Voldemort.

There's also the idea that everybody's ideas of a bunch of characters are kinda locked into place. Hermione is always smart and hardworking, Harry's never a social butterfly, Ron never not indulges in large quantities of food. These things are fine, but anytime we see a character that's different, they are always too 'OOC' unless the work specifically says that it features a Lazy!Hermione, a Social!Harry, etc.
