Getting bored of reading fics where Hermione gives too much care about elf rights. Where she looks down on people acting high and mighty and aristocratic, unable to accept the fact that people bribe others to get what they want and she won't do it despite the need of something behind it. Tired of reading fics where she still goes by the rules and law abiding even during wartime.

I don't mind if Harry or Hermione is the MC. I just want fics where Hermione is no goody two shoes. Thanks in advance.

** Hermione is a great character, but even in cannon her moral compass isn't that great.

She drugs some kids and leaves them in a cupboard naked.

She permanently scars a girl

She leads to the kidnapping of a teacher, (tho if I could I probably would as well.)

*** I totally agree with you, and you even forgot some things. I mean, I love Hermione but her moral compass in canon is a little bit screwed:

- first year: setting a living Person on fire

- fourth year: prisoning a living person in a glas-jar

- fifth year: blackmail said person

- sixth year: hexing McLaggen during the Quidditch tryouts; everything she did out of jealousy while Ron and Lavander were together

- seventh year: altering her parents memories

I always thought that Dark Hermione would be more realistic than Dark Harry. Without Harry and Ron being her "anchors to humantity" I totally could see her going down a dark path if she thinks it's the right thing to do. Not every evil person starts with evil intentions, but there is the saying: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions".

*** Yes and no.

I think the key distinction here is that she did those things (and those listed by [[/u/Serena_Sers]]) for the greater good, so to speak: in pursuance of the imperatives of her moral compass. In other words, she used less-than-good means to accomplish good ends---and those ends happened to be ones that the reader agrees with almost every time.

What I think the OP is asking for is fics in which she doesn't seek good ends in the first place.

**** Yes because we are told the story from Harrys side. Now tell the same story from Goyle's mother's perspective.

And the confundus really has no excuse.

I like cannon Hermione, but if fandom comes down so hard on Dumbledore greater good, I'm not sure why it's ok when someone they like does it.

I'm actually all for the greater good in practice. The world is a nasty place and there are far fewer black and white decisions that can be made than people believe. Every complex decision is gray and sometimes good people have to be hurt to help the majority.

My issue is the willingness to ignore hermione faults that the community displays far too often.

***** I agree completely, actually. My most despised fanfic portrayal of Hermione is as someone nice, nonjudgmental, and reluctant to hurt people.

The distinction I am drawing is between means and ends. Hermione's ends tend to be ones that the readers agree with. Her means tend to be all over the map. The examples [[/u/Rikkardus]] gave suggested that he or she was looking for fics in which Hermione doesn't pursue good ends either.

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.

  In which Hermione takes over the Wizarding World.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.

  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

** I'm tryin to write something like this for a fest over the next two months. My Hermione is always a bit sassy, but this time I'm going full /ruthless/ too. For example her fling with Krum is really her playing with his feelings to spy on the Durmstrang students and corroborate Snape's intel from Karkaroff.

I could use an alpha reader to help me whip chapter 3 into something coherent and believable. I've already drafted chapters 1 and 2 but I'm not above gutting them for the sake of the story.

Here's a rough outline:

Chapter 1: POV Mommy-Domme!Poppy Pomfrey through the 10 year affair with Snape from his first year teaching up to 1992. There may be a bonus chapter later with some PWP vignettes of their dynamic, and there's some frank talk about what their sex life is like, but there are NOT gratuitous sex scenes in this fic. (i.e. rated M not E)

Chapter 2: POV Angsty!Severus Snape through the increasing tensions of 1992-1996, and he mentors Hermione through her dabbles in espionage, including teaching her occlumency.

Chapter 3: POV Ruthless!Hermione Granger from 1996 onward as she makes hard choices to get through the war. Hermione and Poppy become close friends, caring for those who are injured after the Battle of Hogwarts.

Unsure exactly how it ends. I've begun writing chapter 3 with the intent of steering it into SSHG territory, but I wouldn't be terribly surprised if it becomes a Poppy/Sev/Hermione triad...or, I'm still not sure about Snape's survival and may go for a canon-compliant tragedy. This is for an SSHG fest with a rarepair sidepair, but I think the more powerful relationship to explore in this fic is the friendship of Poppy and Hermione, as the only ones who give a damn about Snape.

If this sounds like something anyone would care to read and discuss and help shape the ending, please DM me.

Edit: I do hope that anyone downvoting my post is also making recs for OP to read, or writing their own not-so-goody-two-shoes Hermione. If you don't like what I'm writing just move along. I'm just making my best response to OP's request.

*** I really like the general premise and know of several fics along these lines (along with having made a number of false starts myself). If you need someone to bounce ideas off, I'm game.

One question I have is how important is the SS/HG 'ship to the fic? Does the rest of the plot exist to facilitate it? Is it just one of many possibilities? SS/HG 'ship is invariably all sorts of problematic, because of the age difference, the student-teacher relationship, and, frankly, the simple question of what does it actually add to the story?

The typical workaround for the squick factors---ageing Hermione up by means of overusing a Time Turner---disrupts the story in other ways. So, my suggestion would be to ditch the SS/HG 'ship and focus on a mentor/student relationship between them and on the rarepair. IMO, making a romantic relationship between Ron and a Dark!Hermione work would be far more original and interesting.

**** Thanks for the feedback. If you can rec any specific fics along these lines I'd be quite grateful for the fresh reads. I've seen a few myself where he has to convince her that the means justify the ends, but in this one it's /Poppy/ who first puts them in a room alone together to hash some things out, thinking it's for /Sev's/ benefit, and then Hermione decides he knows things she wants to learn. (And then again Poppy helps set it up.)

I'm putting a note in my fic-ideas doc to consider Ron/Dark!Hermione because you're right that could be really interesting, but for now, since it's a showcase piece for an SSHG fest, I still want to highlight the interactions between Snape and Hermione, even if it's not hearts-and-flowers romantic. Honestly I don't see either of them as hearts-and-flowers romantic anyway.

I'm always a little amused by the folks who want to read something darker and then are still squicked by SSHG. That's part of the fun of it to me. I /like/ to be squicked. I don't much care for the age-ups or time travel that make it "ok" for these two to be together during the series years or Marauder era (because, again, you're right that is disruptive in other ways). That said, most of my SSHG is post-war EWE HEA that gets around many of the problems simply by waiting until he no longer has that position of authority, and neither has the weight of the magical world on their shoulders. I have exactly one serious SSHG darkfic already that takes place during HBP, but that one is entirely Snape's POV and I don't want to spend the entirety of this one wallowing in angst and self-loathing lol.

For this fic, I'm finding several places to weave in that mentor aspect (which is solid advice thanks), as she eventually realizes she can go to him for help after /he goes to her/ for a couple of things. It's a very mutually beneficial relationship -- like OP was saying about bribery, she knows she has to give him something in order to get what she wants.

I'm also trying on some "magic made me do it" trope. I love taking the cliche tropes and flipping them a bit. After all, the WIKTT is the source of the original MLC challenge -- I've had /decades/ to think about putting my own spin on these common plot devices with these two characters specifically. That previous darkfic I wrote was my take on the "Dark Revel" trope that was super popular in the early days of the fandom. (If you want to find it, I'm [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][jalapeno_eye_popper]] on AO3 and it's called /My Whole Existence is Flawed/ and I don't usually link it directly because Rule 8.)

In the case of this new fic, Hermione already had a pretty ruthless streak to her, but then the potions that help her cope with Dolohov's curse after the Dept of Mysteries actually shut down her hormonal desires. As a side effect, all her emotional responses are delayed for a "filter" that represses her baser instincts and thus takes her ruthless edge and dials it up to 11. This is actually what Snape considers the /lesser/ of two evils, because the alternative is... well... that squicky stuff about sex with one of his students. I'm having some fun with the idea that /he's/ more squicked about it than anyone else, because he seriously regrets the days when he created spells "for enemies" and it's coming back to bite him.

Here's an excerpt from Chapter 2, Snape's POV

#+begin_quote
  Dolohov's favorite curse.

  That sick bastard.

  "I know a partial counter-curse," Severus murmured, drawing his wand. First he cast a numbing spell, then a gentle cleansing spell, and finally the incantation to close the wound. It would leave a curse scar, but Miss Granger was no longer in mortal danger.

  Poppy eyed him curiously. "That was easy enough. Why are you still so severe?"

  He raised one eyebrow.

  "I know, you're always severe. But this is different. Perhaps /disturbed/ is the better word. What's wrong?"

  He swallowed hard, looking away from both Poppy and Miss Granger, gaze directed downward at his own boots. The pause wasn't long, but he was sure Poppy would catch his hesitation. Without looking up, he said, "When she wakes, she'll still be compelled by the curse to be /intimate/ with the first person she sees."

  Poppy gasped, drawing Severus' full attention, and then her lip curled. "A Death Eater designed this curse, as well as the partial counter-curse."

  Severus felt his guts drop to his feet. He had to remind himself that she didn't actually recognize it, and she didn't know. She didn't know any of the spells he invented in those days, or that he was a much better teacher of the Dark Arts than he was of Potions. Dolohov only needed a few pointers to get it right. Severus couldn't force himself to lie about it, except by omission: "Yes, to make certain victims more compliant." He adopted the same no-nonsense tone she liked to use. "You can try to give her a sedative. I may have another potion to repress her desire."

  A quiet voice queried, "For how long?"

  Severus shut his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. /Fuck./ She was already awake, looking at him like he was her favorite textbook. "In theory... indefinitely."

  "Oh, god," the girl moaned, "Give me the sedative, but only because I feel like I've been hit by a train, and I want all my wits and limbs working properly when I jump you."

  "Miss Granger!" he hissed, feeling heat in his cheeks.

  Poppy snickered. "Good girl, you need to rest now. Here you are."

  As the sedative was administered, Severus turned on his heel and left. He had a Repression Potion to brew.

***** Thanks for reply. Briefly, the fics I had in mind were,

- linkffn(For The Only Hope by ausland)
- linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258)

The potion idea is promising. Funnily enough, I ended up implementing the idea of Hermione under the influence of a potion that temporarily shuts off her moral qualms in the one multi-chapter fic I am actually attempting: linkao3(Potential and Tension by turbinicarpus). Once she is off it, Hermione is explicitly conflicted by how /effective/ she had been while under its influence---whether she should seek to imitate its effects.

Dark!Hermione/Ron romance I think is an underused idea that could create an interesting dynamic, particularly if it's portrayed as a high-school romance rather than a 'ship for the ages (which IMO is true for almost all romance fics, but that's a separate discussion). In some sense, Ron is the anti-Snape, far more so than Harry, and not because of his (largely fanon) disdain for Slytherins. I would expect Hermione to make the first move---and probably quite directly and even aggressively: she finds the tall redhead attractive, she is keenly aware of being inextricably involved in a conflict that is not unlikely to take her life before it's over, so /carpe diem/.

Fair point about not being squicked by violence and ruthlessness while being squicked by aspects of Snamione. I do have a lot of respect for Snamione writers: whereas Harmonians and Dramionists more often than not reduce Hermione to arm-candy and follower in the former and a flighty, bookish ingenue in the latter, Snamionists tend to portray her as mature and powerful.

At the same time, there is an important distinction: the transgression of ordinary moral and ethical norms in the course of a bloody civil war is understandable; whereas the transgressions in Snamione are inherently gratuitous. It doesn't help that Snamione fics I've seen (including the two I've just recommended) tend to portray exactly the sort of uninteresting and stereotypical romance that you've referenced, with lots of synthetic angst and very little logic to the two characters' actions. Heck, I'd probably respect a fic that actually revels in the transgression---that involves a fling but not a 'ship---more.
