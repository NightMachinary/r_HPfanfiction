So I was thinking of writing a few fics, but it would be a Guess-that-movie-plot kinda series of fics. and it would include movies from all around the world and you would have to guess the movie from the plot I gave throughout the fic.

Of course, some details of the movies would be changed so its not identical to the movie, but not enough would be changed so the movie is unidentifiable.

Should I go for it? I already have a few stories pending but I kinda do want to do this one. I could also use quite a bit more of movie recommendations from around the world (Mostly just romantically inclined) so its not just north american movies.

If it's something you're going to enjoy planning and writing, what's the harm? :)
