There was a story, where Hermione was actually from some very ancient but not very rich Muggle noble family. She was pretty cool about it, didn't do much fuss about it, except she could have those lovely lines like “Malfoy, Malfoy ... I don't remember to see you in Ascott, are you from some impoverished branch of the family, or something?” and “And Malfoy ... yes, of course, nouveau riche, no history and no proper breeding”. Petunia somehow got in peace with the magical world (she was a little bit magical herself) and living close to Grangers (except they were not called exactly Grangers, something similar).

Anybody knows what story it was?


** That might be linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot]])? Hermione is part of the house of "Graynge", and I'm pretty sure that Snape (who was also sent back in time) set it up so Petunia was less... Perunia.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** Reboot by Kallanit has Harry, Hermione, and Snape go back in time. Snape goes back to the day he first met Petunia and Lily. Petunia does not end up with Vernon. And Snape does not join the deatheaters eg he's good. Now Hermione did put Draco down because her house was of the peerage and had been in Britainway before the Malfoys have left france.

However, I don't recall any lines like you referenced in your OP. The story is just shy of 290K words and I thought it was a decent read.

*** I may have it mixed with something else (and it could be even Justin Finch-Fletchley delivering those lines), but it doesn't matter. “Reboot” is the story I was looking for.

was it this one? Hermione's proper name in the fic is the Lady Hermione Graynge, and I'm pretty sure it's the only one I've read where Hermione had a different last name to canon
