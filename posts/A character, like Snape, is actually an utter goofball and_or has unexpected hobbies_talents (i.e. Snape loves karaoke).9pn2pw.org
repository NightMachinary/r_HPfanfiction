"Dunderheads!"

Unimpressed with his students' performances, Severus Snape walks up to the stage, rolls up his sleeves, and sings the best rendition of 'Hungry Like the Wolf' ever heard. Or the usually stoic mask of Daphne Greengrass cracks when gifted with the 1995 Pretty Pegasus stuffed plushie -- the only one she lacks for that year's collection -- and squees in delight.

Basically, fanfics where the typical stoic, no-nonsense characters have more to them than meets the eye, a la Captain Holt from Nine-Nine.

** Well, it's sort of what Snape did to Lockhart - waltzed up there, adjusted his sleeves, and blew him off the stage, literally.

He was just too Snape-ish to thoroughly carry it off.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
