***** That's good to know. I actually just started it too. At first, I was annoyed that it was a friendship fanfic (or whatever the A/N said), but now I'm okay with it. I love the ff so far.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Hermione gets sent back in time to the Marauders. How can she face Sirius, the once love of her life again after he died in her arms-killing her inside. Her heartbreak over the lost war in her present day takes it's toll and can the young Sirius take his mind off of the broken witch that seems to fear nothing and not fawn over him?
