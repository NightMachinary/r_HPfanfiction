** That mostly depends on how exactly you read stories. If it's in a web browser, then extensions (for example [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/][FoxReplace]] for Firefox or [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/word-replacer-ii/djakfbefalbkkdgnhkkdiihelkjdpbfh/reviews?hl=en][Word Replacer II]] for Chrome/Chromium-based browsers) can work. If you download a copy with some third-party application or service, then you can edit the document and search/replace all matches of "Hadrian".

*** There are some circumstances where it can be done well. Most of the time they change the name for no reason, which inevitably leads to it being shit.

** u/aspectq:
#+begin_example
  $('p').each(function(){
      var t = $(this).text();
  t = t.replace(/hadrian/ig, 'Harry');
      $(this).text(t);
  });
#+end_example

On ff.net the text is in *p* tags. Hence the code above.

*** The approach isn't bad, provided someone knows how to create a bookmarklet or a userscript out of it.

Keep in mind however, that most formatting (any bold, italic and underscored text but not text-align center/right) will be removed from the chapter when using this code. Since you're applying the .text() content to /all/ p-tags, whether the word "hadrian" was found within or not, no formatting will survive. You could use .html() instead and keep the formatting intact - this is inherently unsafe because it can have unpredictable consequences, but a word like "hadrian" would not break any html code - but above all, it would be a lot better to filter out all those tags which do not contain the word you look for.

** If you're on Chrome, I highly recommend the Search and Replace google extension. And I get why you need it, I use it often to get rid of 'Mione and Hadrian.
