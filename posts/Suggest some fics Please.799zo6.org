So I hear about people who want super Harry but gradual and all that. . What I want is the opposite like for e.g. one fine morning Harry wakes up to realise he's a god and starts causing mayhem like reviving Morgana and all that sorts or ice also heard about fics where Harry has a nundu and I still haven't found one -_-" anyways in most straight forward way I want the exact opposite most people want from a super Harry fic I want him to get one power up at no cost and then he's able to do whatever the fuck he wants kill Dumbledore voldemort with a finger or just with thought.....enslave his friends/death eaters and all that jazz.....couldn't care less if it's dark just keep slash away.....slash only allowed if the sheer super/overpowered-ness makes up for it.


** // In linkffn(Make a Wish) Harry has a nundu if I remember correctly? He's also quite powerful there but doesn't fit your request

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** The closes thing I can think of is linkffn(Harry Potter, Lone Traveler, God and Wizard). It's part of a series where harry becomes the universes handy-man. He gets transported by higher powers from dimension to dimension to basically fix shit. There's two installments before this where he is first a wizard who gets traveled all over the place, then he gets the hang of it, then he gets promoted to god. If you start with the "devine" installment you have a Harry that /can/ basically do whatever the fuck he wants and uses that to fix messed up alternate universes. Since he travels to alternate universes regularly it's somewhat reachable without reading the previous installments. Though him having foreknowledge of the worlds is already fairly broken so you might like that too.

Not exactly what you're looking for, but I can't think of anything closer to your request at the top of my head.

  It's finally happened: The Lone Traveler became a God. With the Divine name Marek Ilumian, Patron God of Free Will, Minor God of Knowledge and Travel, sometimes he goes over the top. But he's all about giving people a choice - or at least the opportunity to Choose. And having fun, of course. And Pie. Lots of Pie.
