Just like someone uses imperio and controls her


** Eh, that depends. Are you into smuts? Because there's this one where Hermione is under the imperius curse and forces Harry to have sex with her to place a curse on him to drain his magic, which leads to Harry looking for help (from Tonks, no less) to get rid of the curse, and to do that he needs to... have more sex with other girls. Yeah, not the best sales pitch, but it meets the criteria. It's a comedy fic, at best, not really serious or very elaborated.

It's called [[https://marjorie.auroris.net/harry-potter-cov/a-trip-to-hogsmead/][The Charm of Venus]].

***** It drains a portion of his magic and gives it to his partner, leaving him perpetually exhausted and weak. He also can't resist the caster at all, and Imperio!Hermione is voracious.

** Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

Hermione isn't under the Imperius. Instead she was ripped from her parents, memory charmed so that she believes that they hated her and that she was rescued by Lucius Malfoy, raised to be completely loyal to Minister Malfoy from a young age with all the other muggleborns, and indoctrinated to believe that her special status as brainwashed soldier is a great honor. Involuntary sex with Draco is implied but only as a short mention. The story is about her stumbling across an inconsistency in the Obliviator records and how her secret investigation reveals the truth about the 'benovelent' Minister.

It's quite a heavy AU where Malfoy took over after Voldemort's first death in 1981 and became essentially an orwellian dictator, wizarding Britain is heavily seperated from the muggle world and everyone believes that the muggles are horrible monsters who abuse all magical children. Ron, Harry, Dumbledore and the rest of the good guys spent the last 20 years or so in France and went to Beauxbatons and finally return to Britain to prepare a coup against Malfoy.

Featuring a very competent Ron and Dumbledore with no bashing. Main pairing is Ron/Hermione, which is a bit troublesome with him being a secret agent for a foreign enemy preparing to topple the government and her being a loyal soldier of that very government.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
