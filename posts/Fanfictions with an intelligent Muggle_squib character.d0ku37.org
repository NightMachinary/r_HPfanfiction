** Strangers at Drakeshaugh is pretty good, with a Muggle woman, Jaqueline "Jaqui" Charlton, whose family befriend Harry, Ginny and their children. Mind you, the story has a pretty disappointing ending... but the sequel, James and Me, picks up years later and focuses on Jaqui's now grown-up daughter Anna, as she meets James Sirius Potter again for the first time in ages... and that story looks like it's heading places that are a LOT more promising.

#+begin_quote
  When Annabel meets someone she hasn't seen in many years, her life takes another unexpected turn. How many surprises can she take? Do people really change? Has James Sirius Potter finally grown up? Whatever happened to those brave adventurers, the Drakestone seven? Warning: Language, and some smut.

*** I have been [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][critical with story]] as well, but still I think it is one of the best fanfic stories I know about and most of my criticism grew out of the frustration, because I think it is one of few stories which are almost good enough to break through the barrier to be really good story even outside of the fanfic universe. Yes, „James and Me“ is very nice as well, except both these stories (as 90 % of all fanfic stories) would get help by rather savage trimming. Especially Strangers have very slow start (there is so much tea drunk and biscuits eaten, that one has tendency to fall asleep), but “James and Me” could use some trimming as well (in the middle, those bike trips are slowing down the story a bit). And unfortunately, it seems to me the author gave up on HP fanfiction stories after all these years and he know writes [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3328948/1/Winter-Journeys][original fantasy]]. Which is really pity, I would really love to see the conclusion of Anna and James relationship (I have already dreamed about couple of ones, but I wouldn't to make a follow-up for such good writer as Northumbrian).

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

**** Its focussed on a stereotypical fantasy wizard coming to hogwarts. so the first part is mainly about the clash of different magical systems. Soon another main character appears, a police woman who experiences strange stuff. Id recommend it!

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

  v. split or sever (something) AU. Holly Potter was to be raised in the Muggle World for her safety, return to the Wizarding World at eleven, and leave her deplorable family behind. But between a squib-born friend, a secret education, and a suspicious business running, the Wizarding World will get more than it expected from the Girl-Who-Lived.
