i am absolutely sick and tired of slytherin harry being made out to be the only intelligent person in slytherin. so many great fics fall into a habit of making harry the only person who actively uses cunning in slytherin, and seem to make a point of attacking draco for for being an idiot. I like these fics, but im really hoping for recs where a slytherin main character has actual competition within the house itself


** Interesting notion. How would you write that? I'm actually writing a Slytherin Harry fanfiction right now and I want to incorporate other Slytherins more. Thoughts?

*** Figure out what the characters motivation is (they should be ambitious and be trying to become powerful to achieve their goals). Have a diverse selection of goals and incorporate a couple into the plot that your Harry is focused on. For example, your Harry is attending lots of pureblood parties to become a politician, Pansy wants to become an influential robes designer so she shows him what to wear and proves that she's the best in that way, Blaise has been taught by his mother all about manipulation so that he can take on the Italian wizarding world so he has no qualms about helping Harry in England and might make a strong ally (Or develop the other characters more; Theo wants to start his own business “Nott Products” and he will go to any length to get situated, Tracey's kids will get pureblood status if she marries well so she is learning as much as she can to be the best mother beyond the typical “just give birth”) Draco being the more direct competition makes the most sense so you just need to allow him a share of the wins, especially at the start of the story. Some people over power Harry by letting him do things that society advises against so there should be consequences for this that he doesn't see coming (which Draco can know about). Canon Draco loses at the start of PS cause he represents Harry coming out of the shadow of the Dursley's, meanwhile Quirrell is getting a lot of wins in the background, so pick your main opponent and give them some early intimidating wins. Introduce a plot goal that is stakes enough to be contentious but won't wipe the enemy out (this is the Quidditch games in canon) eg a special assignment. Give your Harry flaws and let the other characters recognise them and exploit them, then you can have Harry overcome his flaw at the end (not at the beginning or the story is boring).

*** Don't have Harry automatically gain power of slytherin in his first year. He doesn't have the political clout of the Malfoys during his first few years, he actually has to work hard to gain influence over slytherin

**** also keeping in mind that even Riddle, as a halfblood had to spend years gaining influence over Slytherin house, and that was using his Slytherin heritage and parseltongue, and that was BEFORE the cohesive anti-muggleborn movement he created.

*** Don't make Harry be the only cunning person in Hogwarts. It's fine if you have Draco, for example, to be this brash child he is in canon since you can easily excuse his behavior on his upbringing, but don't make the rest of the House a bunch of sheep that follow him [Draco] around because of Lucius, or even worse, have them follow Harry (11-year old child) just because he is the main character.

Don't make Harry the heir of Slytherin the moment he enters the common room, don't make the entire house to be a bunch of bullies that curse him all the time because he is a Potter, don't use those overused tropes such as 'what happens in the common room stays in the common room' or 'the underground arena where they can fight if someone insults someone' and so on.

Don't have Harry to win over the entire Slytherin simply because he is the MC. Let him work for it, and struggle because of his blood, upbringing, and lack of magical family. You could consider Harry using parseltongue to gain some respect. For example, let him struggle in the first year, since he's new to the whole magic thing, has no connections, and he's a half-blood, which would change when he speaks to the snake, whether it is in the dueling club (second year), or you could devise a completely new scenario where this ability would manifest itself. I think the former idea would be more dramatic since the entire school would think ill of him, and the only ones who didn't think about him as evil would be Slytherins, who made his life difficult until now.

You could take a page from the Santi's 'Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived', and have someone to stick with him, only for him to learn that the entire reason for them being friendly was to milk his name and his fame and to manipulate him, only for them to end up liking each other for real, or maybe have Harry find out about this which could start some hostile rivalry between them.

And probably the most important of all, don't make 11-years old children be politicians.

*** you could always incorporate some of the older slytherins, which I find are an untapped resource in fics with a slytherin main character. one of those options is an OC sibling of a known pureblood family, example being Josephine Zabini, from the AO3 fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900/chapters/26470377][Rose Petal Red]], which i realize as a self insert isn't for everybody, but i enjoy it a lot.

alternatively, you could use known characters, but switch up their motivations a bit. Draco is usually portrayed as a fairly 2D character, especially in the beginning of most fics. However, you change his overwhelming arrogance and reliance on his father's name to a arrogance on the Malfoy name and a need to live up to his father's harsher expectations that he live up to slytherin ideals and suddenly he feels a lot more real and complex. Or, Daphne Greengrass, who i think is rarely seen as a rival, and more often as a ally/love interest. In a fic she could be portrayed by her family's neutrality during the war to appeal to halfbloods and minor purebloods, as an alternative to the more supremacist purebloods in slytherin. I think it depends on what you're willing to change or create about a character's motivations

** Are you looking for recs with other Slytherins being competent? If so, there are a few out there. I do know what you mean though. Fics where Slytherin Harry just cruises through with no trouble at all just make no sense.
