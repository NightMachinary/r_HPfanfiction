** There are a lot, so I'll name the only one that I read any of, which is Arithmancer. It's Hermione-centered (she is a math whiz), but follows the usual cast through Hogwarts with Harry doing about the same stuff, with Hermione having a much bigger part. The first volume is 3 or 4 years, the second volume "Lady Archimedes" is (I think) the rest, and then there's what I believe is a post-graduation sequel called "Annals of Arithmancy". I've only read the first volume. It might be the kind of thing you're looking for. I had mixed feelings. It's an engaging read but I felt that once the main idea had played out, continuing was just more of the same.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
