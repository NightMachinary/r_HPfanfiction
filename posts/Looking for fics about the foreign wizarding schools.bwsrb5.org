** linkffn(4508571) - Für Das Größere Wohl - Durmstrang in the times of Grindelwald's tenure as a headmaster. Story follows a German muggleborn boy who is a keen follower of Nazi's beliefs and considers himself to be superior to some other people because of his race. But when he arrives at Durmstrang he discovers that race is not something wizards care about, unlike the blood purity.

One of my favourite fics but it's abandoned for good.

There was Snow Point by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1499112/Quetzalcoatls][Quetzalcoatls]] but idk if its been finished as though there's a sequel it looks dead too. These are only what i remember off the top of my head so might be back

** Harry potter and the boy who lived by the santi

Harry goes to Durmstrang. Incomplete and abandoned, but still one of my favorites.

On a side note: can someone recommend me fics similar to this one?

** Ooh this is definitely what you want! Half of it takes place at Beauxbatons, and it also dips into Ilvermorny. It is OC heavy and canon-compliant for all that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13126835/1/The-Slytherin-Heart][The Slytherin Heart]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6097611/Farbautidottir][Farbautidottir]]

A tale of ambition, cunning, pride, and above all love, this is the untold story of the strange events surrounding the 1792 Triwizard Tournament. Set against the political backdrop of revolutionary France, the three heirs of Slytherin look to find their way in a changing world while remaining true to their hearts and keeping favor with Britain's most powerful man, Septimus Malfoy.

​

Also here are some fun Castelobruxo stories!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13031702/1/Castelobruxo-The-Forest-Tales][Castelobruxo: The Forest Tales]]

Hidden in the heart of the Amazonian forest lies Castelobruxo. What are the secrets lurking inside the forest? Who are the mischievous creatures which guard the gates of the temple? A series of tales about the Brazilian Wizarding School, its magical beings, students and the folklore that doesn't seem to be so mythical after all.

** It's not exactly what your asking for but look into the Alexandra Quick series. It was written pre ilvermorvy(??) but has a FASCINATING version of Wizarding America that's completely canon with just the original series.

If you do read it be aware the first part's a but hard to get into, but it's ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!!!! There's actually a sub reddit for the fic if you're interested.

** I can recommend you this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13217021/1/Tales-From-Durmstrang-Poisoned-Bloodlines]]

It's not finished yet, but it's got some strong OC's in it and it all revolves around Durmstrang.
