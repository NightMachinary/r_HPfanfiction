This just finished and it was awesome! Action packed last chapter. Bit of mystery with the horcruxes, near physical pain at the amount of effort wasted on the Stone, Dumbledore's crushing realisations and similarly Quirrelmorts. What did everyone think?

No way. Next year he will be manipulating the Potters' attempt to retake control of Harry, and will restart the Order of the Phoenix to keep track of and mess with Lord Slytherin.

Hmm? There are some things that they should be thinking about, but I don't think they've put them all together into that kind of opinion? Dean is the only one who has expressed annoyance at John's "controlling", I think.

#+end_quote

This is an interesting idea but isn't Alex the heiress? I guess it depends on how patriarchal the Black family is but if she was Bella's child and the oldest /boy/ inherits then Draco would be the heir and therefore Alex couldn't be Bella's daughter.

I guess we need more information on inheritance to have a clear answer. IIRC so far we've only seen families with only daughters and eldest sons, no eldest daughter inheriting before a younger son.

(Also: Her middle name is Patricia. I know this is fairly weak evidence but I feel like Bella would have chosen something more traditional than that.)

As for Dumbledore and Lucius: I doubt the Potters have much say over Harry anymore. Any custody dispute could easily be won due to their negligence and if worst comes to worst Harry can always play the Lord Slytherin card. Granted, he doesn't want that known and it would be a worst case scenario but i doubt the Potters will ever get control over Harry again.

I think it'S kind of funny that Lucius hasn't made the connection between Harry and Lord Slytherin. I guess he assumes that a child simply can't be Lord Slytherin but considering the skills Harry has shown so far it really shouldn't be that much of a leap to make the connection, especially considering Lucius thinks that both of them are likely incarnations of Voldemort.

She could simply be "named" heir. Also, "blood adoption" exists in the setting but is illegal (ch. 4), so unlikely but a possible twist from Sirius.

*** Luna might also be a time traveler. I think she would know the fidelius for the horcruxes right? It would make sense because of how she keeps beating Ginny, only using her new moves when Ginny improves. Her mission would be to stay on the down low as much as possible, and correct Harry's mistakes. Harry's would be to make as many changes as possible, and John's was Fate/Death's first go.

Alex might really be Bellatrix's daughter. She was supposed to have replaced Bellatrix in the first timeline.

I don't think Dumbledore is 100% fucked. He lost some influence and reputation, but now he could operate in the shadows and had more flexibility.

Honestly, I don't think Harry did all that well in Year 1. He expanded his influence a great deal, but also blew his cover, and would be facing two difficult enemies. I'm not sure why he would bother with going to Hogwarts at all. Faking his death and operate completely as Lord Slytherin would give him far more flexibility and greater safety.

The timeline is already destroyed, so I think Voldemort will get his body back at different time. In fact, I think the later Voldemort gets resurrected, the better it's for Harry, unless he wants to set Voldemort after Dumbledore.

** The Horcux thing seems easily explained as someone (either another time traveller, James or even Harry with a time turner and an obviliate) switched them out.

The real danger is that Voldemort thinks that Harry fooled him, and has the most accurate assessment of Harry's abilities. I have a feeling that by the end of the series Harry will be forced to do that ritual that has been talked about, and most likely, someone will willingly sacrifice themselves for it, probably tracy or someone not as important.

Flamel will play a larger role, because he /knew/ that Harry wanted his stone, before Harry even wanted it! That is terrifyingly smart.

The only thing that irks me about this is that the prophecy sounds so very fake. I get it, hindsight is 20/20 and it may not be as obvious to the Potters, but it is literally the best outcome for Dumbledore and quite convenient. Aren't there experts on prophecies? Does it even make sense to have a prophecy that depends it's prediction on whether the subjects have heard it or not? Seems kinda pointless to have a prophecy that's not supposed to be heard...

It's a fake, obviously, so Dumbledore worded it as a backup plan to control the potters. If they never heard it it wouldn't matter what it said, but having heard it, suddenly Dumbledore's actions make sense to the Potters. From their perspective it tells them why Dumbledore was behaving the way he was all along, since he heard the prophecy in the beginning.

I'm assuming the ministry experts don't even know about this one, it's probably just been surreptitiously placed by Dumbledore without anyone noticing.

Well, duplicitous for good reason, b/c of prophecy. I'm not sure why it would occur to them that DD can plant a fake prophecy, as they went to the place where prophecies are stored and controlled by the ministry and found it. It seems like an independent verification of everything DD has been doing.

So if you think the prophecy is real, it /caused/ DD to act the way he did, not DD acting that way and planting a fake to justify it.
