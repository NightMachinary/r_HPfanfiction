*** A continuity error on JKs part.

In book 5 Sirius said she was blasted off because 'she ran off and married a muggle'. Then later in book 7 he showed up as a muggleborn on the run / in hidding.

The continuity error can easily be rationalized away though. The way Sirius describes the event in book 5 can easily be described as him repeating what the family said, and to the blacks there probably isn't much difference between a muggle and a muggleborn. The context was very much 'Andromeda got blasted off the tree because she 'ran a away with a muggle'' kind of deal.

**** I'm not even sure if this is a continuity error. I'm fairly sure that this "rationalisation" is in fact her exact intention. JKR has commented several times in the past on how the extreme pure-bloods consider any trace of Muggle blood to be completely unacceptable, Muggleborns being equivalent to Muggles.

***** Agreed, and that's how I view it.

However, some may read the two passages in a different more literal way, hence why this question is being asked in the first place. This is probably the case for a good amount of people who only just read the books without finding any external information, myself included.

What I was trying to get after, is that it seems like a continuity error if read in a certain way.

** The biggest problem with the Black family tree are the dates. Not only are all the members of the family dying incredibly young, they're also having kids when they're age 13, etc. It's all a bit of a mess.

The second problem with it is the way it's been used. For example, so many people have assumed that Charlus Potter is Harry's grandfather. There's no real reason to think that - in the past, presumably the family had multiple branches as any normal family that hasn't been wiped out by a terrorist does - and one very good reason to think that he isn't: again, the dates don't work out well.

*** According to JKR, James' parents were elderly by wizarding standards when they died in the 1970s. Yeah, that probably means that they weren't only in their 50s, but the question then is what is elderly by wizarding standards? The only two canon wizards (iirc) that lived past 200 are Flamel and Dippet. Actually, as far as I know, Dippet, Marchbanks, and Bagshot are the only witches or wizards known to be older than Dumbledore, and he's "only" 150. If wizards are long lived, wouldn't there be more than three? Is 100 considered elderly? Or is elderly used to describe "old in body" even if chronologically they're about McGonagall's age? As for the Blacks, they died between age 50 and 70 for the most part (Arcturus lasted 90). Could that be related to the fact that they were purebloods, or somehow related to their magical power and ability?

There are a lot of questions that aren't answered by canon but do have room for creative interpretation in fanfics.

**** My head canon says that the intermarrying that goes on in the pureblood supremacist families causes the average magical strength and general health of the family to decline, and they need "new blood" to be added every few generations to help keep the family strong. This decrease in health and magical strength, as well as the Black's being a dark family and therefore not always making the healthiest of decisions would tend to cause a tendency towards dying younger than is average. A good example of this is with the Gaunts. Merope was practically a squib, and the whole family was looked down upon by the general population. But once you add some new blood (in this case muggle blood, but muggleborn works the same) you get one of the most powerful wizards of the century.

***** This goes rather against the importance placed by JKR (and accordingly the way magic works in her universe) of choices over birth. I don't think any magical qualities are decided at birth.

****** I think it could be less of a 'magical quality' and more of a... human biology?.. problem. The inbreeding issue may not affect your raw magical power... but we know it affects your other human traits, which may impact your ability to learn or focus on magic. If magical ability is a combination of raw power, focus, and will (or is focus and will a repetition, and I'm missing one?) inbreeding does affect things that can impede the second 2, even if it doesn't impact the first. In fact, even if it helps the first, it would still be a balancing act with the other two.

Although given our examples of powerful wizards... magic seems to find sanity confining. Dumbledore, Bellatrix, and Voldemort were all supposedly... nonlinear thinkers?

******* I think magic would probably correct any genetic abnormalities... certainly none of the purebloods we see appear to have any such problems except the Gaunts... though even with them, the problem seems to be that they're absurdly bigoted rather than any kind of biological problem.

******** I feel like we suffer from a lack of direct testable evidence here. Does magic correct basic biology? Or does it merely let a person/bloodline function in society longer before the bad traits pile up and become untenable. Or is there no direct effect of the magic gene on other genes? (Admittedly, some of my thinking is probably colored by a recent bout of [[/r/crusaderkings]] and it's version of genetic inheritance fogging up my recollection of actual biology/genetics)

I don't think the Harry Potter canon really gives us much to work with in terms of the cause/effect as it pertains to inbreeding and genetics, which makes most of this conjecture, but I sadly lack a eidetic memory to say for sure.

** I love the Black family tree - I actually made a copy on Ancestry for easy reference ^{^{"}} I think it can be used in different ways depending on the fic you want to write - there's no reason that the way everyone is related in one fic has to be the same as the way they are related in another. Although, Dorea and Charlus being Harry's grandparents is my 100% headcanon.

It irritates me, though, that people feel like the only characters are those mentioned on the Black family tree, and therefore all purebloods are inbred. There are families of the Sacred 28 that haven't married into the Blacks, there are families like the Odgens, Botts, Blotts, Fortescue's, Honeydukes, etc that haven't married into the Blacks, there are foreign families like the Zabinis, Krums, etc. All you have to do to travel is step into a fireplace, touch something, or spin in place. Surely the fancy pureblood parties would span across countries? Plus, each family probably had two or three kids per branch per generation too, before the war. And just because a war decimated one country doesn't mean it decimated others. There really is no reason that purebloods all HAVE to be inbred just because Walburga married her cousin and Harry married his several-generations-removed cousin in the epilogue.

Also, I tried reading Black Comedy just a few days ago, and I couldn't even get through half. It was just so bad D'=

It was mentioned on Pottermore apparently. But it only applies until the 1930s, which means either those houses intermarried to remain truly pure-blood or they married a less-than-pure-blood following that. The pure-blood [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pure-blood][page here]] shows a lot more than 28 purebloods and several that could be assumed to be pure-blood as well.
