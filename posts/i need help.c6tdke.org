:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I cant find a Drarry fic I've been reading on AO3. I accidentally closed the tab and cant find it anymore. It's about 7 years post Hogwarts, Harry falls ill with some unknown sickness that makes him unable to withstand any kind of magic and Draco is a healer and has to move in with Harry to serve his needs 24/7. It's 40 chapters long. I hope someone knows what I'm talking about!!!
