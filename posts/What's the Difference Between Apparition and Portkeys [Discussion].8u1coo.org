So Apparition is a type of teleportation of course. The person goes from point A to point C without going through the intervening space, so they aren't simply moving at high speeds. Harry's description of it feeling like being sucked through a tight straw seems to suggest it's like a personal wormhole.

Portkeys, on the other hand, are seemingly described as moving through space (albeit at some ludicrous speed). But then I remembered Dumbledore portkeyed Harry from underground at the Ministry into his office with no apparent damage to any structures. Is one intangible while using a Portkey? Or are Portkeys just some other kind of teleportation (it doesn't sound like it is).

Maybe it's supposed to be like the Bifrost in the MCU which, despite claiming to be an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, obviously moves one through space FTL (look at what Heimdall does to Hulk in Infinity War).


** One of them is the wizard moving under their own direction and power, the other is the wizard moving under the direction and power of a spell cast on an object. Both of them appear to be teleportation - going from A to Z without passing through the rest of the alphabet - with different, but nevertheless unpleasant, subjective experiences.

*** But aren't Portkeys described as moving people through space? Like in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward.

  His feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding for- ward in a howl of wind and swirling color;

**** I'd argue that both are some form of "subspace" travel. So you go from A to Z via the alternate dimension, not the rest of the alphabet.

**** That's the subjective experience, certainly. They can't be moving through actual, standard-issue space because Portkeys work from one indoor room to another, as we see at the end of OotP.

***** If we're going to discount subjective experience then we can't even say how Apparition works, even if it's described in a wormhole-y kind of way.

***** If portkeys warp space then they really just need the tiniest gap to move past. Under doors, through keyholes, etc...

I don't believe we've seen anyone portkey into a room with no gaps at all. I bet a portkey to a sub-sea facility would fail to work simply because it is completely sealed.

** I think they are very similar in function as they both seem to be a form of teleportation. In my own head, I think of Apparation as good for relatively short distances--Mr Weasley commuting from Devon to London, for example--and Portkeys are for more long-distance travel such as to mainland Europe. Portkeys would also be used for people inexperienced or unskilled in Apparation such as children as we see in GoF. I do have to wonder if a Portkey would work with a Muggle. It certainly worked with a dead body.

Floo, on the other hand, seems to actually incur travel time in real space as shown by Harry's horrible first trip through on the way to Diagon Alley. I would love to be able to Apparate (commute? what commute?), but you could not pay me enough to get me into a Floo.

** One possibility is thus: portkeys and apparitions are functionally the same thing.

When wizards/witches apparate, they appear to spin and be forced through an opening between two spaces. This ability is limited based on the individual caster. Additionally, other beings and objects can be pulled along with them via side-along apparition.

A portkey is almost identical in that it transports a person to another space via a spinning motion and you must be holding the object being moved between spaces. However, the difference appears that a portkey is a /set/ apparition point.

The best explanation is that the spell /portus/ is actually making an object apparate a specific time or place. It transports anyone who touches it to a set point, but requires a different spell to block its use (anti-portkey charm for instance). That might explain how Dumbledore actually got rid of Harry's stuff after leaving the Dursleys in HBP: he turned them into portkeys.

*** The issue with this is that Portkeys are described as moving forward (check elsewhere on the thread, I quoted it), whereas Apparition is described being sucked through a sort of hole and instantly appearing at your destination. The latter is teleportation, but Portkeys sound more like a warp drive.

**** In that same quote it also describes them as "swirling" which does sort of call into question the nature of the motion. For Harry, forward could have been toward the portkey.

** I once read an excellent description in "A Cadmean Victory" that described the world as a piece of paper, apparition crumples the paper so that you and you destination are close together and you step across the crumpled paper to where you want to go.

Portkey is like folding the paper in half and punching a hole through from where you are to where you want to be.

*** That seems backwards. Apparition is described as the paper folded and punched through; that's essentially a wormhole. Portkeys are described as actually moving through space, not taking a shortcut. It might hop through another dimension (explaining how you can Portkey from indoors).
