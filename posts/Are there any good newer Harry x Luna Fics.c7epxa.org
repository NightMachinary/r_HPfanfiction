  A/U after DH, EWE. Luna Lovegood is the Ministry's newest Unspeakable, and Harry's work as an Auror brings them into close quarters. What will happen when The Boy Who Lived Twice can't stop thinking about The Girl Who Lives In Her Own Universe? HP/LL

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.

  It's the morning after Ginny and Ron's fight in Half-Blood Prince, and she can't concentrate in DADA class. Unfortunately, that means she incurs the wrath of Snape. But somebody in the class has had enough of Snape's bullying and decides to take a stand. No longer a one-shot, and spinning out from HBP into something AU and silly. Harry/Luna.
