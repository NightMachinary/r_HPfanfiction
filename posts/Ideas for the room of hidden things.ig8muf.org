I'm interested in what everyone thinks might be in the room, it seems really underutilized in fics. In canon there is: a stuffed troll, a creature skeleton in a cage, dragon egg shells, a sword and an axe, a bust, a wig, broomsticks, damaged furniture, joke items, ‘evil' potions, and ‘thousands' of books. I had a few extra ideas: cursed objects, erotica, stolen objects that were hidden quickly away (like money or jewelry), and broken or old wands. Any other ideas?

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** I don't know if any ofther fic did it, but I really like the take linkffn(*Forging the Sword*) had on the Room-of-Hidden-Things, where, despite being full of items, is mostly useless.

The room is regularly "discovered" by the castle student, and anything usefull would have been plundered by the previous generations, especially Tom Riddle who would have taken anything taking his fancy. All the items we see in the Room are there because nobody though it was worth taking there. The magical items are broken. The potions are either "failed product" or have been replaced by better ones since they were placed there. And the books look more like "/Veracrass, their life, their story/" rather the "/Magik Most Evil/". I guess there could also be some money too, but not a fortune, just a handfull of knuts and sickles, with maybe one or two galleon that have been lost in the last 40 or 50 years. Enough to buy something nice like a broom (but not a top of the line one, and probably second hand), but not enough to crash the market.

Also, I never understood why the MC should look into the Room of Hidden Things to get books, since the Room of Requirement can "create" books like it did for the DA. We don't know the limits of the spell (can it create any books? Only books in the castle? On in the library? Or maybe any book that passed inside the castle? . . .) but it's still better than to look into the trash hoping to find a nice one.

** the SI in linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) does a lot of delving through the Room and finds pretty much all the stuff you mentioned.

Honestly the coolest thing in there would probably be the hidden books (guess which House I'm in lol) but all the /interesting/ ones would have nasty curses on them.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

**** It's just a really fun fic. I like the more down-to-earth approach to an SI rather than "SI fixes everything in 20 minutes and rediscovers 5 lots branches of magic". The magic and worldbuilding is cool too, and has a lot of authentic flavor to it.

** Pretty much anything. The elves use it as a lost and found/storage/garbage. There's a lot of leeway just with the elves. Students have been using it for centuries, apparently mainly to hide contraband (horcruxes/potion textbooks with dark curses/empty sherry bottles). That said, most of the stuff in there is probably going to be junk. Either broken, way past it's expiration date or just plain useless.

I think you can also expect it to be at least somewhat dangerous. Think #12 Grimmauld Place taken up to 11. Doxies and boggarts are just a few things we know of that like to infest such places.

I remember one fic where Harry setup a small business going through the place. Harry, Ron and Dobby did the sorting with anything useful being sold through Gringotts for a cut. They didn't make a fortune by any means, but Harry noted Ron was a lot happier with some pocket money.

** A bludger with a severely worn off enchantment that can't fly and instead just shuffles along on the floor

Several cursed statues

A pile of discarded muggle electronics

Viktor Krum's toy dragon from the First Task, stolen by one of his friends as a joke and ending up in the room after a series of hijinks ensued

The first draft of A History of Magic, written while Bathilda Bagshot was a third year

A giant wardrobe with caricatures of various professors pasted all over it, drawn by many students over the years

A taxidermied hippogriff

The surviving giant chess pieces from McGonagall's chess set

The remains of a muggleborn headmaster's 1910 attempt to build an elevator for the school

A bunch of old school uniforms

Some ashwinder eggs that the room's magic prevents from hatching

Surprisingly few talking portraits

A ton of historical artifacts muggle scholars would kill for but various wizards have just haphazardly tossed aside (Original copies of Shakespeare, Greco-Roman statues with the paint preserved, Leonardo da Vinci's proto-motorcycle, etc.)

Numerous dead rats and cockroaches

Earlier attempts at the Sorting Hat, a few of which are completely inanimate, others that will yell GYYYRFFINEAS HUFFWIN if touched, and the penultimate one, which is as sentient as the final Sorting Hat, but who harbored a deep dislike for children and refused to do the Sorting

Fred and George's firewhiskey stash
