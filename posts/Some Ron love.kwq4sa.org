**** Fair enough - I have a few that I'll share here. I'll admit that only one is Ron-centric, but they all show Ron pretty well.

​

linkffn(9649736) - This is a fun bit of AU 7th year fluff. It's Harmony and has a very supportive Ron, who I find pretty funny.

​

linkffn(2287898) - this is massive canon divergence. It was written before the series was completed so it's got a hugely different scenario for the end of the second war - it's a Harry/Ron piece.

​

linkffn(8550820) - Canon divergence. During the battle of the department of mysteries Harry, Ron, and Hermione are thrown back in time to the founders era. This probably shows the best Ron characterization. The growth and maturity shown by all three of them in this fic is amazing.

And finally, I'll add an extra Ron-centric fic in... It's self-promo so feel free to take it with a grain of salt and I'll freely admit work has been absolutely insane lately so I haven't been updating as much as I would like... But - here's the link to the 'series' just so you have an idea of what you're getting in to: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2079837]]

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** Have you tried Of Lies and Deceit and Hidden Personas from Jessiikaa15? It's both on FFN and AO3 but the updates come out on FFN first as it was published there first. It's a WIP with 50+ chapters and still being updated. With Ron being a good friend and with Dark! Golden Trio.

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH
