I've gotten a series of them from an anonymous guest reviewer and I'm wondering how the writers on this sub deal with them. Thanks.


** I take them as a sign that I'm doing well enough to draw a troll's attention.

** I read them once and move on. The way I think of it is anyone who's left a hate review has spent more time writing the review then I have thinking on it, ergo they've just wasted their time. I find this a good thing to do IRL too, good for the mental health.

I think on ffn you can also moderate guest reviews before they become public.

** Laugh at them and delete them. It's hard, and hurtful, but it's really just best to ignore them the best you can and get rid of them. I had one calling me a whiny bitch the other day, which was hurtful, but also not a reflection on me.

These people aren't worth your time or energy.

** Delete â€˜em. I have no compunction. I do this for fun and if it isn't fun, I make it fun again

** If you're on AO3, you can turn on moderation and delete them

I haven't gotten any hate reviews but I did get a mildly eyebrow-raising one (someone whose profile picture was Leon Kennedy in bondage calling my romantic comedy "hot"). But hey, at least he kudoses and bookmarked !

**** Activate moderate guest comments on ffn. Once you do, you have a day or two to allow the review or not to allow it (this only works with anonymous guest comments).

Other than that, I just ignore them. Anyone who comments like that anonymously is a coward or a troll, and I don't have time for that noise.
