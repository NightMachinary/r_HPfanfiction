How come no one detected Harry casting underage magic in the Graveyard and Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny and Luna doing the same in a restricted section of the Ministry.

The only reason I can give is that the Trace isn't put on the person or the wand but only works on specifically monitored areas, otherwise the whole Department of Mysteries stunt would have been detected instantly and Unspeakables involved.

Or maybe no one at the Department for Detection of Underage magic is working that late at night because kids obviously go to sleep (...yeah right). Or they don't care about that sort of thing while Hogwarts is in session no matter all the unattending muggleborn that threaten the Statute of Secrecy.


** It could be that those events happened during the school year, so if the trace was activated they may have assumed that the spells were cast as classwork.

*** It can't be detected who cast the spell. Only that there was magic used near an underage magical. When you have death eater casting AK and Crucio and the location is a random graveyard or secret departments in the ministry of magic you would think someone would be sent to investigate.

It seems strange that in both cases such spells weren't detected near Harry and no one accused him of them, especially since there is no way of knowing that it was near him that those spells were cast and since he wasn't in Hogwarts.

**** About the graveyard... Voldemort planned that ritual months in advance, he knew there would be an underage wizard present at his resurrection, so my headcanon concerning this is that Voldemort took measures to assure that the Trace would not report back and spoil his coming home party.

** It might be like how children in wizarding households can use magic and it is assumed to be the parent. They were near the death eaters both times, so maybe it didn't get picked up because of that.

*** If the presence of adults overshadows underage magic and makes it ok it wouldn't have been a problem for Harry to get side-along apparated.

The only thing the presence of Death Eaters would be mean is that there would be a ton of questionable curses added to the spells cast near said underage wizard. Like the AK's and Crucios that the Death Eaters cast but no one detected for some reason. Or were the regulators ok with those spells being cast near underage wizards.

Unless of course some areas are exempt from the list because Hogwarts and the Ministry would spam them with spells as long as a single kid is visiting.

Still doesn't answer how the Graveyard was left undetected unless Voldemort put wards up.

And if it doesn't, then the Ministry would get an alert for No. 4 Privet Drive. A squad of Death Eaters could arrive within five minutes. But by the time a human could notice the Trace going off, Harry would be at Grimmauld Place and safely within the bounds of the Fidelius Charm. At that point, they didn't believe that Apparition could be tracked (or at least, Remus Lupin didn't), but if there were a special interaction between the Trace and Apparition, they could have transported his wand separately on the idea that the Trace might affect the wand rather than the area and gone by way of Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade, which would likely confuse things even further.

But their plans were crafted for drama, not common sense.

**** As far as I know it was okay for Harry to be side-along apparated. They didn't do it in the OOtP to get to the trial to make a better impression, and they didn't do it in DH because Thicknesse make it an imprisonable offence.

Maybe the graveyard was detected, but they either couldn't detect the perpetrator, or they thought it was some lunatic who thought that he was following Voldemort's orders (like Fudge says about Crouch Jr.).

  “You are quite right --- they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by ---”\\
  “Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?”\\
  “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry's face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls.”

** IMHO the Trace isn't really well thought out in Canon and I always appreciate a Fic that comes up with its own rules for it as long as they are consistent. There will always be people who are super upset when something isn't strictly canon, but IMHO it's a good idea to ditch canon when you can come up with something better (Trace, Wand-Lore, romance, incompetent adults).

** The trace only worked when it was plot convenient because... it was plot convenient.

JKR was really not that good about internal consistency - which is fine, as it gives us lots of room to expand. But when we come across stuff like the Department of Mysteries (what kind of R&D department has a /roulette room/ as a defense measure? Or not have personnel staffing it 24/7? It's a government headquarters, not a bloody office.) or the Trace choosing when and where to work (PACK!, anyone?), the answer is because it was convenient and JKR decided not to spend her time trying to pin down minutia.

This is exactly how I think it works, personally. The specific areas would be the houses and neighborhoods of muggleborns and muggle-raised children like Harry.

*** I just thought of something...in Order of the Phoenix, Tonks casts a Scourgify on Hedwig's cage, right? But Harry doesn't get a warning notice, despite that he's likely under extra scrutiny due to previously casting a Patronus that same day.

This would hold with your hypothesis that the trace triggers if a spell happens near a magical child who isn't in the company of an adult witch/wizard. Dobby wouldn't be recognized as an adult witch/wizard, nor would the dementors, but Cedric Diggory (remember he's of age), Peter Pettigrew, and possibly Voldemort, all would count as adults.

*** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  Then other commenters came up with excerpts from DH that basically contradicted with what was said in Book 6.
#+end_quote

No, they're reconcilable, just not in a way that you like.

The Trace is a piece of magic on each wizard under 17-years-old. It detects the magic cast around that person and where it is cast. The Ministry gets a list of which spells have been detected and the location where they have been cast, but they do not get the identity of the caster, nor do they get the identity of which underage wizard the spell was detected off.

When the magic is cast in an area known to contain only one underage wizard (i.e. a Muggleborn), they will enforce the Reasonable Restriction on Underage Sorcery against that underage wizard, assuming the magic to have been cast by that person unless they have knowledge to the contrary. When magic is cast in any other location they cannot enforce the law because they lack sufficient information. They do not issue multiple enforcement notices against a person who is already pending a hearing. They do not issue enforcement notices during term-term, nor before a person has started Hogwarts.

I'm fairly sure this accounts for all canon events and explanations.

***** What element of it do you think is problematic?

The Ministry would be aware that magic was cast in that area. They would have no way to link it to Tom Riddle, since they have no personally identifying information, just what spells were cast in what areas. Any curiosity about why an unknown underage wizard had happened to be in the vicinity - assuming that the two different branches of the Ministry had been in contact with each other about it - would go away when Morfin confesses that he performed all of the magic that the Ministry detected, and his wand's "spell history" backed up his confession.
