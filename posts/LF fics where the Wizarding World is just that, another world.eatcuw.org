I just started getting into PJO fics and really like the idea of the Mist and was wondering if there were any HP fics with similar concepts to keep magic and muggles separate because one of my pet peeves is as soon as the internet becomes widely spread the statue of secrecy is gone thats within a decade of voldemorts defeat

*** Here got this from google hope is explains it- The Mist is a supernatural force controlled by the goddess Hecate that twists a mortal's sight from seeing monsters, gods, Titans, and various other mythical creatures and supernatural occurrences by replacing them with things the mortal mind knows about and can comprehend.

*** I think PJO stands for Percy Jackson and the Olympians, a book series by Rick Riordan where part of the basic premise is 'Greek mythology is real, the monsters are real, the gods are real, and Percy Jackson is the son of Poseidon'.

In the Percy Jackson series, the Mist is a kind of supernatural force (which according to TvTropes, is managed by Hecate) which prevents mere mortals from recognising supernatural happenings, instead interpreting them as mundane things.\\
Monsters look like humans or animals, magic weapons are concealed, and a titan's rampage looks like a freak storm system.

Wizards and witches have their own medieval fantasy world, with entirely separate government and economy, and many live their lives without ever seeing a Muggle.
