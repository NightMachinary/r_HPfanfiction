Hi guys, I posted about my fic last [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j6e6qr/darkest_of_dreams_sirius_blacks_story_between/][week]], and now it's fully completed and out there in the wild. If you would like to check it out, be sure to go to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13713827/1/Darkest-of-Dreams][FFN]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26862826/chapters/65542126][A03]].

Elevator Pitch: After the events of October 31, 1981, Sirius Black must defend his Godson and capture Peter Pettigrew before it's too late.

Cheers!


** btw, you'd probably get significantly more views if you added a character. Most people (to my knowledge) sort by character on FFN, so you're basically just gimping your possible views by not adding one in.

**** You're good, if it still isn't achieving the results you want, you can try taking it down and reuploading it over a period of time. Every time you update a story to a wordcount over one of the search limits you're going to get a new influx of people who search for stories over that wordcount.

As yours is only 16k, I don't expect it would matter that much. It is food for thought though.

***** I could probably expand it in the future, but right now it's definitely complete. Thanks!
