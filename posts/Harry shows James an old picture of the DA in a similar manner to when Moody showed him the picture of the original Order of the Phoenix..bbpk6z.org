** "You need to do something about him, Harry." Neville ran a hand through his hair. "The way James acts...it's like he thinks he's a gift to Hogwarts and that it's my privilege to teach him. He doesn't understand...I wish I knew /why./"

"He's young," Ron suggested weakly. "He's really only known peace. Privilege really, given who his parents are. Can't really blame him for not getting it."

"He's almost seventeen." Harry said curtly. "When we were his age, we were risking our lives to bring down Voldemort and destroy his Horcruxes."

"I was leading the resistance inside Hogwarts...I still dream about some of the things the Carrows did."

"I get nightmares from when we were grabbed by the Snatchers...and Fred."

"I think I have an idea," Harry murmured.

--------------

James Potter, ever the arrogant arse, rolled his eyes. Another lecture from his father. Another lecture on how he wasn't applying himself and how he took too much for granted. Bullocks. He was James Sirius Potter, son of the war heroes Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley. If it weren't for them, then they'd all be under Voldemort's thumb. There wasn't enough ways to say "thank you" for that.

"This is us, Dumbledore's Army...I thought it might be a good idea if you saw what we were before, during the good days."

"So what?" He had met a few members of the DA too many times to count at all those remembrance dinners. And yeah, they fought against Voldemort. And his dad saved the world.

"There's your Uncle Fred. And Uncle George of course. Never saw one without the other then."

James smirked at the twin expressions of glee staring back at him. It was too bad that Fred had died during the War.

"That girl with the long hair is Lavender Brown. She wanted to design dress robes." A pretty girl with shiny brown hair waved. "During the Battle, she was mauled by Fenrir Greyback. Punctured a lung. Bled out before Pomfrey could check on her."

James stiffened.

"That small boy? Colin Creevey. One of your mother's best friends when they were in school. Threw himself at Dolohov after Lupin was killed. Last spell he ever cast was a Shield Charm over your mother.

"And Dennis? The little guy next to him? Shut himself up after the War. Nobody's seen or spoken to him in twenty years. I don't even know if he's alive."

--------------

This is tougher than I thought. I may come back to this.

***** True. That's what made me question my obsession with Weasley Bashing fics, as convoluted as it sounds. One of the stories I'll recommend to anyone I find.

*** Wow, that was exactly the type of story I wanted when I saw this. So short, but so captivating. Would be nice to see a continuation where James goes looking for Dennis. Maybe he finds him through an ad for a photo gallery, because Dennis has followed in his brothers footsteps of being a photographer.

*** For Moody though, I don't think he meant to show it to Harry to be sobering. That was the way Harry took it when he realized so many people he knew had died for this war, and because he was feeling so miserable as it was. Moody seemed to show it to him because it reminded him of the good times, and the friends he fought this war with.

If Harry could show the picture to James or Teddy with the same intention, I think it would be a nice short fic. I'm also not sure how much Harry and the family would tell the kids about the war. The kids might see some familiar faces they've seen at Diagon or parties before, but never knew were in the DA.

** Ok, I totally took this prompt as Harry shows James--- Harry's father--- the picture and assumed time travel would be involved. However reading through the comments, I can totally see how OP probably meant James Sirius---Harry's son.

My mind probably jumped to time travel as I typically prefer those over next-gen fics, but I can totally see it working if the pic that Moody shows Harry in canon was taken recently from when HP time travels. Potentially HP could have his copy from future-Moody on him to help prove validity. Maybe copies of that pic hadn't been handed out yet ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or HP popped in exactly as the picture was taken. Like /snap/ /poof---theres HP/ ‚Äúwho the hell are you‚Äù /everyone draws wands on HP/ etc. And then HP could follow up the ‚Äúold-Order pic‚Äù by showing his DA pic and perhaps an additionally updated Order pic--- where the Marauders get to marvel at old and scruffy looking Sirius & Remus as well as an even more mangled Moody.
