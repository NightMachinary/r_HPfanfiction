Voldemort decided early on in his 'career' as a Dark Lord that he wouldn't use the Killing Curse unless he was in the most dire of circumstances (and maybe not even then).

"I understand the practicality of it," he'd say, "but it's just so...boring. You might as well just use a /gun/."

*** He conjures great vortexes of fire. Transfigures statutes into beasts to maul people. Uses charms to slam people into walls so fast they explode upon impact. Enlarge a colony of rats and watch them wreak havoc on a village.

You know, flashy things. Unique things.

*** He's a supposed Genius, he could easily create ways to kill worthy of a Dark Lord.

Or maybe not even kill. Make someone as immortal as possible, put them inside an unbreakable, transparent box and dump them into the ocean for all eternity.

** I rememberm in a story where Voldemort did not use it himself but made his followers use it. The curse damages the soul and lowered self esteem or something. Made his followers believes they can Never be good people
