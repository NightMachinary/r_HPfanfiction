** I often read that as a standalone story myself.

One thing that's important to point out from the start. People sometimes criticise some of TE7's stories for not having much magic in them. Those criticisms are usually invalid but that epilogue really does have almost zero (visible) magic in it - for a very good reason. I won't spoil it by saying why, but felt I should point it out.

Epilogue 2 goes between the main story and Epilogue 1, and Epilogue 3 occurs during Epilogue 1. Just to keep things confusing.

*** Glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks it's good as a standalone story.

***** What nonsense are you spouting? It's fanfiction! Everyone gets married and lives happily ever after with a bunch of Daaaawww kiddos and puppies. Ron/Hermione Draco/Pansy Astoria/Theodore Neville/Hannah Ginny/Neville Bill/Fleur Fred/George

wait what do you mean that Harry killed Draco and Ginny? That doesn't seem right.....Well oh well. It's not like lying to someone for fifteen years of their life would lead to any negative feelings or repercussions.
