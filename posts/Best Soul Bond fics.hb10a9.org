I'm looking for your guys favourite soul bond fics. Any pairing is fine really. As with most of my posts, longer is preferred and completed is even more so!

Thanks all!


** Linkffn(soul scars) is definitely my favorite, still in progress, pretty infrequent updates.\\
Linkffn(amplitude, frequency and resistance of a soul bond) is pretty good, but abandoned AFAIK.

#+begin_quote
  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore!

*** Yes. I clicked on this thread to recc this fic! Soul Scars is really, really good in an area that's really hard to do in any positive way.

It's also one of the only H/multi stories that felt remotely possible, relationship dynamic-wise (I felt the author considered a lot of the reasons why it's so difficult for a polyamorous relationship to function well). It was a solid read, IMO!

** Obligatory mention of [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]] (on SIYE, so no bot), which is complete up to the end of year two but probably won't go further than that. Harry and Ginny have been custom designed by the universe to be the perfect match, and they share every thought and sensation unless they actively concentrate on something else to distract themselves.

It could easily have become too saccharine, but I think that the author got it right and instead just made it a story of them being completely united and loyal to each other, which is nice to read. And their shared life has its own challenges, especially in second year when one is petrified and the other has to deal with the sudden loss of their companion and half their identity.

** There was a really old one, that wasn't completed but I thought it was one of the original examples of soul bond fics. It's H/HR, started pre-Hogwarts. A little angsty, but not over the top. I'd recommend it, for sure if you're interested in a soul bond fic.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
