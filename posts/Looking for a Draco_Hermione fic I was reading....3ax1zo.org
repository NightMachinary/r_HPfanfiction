My phone broke and I was mid-story.

AU - Directly after the final battle Hermione is transported to a reversed universe where Dumbledore is the bad guy, Tom Riddle is trying to save the world and gain equality, and the rest of the purebloods are slaves. Hermione suddenly wakes up with a headache on the train tp school only to realize that she has taken over the stupid, prejudice, and shallow 'Maya' Granger's body. Harry and Ron are total jerks. Draco is nice and she tries to save him from slavery. Pansy is Maya's slave, to Hermione's surprise. It takes place in Hogwarts, seventh year. I'm trying not to post spoilers...

Its like 200k words, incomplete, and was recently updated (in May, perhaps?).

My description makes it sound like crap but I recommend this to anyone, whether or not you're a Draco/Hermione fan. It is very, very well written and creative, with a lot of plot.

A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM
