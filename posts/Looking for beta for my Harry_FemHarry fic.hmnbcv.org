This request is only to beta my latest chapter of about 5k words (I update very slowly)

I'm not terribly picky about who my beta is, but at the moment, I primarily need someone who I can bounce ideas off of to work on some plot points and chapter arrangement.

My grammar is going to need plenty of work, but I don't really need a beta for that (although it would definitely help).

This is a Harry/Fem!Harry romance fic, so you have to be okay with that.

The fic is Self Reflection by Blandge on FFN

Reply here or PM me if you're interested.

Thanks!


** What do you mean by Harry/Fem!Harry? Harry and his twin or Harry and Harry from another dimension? Just asking coz I've seen this pairing before. I don't have the time for betaing tho.

** Just in case you don't know, there's also a beta search on FFnet (check the top bar!) and a weekly beta bartering thread on the fanfiction subreddit. Good luck in finding one! :)

**** Thanks for the link. Also, every time I see your name, my brain keeps providing me with a mental image of Cam from Modern Family yelling 'Stella!' and it's great. :D
