#+TITLE: LF a fic I read. Main character splits his soul like a horcrux, but instead of placing pieces in objects, he places full copies in seven alchemical bodies. He opens a store selling runic light bulbs, that also act as spying devices. He works with Daphne Greengrass on occlumency.

*Edit:* Found it on spacebattles.com: *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-magical-awakening-hp-si.246476/][A Magical Awakening (HP SI)]]* by Emperor Tippy.

I've tried keyword searches on google but haven't been able to locate this. I'll list all the facts I can remember. Thanks for your help in advance.

--------------

- Main character may +or may not+ be an +OC or+ SI.

- +Main character may have been reselling pencils to retarded purebloods for easy income (may have been a different fic).+

- Main character makes a lot of runic inventions, +including floating light orbs for reading lights that were popular with Ravenclaws.+

- Main character is very good at occlumency.

- In this universe once you reach a certain point at occlumency you detach your soul from your mind, making you immune to all magical contracts and mind altering effects like imperio and veritaserum.

- People who reach this point are called +grand+ sorcerers+?+. Most people who try to reach this point die.

- It is mentioned that Lucius Malfoy became one before his supposed imperio enslavement by Voldemort, making the fact he got away with using that legal defence when he was provably immune an outrage.

- Main character uses his own blood and alchemy to make a type of soul-metal, which he uses for his runic creations.

- Main character splits his soul like a horcrux, placing pieces in soul-metal bodies which become sensory shared perfect copies on himself. As long as one copy is alive he can't die, and he can make new copies. He keeps one copy in a pocket dimension at all times for safety.

- One of his copies runs a runic light bulb store out Diagon Alley, the light sources doubling as spying devices.

- He sends one of his copies to mind rape and or control high level government and spy agency members, to help with his plans and also learn how to make fake identities.

- He interacts a lot with Daphne Greengrass, helping her reach the level of +grand+ sorcerer.

- Daphne is traumatised by an event in her past, when her mother was raped and killed in front of herself and her sister in Knockturn Alley, before her father turned up and killed the attacker.

- Main character offers to teach her how to make multiple horcrux-like bodies like he has.


** I found it. I had been fucking up my search by including "site:fanfiction.net" and "harry potter". It turns out it was on spacebattles.com.

The string that got it for me in the end was ="youngest" -"youngest seeker" "sorcerer" "daphne" -"youngest son"=. I had tried many combinations of "harry potter", "daphne", "sorcerer", "warlock", "magus", "occlumency", "light bulb", "light globe", "fireworks", etc.

Unfortunately the story was dropped four years ago.

Now that I've found it, should I delete this post?

*** Nah, leave this post up. If anyone sees this and the premise catches their eye, or if someone searches for this in the future then they'll find the answer.

**** After four years you are still holding out hope for more? Damn it, I'll watch it too. Let's be dreamers together.

My watch lists are getting ridiculously long now. I wish I had kept a detailed list of what I had been reading when I started with fan fiction. It must be hundreds of fics now. Maybe over a thousand. Mostly HP, Mass Effect, Naruto, Stargate, Firefly, Worm. So much Worm lately. Never read the web serial.

Always looking for new interesting things.
