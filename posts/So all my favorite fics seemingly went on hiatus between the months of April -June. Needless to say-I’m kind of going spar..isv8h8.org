I've really tried to find something else that has clicked but I'm just not having any luck. Idc the trope or the pairing - but what are the best, well written, (preferably Harry centric) fics that anyone knows? I'm happy with fics that don't have a pairing as well. Thank you so much!


** Will I ever stop recommending this fic at every chance I get? Hell no. Let me introduce you to my favorite fanfic of all time, "The Darkness Within." It's long, extremely well written, and it has two sequels and multiple spin offs to keep you occupied for some time.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

** I really love New Blood. It's Hermione-centric (but Harry is present.) Regular updates twice a week! Really well written.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** Well, if you want something regularly updating, the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series is about every two weeks. Sirius escapes from Azkaban five years early and offers Harry another home - but is still in hiding from the law. First book is pre-Hogwarts, following books are one year each, book five/fourth year is in progress.

There hasn't been an update to the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series in a few months, but it's already well over a million words, so might keep you busy for a bit. The summary sounds a bit pedestrian, but it's actually a really original series with rich world building, high stakes and danger, and a complex interesting antagonist.

Edit: Ugh, just specifying the title for Innocent used to work. Will fix.
