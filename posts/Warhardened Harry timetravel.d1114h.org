  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past is a classic, even if it's unfinished. He's got massive survivor's guilt and PTSD after his future self killed Voldemort after everyone died. It's an emotional rollercoaster and I love it.

It was on FanFiction, but then it was taken down for some undefined "copyright" reason by the site.

*** I think it was because the author mentioned their patreon on it, which isn't technically allowed because you're making money off of the fanfiction. It's a shame because for such a long time it was at the top of the favourites, and it had just finally received another update.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
