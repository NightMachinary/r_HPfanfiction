Mr. Ollivander said about Lily Evans' wand:

#+begin_quote
  It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand.
#+end_quote

However, James Potter's apparently had one wand for life:

#+begin_quote
  Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.
#+end_quote

Why did he emphasized it was her /first/ wand? Did she buy more of them? Did she break the first one? How did it happen?

No smut, please (you know, “wand” as the most boring overused innuendo ever).


** *The First Wand*

The girl was small, with dark red hair and green eyes shiny with wonder. Ah, I always enjoy watching the children of Hogwarts purchase their first wands. Such excitement, such joy. Oh...to be young again.

She was with three people, a man and a woman, presumably her parents, and a taller girl with blonde hair. A sister. Not one of mine, though. I do not recognize her, and I remember every wand I've ever sold, and by extension every buyer..

"Alright my dear child," I nodded slightly at my measuring tape. "Which is your wand arm?"

"Um...." Lily blinked once. "I'm right-handed."

The measuring tape flew over to her arm and measured, from wrist to elbow.

"Ah, yes. Nice, nice. And your name, dear?"

The measuring tape stretched across the length of the small girl's fingers, and then her wrist.

"Lily, Mister...Ollivander."

"Ah, that's a very pretty name."

"If you like flowers for dead people."

It was the taller girl, Lily's older sister. Ah...a sibling without magic. Jealousy seemed to seethe from the girl--that could be trouble. I've seen more times than I dare to count through the years. Resentment and envy. So many families torn apart by what should bring them together.

"Young lady, that is quite enough. I happen to quite like such flowers."

"..."

The magic measuring tape was still measuring parts of Lily's anatomy, now focusing on the bridge of her nose.

"Thank you Mister Ollivander...um...heh heh heh...Is the tape supposed to tickle?"

The tape had wrapped around Lily's head, brushing her hair back and making her eyes seem all the larger. She giggled as it stretched, measuring her height from the top of her head to the bottom of her feet, and her smile was as bright as any I've seen.

"Oh yes, child. It does that for everyone. Now then..."

It was time for her to try a wand. Or to be more accurate, for a wand to try her. The wand chooses the wizard...or witch, in this case.

"Perhaps this? Elm and phoenix feather? Sturdy."

She took it in her hand and I knew it wasn't right. I grabbed it back before her fingers finished closing over the grip.

"I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong?"

"No, no, no. You've done nothing wrong. It just wasn't right."

She looked confused at that, an expression not uncommon for my customers, especially my youngest Muggleborns. But then, wand lore is confusing for even the most experienced wizards. I myself doubt that I know a fraction of what there is to know.

"Let's try this then. Pine and unicorn hair. Excellent for offensive magic."

Lily took it in her hand and gave it a light wave. Nothing of note happened.

"Um...I'm not sure this is right either."

"Ah, a tricky customer! What fun! We'll get you right in the end, Lily."

It took me seven tries before I found the one.

"Ah, here we are. Willow and dragon heart-string. Ten-and-a-quarter inches, swishy. This will be nice for Charms work, my dear child. You will do well."

Lily's eyes gleamed with wonder and delight as a trail of golden sparks emerged from her wand.

"Thank you, Mister Ollivader! You really think I can do well in Charms?"

"Of that, I'm certain."

Lily and her parents paid ten gold Galleons for her wand.

It was not the last time I would see Lily Evans.

*The Second Wand*

Eleven months, two weeks, and three days after I met Lily Evans, she came into my shop again. This time, she was accompanied only by her father, a tall man with neatly trimmed blonde hair, and a severe look in his eyes. Though I do not think his anger was directed at Lily.

"Mister Ollivander," Lily whispered. "I'm really, really, really, really sorry...I am so sorry."

"Dear child, please speak up. My ears are not what they used to be."

"I've...broken my wand...accidentally. Tuney...er...um..."

"Did your sister break your wand?"

"Petunia has been punished for her transgressions, sir." Lily's father nodded. "Make no mistake of that."

"It was my fault," Lily mumbled.

Poor child. I'm no Legilimens but I know a thing or two about children who take the blame for their elder siblings.

She set her wand on my countertop. It had been snapped cleanly in two. In anger? Resentment?

"Can it be fixed, Mister Ollivander?"

I'm no stranger to wand restoration, but a break like this is beyond even my own abilities.

"I'm sorry, my dear. But I am afraid replacement is the only option for you."

Lily hung her head as the tape measure sprang to life. She held out her arm lifelessly as it took her measurements.

She was still small. But she didn't laugh as the tape measure moved along her arms and hands. Not even a giggle as it brushed against her nose.

"Alright, dear. Let's take a look."

"Should we do willow again?"

"Yes...perhaps that will be a good idea."

It only took four tries this time, as Lily swished her new wand.

"Here we are, child. Twelve inches even, willow and phoenix feather. It will serve you well, my dear. Take good care of it."

"I will," Lily promised, her green eyes shiny with unshed tears. Oh, the child...

*The Third Wand*

I wouldn't see Lily Evans again for nearly two years. One particularly hot August afternoon, she stepped into my shop, alone--though this time, there was quite a spring in her step. Her hair was longer now, tied back in a loose braid. Her left arm was bandaged considerably, though magical drawings moved along the cast. She dressed her bare feet in sandals that appeared to be made of the muggle substance rubber.

"Good afternoon, Mister Ollivander."

"Good afternoon, Lily. I suspect you are here for another wand?"

"Yes sir."

"Dare I ask what happened?"

"Care of Magical Creatures--I had to save Professor Kettleburn from a Fire Crab...and then a Graphorn...and then an Erumpet...the end of term exam got out of hand."

"All in one day? Merlin's beard, dear."

Lily smiled sheepishly and raised her right hand innocently, her left being immobilized by the bandages.

"Very well, let's take a few measurements. Wand arm out, girl."

Lily gave a small shriek of laughter as the tape measure ran along her arm and then her leg, measuring her from kneecap to hip, and then along the length of her foot.

A delightful sound, though even I hadn't realized how much I missed it.

"Now then, let's try us a wand."

It took much longer to match Lily that day than before. I'm honestly not sure which of us had more delight in the process. In seventy-nine minutes, after going through one hundred eighteen wands, we found one.

"Aspen and dragon-heartstring. One of the finest for martial magic, Lily."

Lily waved the wand and ribbons of light, blue and white erupted from its tip and danced around her arms and legs.

"Wondrous!"

Lily pulled out a coin purse and handed me twelve golden Galleons.

"Thank you, Mister Ollivander! Oh, do you need some help cleaning all these wands up?"

"Oh no, dear--that's not necessary."

With one flick of my wand, all the discarded wands rose back into their boxes and then went back to their proper shelves.

I watched as Lily skipped out of my shop, more ribbons emerging from her wand. I watched her step out of her sandals and dance barefoot down the streets of Diagon Alley.

*The Last Wand*

How quickly time passes. How fast they grow. It seems only yesterday that Lily Evans walked into my shop, a small girl with dark red hair and bright green eyes.

Now, she stood before me a grown woman. Married to James Potter of all people! Old Fortescue was right about them after all--though he is very rarely wrong about such matters.

Lily and James walked into my shop, fervently looking over their shoulders, their fingers intertwined.

"I need a new wand, Mister Ollivander."

"Again, my dear?"

Lily smiled, though it was not nearly as happy as the smiles to which I had grown to know. More resolute, if a smile can have such a quality.

She pulled her wand from her sleeve. It had been crushed and charred significantly. Worse than any other wand she'd damaged over the years.

"It was destroyed in a duel, Mister Ollivander. Against Voldemort. Fiendfyre."

Such courage to speak the name of that Dark wizard. And to think, she and James had defied him! More than once, if the rumors I've heard are to be believed.

I brought out the old tape measure, and it once again sprang to life. Lily held out her arm and it measured, from wrist to elbow.

It wound around her stomach...strange, I hadn't seen it do that in quite some time...It had to be seven or eight years...and that witch had been...well, that was good news.

"Congratulations, my dears. I am sure you will be fine parents."

Lily and James both blushed deeply.

"We just want to keep him...or her...safe, Mister Ollivander."

"Well then...If you want to protect the child, then perhaps we shall try this. Rowan, eleven inches, phoenix feather. Superb for defensive magic."

She took the wand and gave it a wave. At once, sparks of silver and gold and scarlet emerged.

Ah, the first try...had to happen sooner or later, I suppose.

Lily gave me the wand to place back in its box, and then pulled out her coin purse.

"Eleven Galleons right? Or is it twelve?"

I handed the rowan wand to Lily, and then handed her back the Galleons.

"No charge this time, Lily. You'll need every coin for the baby."

"Thank you, Mister Ollivander."

"It will protect you, Lily. Of that I am sure."

I was wrong.

It didn't.

Lily died at the hands of Lord Voldemort about a year and a half after I sold her the last wand.

Thrice, she and James had managed to defy the Dark Lord. And to think, their child, Harry, defeated the man.

I saw great things with Lily, with her many wands. I suspect we will see great things with Harry...great things, indeed.

Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived.

** I think when you have someone as talented as Lily, there comes a point when your everyday wand isn't as good for some spellwork as one specializing in a particular type of magic. One of the little additions from the movies that I liked was when Snape was teaching Occlumency to Harry, he pulled out a toolbelt roll of wands to choose from and selected one to use for the lesson.

***** Actually, there is no canon evidence of McGonagall being much Quidditch fan herself (except of rooting for her own House). That's a pure fanon as well. Sorry, two in one go.

My headcanon (and it is nothing more than that) was Lily was a bit of Hermione-with-temper (oh, OK, so just Hermione), but unquestionably beautiful and more action-friendly.

****** Wow going over all the books again, I realize I way overestimated both lily and mcgonogals characters lol, looked through everything about lily we know and it's kinda comical, we know shes pretty, nice,and talented but that's almost entirely it, now it's starting to feel like we boba fetted her lol. The mcgonogal one sucks to hear though, I went through the books thinking alot of her actions were being affected by deep personal ties to Harry's parents but after looking back through the books, shes kind of a huge dick to nearly everybody throughout the series, especially harry, I feel like I just re learnt how terrible mother Teresa is lol no wonder I like the fanfic versions more nowadays lily actually has a character trait and mcgonogal either has some sort of reason for being terrible or they call her out on that.

******* If you know your classical English literature, then I always thought about prof. McGonagall as a granddaughter of Helen Burns from Jane Eyre (which is of course a problem, because Helen Burns died as a girl, so a greatgrandniece or something). Hugely smart, without a question super accomplished in her field of research, but stickler to what's right or wrong on level of Percy Weasley (sending the Trio away in the Philosopher's Stone is a bit low-point for her, but no bashing, we all make stupid mistakes).

******** Yeah true I shouldnt be so harsh on her but I looked through like everything shes ever said in the books and before 5th year she really didnt do many positive things, like in first year she gave harry a broomstick and let him on the team, but that was because he was a natural talent, and in 4th year she taught them to dance, but she was kind of obligated to. Like I get that her charcater is supposed to be the no nonsense fair play for all type but that sense of professionalism and refusal to level with harry indirectly led to him; almost getting killed in the forbidden forest, murdering a teacher, getting constantly harrassed by snape, sneaking out to hogsmeade while a killer was on the loose, hunting said killer, and then in 4th year a death-eater mad-eye was more supportive of harry than she had ever been previously lol. After 5th year she improved alot but before that I really dont think she deserved the title of being Harry's second mother figure like many (including myself) thought of her as, ya know. Also maybe she was trying to just treat him like any other student, but that's kinda also really bad considering the special circumstances surrounding harry that she was intimately aware of, especially since she knew the dursleys nature better than most of the British wizarding world (save maybe snape and figg)

Edit: whew sorry about that, just had to get that off my chest lol, this is similar to the feeling I had when I was made aware rock lee was overall kinda useless in the naruto series lol
