Hello, today i write with yet another lost Story (maybe one day I'll remember to download them). A while ago I've read a story where Harry was Deaf/Mute when he came to Hogwarts, i think through abuse I'm not sure on that rn. Anyways he gets sorted and everyone is kinda confused what to do with him bc he won‘t speak. Later there was sign language introduced to the curriculum. I already searched all through AO3 and can‘t find it, it‘s driving me insane. Maybe one of you knows it that would be very helpful!

Thank you in advance!!!!


** There's also one where Harry and Hagrid get split up during the Diagon Alley shopping trip (Harry can't understand Hagrid anyway because he doesn't look at him while speaking to him, and the beard makes it hard to read his lips.) He asks Snape for help. Later, Dumbledore tries to bring in an ASL teacher when Harry uses BSL, and tries to "assign" Harry as an assistant. Mentor Snape, obviously, and a Harry/Voldemort pairing.

  What if things didn't go the way Dumbledore had hoped at the Dursley residence?
