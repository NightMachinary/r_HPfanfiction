I'm working on my first fic and it's coming along nicely however my two leads are going to be required to bust someone out of Azkaban as secretively as possible and I'm looking for suggestions on how to make it work.

I'm thinking the solution will be to have them somehow have the prisoner take Draught if Living Death to fake their death then...dig them up secretly later?

Suggestions welcome!


** You can transfigure people into objects and they are fine when transfigured back.

What if you transfigured someone into the object of a dead body that looks exactly like themselves? When the transfiguration end they're back to their normal state.

****** It's mentioned in canon that they can sense lives, but not individuals.

The Crouch deception worked because they left the mother behind. The dementors could sense only a dying person coming in and a dying person leaving (presumably Crouch Jr. was “dying” due to normal treatment to the dementors - unless I'm misremembering).

Whether or not a transfiguration of someone into a “dead version” of themselves would fool a dementor is likely open to interpretation, but I would assume not.

I would assume not mostly because they have a history of seeing through transfigurations. Sirius used his animagus form to lessen their effects on his own self, but the dementors didn't notice anything amiss until he actually escaped, likely because the transfiguration had no effect on their senses of his presence.

******** This isn't canon, though. How the dementors felt/acted around Padfoot isn't something that's ever discussed in the books. The only information we have to go off of is that it helped Sirius retain his sanity, because they had a lesser effect on him. For all we know, other than sensing people, they're completely unaware of their own effect on people.

All we can do is speculate.

********** I read the wiki to confirm my remembering of the books, and you're correct on your original point - my bad!

They could still sense padfoot, of course, but they took his muted emotions due to being in dog form to mean that he was losing his sanity, like everyone else.

#+begin_quote
  Marked as Prisoner ᛈᛉ-390, Sirius was placed in solitary confinement at the mercy of the Azkaban guards, the Dementors. Driven to the brink of madness, he retained his sanity by focusing on his innocence, which he said in the Shrieking Shack was "more an obsession than a happy thought"; it could not be detected by the Dementors, but still allowed him to maintain a sense of self and regain enough strength to transform into his Animagus form in his cell. Since Dementors have difficulty sensing the less complex emotions of animals, he was able to remain relatively unaffected as a dog. It was not at all trouble to them, though, since they thought it meant he was losing his mind like every other convict in their custody, including Bellatrix and some of her fellow Death Eaters.

******* I follow the wiki's policy --- film info /can/ be canon, but only where it does not /contradict/ the book- or WoG-lore or its spirit. And anonically, per Rowling's statements, Transfiguration rearranges the object down to a molecular magic --- it isn't a /sustained/ magical effect like Charms where there is a steady inflow of magic to "keep it up". Thus there's no logical reason it would end with the caster's death.

WoG isn't part of the official works. The movies are. Movies are more canon than something that the author decides to spout off after the fact imo.

That being said, it doesn't matter either way. This is fanfiction. Fanfiction by it's nature is not canon so arguing about what is and is not is senseless.

ah, I haven't read the Wonderbook: Book of Spells, but the wiki says that it rots or tarnishes more easily, not that it disappears. Although I guess that could count as "unraveling". Hmm, as far as rotting faster goes, does that mean that duplicated food would digest faster than regular food? lol.

Have said doppleganger visit Azkaban, go to see the prisoners; when reaching the target one, hand them a newspaper, a Portkey of course.

Once prisoner disappears, remove fabricated corpse with skull-caved-in from a bag that's bigger-on-the-inside and put it in the cell; your target prisoner now appears to have committed suicide by beating their head against the wall, while in reality they've escaped.

Discreetly release the Minister for Magic, having placed a False Memory Charm on him/her so that they 'remember' an innocent version of the Azkaban visit.

** Give someone polyjuice in the form of the prisoner, kill them and place their body in Azkaban, while removing the still living prisoner.

I'm not sure if its canon or just my headcanon but if someone is killed while polyjuiced they keep their polyjuiced form.

A fanfiction I read had something similar, where polyjuice was being abused heavily so there had to be a way to detect polyjuiced bodies. It made for an interesting subplot and if I remember had a twist where one of the dead bodies was someone unexpected/important. I can't remember what fic it was but it was an interesting premise.

*** Yeah thats basically what Crouch did, except the big problem is that only worked because he was an important ministry official (I forget if he was still Head of Magical Law Enforcement at that point, but whatever) so he had permission to visit his son with his wife. Without having someone on the inside they wouldn't be able to get the polyjuice to the prisoner, and that person they polyjuice into has to have permission to leave.

Ooh wait reread op and i guess that would be secretive as long as they have the ability/resources to pull it off.

** Your base plan could work, but the problem is not making the prisoner seem dead. It is "How do your characters even get in?".

If you have to go about this with as small 'ripples' in the security as possible, you have to actually get in legally. You can achieve this through some law or rule you made up for this specific situation. But I would not use such a way.

Your plan also has to fit with what your characters would do. A 'Hit it till it dies!' kind of character doesn't seem like the kind of person that would go in using stealth.

Some things that can fix some of these problems:

Bribery/Blackmail: Find out dirty secrets about a person with permission to allow entrance to Azkaban. This is a standard way of making the entering of guarded buildings possible. This can also make less of a 'paper trail' if the guard is also the person registering the people visiting the prison.

Disguises: Azkaban is a classical '3 walls + bars' kind of prison, with full view of the path in the middle. Meaning, everyone you walk past on your way to the target might remember you. So make yourself stand out less from the norm. Or, make yourself not seem to be who you are. Ordinary makeup is popular in fanon for its 'non-reactions' to magic. You don't have to look good, just different.

Dementors: ...Yeah, Dementors.

*** These points are most effective if what you wanted to avoid was a trail that would lead to you after an investigation. (except Dementors).

Going full stealth is another matter. It's based more on resources.

What can you use that allows for you to enter without the guards noticing?

What can hide you from the Dementors patrolling the floors?

What makes the other prisoners not notice your presence?
