  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

I love this fic: it's so unfrequent to see a magic system that's symbolic, and not the "arithmancy as science and runes as programming" that seems to dominate the fandom (and has absolutely no support from canon...)

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

*** This one's got decent worldbuilding as long as you don't think too hard about it, but the plot is pretty much just canon with a few words changed, and Hermione realizes stuff earlier but doesn't actively do stuff about it.

*** I've tried reading this /so many/ times and I just can't get past the first handful of chapters. Something about it just doesn't do it for me. I don't know if it's the constant references to the "Year of Exploration" or Hermione being a weird slave girl in public or what but it's just dull. Which sucks because I love most of Starfox's other stuff and I keep meaning to give it another go but i'm at like 5 readings now and the bit that I don't like I just get stupidly bored at and give up so it's a bit of a cycle of abuse at this point where it's not as bad as I think it is but i've read it so many times I can remember it all really well so it's not fun.

**** It's got one of my favorite Voldemorts, if you wanna just skip ahead you should be able to figure it out.

The year of exploration seemed insufficiently explored as a concept for how much play it got.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy)

Matriarchal polygamous society and the design of the school reflects this. The aspect I enjoy most is the looming threat, Hogwarts is not a safe place, it is not home.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
