*** Yes, but chemistry labs seem much more difficult than N.E.W.T. level Potions. For example, this is the recipe to the Polyjuice Potion, which is extremely complex and difficult magic that most adult wizards can't brew:

Part 1, step one:

1. Add 3 measures of fluxweed to the cauldron (must have been picked on a full moon).
2. Add 2 bundles of knotgrass to the cauldron.
3. Stir 4 times, clockwise.
4. Wave your wand then let potion brew for 80 minutes (for a Pewter Cauldron. A Brass Cauldron will only require 68, and a copper one only 60.

Part 1, step two:

1. Add 4 leeches to the cauldron.
2. Add 2 scoops of lacewing flies to the mortar, crush to a fine paste, then add 2 measures of the crushed lacewings to the cauldron.
3. Heat for 30 seconds on a low heat.
4. Wave your wand to complete this stage of the potion.

Part 2, step one:

1. Add 3 measures of boomslang skin to the cauldron.
2. Add 1 measure of bicorn horn to the mortar, crush to a fine powder, then add one measure of the crushed horn to the cauldron.
3. Heat for 20 seconds at a high temperature.
4. Wave your wand then let potion brew for 24 hours (for a Pewter Cauldron. A Brass Cauldron will only require 1224 minutes, and a copper one only 18 hours).

Part 2, step two:

1. Add 1 additional scoop of lacewings to the cauldron.
2. Stir 3 times, counter-clockwise.
3. Split potion into multiple doses, if desired, then add the pieces of the person you wish to become.
4. Wave your wand to complete the potion.

This honestly seems easier than the chemistry labs I did in middle schools tbh. It just seems very time consuming, not difficult.

***** Maybe you are right, since her chemistry teacher, who Snape was based off of, said this about her:

*‚ÄúI guess I was rather like the Professor Snape character in the books -- demanding, wouldn't suffer fools gladly, exacting,‚Äù he remembered. ‚ÄúI don't know if she was actually scared of me.

**** Where did you find this recipe? I ask because a) they needed a month to brew it in Chamber of Secrets and this recipe implies you can do it in a little over 24 hours, and b) there's no mention in any of the books about waving anyone's wand to finish the potion after adding someone's hair to it.

***** It's from the wiki. I'm pretty sure it's stated that the lacewing flies needed to stew for 21 days, so that probably made it longer to brew. This recipe also doesn't mention timing so we don't now how much time there needs to be in between the separate steps.

Does grinding have a different effect to crushing? What happens when you wave your wand? Are there any pre-steps that the recipe is assuming (such as a certain quantity of water)

** If you have Netflix, go watch a few episodes of /Nailed It!/ You will be amazed by how bad some people are at following recipes, even when $10,000 is on the line.

Judging by how the Harry and his classmates often struggle to make perfect potions even when following directions, it is clearly a very precise and technical process, so even if it was just following instructions, lots of practice might be necessary to follow those instructions adequately.

We also see that some amount of ingredient preparation is included in the class, which adds more precise and technical work.

And while I don't think we ever see it, there definitely /should/ be a large amount of theory involved in the class.

*** Definitely agree with theory. I flunked chemistry in high school because I couldn't remember what reactions were produced when mixing two chemicals. Imagine the whole 1001 magical fungi/plants books that exist in universe and what would happen when you had to mix in 8 seperate ingredients under a cauldron at different temperature üò±

*** Huh, I guess I overestimated how good people are at following recipes. I've always been good at following them exactly, so I sort of assumed everyone else was too.

Regarding the theory, it seems to only be taught through homework assignments. Classes are almost all practical. I wonder why it's necessary though, since someone can learn how to brew something without knowing the theory, unlike with most spells.

**** How are you supposed to innovate with potions if you don't even know what does what? In chemistry if you don't know about certain reactions and just randomly put chemicals together you'll just end up killing yourself with poison gas or blow something up. If someone wants to create or alter an existing potion they need to understand what ingredients do what and how timing and heat effect certain ingredients and how ingredients might react with each other, etc etc. if Neville had known that porcupine quills react strongly to heat, even if he had trouble following instructions he wouldn't have put the porcupine quills in his cauldron when it was on the fire when making the cure for boils in his first potions class. With cooking you can figure out what goes well together and how certain ingredients react to different cooking methods by trial and error. For potions if you just chuck in ingredients to see what happens you'll end up killing or permanently maiming someone, it's the same as chemistry. If theory wasn't taught then they'd just be learning recipes, which would actually just make potions class completely obsolete because they could just get a recipe book and use that instead of being taught in class. The point of the class is the theory.

** I think of potions as your regular chemistry lab. There are volatile ingredients. Timing has to be perfect, measurement has to be perfect. And there is the added bonus of magic. So you've got clockwise vs counterclockwise motions, spells in addition to the mixing, ultraspecific timing and cutting methods among the usual chemistry methods.

As someone who almost failed her chemistry lab, potions sound like a nightmare.

*** Many advanced potions, such as Felix Felicis, which is said to be extremely complex and difficult, have pretty simple recipes though. It seems almost juvenile compared to chemistry labs. This is literally the Felix Felicis' recipe:

1. Add Ashwinder egg to a cauldron, then add horseradish and heat.
2. Juice a squill bulb, add to the cauldron and stir vigorously.
3. Chop up anemone-like growth on the back of Murtlap, add to mixture and heat.
4. Add a dash of tincture of thyme and stir slowly.
5. Grind up Occamy eggshell and add to mixture.
6. Stir slowly then heat the cauldron.
7. Add a sprinkle of powdered common rue.
8. Stir vigorously then heat the cauldron one last time.
9. Wave wand over potion in a figure of eight and say incantation ‚ÄòFelixempra!'

It's honestly funny to me how easy this supposedly hard potion is to brew. Also, with chemistry labs, people need to know how and why it works, but with potions, someone can brew it without any knowledge of why it works. It seems a bit unrealistic to me.

**** It's not as if that is a proper recipe. It takes six months to brew, but that recipe doesn't have stuff like timing. My best guess is that the recipe you pulled is incomplete. And besides that Potions isn't real. That recipe was likely created because it looks nice.

It might be better that you don't use specific recipes as benchmark for how difficult Potions as a subject might be. The recipes are arbitrary, and likely not reflective of what they would look like /in-world./ Potion recipes should be examined with the fact that they were invented by a non-magical person in mind.

And considering that people keep /inventing/ potions, it is likely that Potions does indeed have a theories aspect. We definitely see Slughorn teach theory in his class. Snape correcting the potions in his textbook also means that there is theory behind the ingredients and what not. They are also set Potions essays that they have to look up ingredients, techniques and the like. While it isn't as prominent in the books, theory is definitely part of potions class (or what they should be had Snape been more competent.)

***** Yeah, that "recipe" seems horribly incomplete by RL standards. There's barely any quantities specified except in the vaguest of terms, no mention of precise temperatures anywhere, nothing to suggest how much time should elapse between any of the steps, and also no mention of the liquid base that I'd /assume/ should be step 0 because otherwise you're just throwing an ashwinder egg and horseradish into a bare cauldron.

***** I guess you're right about your first point, but your second point is contradicted by canon. Although theory is part of the class, it's not required for brewing. In CoS, Hermione doesn't know the theory behind N.E.W.T. level potions, but can still brew the Polyjuice Potion. In HBP, Harry can't find an antidote to his potion because he didn't study any of the theory in Potions, but he still brewed perfect potions by following the Prince's alterations. Theory only really seems necessary for recognizing where you're messing up (and potentially even how to fix it), finding antidotes, and altering/inventing potions.

You just pointed out why theory is necessary. It's necessary for everything important in potions. Hermione manages to save Neville when he messes up because /she understands the theory/. This exactly why she fought with Harry over the stupid book. She thought he was cheating because /he got better grades without doing any of the effort./ Just because Harry slacks and cheats doesn't mean theory suddenly stopped mattering.

I also did my chemistry lab without understanding any of the theory either. I still got a passing mark. Does that mean the theories behind the chemicals stopped being important?

******* Most people need to know how it works to do those chemistry labs though. Potions just seems to be following the recipe. If a student just follows the recipes exactly, they will get great grades. It's only if someone messes up when theory really matters. I doubt most students would need or want to alter/invent potions. I understand why theory is important and taught, but I just think that brewing a potion would be really easy since it's just following instructions.

******** I repeat - so is chemistry. Maybe you're naturally good at chemistry, but it's reasonable for people to find it difficult. And considering that most of their medicine is homebrewed to an extent, their Potions is much more practical that chemistry is for us. They would definitely need to know how how fix stu or be safe in case things go wrong.

I don't think anything can convince you that Potions is difficult or relevant at this point though. You've buried your head in the sand.

**** You seem to be making the implicit assumption that precision doesn't matter in any of these steps. Exactly how much of each ingredient is needed? What temperature is called for? Is it the same temperature each time it says to heat it? How much time should elapse between each step? How fast or slow should you stir? What direction should the figure eight go in for the wand movement? Is there some sort of liquid base we're starting with (and if so, what and how much of it?) or are we throwing horseradish and an egg into a bare cauldron? And, perhaps most importantly, /what happens if you get any of the above wrong?/

I mean, IRL bakers bemoan recipes that call for cups instead of grams of flour because /it matters/, and they don't make anything more volatile than pastry. Some people have a hard time making pie dough because their body heat melts the butter too quickly. I have a hard time believing potions, of all things, would be less reactive and troublesome.

***** Even if it needs the utmost precision, it still seems very simple compared to chemistry labs, especially for such a complex potion. Even for potions we know that are specific, they still seem too easy. This is the Forgetfulness Potion:

Part 1:

1. Add 2 drops of Lethe River Water to your cauldron
2. Gently heat for 20 seconds
3. Add 2 Valerian sprigs to your cauldron
4. Stir 3 times, clockwise
5. Wave your wand
6. Leave to brew and return in 45-60 minutes

Part 2:

1. Add 2 measures of Standard Ingredient to the mortar
2. Add 4 mistletoe berries to the mortar
3. Crush into a medium-fine powder using the pestle
4. Add 2 pinches of the crushed mixture to your cauldron
5. Stir 5 times, anti-clockwise
6. Wave your wand to complete the potion
