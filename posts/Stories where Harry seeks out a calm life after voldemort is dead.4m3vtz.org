In many fics Harry becomes an auror, adventurer, unspeakable or something of similar caliber. He almost never says 'nope, I had my share of the action, time to become a janitor somewhere and clean floors all day', or 'I think giving guides to people in a museum would be nice and quiet'.

Basically, I want a story where Harry gets to enjoy his 'retirement', and the biggest action he has to deal with is maybe a bit of interpersonal dynamics with coworkers.

Suggestions?


** *The Sea King*, linkffn(7502511), a very cute one shot in which Harry retired from the wizarding world and became a muggle fishing boat captain.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

** One of my guilty pleasure fics has harry playing quidditch and living it up celebrity style with all the gushy drama between him and Ginny. Not compete though and fair warning it is pretty romcom

  A story of Harry and Ginny, their lives, friendships, realtionships and everything in between. Life doesn't always take the road they expect or want but they soon learn that no matter how hard they try to stop it, Life Happens Post OotP thru Post Hogwarts
