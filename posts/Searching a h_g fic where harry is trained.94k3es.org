Hi,

I'm searching a H/G fic where harry is trained (pretty sure in a time dimension).\\
I remember that he meet two guys in privet drive (maybe bro, i'm not sure) who are already trained.\\
He also have a phoenix in this story.

If anyone have an idea i'm glad !


** Harry Potter and the Dance of the Warrior, perhaps? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1921201/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dance-of-the-Warrior]]

*** The two guys are definitely human at least at this moment of the story. Don't remember if the train is made by gobelin but there was a room like that.
