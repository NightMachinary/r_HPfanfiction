This series was the first DE Harry that I've enjoyed and was really impressive with the gritty and grim tone, though it is a REALLY dark fic to read, definitely not something that can be read while eating (IMO). Its basically Harry's descent from an abused(all 3 types) orphan to being second worse only to Voldemort himself. There's a clear and defined slope, with several mental conflicts (specially regarding Sirius) that Harry has to overcome, and while he's the MC, he's utterly evil, sadistic and crazy, almost as crazy as the worst Bellatrix you've ever read.

The first of the series is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) and its a 6-part series with an one-shot about Bellatrix, at least so far.

**** Just finished binge reading the whole series, wow!

Definitely the darkest Harry I've seen, and the most realistic, and most insane.

Great story, very original, and I loved how they didn't really roll over all opposition, but still showed superiority. A bit heavy on the torture porn in the second half of the series, but it fits, so I can't really complain.

Just wow. It's a REAL dark Harry, not just an angsty Harry that all the other "dark" Harry's show. Just wow.

If anyone ever asks for a dark Harry series, this is definitely the highest benchmark now. I've read quite a few fanfiction, but this is the best, darkest Harry by far.
