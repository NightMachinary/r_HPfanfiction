Hello, first I would like to state that I am unsure how to get the little request box to appear beside my post so I apologize for that. Second is my request. I am looking for a fanfiction in which Harry, during his Hogwarts School Years, is extremely good in combat. A great example would be This Lie I've Lived Harry. Another such example would be most Harry in Azkaban fics. I would love for the fics to be 100k+ but that is not a deal breaker, as long as they are longer than 60k. The only other deal breaker is that they must either be complete, or near completion and NOT ABANDONED. This does include series in which portions are complete, but is abandoned. IE- They Shook Hands series. (abandoned has not been updated in over a year) I don't really like the thought of getting into a series and finding out that it will never have a proper conclusion. Thank you for the help!
