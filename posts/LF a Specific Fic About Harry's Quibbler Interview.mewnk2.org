:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi there! I'm looking for a specific fic/oneshot: it revolved around the article written by Rita Skeeter -- the article from book 5, where Harry gives his interview about Voldemort's return, is included in the fic. The piece was well written, from what I can remember, and was considerably long. I think it was on Livejournal, but I'm honestly not sure. If anyone remembers any such fic, please do let me know!! Thanks :)


** Could it be this one of mine? The article is at the end. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19420237]]
