:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've read a lot of fics that have Harry traveling or transferring his memories into the past, but they only ever go as far as his first year. I do distinctly remember one fan fiction I read where Harry traveled farther back, specifically his one year old self. Unfortunately I don't remember much else because it's been a while.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change by T. E. Tanglebrooke) also is somewhat like this even if it isn't the one you are talking about. Fair warning though, it's abandoned.
