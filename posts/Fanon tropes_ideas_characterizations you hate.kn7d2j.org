Is there anyone who just HATES a trope or idea or characterization that was created in fanon?

For me, it's having a separate common room for the Head Boy/Girl. I just despise them. It's great at putting together two characters who hate each other in a domestic setting. But it makes no sense!!!

Why would Hogwarts have a separate dorms for the Head Girl and Boy? What's wrong with keeping them in their original dorms? The Founders went as far as making it impossible for boys to climb the girls staircase, but they break that rule to let the Heads live across from each other?

I get it's probably to give them perks because they have a higher status but how is it helping their jobs to be away from all the students they represent?

And some fan fictions make them share a bathroom! If they were able to get luxurious quarters away from other students, as a massive perk to being Heads, surely they can have their own bathrooms?! And then some even have a kitchenette??? Why would they be cooking? The house elves make food for all the students! Why do they need to cook on top of having the most work to do in the entire school?

It's just my biggest pet peeve. I've read some good fics that use this trope but logically it makes no sense to me why Hogwarts would need this.

Please share yours if you have any! I'm curious to know if other people have pet peeve tropes. I'm also pretty positive there's another thing but I can't remember it right now.


** Been reading a lot of Marauder era fics lately.

- James is a pushy insistent creep that keeps asking Lily out.

- Pettigrew being treated like shit. Dude was trusted over Lupin to be the Potter's secret keeper.

- Lily is a mirror of Hermione/Ginny. Some fics even go so far as to describe Lily having bushy hair.

- Lily has or had any romantic or sexual attraction towards Snape.

- Every Order member is somehow in the same year as the Marauders.

- Lily bashing for not saving Snape from falling in with the Death Eaters. If anything, I think canon Lily is a bit of a doormat for hanging around Snape even though she knows he calls other muggleborns "mudblood".

- James and Sirius being dumb jocks who only get anything done because of Lupin.

- Portraying Snape as a better person than the Marauders.

*** I honestly don't mind James being depicted as overly pushy, because he was by 2020 standards (I think people forget how drastically things have changed in terms of behavior even over the past ten years and was was considered acceptable). My annoyance is when James is portrayed that way but Severus's behavior is "normalized."

Agree on Lily. She was basically the equivalent of a minority being bffs and ignoring a guy using slurs because they weren't directed at her. Maybe as a WOC I relate too much to the allegorical similarities, but I can't imagine being friends with someone who used racial slurs. There was a good fan fic from ages ago, wish I recall the name, where a muggleborn character calls her out for being bffs with a guy who uses the word mudblood and who was pals with people who use the word mudblood.

Same with Peter. I don't get the "Peter was treated like crap" bit. I think it's possible canon Sirius overlooked him based on what little we've seen, but James and Lily obviously trusted him a lot as did Remus.

*** I agree with all your points, well said.

We only have so little canon to go off to write Lily and James' personality, so I really enjoy fics that branch out and make the characters their own and unique, while still fitting into what we get from the 7 books about them.

Also I feel like thats why James (and Sirius) get a bad rap, we have a lot of what Snape thought about James and Sirius and the memories of them bullying Snape, so I suppose it's easier to paint James in a bad light who is pushy with Lily and just a dumb mean jock. But I dont believe he is, because gotta keep in mind that Snape also "gave as good as he got" so it wasn't one sided bullying, plus Snape was a horrible racist so it stands to reason why James would keep up the rivalry and insult him. And then we know he grew out of it, got his head on straight and became a much better person. So I like fics where it has that growth in his character

also yes Peter was a trusted member of the group, hate when fics dont treat him as such. I still have yet to find the fic that characterizes Peter perfectly, though I've seen some alright ones

Which ties into James' refusal to date and inability to like, or even feel attracted, to anyone besides Lily. I get he had a long standing crush, but I'll be damned if I believe it started just as soon as his balls dropped and his head never turned to look at anyone else.

*** Definitely agree with you on Twinspeak, squicky age gap romances (always makes me suspect the author is working out some issues), and Hermione suddenly becoming gorgeous. She's canonically not beautiful, because she's truly not bothered about it. Emma Watson is partially to blame for this one.

In fairness though, in canon she is described as being pretty (and even characters who don't like her think so) during the Yule Ball, so it seems that she can make the effort to look "beautiful" but has more important things to do most of the time.

***** The whole thing squicks me out, but I think what makes Snape particularly bad is he's in a position of authority over the students so the age gap is particularly nasty and a crime IRL. I get it's a "fetish" for some people, which whatever, but unless the student is in 7th year..and even then it's squicky...it makes me seriously side eye the writer. Lucius, too, hates muggleborns so pairing him with a muggleborn is bizarre.

** Snape magically being a good guy just because like my dude was involved with the wizard equivalent of the NaziKKK and not even the love of his life being their hated race made him quit.

Writing Draco/Ron (it's always these two) as the son of Satan revived who is totally evil and rapes and murders people for fun and or he's a totally idiot who fails at everything, can't tie his shoe and just overall pathetic.

All the Weasleys being bad except for the twins, maybe it's cause I don't like them the same way everyone else does but it always bothers me that the twins are somehow different like sure bud.

Daphne I don't get the hype, she's prob just as bad as everyone else in Slytherin but for some reason people love writing as a good Slytherin like no fam she probably called people mudbloods the same way Parkinson's and Malfoy did.

So she can basically be however the author views her a clean slate 'canon' character that can be used as a good Slytherin, which people want since we dont have any peers of Harry in canon that hes friendly with in Slytherin (but he had one from other houses, Cedric in Hufflepuff, Luna Ravenclaw)

also she might not be as bad as the other Slytherins, because if she was then Harry would have been more likely to notice that in canon and point her out.

**** I see that you've been downvoted already. If you care, could you give me a sgort description what can I expect from this story? I know this title, which probably means that I didn't like the story when I checked it. Also, I'm rather reluctant giving this story a go when it has over milion words, and it's in what looks like 4th year.

***** It's possible that you didn't like it because it appears to just follow the tropes without any sort of subversion or anything at first. As the story goes on, this changes though. Don't want to say more, for fear of spoiling.

As for the million words by fourth year part, yeah it's long, but I wouldn't call it slow paced.

I love this story tbh, but I dont think that people can appreciate it if they dont know a lot of other fanfics, or rather not as much. It beautifully subverts tropes in really creative ways and the actual eponymous title, prince of slytherin, is beautifully done in a very much slytherin way.

***** In /HP& The Prince of Slytherin/, the justification for splitting the twins up is that they thought Harry was a squib. So 1) they thought his twin had drained Harry's magic to defeat the killing curse and were worried that the twin might accidentally drain his life as well, 2) they were afraid Death Eaters would attack and Harry would be a defenseless, easily slaughtered squib, 3) Lily thought Harry would be happier living a "normal" life than to grow up as she and Petunia had done, one sibling having magic and the other resenting them for it.

The big spoiler is why Petunia didn't tell them Harry wasn't a squib, and why did the Dursleys abuse him when they'd been happy to adopt him?

** Voldemort/Harry or Tom Riddle/Harry pairing are so weird to me. Like the only, only way I can see the latter is if some sort of time travel was involved and he never killed harry's parents in the first place, but even then it's a stretch.

Evil/crazy/rapey Ron. I get some people don't like him, fine, but people make him cartoonishly evil.

Lily/James being abusive and awful. I mean, these are two people who sacrificed their life for their kid. I understand writing them in a critical way even, but when people have them acting all Dursley-ish it's insane. Sometimes I think people work out their real life issues with the "popular" kids on fictional "popular" kids.

If a fic takes the time to establish a world in which a ridiculous Head-People apartment-duplex thing is logical and backed-up, then I'll buy in to it. If it doesn't, then I probably won't.

**** It's the suddenly and without warning or support that throws me off, not the Christianity. Heart and Soul by Sillimaure is a perfect example. Without warning, the story suddenly has Fleur's family all being secret Christians. There's no particular reason to have it in the story, there's no particular reason not to, but it just happens out of nowhere and that's what I dislike.

I honestly couldn't care less if someone wanted to write a story that's basically Christian Apologetics, or one where Harry was a full-on Witch-burning Stereotype Puritan - so long as it was established and plotted and fit the internal logic, I'd be fine with it. But if he just suddenly turns around in the middle of DADA after twenty chapters and starts talking about how all Magicals are sinners before the Lord and must burn in the fires of Hell or whatever, that's the thing that throws me off a story.

** ° I couldn't give less of a shit about Slytherins if I tried.

°Ginny being a slut because she dated two boys in three years

°Harry (and sometimes Gary Stu!Neville) being the only datable guy in the castle seemingly.

° The general attitude that the richer you are, the better of a person you are.

° Convoluted reasons for Harry to somehow meet Hermione before Hogwarts.

° Friendly goblins

° Daphne (she would comment 'All Lives Matter' under a post of a BLM protest, let's be real here)

° Every Ravenclaw bullying Luna, always led by Cho and Marietta

° 'It's not bashing, it's how they are in canon !'

° Neville replacing Ron and basically being the same person with flaws removed.

° Comically over the top Dursley abuse. Like the ones where they eat Hedwig for Christmas dinner.

° Slytherins getting praised by the narrative for nothing

° Magical cores.

° Ron being a walking stomach whose every word is hating on Harry for being famous/rich and also being misogynist

° Using characters as your mouthpieces

° Luna being a flawless goddess

° Greg, Vince and Millie

° "ZOMG Ginny looks just like your mom !"

° Dumbledore/Weasleys/whoever the author doesn't like getting enslaved for life in Gringotts life as punishment for being so EEEEVVVILLLEEEEE. Usually ends with a dragon shitting on them.

° First Year study club.

° Harry having an all-caps temper tantrum every other chapter, where he complains about how shit his life is, and then proceeds to insult everyone in the room, and then leaves without any repercussions.

° Twinspeak

°Wizengamot factions that literally have "light" or "dark" in their names

I agree with the Slytherin thing! I have nothing against Slytherins, but the ones that we read about were awful people. I've seen Dramione fics where just because Draco is suddenly nice to Hermione then Pansy, Daphne and Millicent suddenly become her best friends! Draco liking Hermione is already a lot to work on but to have the girls who hated her guts suddenly see her as their best friend, and who Hermione ditches all her friends for to hang out with all the time? A reach.

100% agree with the Ginny being a slut thing, it's really weird. Just because she had more boyfriends doesn't mean dating is all she cares about. Similarly, I hate it when they make Hermione seem like the biggest prude because she likes books, I mean this girl dated the hottest guy at their school in fourth year I think she got over being shy. And that she has no sense of humour or hates jokes just because she's bossy about schoolwork.

** I have another one!

Every character using "oh, Merlin!" as an exclamation.

I assume it's a substitute for a real person saying "oh, God" or "Jesus Christ", but it just comes off as so cringey to me.

There's no reason why magical characters wouldn't say God. Christianity is a thing in the magical world. They celebrate Christmas and Easter.

Draco Malfoy, the most bigoted bigot who ever bigoted, even says "God" in canon.

Canon occasionally has "Merlin's beard!" as an exclamation or mild profanity, but only from older characters, never Merlin on its own and especially never "oh, Merlin and Morgana!"

I have no idea why this has become so widespread.
