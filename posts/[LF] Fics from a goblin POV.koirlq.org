Don't think I have ever seen a fic where we see things from a Goblins perspective.. Has anyone done that?


** The one story that is the closest as there is a lot of interaction with the goblins is a story readers either love or love to hate. And that is Harry Crow by RobSt

** Not exactly what you're looking for - it's from Snape's POV, but many, many chapters are written about his apprenticeship with goblins, their everyday life, customs, government, etc.\\
