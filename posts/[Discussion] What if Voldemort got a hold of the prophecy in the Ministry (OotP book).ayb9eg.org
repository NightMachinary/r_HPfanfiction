So, I'm writing a story and have some issues with OotP. It feels like the more I read, the more the book becomes unnecessary, at least parts of it. Dumbledore has a strong suspicion that Voldemort created Horcruxes, Arthurs attack would probably make him believe that Harry is a horcrux, I'm not sure if that is when he realises it or not. The whole idea of hindering Voldemort from hearing the prophecy appears as an attempt to distract him and perhaps force him to make an appearance and then be outed as resurrected. If they just ignored Voldemort and let him take the prophecy. How would Voldemort interpret the prophecy had he gotten it in the ministry?


** Considering how he's obsessed with immortality and power to the point of stupidity, Voldemort would put a hold on his domination plans and just go blast Harry into a fine paste, since the prophecy saying "Neither can live while the other survives" would TERRIFY Voldy.

** I'm not sure about his interpretation of the full prophecy. I think the full prophecy is only interesting before Voldemort acts on it (Halloween 81) and after that it's already set in motion.

The power is more like you say in withholding what could be in the prophecy than what is actually in it.

** Personally I think he'd want to capture Harry and ensure he stays alive. After all Harry is supposed to be the ONLY ONE who can kill him so he has extra insurance that he won't die.

** "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...."

'And either must die at the hand of the other' Is the key bit for me. It really comes down to arrogance vs practicality, how insane do you think he is, and how much do you think he thinks you can meddle with a prophecy.

In my opinion little would change, it would only confirm what he already suspected. Voldemort already thinks he knows the power is love. He thinks he's beaten it already when he took Harry's blood. Voldemort always wanted to kill Harry himself and Harry is the only person other than Dumbledore who has faced him and survived that we know of. Now someone might, and i have seen it in fics, take the idea that since Harry is the only one who can kill him that he's immortal so long as he doesn't fight Harry. Either find a way to make peace with Harry or just have him stunned and locked away for all of eternity. I don't think that fits with the Voldemort we know. I don't think it would even cross his mind that he could be the loser if they faced again. He believes he knows the power and all it will take now is for Voldemort to kill him by his own hand.
