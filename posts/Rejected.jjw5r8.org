I want any fanfics in which harry gets rejected by a girl he asked to the ball and after something happens she gets jealous of harry


** Sounds like you might have to write it yourself, sorry. Sounds intriguing though. And jealous of Harry how? As in jealous of who he takes instead? Or jealous in that they want to be with the person he takes?

** That kind of happens in Chapter 6 (Episode V) of this fic:

Harry definitely gets turned down, and there ends up being some jealousy on Fleur's part. The story itself isn't too bad, although I think Fleur here is pretty toxic.
