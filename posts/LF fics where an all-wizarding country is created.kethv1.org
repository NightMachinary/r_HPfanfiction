Maybe they take over a piece of land or create an island, but I want a fic where an all-wizarding country exists. Sort of like Hogsmeade except it's a whole country.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: After the SoS collapsed, the British Ministry of Magic evicted Muggles from Scotland and carved out their own territory there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]]: They colonized their own planets!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]]: Harry made a deal with Voldemort. He and his followers founded a new magical nation on some Pacific islands, while Voldemort got to build his Pureblood 'utopia' in Britain.

** One that's currently and actively updating is A Place Apart by Metalduck. It's not half bad.

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

** One fic immediately came to mind, but it's been awhile since I read it, so I'm not sure if it exactly ticks all your boxes. However, I noticed no one else has rec'd you anything, so I thought you might like to check it out and see if it's something you might like. It's called The Dark Corners of the Earth, and it has sort of Lovecraftian horror vibe. Snape and Bellatrix LeStrange are possessed by old, enormously strong spirits/powers with an ancient grudge. They end up waging a world war between them to see who ultimately wins.

  The war was supposed to end with the fall of Voldemort. Instead, it not only kept going but steadily escalated into a full-scale wizarding world war as two people who were thought to be dead pit their armies against each other. Now Hermione is desperately trying to find a way to save the wizarding world from itself... and from that which lies among the dark corners of the Earth.
