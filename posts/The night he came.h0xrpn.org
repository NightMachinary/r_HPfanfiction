Voldemort didn't find Harry. He killed Potters, but the child was nowhere to be found. Unknown to him little

Harry witness it hidden under family cloak of invisibility and in a silenced crib.

The strange thing was, that only Voldemorts wand and cloak was found on a doorstep of Potter cotage.

Sirius was not sentenced because they had to question him about the missing Potter hier, that was found by his dirrections. He was starved little thing, but alive.

So that's how he became the-boy-who-was-not-found.

P.s. In essence Harry Potter fic with a different epithet, and how his legends change would affect him.


** Interesting prompt. Any ideas of why Voldemort abandoned his wand? Was he double crossed by Peter upon leaving the Potters, caught off guard by cowardly Wormtail who he would never expect to betray him, having his body destroyed?

Did he decide to abandon his identity and conquest of Britain after realizing he wouldn't be able to destroy "the one with the power to defeat him" as a baby and didn't want to risk his life hunting down the child who he would presume to be being trained to kill him?

*** Well I always was of Idea that it was Lily that defeated Voldemort, he simply had a last hurra!, by cursing Harry.

This time she used Blood wards powered by her sacrifice and some-such to discorporate already barely human Voldemort. He did Horocruz ritual before coming for Potters so his claim to his body was tennable at best. In essence Lily got lucky.

He's not as insane in this case, because this time his discorporation was less traumatic. No baclash and some-such.
