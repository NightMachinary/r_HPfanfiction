Hey! I'm writing a FanFiction with original characters set 20 years after the epilogue of Harry's kids and would like suggestions for adventures for my students!

The four main guys are a Harry type character, leader qualities but not as considerate, dorky yet charming young man who's very into education, a jock who's lost on what he wants with his life and the new girl who doesn't quite have many friends due to trust issues but has the good looks and nice personality. They are in Year 4 but I don't want any Triwizard stuff.

These ideas can be overarching stories for the whole book or even little adventures that involve with things like a portkey or a two way mirror or a new plant being developed or something new in hogsmeade. Anything is welcome but the more original the better! Please leave any suggestions below!

Oh and there is a villain but he's more on the level of bellatrix or quirrel. He's not the big bad he's just a right hand man/woman. So anything for them too on how they infiltrate Hogwarts or their plans!


** For a student - muggle born named Beatrice 'bea' collins ( not related to any main or side character). She gets in to Hufflepuff because she has a big family and grew up learning that family helps others. She would be very surprised to get the letter because the only accident magic is small and easy to explain. I think her overall goal would to try and see if magic from muggles books would work in reality. She would always be ready to help her friends ( and if Teddy lupin is in the story she has a small crush). She and her friends would start a club for research and crafting.
