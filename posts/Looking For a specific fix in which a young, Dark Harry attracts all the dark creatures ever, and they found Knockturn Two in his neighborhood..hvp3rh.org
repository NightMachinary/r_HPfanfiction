  What if the Horcrux hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned? Rather than influencing Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. An aura already rather grey, despite his innocent nature. Grey with the darkness of his parents traumatic deaths, grey with his status as the last living primary heir of the Peverells, thusly a child of Death -- and that made him something warm, endearing and adorable to the dark creatures of the magical world. Man, wouldn't that suck for any other wannabe dark lord trying to make a comeback!

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
