So many people treat Harry as the villain in that Scenario. Sure, Harry cast an untested spell that could have just been another Avada Kedavra with a different name as it was listed as "For Enemies" in the HBP Potions Book, but he reacted to Malfoy actively trying to use Crucio.

*Harry slipped* as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, “Cruci---”

/“SECTUMSEMPRA!”/ bellowed Harry *from the floor,* waving his wand wildly.

Either Malfoy cast the spell and missed, or Harry talks hella fast, though... so I want to see what happens if Malfoy is found to be Crucioing Harry. Snape can't expel Malfoy anymore than he could Harry, though in Malfoy's case it's because of the Unbreakable Vow, and Dumbledore would probably sweep it under the rug for the sake of Snape.

It could lead to some heavy retaliation from the Gryffindors. Hermione brewing Veritaserum, someone stunning Malfoy and screwing up his plot (Dumbledore could have done that and not told Snape, and sabotaged the Cabinet, as Dumbledore knew Malfoy was trying to kill him, stun, veritaserum, find out his plan, obliviate, back to class, wait til Malfoy is in class, burn the Cabinet, probably spot the Diadem in the process. Anything like that.

*** Yeah, but if only Snape and Dumbledore know, then they'd cover it up for Snape's sake, as he's needed for Voldemort's defeat. Dumbledore would probably give up on Malfoy's redemption at that point, but he'd have to save Snape, and the Unbreakable Vow would kill Snape otherwise. In a fanfic, it'd probably be Obliviate Harry and Malfoy both and say "FOR THE GREATER GOOD!" in a way more reverent than the Tau from WH40k.

  Hello Minister,

  There was this student who used the torture curse on me. If you want a PR stunt with "THE CHOSEN ONE"^{TM} , please make sure the law is followed. I would make sure to tell many people about your strong sense of justice.

#+end_quote

why? malfoy would still be a terrified teenager who doesn't want to murder. even harry, the person he tried to crucio, acknowledges that at the end of HBP, and risks his life to save him in DH. not to mention dumbledore offered snape a chance at redemption, even after he was a DE who delivered the prophecy

***** Malfoy actively torturing a child, especially Harry, in his school would be harder to ignore. He, until the very last parts of DH, didn't show any want to be free of Voldemort. Snape was like "Lily's in danger. Help her and I'll serve you instead" when Dumbledore was pissed off at the very sight of the man at first. If Malfoy had turned around and said "This is too much. Help me get away from the Dark Lord" and meant it (After Legilimency) then Dumbledore would handwave all his problems away, but mostly, if there was no sign Malfoy wanted to change, and Harry wanted something done, he'd HAVE to do something, because the risk of Harry saying "Fuck this war" if Dumbledore let Malfoy get away scott free, would be bad.

***** The problem is that you have to /mean/ it. You can't just cast it because you are scared or angry. The spell requires a vicious sadistic streak a mile wide, and if you are even able to cast it there's something deeply wrong with you. It's /unforgivable/.

***** I agree! I bet Snape tortured people in Voldemort's service and he still gets a pass for being a despicable human being that should be kept away from children - much less be allowed to teach them and abuse his authority left and right while not actually teaching (Yelling about instructions being on the board and then stalking the students like a bat out of hell till the lesson is over? Nope, that's not teaching! Hell, he doesn't even start with some safety instructions which are mandatory in chemistry and other practical classes!)

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
