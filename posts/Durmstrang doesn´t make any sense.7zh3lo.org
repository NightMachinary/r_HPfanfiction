It is generally accepted that the name Durmstrang is a spoonerism of Sturm und Drang a 18th literary period in Germany, the problem with that is that Durmstrang was founded in the 12th or 13th century, by the Bulgarian witch Nerida Vulchanova, so there is no way that Sturm und Drang was the inspiration for the name...

Or is there?

Nerida Vulchanova supposedly died under mysterious circumstances and you can somewhat reasonably assume that the second headmaster after her killed her, but we don´t know how she died, what those mysterious circumstances were and if there was a corpse. A more likely explanation is that she mysteriously disappeared Harfang Munter claimed she was dead and then took over.

So how did she disappear and why did she call the school Durmstrang, there is only one possible explanation:

Time travel!

Nerida Vulchanova traveled into the past founded Durmstrang and went back to the future, but this poses another far more interesting Question.

Who is Nerida Vulchanova?

You might think, it is impossible to determine who she really is, but there is irrefutable evidence that point to only one person and one person only. First what do we know about her, that she is Bulgarian? I would assume that is only a part of her cover story, but not the truth. If we look at Durmstrang´s coat of arms we see that the name is written in Cyrillic script and in Latin script, which lead me to the assumption that Durmstrang is bilingual and we can assume one of the languages that is used there is German and in looked at it in isolation we cannot determine the second language but looking at the big picture it has to be Russian, so we know she must speak German and Russian. Then Sturm und Drang was released in 1777 so she must´ve been born a decade or two before publication, at the earliest, though I assume she was born far later.

Then we can say something about her personality and abilities. She must have been extremely capable and driven, to be able to found one of the precious few magical schools even though she didn´t have any prestigious background or family that could´ve helped her, she must´ve risen to the top with her own abilities.

So we know she is driven, that she was born in the last 300 years and that she speaks German and Russian, but why haven´t we heard from her? Her real identity I mean, someone like her surely made a name for herself, when she came back, she must´ve surely made an impact far beyond her nation.

The thing is we did, but not in the books and not on Pottermore, if she didn´t make it big in the wizarding world she must have made it big in the mundane, she must be the leader of a nation that´s only logical conclusion where here ambition would lead her.

And which countries leader is female, speaks German and Russian and still made it under unfavorable circumstances?

I always saw it as a play on words for the reader, but not an in-world inspiration. Like Remus Lupin both meaning wolf (not to mention Fenrir is the wolf-son of Loki in Norse Mythology), Dolores Umbridge meaning basically Pain & Annoyance ( /dolorous/ means causing pain or sorrow, umbrage means offense or displeasure), and stuff like that.

***** From /Pottermore/:

...A certain sector of magical society, however, follows the ancient wizarding practice of consulting a Naming Seer, who (usually for a hefty payment of gold) will predict the child's future and suggest an appropriate moniker.

This practice is becoming increasingly rare. Many parents prefer to ‘let him/her find his/her own way', and dislike (with good reason) receiving premature hints of aptitude, limitations or, at worst, catastrophe. Mothers and fathers have often fretted themselves silly on the way home from the Naming Seer, wishing that they had not heard the Seer's predictions about their child's personality or future.

** German and Russian aristocracy used to be very friendly with each other. For examples:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great][Catherine the Great]] was a German princess.
- The last Czar of Russia, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia][Nicholas II]], was primarily of German and Danish descent. He and Kaiser Wilhelm II were all first cousins of the King George V of the United Kingdom.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Kira_Kirillovna_of_Russia][Grand Duchess Kira]] was a Russian princess who married Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, in 1938, right when Nazis were in power and about to start WW2. The couple remained untouched by the Nazis until their involvement in the July 20, 1944 assassination plot against Hitler was uncovered. They were arrested in late 1944 and spent a few months in Dachau Concentration Camp.

*** To be fair, European nobility was generally quite interconnected. Quite a few foreign nobles came from minor German houses or cadet lines. The current Dutch family is of Nassau and the Palatine branch of the Wittelsbach line ruled Sweden for quite some time.

Of course, there were also the more significant ones like Habsburg or Hannover, but those are rather well known.

*** *Nicholas II of Russia*

Nicholas II or Nikolai II, Saint Nicholas II of Russia in the Russian Orthodox Church (Russian: Николай II Алекса́ндрович, tr. Nikolay II Aleksandrovich; 18 May [O.S. 6 May] 1868 -- 17 July 1918) was the last Emperor of Russia, ruling from 1 November 1894 until his forced abdication on 15 March 1917. His reign saw the fall of the Russian Empire from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. Due to the Khodynka Tragedy, anti-Semitic pogroms, Bloody Sunday, the violent suppression of the 1905 Revolution, the executions of political opponents and his perceived responsibility for the Russo-Japanese War, he was given the nickname Nicholas the Bloody by his political adversaries.
