read a crossover around the mid 2010s on ff.net for harry potter and fma, but i can't find it for the life of me. edward was a student, it took place during order of the phoenix, and there was a very specific situation where ed made a bargain with truth to have him take his teachers human transmutation sacrifice to save her, i'm pretty sure immediately after this he yelled at umbridge during class,threw up blood, and passed out.
