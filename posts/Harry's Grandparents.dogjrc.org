Why does the fandom just uses Charlus and Dorea as Harry's grandparents, when his true grans are Fleamont and Euphemia ?

And there's some fic where Harry interacts with Fleamont and/or Euphemia ?


** For a while people thought Charlus and Dorea were his grandparents because their existence was revealed before Fleamont and Euphemia's. I think a lot of people don't wanna accept the change/move on.

*** The thing is that they never made sense as Harry's grandparents, for one Rowling had already revealed that James Parents were elderly even by wizarding standards, while we know Dorea was only forty when James was born.

Then there is also them not being burned of the Family Tree, which they definitely would have been if they were James Parents, since they took Sirius in after his family kicked him out, and helping Sirius got his Uncle burned of the family tree.

Edit: I was just reading Order of thr Phoenix, and noticed that Sirius was surprised that Tonks wasn't on the Family Tree, meaning that if Dorea was Harry's Grandmother he definitely would have noted Harry's absence.

** JKR wrote about those other names on Pottermore long after Charlus and Dorea were well established in fanon.

** As others in the thread have already said, Charlus and Dorea were revealed before Fleamont and Euphermia were, so many fanfiction authors simply jump onto fanon rather than extended canon when writing their fic.

That said, there are other reasons why some authors would choose to make them Harry's grandparents. Giving Harry an actual extended family through Sirius, Andromeda, and Tonks is one such example.

*** I also think the the names just fit better.

Harry <- James <- Charlus

vs

Harry <- James <- Fleamont ... it just doesn't feel right.

Edit: Or, Harrys middle name was that of his grandfather: Harry Charlus Potter vs Harry Fleamont Potter.

** Like others said Dorea and charlus were revealed before canon grandparents, some people prefer the name, it gives him a connection to the black family, many people don't even consider a lot of what JKR says ok Potter more or interviews to be canon.

** Other than what others said I want to add that Dorea is a Black who didn't disinherited and this gives Harry a closer connection to /The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black/ and all it entails in the fanon.

** The names Charlus and Dorea existed for them in fanon LONG LONG before JKR came out with that Fleamont and Euphemia bullshit on pottermore.

Also a lot of people (myself included) don't view pottermore as canon or even view it favorably at all. That leads to a lot of people just going with the established fanon version of things instead.

There will always be people who disagree, and I'll likely get downvoted for saying this; but I personally will never view pottermore as being actual canon. I think it's a trashy attempt at retconning and JKR should have just given up and never even tried it because she did it far too late.
