No moral concerns or empathy for somebody standing in his way.

And for the love of god no romance with a character who doesnâ€˜t understand him and tells him what he does is wrong but because its Harry its ok.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** It's been years since I read it, but I'm pretty sure Harry breaks almost every law in the Wizarding World in his goal to save his sister in this one. I don't remember a romance either.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
