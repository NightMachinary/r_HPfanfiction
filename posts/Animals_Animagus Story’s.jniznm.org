:END:
So a while ago I read ‘Magical Creatures will get me killed... again!' And it's a great fic that I suggest you read, but that's not why we're here, I was really interested and I tried finding more like it but I failed.

So I was hoping that you guy's could suggest any FanFiction's that involve an animagus OC, or an OC that is great at Care of magical Creatures.

It doesn't matter what house it is in (but I would prefer Hufflepuff) and is set during the time that the golden trio go to hogwarts. From year 1-7

If you could spare some time to help me, I would be so Grateful -thank you so much!


** Damn has no one recommended anything yet? I would personally love to read a story like this.

*** Yeah, I think so too was just thinking of re-posting

I'm also thinking about writing one. After all of no one else can be bothered, do it yourself

**** I just posted a request for an OC similar to Newt Scamander and I guess that could count.

P.S- If you need a Beta for the story if you write it then ask me and I'll be willing to help. Albeit I am not able to be on as much as some other readers. I am quite a grammar nut at times!!

  Persephone Black approached 12 Grimmauld place with her purchases from Diagon Alley. She wore her honey blond hair in a tight neat bun, and her kitten heels clicked against the cobblestone. Two men stood outside of the house's magical entrance. "Miss Black... your grandmother has passed." The wizard robed in purple started. A wave of utter relief washed over her.
