Hi all! I wrote this while things have been slow at work. I hope you enjoy the first installment!

Chapter One:

She woke with a start. This was the third nightmare Ros had in a row. It was always the same. She was doing her evening rounds at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries (St. Mungo's for short), when the floor started falling down around her. She tried to out run the falling floors but she never could. It always ended with Ros hanging on to some loose debris before falling into a literal pit of despair. That was what she woke up to when her alarm went off. 

"Ughhh," she groaned as she swung her feet over the side of the bed. She clumsily pawed for her glasses and slipped them on. She wore a pair of wire rimmed glasses every day. Being magical and in the Healing business, she was always asked why she didn't get her vision corrected magically. She laughed them off and would say the glasses make her look distinguished. She really was just a little bit hesitant to let someone correct her vision magically. 

Like with anything in magical medicine, there are possible side effects. When witches and wizards were first starting to try to correct eyesight magically, some very strange effects would occur. One of the earliest experimental healing spells used was in the 1800s by an American Healer named William Henry Young from Fayetteville, Georgia. He was nearly blind and tried to correct his vision with a homemade spell. The incantation went oculus repairo. Instead of correcting his horribly nearsighted vision the spell somehow managed to give him two new functional eyes in the back of his head. Luckily he was able to hide his deformity with his long thick hair. Overtime the eyes on the front of his head became useless as his body started to rely more and more on his new eyes to see leaving him completely blind. This case is one that has been used all over the world to discourage witches and wizards from practicing Healing magic on themselves.  

As Ros pushed her glasses onto her nose, she shuffled into the bathroom and started the shower. While the shower was running, she brushed her teeth, noting her shoulder-length frizzy brown hair in the mirror. Looking down at her rubenesque orange tabby cat, Tubs, she said, “are you hungry, buddy?” He simply meowed in return.

After getting out of the bathroom and dawning her bright green St. Mungo's robes, Ros plopped down with her laptop to catch up on her emails before work. Most of her emails were from work and which cases were transferred to her department from the Emergency department from the night before. As she was clicking through she saw three new isolation cases with suspected Dragon Pox. Tests for Dragon Pox tests typically take 48 hours to diagnose, it requires a special potion with a nasal swabs. Luckily muggles and squibs don't have to worry about Dragon Pox as it is a disease that only affects witches and wizards.

"Oh great," Ros thought to herself, "I'm going to get stuck on Iso duty with him..."

The "him" she was referring to is Paul. As far as Healers go, he is one of the best. He has an intuition when it comes to Healing that is only surpassed by their mentor and head of the hospital, Rutherford Poke. He would have been a great colleague if he wasn't so highly frustrating to work with. Getting stuck on Isolation duty meant 14 hours with Paul. 

Ros gave Tubs one last pat on the head, put her hair up in a bun, and readjusted her glasses. She then grabbed some floo powder, threw some into her fireplace, and stepped into fireplace. 

She was instantly transported into the staff entrance to St. Mungo's. She rushed through the first floor and took the back stairs to the second floor. The Isolation ward is a small ward in the back of the second floor out of the way of the regular hospital traffic. This ward has its own laundry unit, ventilation system, and medical supplies which are completely separate from the rest of the hospital. Just like any Isolation ward, you are required to dawn personal protective equipment (PPE), only at St. Mungo's your PPE protects you from jinxed, hexes, curses, counter curses, and various other magical maladies you might be exposed to while working with a contagious witch or wizard. 

There was no way around it, these suits were hot. They did not have good ventilation.  They were not easy to get on and off without accidentally contaminating the prep room before entering. As she was putting on her PPE, she noticed Paul was already at one of the desks going over the notes from the cases that were transferred. 

"Nice of you to join me," Paul said as Ros shuffled in. 

"Thanks..." Ros said as she plopped down at the desk next to his. She could never come up with anything clever to say in return. "What do we have for tonight?"

Paul slid the case files over for her to look at. The first case was a 34 year old female witch recently on holiday in Romania to visit one of the dragon sanctuaries there. Seven days post-exposure she began to experience fever and headaches followed by a green scaly rash on her neck and chest with red pustules. A few days after that, her sneezes began to spark and she almost lit a box of tissue paper on fire during a particularly violent sneezing fit. Her symptoms are most likely consistent with Dragon Pox, but her test wouldn't be ready for another day or so. 

The next case was a 35 year old male wizard who presented with similar symptoms to the first case, only his seemed to start 7 days after hers. He was likely exposed while she was asymptomatic during the 7-10 day incubation period. The witch and wizard were on a mini moon after their wedding. The wizard happened to be terrified of dragons and refused to visit the sanctuary with his wife.

The third case was the couple's landlord, a 70 year old woman who has been a landlord of a large apartment complex for over 30 years. She was also having the same symptoms as the other two, presumably when the couple came to drop off their rent check. 

"Heeeeyyyy Cooper-pooper!" Ros' train of thought was immediately interrupted by one of St. Mungo's ghosts, Rhonda. Like with any of the ancient wizarding institutions, St. Mungo's has many ghosts that roam the halls. Rhonda was extremely annoying and always went out of her way to pick on Ros. Ros's last name is Cooper, many of her coworkers call her Coop. The first time Ros met Rhonda she was carrying a stack of charts and ran right through Rhonda accidentally. Ever since then, Rhonda had it out for Ros. She never missed a chance to harass Ros. 

"Get lost Rhonda, we're working," Paul said in a deep grow.

"Ok Paulie, only because you're so cute. Catch you later, Poop. Oops sorry, Coop," Rhonda said as she flew off.

"She is the worst. I would love to go one day without being called Pooper or Poop or any other permutation of the word poop."

"Don't let her get under your skin. She wouldn't tease you so much if she didn't know how mad it makes you when she calls you Poop."

"You're probably right," Ros said with a huff. 

"I'm always right. Now can we get to work please?" Asked Paul impatiently. 

"Sure," Ros said rolling her eyes.

"Ok great. So what does this look like to you?" Paul asked.

Paul never asked a question he didn't already know the answer to. He liked to talk things out to try to get a better understanding of what was going on. He usually used Ros as a sounding board when they worked together. Paul often had a way of making Ros feel both insecure and inadequate. 

"It looks like three Dragon Pox cases." I said with a yawn. I was still tired from the poor sleep I had had the past few days.

"Wrong. You know, you'd really be a lot sharper if got on a proper sleep schedule." Paul said in a condescending tone.

"Oh you're one to talk. We have almost the exact same schedule," Ros said.

"Yes, but I'm already sharp enough as is," Paul said with a grin.

"Ok smart guy, tell me what you found."

"What do you notice about Mrs. Norberry?"

"The old lady? She probably got exposed when the Pruits dropped their rent check off for the month." Ros said, not seeing what the big deal was.

"There's only one problem. Mrs. Norberry is a muggle."
