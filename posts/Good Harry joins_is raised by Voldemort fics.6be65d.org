If possible, he doesn't defect to the "light". I just want to read something like that.

No slash or crossovers please.


** Oh.

OH.

/OH/

finally I can pull this out of its original posts.

My [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzSyIRlXGa1_rtjjhxOVogz_l_-5ZuhMFvbBYwdlDeM/edit#gid=0][Masterlist]]! There is slash rec in there, but platonic (non slash/amorous) pairings are indicated. Just pick those with an X under the G column and you're good to go.\\
I've also made an additional sheet for platonic pairing to help having a better view of what's available. It's updated very frequently, and you can see the last updates in the according sheet "Updates Notes".

Edit: for your particular request you may be interested, specifically in linkao3(The Train to Nowhere), linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) (and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis), Hit the ground running, which has been pulled from ff.com, but the dl link can be found in the masterlist I linked. linkffn(Keep Your Enemy Closer) would also be worth reading.

Harry remains relatively good/neutral, while still joining Voldemort in all of those.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  It's a different Hogwarts with weird Pureblood regulations, Dark Marks acting funny and deadly classmates. The last thing Harry needs right now is the mocking voice of Tom Riddle whispering inside his head... Voldemort wins and discovers the existence of his human horcrux. Or: how Harry learned to see things from the grey side. AU LV/HP mentoring, no slash.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
