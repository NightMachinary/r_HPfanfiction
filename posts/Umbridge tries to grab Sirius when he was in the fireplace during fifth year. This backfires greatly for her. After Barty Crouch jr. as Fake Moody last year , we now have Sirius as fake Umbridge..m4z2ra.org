I always found this scene weird in the fifth book chapter 17. Did umbridge really think that she could just grab Sirius from the fireplace ? Well if that is really the case , the inverse should be possible.

After removing his head from the fire , Sirius proceed to grab Umbridge's hand. He drags her in 12 Grimmauld Place and use a spell to stun her.

Sirus panics and he comes up with a crazy idea. He decide to impersonating her with some polyjuice while having Kreacher hiding her in the house.


** The fifth years dragged themselves into the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom and slouched into their seats. They had long since stopped bothering to take out their wands. Harry could hardly remember a time when Defense had been his favorite subject.

Professor Umbridge arrived precisely three minutes after class was set to begin. She was as pink and toadlike as ever, and yet there was something different about her. Her stride was awkward, as if her legs were suddenly too short. And the pink bow in her hair was crooked.

‚ÄúWhere are your wands?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou can't learn to defend yourself without a wand. Not that I'm entirely against throwing a good punch when the moment is right, of course.‚Äù

Harry and his classmates stared at one another, mouths agape, for a long moment before reaching for their wands.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù said Umbridge, ‚ÄúWhat's the best Defense lesson you've ever had?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe boggart lesson with Professor Lupin,‚Äù said Dean quickly. They all watched Umbridge carefully. They knew what she thought of Lupin.

But Umbridge looked more amused than disdainful. ‚ÄúWell, I haven't got a boggart but I suppose you could practice your jinxes so I can see where you are. Pair off.‚Äù

Everyone except Hermione stood up. ‚ÄúProfessor? I thought you said that we only needed the book for this class.‚Äù

‚ÄúI've changed my mind, Hermione.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you called me Miss Ganger---‚Äù

‚ÄúMy apologies, Miss Granger.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's almost as if---‚Äù

/‚ÄúAre you mad, Hermione?‚Äù/ Ron hissed under his breath. /‚ÄúLet's hope the real Umbridge never crawls out of whatever hole this person put her in. You stuck Rita Skeeter in a bottle. How is this worse?‚Äù/

Hermione seemed to consider the matter. ‚ÄúWhile we practice our jinxes, /you/ should practice walking in heels,‚Äù she told not-Umbridge pointedly.

‚ÄúIt's harder than it looks,‚Äù Umbridge said.

‚ÄúYou need to put your heel down first,‚Äù said Lavender. ‚ÄúNot your whole foot at once like you're wearing a flat.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have to shorten your stride,‚Äù added Parvati. ‚ÄúLean back a little.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd fix the bow in your hair,‚Äù Lavender completed. ‚ÄúThe real Umbridge would never let it get crooked.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are spells for that,‚Äù Hermione put in.

‚ÄúClear your throat,‚Äù Seamus suggested. ‚ÄúIt's awful, that little /hem hem./‚Äù

The others all shuddered.

Not-Umbridge looked at them all as if she didn't know what to make of them.

‚ÄúDon't look at us like you think we matter,‚Äù said Neville. ‚ÄúLook through us. Except Harry and Hermione. You need to pretend to hate them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you can't jump into the practical lessons right away. Make it gradual so people won't notice the difference so much.‚Äù That was Hermione again.

‚ÄúDon't any of you care what I've done with your professor?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù they said in unison.

Lavender, unable to bear the crooked bow any longer, stood up to straighten it. ‚ÄúWe've only got forty minutes left to teach you enough to pass when the Slytherins come in. They won't be as forgiving as we are.‚Äù

‚Äã

ETA: Thanks for the awards, kind strangers! (Platinum?!) I'm glad you enjoyed.
