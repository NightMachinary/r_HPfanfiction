I know it's popular but seriously it's so fantastic and spot-on. I know that it's relatively popular (900 favorites) but it's easily one of the best fics out there.

All of the Marauders are well-characterized, and they actually seem like preteen/teenage boys which is somewhat rare in Marauder fics. This fic revolves around all of the Marauders in their first few years at Hogwarts, but with a focus on Remus. Sirius is very very well-done, he's impulsive, blunt, and acts his age, but he's also surprisingly earnest and an unwavering friend to Remus.

None of it is overdone or seems out of character for boys their age.

It reads like a prequel, you can see the boys developing into the men we see in the Potter books.


** Been reading this fic for two days. It is amazing! Thanks for the recommendation. Only to chapter 19, but i am looking forward to the remaining 80+!
