Do those exist? Not just multiverse hopping Harry. A fullblown, Magic: The gathering concept taken and applied to the HPverse. His spark could've ignited during the loss of Sirius or at the end of voldemort.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lessons of Urza) was something I enjoyed. It has a good Dumbledore(which is rare with somewhat OP Harry fics), and while currently he has great power, and even greater potential with Dumbledore himself saying he has no doubt that Harry will defeat Voldemort, it's hinted at that an even greater evil is coming, can't say more without spoiling the story.

While it doesn't have much in the way of Planeswalkers, it does have a Harry who is learning from a Planeswalker(Urza) through a book, and interesting mechanics are introduced.

Thanks,

Warryn.

  Harry was looking for Nicolas Flamel. Instead, Harry found a whole different way to use magic. Crossover with Magic: the Gathering. first fic, reviews are always appreciated
