  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/BM.html][Blood Magic]] has Harry smoking occasionaly. It's an old post-OttP Severitus story (one of the few that I liked) featuring a lot of trio friendship moments, Harry & Snape interaction, Harry & Draco interaction, quite a bit of Remus and some other subplots.

Sounds quite trite, right? Well it would be, except the author is a mistress of characterization. She turned a 5/10 plot bunny in a 9.5/10 story.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

*** I could never get past the first chapter of this for some reason, for the uninformed who doesn't mind sopilers too much, could you tell me a bit about this story. most importantly, how powerful is he when he gets to Hogwarts for the first time. Does it use the whole different culture, different magic thing, or is he some OP, wandless BAMF, because "only Europe uses wands". I wouldn't mind it too much, but where would you rate him on the power scale in this story.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

**** It has been some time since I've read it but I'll try my best. Maybe others that remember more can chime in.

He is really powerfull, at least as a fighter. He is trained from a young age to be an assassin/enforcer, so he is extremely proficient in a number of martial arts, swordfighting and the use of numerous other weapons and poisions. We are given the impression that few, if any, wizards would stand a chance against him in a fight. Comparing his pure magical skill to others is not that easy, because he rarely uses a wand or spells the british know. In this stories Japan, magic is not as much of a secret as it is in the UK. It is not exactly common knowledge but there are a lot more in the know. Because the society is not seperated their use of magic is often times more subtle, Harry uses a focus ring and a type of prewritten "Kanji runes" on little pieces of paper he can activate at will, though he is also capable of completely "wandless" magic. So in some ways he is OP, because he uses things other people have no knowledge of or defences for.

I'll see if I remember anything else, but feel free to ask any questions you have. I'm unsure what else is relevant
