** "He has never shown any inclination to be attracted to males, let's not go too far."

Why not just say you prefer not to read slash? Harry never showed an inclination towards dark/evil magic, being in any house or having a secret ability - that doesn't mean that it's 'too far' that you want to read it.

*** Harry comments on men being handsome an awful lot . Did this guy read the books or is he just caught in a fanon loop ?

** linkffn(12562072) You're pretty much describing Harry Potter and the Daft Morons - or an even worse version of it.

***** Yeah, it's... Not a great story to be honest.

From what I can tell, Clueful!HP means "I bash everyone to make Harry seem smarter without actually making him a compelling character".

And yes, the Dumbledore Bashing is at its very worst.

All in all, it's a perfect storm of almost everything I personally dislike in Harry Potter fanfiction - which is exactly what the OP requested.
