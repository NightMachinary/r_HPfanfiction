-Anakin

-Naruto, Sasuke, kakashi, shikamaru, zabuza, Itachi

-Murtagh, young Brom (eragon)

Aragorn (lotr)

-Jaime or maybe even tyrion (game of thrones)

-Mr. Darcy from either pride and prejudice or pride and prejudice zombies

-Achmed the snake from symphony of ages

It seems like these are not as popular so instead of putting them all on different posts I figured I should put them all on one.

If there is a good story with another character from these series I would welcome that recommendation also.
