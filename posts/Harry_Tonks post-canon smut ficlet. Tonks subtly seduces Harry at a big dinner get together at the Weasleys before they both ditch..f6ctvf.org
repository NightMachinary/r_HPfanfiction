:END:
Post-Voldemort would probably be more accurate seeing as, y'know, Tonks is still alive. It's a big Weasley & friends dinner event. Starts with footsy stuff during dinner; Harry is seated across from a couple of girls and he tries to figure out who it is. Tonks eventually pulls him to the side and they fool around. Afterwards she tells him that she's got the following week off of work and invites him to spend it at her place. Then they ditch the get together. It's just a one-shot, I think.

Anybody recognize this fic?

  A mature commission set after DH, ignoring canon: Harry asks Tonks to sit near him at a Weasley family gathering so Molly doesn't try to set him up with Ginny once again. Tonks would rather play footsie under the table and tease him in a very public place, instead.

*** Between Hidetaki Miyazaki, Quenten Tarantino, and this fic... I might have to try out feet sometime.
