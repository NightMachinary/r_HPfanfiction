So just during the attack on Katie Bell, Malfoy committed multiple war crimes, used unforgivables, severely injured her and tried to murder a person. Romilda tried to rape Harry. And yet there are no legal repercussions whatsoever.

So are there any stories where at least one of them get arrested and sentenced for the committed crimes?


** Not that I know of, but now I want a story were Ron can't be cured of the love potions/no one ever realizes it and now Romilda is stuck with him because she doesn't have the antidote.

** Not that I find love potions moral generally speaking, but I'd be inclined to say that rape is going a bit far. Sexual harassment, sure, but rape? Ehh...

*** If someone slips you a love potion, and suddenly, you want to have sex with them, and then have sex with them, then that's rape. If you've got trouble understanding that, imagine the ugliest person of a gender you're not attracted to (if there's one) doing that to you.

**** Oh I don't deny that. But slipping a love potion to someone and having sex with them isn't the same thing. No matter what, it's sexual harassment. Imagine being aggressively hit on by someone you have no interest with whatsoever, forceful touches, kisses or whatever. That isn't /rape/ -- it's sexual harassment.

***** If you sleep with them while mind-controlled, it's rape. If someone stops you, it's attempted rape.

****** But it isn't clear that love potions make you /lustful/ -- just interested in a character. Does that mean you immediately want to run and shag them? What if you slipped a love potion to a 12-13 year old, which is far too early for those kind of shenanigans?

Again, to be clear, I am not justifying the use of love potions. At all. Just saying that equating it with rape is too far. Rape is a rather traumatic experience -- Ron didn't really seem to suffer much of any after-effects in canon. (He never actually met Romilda, but he didn't seem to want to shag her first thing). Yes, if sex /does/ happen (or is attempted), then rape charges is justified. But if it was never going to reach that point in first place, would it really be equal to calling it rape?

******* Ron was in a relationship with another girl and completely forgot about her.

It was still attempted rape.
