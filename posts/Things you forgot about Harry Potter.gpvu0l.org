Things you forgot that specifically made you rethink things about the series or rethink assumptions you had for a while.

I recently saw a video which covered passages about Snape's memories Harry got in the last book bout his relationship with Lilly.

You get to see Snape apologize for calling her a mudblood and Lilly doesn't forgive him because she knows he sympathizes with death eaters aka muggleborn haters and wants to join them. And she points out her other friends don't get why she continues to associate with someone who has those view points. You see her call him out for talking to the future death eaters in a earlier memory too.

Which totally threw me for a loop. Like I just kinda just assumed that Snape kept the bigotry underwraps and then let it finally slip out during the scene in book 5 and that ended the friendship and he got more blatantly bigoted and pro death eater afterwards cuz I totally forgot about these scenes in the last book.

It kinda makes me rethink the whole scene in book 5 a bit and Snape's whole relationship with Lilly. And his relationship with others too I just sorta saw him as a loner recluse in school who only had Lilly as a friend while Lilly has other friends. But he does have this separate friend group too.

So what are things you forgot from the books that you remembered through like discussions or meta or re reads or whatever that made you rethink stuff?


** People often tend to ignore the fact that Remus was ready to leave Tonks, because he was scared/worried. I love Remus, but damn, that's a slap in the face as a fan of him. While the moment Harry had yelled at him was huge, and some might consider it over done in the book, I honestly loved it, slapping some much needed sense into Remus was appreciated.

People also often seem to ignore or forget that Harry knew about the other Horcruxes were.

#+begin_quote
  Harry: "He made seven Horcruxes?" Dumbledore: "...Not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body..." (HP6, US Hardback, page 503).
#+end_quote

Also while the Order of the Phoenix is considered part of the light side, they were not afraid to use lethal spells. Remus even told Harry that Disarming people was for things in the past.

Amazed me when I found out people thought Dumbledore and Harry didn't have this conversation as there's a whole chapter dedicated to it. Also kind explains the hatred for the memories Dumbledore showed: many don't even remember what happened in them.

But those were not new thoughts for him. He was well aware of his condition and must have thought about the possibility of:

1) infected offspring

2) political persecution

3) his financial situation

4) what can happen if you stick your cock into a woman in the child-bearing age. Presumably repeatedly.

He knew about the issue beforehand and still made a commitment. Only to break his vows three months into the marriage (the "for better, for worse" bit). The fact that he took the decision away from his wife shows that he clearly has not thought this whole marriage through and was not ready. And the fact that Harry was the one who had to take sense into him makes it even worse considering Harry's track record and inexperience.

And I am aware that Tonks probably pushed for the relationship. And that would excuse Lupin's action if they had an ONS and he had regrets afterwards. But they didn't. Lupin not only consented to a relationship, he consented to the marriage. And he could have prevented the pregnancy by wrapping his willy if he did not feel ready for kids. Therefore I blame the entire mess on him.

**** In the olden days of fanfictions, (haven't read too many manipulation Dumbledore stories now, so I have no idea how it is now), many fanfic writers seem to have forgotten what was written in the books, as canon, and assumed that Dumbledore never told Harry about the Horcruxes, which when I was able to stomach the manipulation Dumbledore stories, that was a pretty common plot point of Dumbledore lying and keeping things from Harry, about the Horcruxes, despite the fact he had in fact told Harry about them in canon.

They seemingly forget that Dumbledore did in fact tell Harry the Horcruxes, even without the Manipulation Dumbledore plot line, a surprising amount of fanfic writers seemed to ignore the fact that Dumbledore had told Harry about them.

** I'm listening to the podcast on famous people read the first Harry Potter, and I forgot how sarcastic Harry is with the Dursleys. Like, despite the abuse he's quite willing to be quite snarky even when it has negative consequences. A lot of fics make Harry either too serious or too meek and it makes it easy to forget how rebellious yet well intended this kid is.

*** Tbh, it doesn't need to be despite the abuse. It's well known that some abused kids push in one way or another until they get a reaction - either because 'negative attention is better than no attention', to force predictability (giving the illusion of control), due to emotional regulation difficulties or just because they're people.

***** Not really though. Dudley and his gang chased the other children away and if they didn't do that the kids parents told them not to associate with Harry because of the lies spread by the Dursleys.

At school all the teachers were convinced he was a cheater because of Petunia and Dudley. And (idk if this is canon or just fanon) he had to do worse than Dudley in school or be punished or called a cheater and having Petunia telling his teachers he was a cheater.

** I see it often here on Reddit that people don't remember the actual characters but fanon or head canon versions of them, which is often the source of the bashing of characters and makes objective discussion difficult. I'm not sure if I misremember anything. I usually just forget about small moments, not really stuff that defines characters. But I also occasionally write fanfic, so I've done a lot of research on them.
