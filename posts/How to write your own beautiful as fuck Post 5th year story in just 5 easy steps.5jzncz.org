** In step 4 does that include him suddenly becoming a fucking sex god and being able to fuck someones girlfriend and and have her boyfriend and his friends lining up with their asses in the air next to you waiting for their turn and he later ( like 2 chapters if that) gets a harem of every single fucking girl, man, child, dragon, weird creature that came back to life, and a clone of himself that has a picture of his mum that he will then precede to have vigorous sexual activities with for the next 48 hours straight with not a single break.

With step 5 would Dumbles be defeated in a brutality sadistic way that makes Voldemort cry in sadness for his secret bff and lover's death while having every major organ, limb, and whatever other thing torn from him by a 15 year old kid that is suddenly a damn god. Oh, and he will later turn the entire of magical Britain into a utopia where everyone can jerk each other off.

** I'd love to see just one more try, where step 3 goes like:

"... And he headed for Diagon Alley.

[scene break]

As he lay drifting off to sleep that night, he mentally reviewed his purchases to make sure he hadn't forgotten anything:

1. A multi-compartment trunk just like Moody's. That had looked dead useful.
2. Enough properly-fitting clothes for two weeks before he needed to do laundry, plus several pairs of shoes and boots
3. Contacts, because no one with any sense played a violent sport with glasses on
4. Boxes and boxes of energy bars and several cases of bottled water, in case he ever got locked in his room again (and some wet wipes, 'cause not being allowed to shower sucked)
5. 3 "decoy wands" in case Vernon tried to confiscate his
6. Books on how to actually learn Occlumency, and a few other interesting topics he'd noticed in the bookstore

Yeah, he thought that pretty much covered his essential needs. Not like the stores were going anywhere, he could get anything else later."

There you go, no extended shopping scene needed, or extremely detailed account of his purchases. Fill in later, as needed (i.e., book titles).

** There's something missing. Harry is obviously the heir of all four founders and owns Hogwarts, because through some unfathomable circumstances his parent's and grandparents were unaware that they belonged to the big four's houses, and despite the fact that most of the British wizarding world population is interrelated the title goes only to him.

Harry needs to get acquire an OP teleporting familiar on accident, preferably with lighting or fire affinity, actually make those at least two, that he then proceeds to ignore for the duration of the story.

Harry calls Dobby who manages to build him a mansion with a sex dungeon and 20 underground levels. No expenses needed because Dobby can just blindly rob all of the purebloods of their property without anything being traced to Harry.

Also there absolutely need to be crazy naked goblins beating on gongs when Harry gets his new titles and lordships so that everyone in Gringots knows that something important has happened. Obviously the monumental event needs to be broadcasted live across Hogwarts by bells deafening everyone unfortunate enough to be in the Great Hall at the time.

Basilisk Hide Armor, duh. Because it's the best one out there!

Oh! And Harry doesn't need to go along with Dumbledore's manipulations anymore, since he managed to purge of all the potions in his system that created an adverse reaction and he is now a super powered intelligent demigod or something. All of that suppressed angst has to manifest into something big!
