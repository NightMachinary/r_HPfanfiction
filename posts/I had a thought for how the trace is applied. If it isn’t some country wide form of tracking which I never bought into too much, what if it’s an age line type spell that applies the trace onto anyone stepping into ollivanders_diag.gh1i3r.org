**** It does activate but the ministry ignores it assume that wizarding parents are going to control their kids. It was mentioned in book 5 or 6 i think. I've also read where if a parent gives explicit verbal permission it wont trigger. This holds up when Dumbledore gives harry permission when the go to meet with slughorn

***** I figured dumbledore was more saying he would ensure there would be no problem if he used magic with him in an emergency cause of the underage statute and neither are looked at as crazy now

** Then you would have a tracing charm which works for seven years, which is yet another Orwellian nightmare.

See [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Trace][HP Wiki]]: the Trace is hopeless convoluted mess, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Heroic attempts of HP wiki editors notwithstanding, I still have no clue how it works. Using the book canon only (and specifically ignoring anything JKR or HB editors wrote on the Pottermore ex post), I have some thoughts.

One very radical thought is that the Trace is the charm, which has to be cast on some individual specifically and it can last just for some limited time. E.g., it was a parting gift of the Minister Scrimgeour (or some of his Aurors) during the Funeral of Albus Dumbledore, or perhaps it was installed on Harry (and Harry only) every year when leaving for Hogwarts. Why it doesn't work on The Burrow, I have no idea, aside from the fact that it was the well-established pureblood house, and Death Eaters were not ready yet to attack it before the fall of the Ministry (although they knew Harry was there).

It probably doesn't work completely, but I just want to emphasize how incredibly little we know about the Trace, and how much it is just a last-minute plot-crutch of JKR created as an explanation why Harry has to stay in the Burrow for the wedding (because, obviously she wanted to have their moment at the wedding), and perhaps why Ginny cannot go with them (because she didn't know what to do with her, because JKR sucks with the romance).

** Rowling has given us evidence that the British Wizarding community at least has ongoing spells operating in the background, such as the one that detects every child showing the first signs of magic within the 'jurisdiction' of Hogwarts and powers the quill of acceptance.

​

It's a small stretch to me, to then say that the Trace is applied in the same way, or similarly.

Suppose there is a quill in a room somewhere in the Ministry with similar magic to the quill of acceptance, and it notes down all instances of 'deliberate underage magic' (note that Dobby was able to replicate this using his own fundamentally different elf magic) that occurs in areas where it shouldn't (so, just about anywhere outside Hogwarts, its Express, and possibly other exemptions woven into the charm).

Possibly it is able to detect if there are any adult magic users nearby to supervise, in which case it would probably not mark down anything. (But the Trace goes away on majority - honest, guv'!).

​

Then, it might be the job of some Ministry bureaucrat(s) to read this quill's output and decide how to respond to any given situation, if at all. Presumably, families like the Malfoys would be able to bribe or threaten these people into turning a blind eye to their youths' misdeeds, and someone like young Tom Riddle might, upon finding out about it, be able to discreetly remove his own Trace ahead of time (although, since he left Uncle Morfin alive, it is possible that he simply had him along under Imperius when he murdered the Riddles, which would then count as magic use with an adult present).

​

Although this doesn't gel perfectly with the way Dumbledore tells it, I rather think there would have to be no notification when Riddle was performing unforgivable curses on people, due to Morfin's presence: if the authorities were notified that an underage student is pulling stunts like that, one imagines said authorities wouldn't much care that he supposedly has adult supervision.

​

Possibly this more basic version of the Trace was in place before Voldemort's first war, and elaborations were added because of that event, possibly at Dumbledore's own instigation; in fact he would probably have to perform the alterations himself.
