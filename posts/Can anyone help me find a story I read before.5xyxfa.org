It was a 'Reading the books' type story, with a pregnant Hermione, slightly insane Harry, Neville, Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the room of requirements. Neville blew up the entrance and got them all stuck in there. I think it was based around the time of Draco letting them into the school by way of the vanishing cabinet. There was also a vampire involved in relation to Harry.
