Ployjuice is a very difficult potion to make. Due to stewing Lacewing flies a second longer, potion has become permanent. Now Harry and Ron are stuck looking like Crabble and Goyle and Hermione is stuck as Millicent Bulstrode.


** Ah but Hermione didn't become Bullstrode, she became a humanoid cat (which also proves that she can make such a mistake with the potion). I would read the hell out of that story. I also really enjoy stories that redeem Crabbe & Goyle.

** McGonnagall wonders how 3 of her charges disappeared from the castle. At the same time, Snape is trying to wrape his head around the shocking progresses of his 2 worst students (3 if we say that Millicent was also an idiot).
