Hi, how are you?

​

I need the recommendation of a fanfic that has some of these characteristics:

​

- Lily and James are alive but think Harry is dead (I've read The Darkness Within, Light up the Sky).

​

- Lily and James neglect Harry, but repent and try to ask Harry for forgiveness.

​

Or something similar to this! :D

If you know, thank you very much!


** If you're looking for a nice one, it's on fanfiction net, it's uncompleted and it's called "Love and Love Again."

If you're looking for a dark, tragic one that I couldn't get over, that I don't really recommend, and is the reason "Darkness Within" was created, it's on fanfiction net, it's called "A Shattered Prophesy."
