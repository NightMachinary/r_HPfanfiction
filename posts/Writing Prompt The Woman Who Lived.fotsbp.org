James dies trying to protect Lily and Harry. Lily(and Harry too) has the same blood protection Harry has in canon but from James. Voldemort's killing curse rebounds from Lily instead of Harry and he "dies".

Lily becomes the first person in history to have survived the killing curse and becomes The Woman Who Lived.

Could this be interesting?


** I would be very interested in reading this.

Instead of Longbottoms the Lestranges go after Lily to find out what she did to their Lord. Maybe Lily, Sirius and Remus could fight them off or hold them long enough for reinforcements to arrive or maybe the three of them get tortured to insanity or the Lestranges put Harry under Crucio to make them speak.

Given how the scenario plays out it would be interesting to watch Sirius, Lily and Remus grieve for James while raising Harry and trying to hide from the death eaters; Harry being raised by the Longbottoms or the ramifications of the torture of a baby.

Either way this is a really interesting prompt and I would love to read it.

** I'd love this, but there is a bit of a technicality here: the sacrifice magic only works if the person wasn't going to die anyway. Voldemort always intended to kill James, so unfortunately his death had no effect; however, he was intending to spare Lily (because of Snape asking for it) and so she could have lived, but chose to keep defending Harry. That's why there aren't more cases of sacrifice saving others from killing curses - I'm certain it wasn't the first time a parent had put themselves bodily in the way of a killing curse for their child, but if the murderer was going to kill them too anyway then it didn't help.

Edit: this is my head canon, btw.

*** I posted the exact same [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d9kdjj/lily_potter_is_the_womanwholived_and_james_was/][prompt]] some time ago that gave a good reason why Voldemort might ask James to step aside.
