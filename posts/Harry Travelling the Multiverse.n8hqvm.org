I just had this random idea and was wondering if someone had written anything similar.

The idea is that Harry finds a way to travel to different worlds. Eventually, he finds other Harrys. Perhaps they are different to him. A more darker Hadrian Black. A Harrison Peverell who uses the Hallows. Maybe a female harry. Then they group up to try to achieve something.

It's just a base outline but I thought it would be funny if there was some Council of Harrys travelling the Multiverse. If someone was ambitious enough they could try do crossovers.


** Here is dunelos

Read through all his lone traveller stuff it's close enough

**** I would love to try to write it myself, but I struggle every time I start writing. I can think of good outlines or ideas but never a good plot to follow it.

Anyway thanks for the Fics!
