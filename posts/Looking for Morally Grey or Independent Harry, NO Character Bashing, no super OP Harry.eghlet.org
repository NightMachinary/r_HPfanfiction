So many of those Indy type of stories have character bashing or Harry as OP, I'm wanting a more realistic Indy type of Harry.

I'd rather him be more good, trying to defeat Voldemort and the Death Eaters, he can be smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon, but I don't want him to become Hermione smart, or Dumbledore powerful.

I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

It can be on any site, not just on fanfiction.net

I'd rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but as long as it's written believable enough, to where Hermione isn't perfect, and Harry isn't pretty much a God or anything, and Ron isn't bashed! it'll be fine.

I don't want For the Greater Good Dumbledore either. He can be a little manipulative, but not crazy amount. I'd rather just see him trying his best and making mistakes.

No Lord Potter-Malfoy-Black stories. NO Harem Harry, and as I said no super intelligent Harry or Super OP Harry, a little smarter or stronger then canon is fine, but nothing unbelievable.


** That's a tall order my guy

** There are very few fics that meet your stringent criteria. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is among the few:

- Fights Voldemort and Death Eaters
- Stronger than in canon, but not super smart and powerful
- Is definitely willing to kill, and he killed lots of bad guys
- Canon pairings
- Dumbledore made a few mistakes early, but tried his best and was essential in their victory
- Voldemort went down in a team effort

*** Oh thank you! I know my criteria is rather harsh, but I'm so tired of the same old independent kind of Harry stories that I just wanted something different. Thanks again!

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(11191235)

I mean, every one has either read this one, or attempted to. If you are in the minority who hasn't. Then, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, has a proper, independent Harry.

linkffn(11858167)

Another, "everyone has at least attempted this", fic. No bashing, no Dumbledore and no Voldemort. A good example of a trio fic, with an independent Harry.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
