**** No, they try to make it better than perfect. There was no prejudice against muggleborn, vampires, werewolfs,goblins,elves and other magical creatures, like that was possible.

Wizards get their wand at the age of six and allowed to do magic outside the school, like kids would be responsible.

Ollivander wands are second rate. Yeah Voldemort uses something inferior, that dampens his power.

Or they won't use wands at all. Instead they uses staffs or rings or something else.

In manipulative Dumbledore stories, Dumbledore was just an average wizard and any auror can defeat him.

They use computers, cause they are not ignorant and prejudiced like their british counterparts.

British government was a control bitch and doesn't allow people to learn anything except light magic. In truth there was no light or dark magic everything was just magic and only intention matters. Tell that to horcruxes and inferi creation.

***** I mean some of them can be subjective (like say the quality of the wand - Krum (and probably his entire wizarding culture) believes that Gregorovitch is the best wand maker) or are canon (African wizards do not use wands IIRC).

However, I guess they state that as a fact, rather than an opinion.

I mean, I get that JKR's wizarding culture has downsides - but so does every culture.

And let's be honest - who would wanna read that?

** Most fics are only in other cultures for brief stints of time rather than the whole fic. Nevertheless, I will throw out some fics with different renditions of the non-British wizarding world:

- linkffn(Dagger and Rose): this fic has Dumbledore mentoring Harry post-PoA, and there is a quite a bit of adventuring and worldbuilding as they go.
- linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): this is a highly AU version of the magical world and is /very/ dark (grimdark), but there is quite a bit of foreign worldbuilding in the trilogy with Harry visiting multiple countries (including the war-torn magical Americas).
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): this fic is a gargantuan piece of worldbuilding and storytelling, with a strong point in its characterizations (see: every scene with Voldemort or Snape). Most of the foreign stuff is in Ireland, France and Germany around and after 4th year.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): this fic starts pretty shallowly, but if you get past the first ~5 chapters it improves significantly. The highlight and my favorite parts are Dumbledore and Harry adventuring in Ch. 12-18 in numerous different countries. As a teaser, at different points the two are fighting off an undead Basilisk and tracking down a Chinese dark lord with a penchant for the Imperius Curse.
- linkffn(A Long Journey Home): this a time-travel fic where we see fem!Harry going through many of the magical cultures in her past lifetime. Decent story that is best at the atmosphere it creates.
- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): a true classic, this story features a 2nd person look at Harry in magical Brazil as a cursebreaker in training post-OOTP. The fic is a bit Indy!Harry, but a lot of the personality, cleverness and sense of adventure make it worthwhile.

I have more, but I think thats enough for now.
