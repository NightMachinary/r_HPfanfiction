**** This Bites! runs on high-octane badassery. It takes the One Piece world, makes it far more brutal, and then runs with it like a kid in a candy store, except the kid is a madman and the candy store sells knives. Yes, it is good. It's also written by three or four authors working together, bouncing ideas off one another and checking their work, which means it's really high quality and doesn't suffer from burnout.

** Does it count if it's not finished?

Sympathetic Properties linkffn(10914042) has 39 chapters, 529,886 words, and according to the author:

#+begin_quote
  As to how long this'll run and how far along we are in the grand scheme of things, it'll be going until some time during their 5th year (I'm not exactly sure when), and I'd say that we're 25-33% of the way through the story of 2nd year. If I had to wager a guess, that might make us around 10% of the whole way through the story as a whole

Before this topic it was the longest I've read anyway.

** The longest on AO3 (where you can actually search by word count) is linkao3(CCW: Character Championship Wrestling) at 3.8 million words.

The longest HP fic on AO3 by someone not named megamatt is linkao3(Fragmented Soul) at 1.35 million words.

The longest I've read, if we allow series, is probably the Dangerverse. I don't remember exactly, but it was roundabout 1.7 million words plus side-stories and spinoffs.

  A plethora of icons have joined Character Championship Wrestling in search for unparalleled prestige. And if they know one thing, it's that CCW is where only the elite survive. ROSTER PAGE HAS FINALLY BEEN UPDATED. (Well, 99% updated. But updated nonetheless!)

  When Voldemort attacks and kills the Potters, Snape decides he wants to keep the one remaining piece of Lily, her son, for himself. But keeping Harry safe and away from the world has unexpected consequences that no-one could have predicted. Fenrir/Harry relationship. Dedicated to the wonderfully talented StarLight Massacre and co-written with Bicky Monster.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** The longest fic I've read all the way through is "The Spirit of Redemption" linkffn(6735812) . Highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys Mass Effect fanfics, it's actually quite well written with several generations of interesting characters. The longest fic I've ever seen is the already mentioned "Ambience: a Fleet Symphony"
