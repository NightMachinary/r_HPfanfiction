Hey guys,

​

I know I will not make many friends by saying it, but I'd like some fanfictions where Ron dies (the earlier the better!) and forces both Hermione and Harry to grow up faster and face up to the reality that they could be killed, too and thus have to prepare (or leave, that's ok, too!)!

​

Yes, poor Ron but seriously, him dying is a prime character growth opportunity (same if you would kill Hermione, but I like her too much - without putting her an a pedestal, her superior attitude, bossyness etc. often piss me off, like a lot of the fandom does ("Smartest with of her age!" - Yeah, how about no? Fred and George are way more creative, same for the Marauders! Hell, she never even tries to become an animgus, despite the fact that her idol, McGonagall, being one!)

​

So, help? ;)

​

Also some "conditions":

​

- please no slash (just not my cup of tea)

- no Harry/Ginny unless super well writen

​

There, stage is your's! Go forth my minions and find me juicy reading material :)


** This one meets your request and conditions: linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]]

Ron doesn't get saved when he gets poisoned in his 6th year. Fascinating read and fairly short.

*** It is a good premise just because so many people seem to forget that Ron was poisoned on his birthday. It gets brought up when people want to point out Malfoys crimes, but they otherwise ignore it.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

**** I'm glad you enjoyed it. If you liked that, there's actually a nearly-complete sequel to it that I just read today. It's a dimension hop fic that pits Canon!Trio, ForLackofaBezoar!Harry and friends against Evil!Harry in a world where Voldemort won. It's a bizarre premise, but the author makes it work really really well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog]]

It's supposed to take place in the author's downward spiral saga. I never read that series, but having read For Lack of a Bezoar, I more than understood what was going on. Try it!

** Linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday), I decided to ignore the fact you want character development from Ron's death. He still dies. I'll admit, it ain't right away though, so start digging.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
