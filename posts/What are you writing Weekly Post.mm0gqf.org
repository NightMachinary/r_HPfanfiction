** I'm trying to write the next chapter of my James S./OC and I'm struggling with simply having too much. I keep going off onto tangents and have had to cut a lot of nice scenes because they were leading me off track. It's not a problem I've had in a long time!

** I really didn't want to start a thread only for this, but it's been on my mind lately and I'd to share it - I have been working on a story in my head for at least four years (Marauders Era, canon). However, I stopped writing ages ago, and it's been so hard trying to get that feeling back again. My words are not as beautiful as they used to be.

A year ago, I've decided to write a second (quite possibly short) story. Why? Because I knew that the first story after such a break of writing usually sucks. And I loved the first one, I didn't want to mess it up.

The second story, which I'm currently writing, is about Dorea Black and Charlus Potter. First it started as a one-shot, then I realised that we only know that Dorea was born in 1925, we don't know in /which month/. So I could make her a 7th year during Tom's 1st year. In Slytherin, since Slughorn "had the whole set".

Dorea's dream was to become an auror (because I like the irony). We also have Charlus Potter with whom she shares her ambition. It started as a random /just to write even if it's bad/ story, but now I'm in the middle of outling the plot about them during the Global Wizarding War. The era has so much potential and so much /space/ to write about. I am completely in love with this story and am thrilled to be writing again.

Same here. I haven't found a lot of stories, but I can get quite picky :/

Making Dorea Black a realistic character was quite a challenge. We knew that she wasn't deemed a traitor and blasted off the family tree by Walburga, so I couldn't make her act directly against her family. I can't have her be too... Mary Sue or Slytherin Ice Princessy. It took a while to flesh her out in my head and on paper.

But I digress - her relationship with Tom is cordial, sometimes quite friendly. I made her Head Girl who likes to "take care of" first years who don't seem to fit in - Tom finds her annoying, she finds him amusing. It's an interesting dynamic I would like to explore. I have only one year with the two of them, but he does appear after the time-skip.

However, she is going to be an Auror and fight against Grindelwald and naturally, the Death Eaters and not so little Riddle. We know that she dies in 1977, and I like to stick to canon as close as I can, so I'll make her death have an impact on some of the characters that we know are almost adults at that point, mainly James and Sirius.

  Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts ended in tragedy. Now, as he faces a world darkened by Voldemort's return, he must cling to those he loves more than ever. Struggling with his guilt, Harry resolves to work harder so that he can protect others from Cedric's fate. Follow a slightly sadder Harry through a different fifth year at Hogwarts as he deals with an evil pink-clad professor, a mysterious connection to Voldemort, and the very real trauma of his past.

** I haven't gotten enough written to start posting yet, but I have officially started writing a sequel to my first completed multi-chapter fic, Flutter. Flutter was focused on Ginny's trauma from the Diary, from when she lay dying in the Chamber to and going completely to the end of her second year (Prisoner of Azkaban). It's very, very lightly AU. It's also a complete story on it's own, so I wasn't sure if I'd ever write any more.

I've decided to bite the bullet and begin writing the rest of the story I had in mind for a world where Ginny is more harshly affected by the trauma of her first year. I've got roughly 4-5 chapters written and I plan on it being about 16-18 chapters. It will cover all of the Goblet of Fire, from Ginny's perspective (although much of the plot of GoF will happen in the background while Ginny focuses on her own stuff).

I'm excited to eventually finish and post it, but I'm also glad I finally committed to writing the sequel I had been toying with!

** I have been working on my Draco Malfoy meets a Dark Lord fic, it's a mix of humour and adventure. The premise is that Draco saw Harry talking to the snake in the zoo before first year started, and the blond boy thinks that Harry is a Dark Lord. It's not too long yet, but there's no canon rehash and I'd like to think that's it's fun to read. It's certainly fun to write. Would love to get more readers and reviews/anything. Thank you!

** Still writing the fourth year of my female Slytherin Harry series. 190k, five chapters left to write. I'm estimating another 4-5 weeks left on this fic, then I can finish outlining year five.

The chapter I wrote this past week was a follow-up on one of the main plots from year three. It doesn't quite fit the rest of year four plot wise, but I think it's important to include it because it's part of both Rachel (female Harry) and Severus' series long character arcs.

As of this week I've reached 500k words written for this series, which I can barely believe. Time goes so quickly. I started writing this series in the middle of July 2000 and I can't believe it's almost been ten months.

Year three is back from my beta and I've done a pass to include her edits, I'll finish posting year two this Saturday, and then do another full read over the next week to ensure that I haven't missed anything continuity wise.

Here's the link to the first fic in the series for anyone who is interested (it's also on ffn if you prefer to read there):

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

Working title: New Blood, New MagicExpected rating: Canon-esque levels of cursing, snogging, and violenceRelation to canon: Original Characters, canon compliant setting, but not epilogue compliant.

Working summary: It has been four months since the Battle of Hogwarts, and everything is looking up for a young 12-year-old Muggleborn just starting his first year of wizarding school. But rumor has it the strange runes appearing around the school might point to a treasure left by the Founders, and that the Astronomy Tower is closed for renovations. But rumor also has it that the school was cursed by You-Know-Who in his final moments, and if that's true, then the school's days are numbered. Either way, it's just another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

It is a dystopian AU, where the Prophecy didn't happen. Dumbledore didn't wait 30 years to bother wondering what Tom Riddle's story was, and with the help of an ambitious Unspeakable, after a horribly bloody civil war the Ministry managed to finish Voldemort.

His inability to feel love is ascribed responsibility for the war he waged, and the new Minister makes fundamental changes to reorder the society around making sure another Tom Riddle will never be born.

** I just submitted a [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/263467768-fortuity-writing-contest-entry][Pansmione]] one-shot for a writing contest that I don't absolutely hate. Post-War AU where Harry was publicly executed before he could 'come back to life' and win the battle of Hogwarts. It's kind of sad, because they have to come to terms with the end of their run, but what can I say? Angst writing is my favorite writing.

** After spending too much time reading fanfiction I decided to do something more active. So I tried to write one.

It's about 40k long now and before going any further I wanted to check if I was completely off my rocker here and needed to stop, or if it was a fun read.

Any feedback would be appreciated. Specially negative ones.

  Things went really wrong so Harry and Hermione try Dumbledore's last trick...Prologue : Slight AU where main pairing is Harry/Hermione. Diverges mostly from the seventh year. It mostly starts after that.Mid spoiler if you want a better summary : Hermione and Harry plan to go back in time to the marauder's Era to infiltrate the death eaters and mud in the bud the whole thing, but when Hermione arrives Harry is not there.Inspiration: Delenda Est, Debt of time, Methodes of Rationality... I'm targeting to make something untertaining, mostly adventure/mistery with a bit of romance.Hope it turns out interesting!

** Hate the Cursed Child?

Feel like it ruined the series for you? Wish it was more canon-compliant?

For the past couple of months, I've been working on a fix of the (in my opinion) horrible Cursed Child. I guess I just wanted to give these characters the sequel they deserve.

You can find it here:

[[https://href.li/?https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child]]

and here:

[[https://href.li/?https://archiveofourown.org/works/30081021/chapters/74086224][https://archiveofourown.org/works/30081021/chapters/74086224]]

I know some of you would rather just ignore it, which is perfectly fine. Some of you actually like it which is also fine (I would recommend checking this out anyhow if you feel like reading a nice mystery set in the WW).

This story is meant to provide an alternative for people who would like to know 'what happened after the story' and would rather not bother with the hot mess that is CC (again my opinion).

*General summary*: no Delphi, VERY canon-compliant, the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Reviews and suggestions are very welcome.

New chapter every other week or so. Check my Tumblr for updates: [[https://pvandermeer409.tumblr.com/][https://pvandermeer409.tumblr.com]]

** I've been working on a small post Hogwarts fic in which, for reasons, blaise zabini and harry meet by accident and decide to become friends. The fic is basically their conversations about trauma because of the war, the differences in their school life in hogwarts, their current lives and doubts about their future.

Tldr; blaise and harry having existential crisis at midnight + some fun interactions between the two.

** I'm working on two fics this week, both Harry/Daphne. One is a Hanahaki story (I Just Keep Coughing Up Flowers) and the other is my take on a marriage contract where Daphne broke it and suffered the consequences of having her magic sealed (I Think I've Seen This Film Before).

I wouldn't say I've gotten a block on the marriage one, more like I keep going back and forth on how much of Daphne's POV for the ‘present' (it's 2003) sections should be available now vs leaving next chapter in mostly Harry's POV still. Because on one hand I like the idea of her having some distance from the reader like there's distance between her and Harry, but on the other hand it might be a good idea to show more of her life/thoughts for her character. It's more of a question of now vs later.

  Less than a year after the battle of Hogwarts Draco Malfoy disappeared. 6 years later, Hermione finds him again in South London. But he's not the boy she remembers: Long hair and covered in tattoos, he appears to have developed a penchant for drugs and heavy metal music. And why on earth is he running a muggle bicycle shop?

** Been working my way through my current fic (Boy Who Lived) for some time now. I'm getting closer and closer to the end, but I'm almost dreading it. I started writing this one during lockdown last year and it was an outlet for my general depressed mood at the time. So now, even though I feel a lot better, every time I get down to writing a new chapter for this story, it has to be after I've put myself into a very specific state of mind. It's fun most of the time, but super draining too.

Anyway, if any of you are interested, it's on FFN: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13464146/1/The-Boy-Who-Lived]]

linkffn(13464146)

*Summary:* What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why. How will a young Harry Potter now cope?

No pairings and no romance, Harry is an average 11 y/o going through /a lot/ of tough situations, more so than in canon, in a much bloodier and more brutal wizarding world. Essentially it's a completely AU retelling of Harry's first year and summer after first year.

There is a mystery plot developed that kicks off in full swing in Chapter 5 and that will be resolved by the end of the story (currently 60+% written and posted).

** I've started planning for a fic in the format of a lab notebook, though I haven't posted any of it yet. The basic idea is that if magic is a real, physical thing, it'll show up in scientific experiments sometimes. And while maybe magical society could reach a nondisclosure agreement of some kind with muggle universities and tech firms, the democratization of knowledge and research means there are getting to be too damn many of us for them to reach everyone. Eventually, some biohacker or amateur chemist will find or create something magical, and the kneazle will exit the bag. So if this works, I'll be posting excerpts from the lab notebook of that biohacker, as he finds something magical and un-bags the kneazle.

** I'm writing a long hogwarts era fic, which will be drarry endgame. It's enemies to lovers (yum). Their relationship isn't really established until 5th / 6th year, but there are plentiful of interactions between Harry and Draco, even if Draco doesn't become central to the plot until 5th year.

The first book is called Harry Potter and the Age of Enlightenment. Major Canon divurgence from second year onwards. This year is shorter, as it sort of mostly follows the plot, but with lots of cute smol draco and Harry enemy interactions, more realistic relationships (including friendships) between characters etc. Nicolas flamel becomes central to the plot in fifth year, which has potential for a spinoff acting as a prequel.

Edit: Here's the link! First chapter, titled "His Mother's Child", is up.

** Posted three things this week, two femslash one shots and a new chapter of my main Dramione WIP!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30591920][*Finding Sunshine*]]: Each day is a little darker in St Mungo's for Astoria Greengrass, with the exception of daily visits from a bright healer. When Astoria wakes up with a strange tattoo, can she keep a lid on all her secrets? <- I loved writing this hurt/comfort soulmate Cho/Astoria one shot

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30053514][*Mismatched Blossoms*]]: Even though she's a professional at love, matchmaker Pansy Parkinson is struggling with an unrequited crush on her business partner, Lavender Brown. Content to let those feelings die on the vine, deliveries of mysterious flowers threaten to drive her mad. Can Pansy figure out who they're coming from while building the courage to confess to Lavender? <- my fav femslash pairing. If you like pining, romcoms, and flower language this is probably for you!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27417406/chapters/67015339][*What Do A Lion And A Wolf Share?*]]: Two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione Granger is called back from Australia by the Ministry for urgent news. Just when she feels like her blood doesn't define her in the wizarding world, Hermione is thrust into a new world based on blood status. Working with unlikely allies, can she navigate new societal challenges, better the wizarding world, make her friends all get along, and fix her parents? Dramione, enemies to lovers slow burn. <- just posted the new chapter tonight. This is my main fic, my bb. It was a huge chapter too, so a little anxious about the reaction!
