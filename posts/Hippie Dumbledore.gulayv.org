Dumbledore was very moved by the counter culture of the sixties and seventies. As such he became fierce advocate and proponent of psychedelics and pacifism. Dumbledore is most proud of his LSD Lemon Drops which he offers to unruly children to promote peace love and understanding as well as openmindedness. Only Luna Love good regularly accepts a lemon drop

Dumbledore is constantly pushing to turn Hogwarts into an Alternative School and dismantle the rigid structure to fierce backlash from the Board of Governor's.
