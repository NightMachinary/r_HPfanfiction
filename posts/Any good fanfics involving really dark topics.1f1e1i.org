For example, subjects involving abuse, mistreatment, etc? Basically, the mature subject matters.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper]] - probably the closest to your request from my replies. To quote description:

#+begin_quote

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] is pretty good.

"A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny."

*** This isn't the best of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1228238/DisobedienceWriter][DisobedienceWriter]]'s stories, but it does go further into dark than most.

** There was an extraordinarily dark but thrilling psychological piece called 'Sanitarium' out there, but the author took her stuff down. If you can find a copy, I'd say it's as mature without getting ridiculous as can be expected. The author also wrote an excellent post CoS story about Ginny recovering from Tom's possession in the Chamber, aided by Luna. That was called Glass Houses. Author was greensl33ves - if you can find them, do so, and let me know where.

And then there's some [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][stuff]] [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5073471/1/Spiral-Tangents][that]] [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ewordhammer][I]] [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6844334/1/The-Spiral-Path][write]]...

... but I can't say whether they're good, as my opinion is tainted.

** WIP but very dark...not abuse/mistreatment. More eldritch horror..

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]] The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** "The Rain in Spain" by Ishafel. A short one-shot about the Cruciatus curse. I don't want to spoil it. I think it works better read aloud. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ishafel/TRIS01a.html]]
