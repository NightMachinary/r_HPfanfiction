By this I don't mean where he becomes obviously evil but the author believes that Harry is still in the right, but one where the author clearly doesn't see Harry as the good guy anymore.

** What you're looking for sounds very rare. And when it does happen, the author usually either ends up writing themselves out of that hole or it was just a misdirect. I can think of plenty with that, maybe one or two where the reader shouldn't think he's the good guy, but none where the author doesn't see Harry a good guy.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is an obvious example. Apart from Harry, Hermione and Neville were also becoming increasingly brutal and ruthless as the conflict escalated.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
