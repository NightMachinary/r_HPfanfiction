** Where possible, do a find and replace? While I admit I have one where he goes by another name, it's not a variant of Harry, fits in the family's naming theme, and intended to hide him. Like Harrison Evans or James Black would actually pass scrutiny....

****** But right for the region and arguably the time! 'Harry' for girls is more common up to about the 1920s or so, but it was a known short form for Harriet in the UK, and still is. It's just barely anyone calls their kids Harriet.\\
'Harri', to this British person's eyes, seems like either a foreign name, or a made-up one for a fantasy book, but possibly it's the go-to for Americans, I don't know. 'Toni' for a girl is American or Italian, although possibly by now it's come over here. 'Harry' for a girl, on the other hand, while old-fashioned, is otherwise unremarkable.\\
'Bill' for 'Wilhelmina', along with the name 'Wilhelmina', seems to have disappeared entirely, but these were just things we did with women's names.

James *might*, if his parents had a say, but he himself has shown a disregard for pureblood traditions(from what we've seen). Also, James is not a Roman name, it's Christian. Anyway, it doesn't matter, since neither Hadrian nor Harrison make very much sense. Lily may name him Harrison, because it is a common name. Anyway, all evidence points to his name actually being Harry.

** I don't like either Harry or Henry as a name in the HP world context - Henry because the most famous Henry is the guy who kept chopping his wives' heads off (one of them for being a witch or whatever) and Harry because this series is the first time I heard of it being used as a full name. Both James and Lily are really old names that have similar versions in other cultures, but Harry is mostly a shortening of a bunch of other names, including the list of names you mentioned. Hadrian is not only present in multiple cultures, but it's also historic (Hadrian's wall as an example) and if you read up on Emperor Hadrian he's actually decent for a Roman emperor.

People have different points of views - I don't stop reading because of a name, but if I have to put down a full name for something (I don't like doing it more than once in a story and it only comes up in one of my stories) I won't use Harry or Henry. From your perspective it could seem like a pretentious thing writers do, which is fair. *shrug* People keep pointing out Prince Harry as a reason to not diss the name, but his actual full name is Prince Henry and I already said why I don't think magical parents would give that name to their child.

*** Henry was /really bloody common/ as a name in the UK. No idea right now, but I'll be amazed if it isn't in the top fifty. Harry is the short form of Henry. It's a British cultural thing. It's like objecting to John because of King John, or Richard because of Richard III. We don't think like that. Henry is a common name for boys, that's all.

Edit: in 2015 'Henry' was at number 15 on the list of most popular boys' names in the UK. So there's that.

****** Alright, if you really want to get into it. Lily as name /gained popularity/ in the 20th century, but it is older than that, both as a first name and a [[https://www.houseofnames.com/lily-family-crest][family name]].

"By the late 16th century, it was the #*1* name in England and it is during this century that we find Lily itself (most commonly spelled Lilly or Lillie) recorded as a given name in its own right --- perhaps bolstered by the surnames --- alongside Lilian and and the variant Lilias in Scotland." [[https://www.britishbabynames.com/blog/2018/05/name-of-the-week-lily.html][BritishBabyNames]]

Edit: Before that, due to Lily both being a name for the flower but also as a shortening of other names (Elizabeth, Lilith, Lilian, etc.) it's hard to determine how common it was as a first name.

** The only time I've ever seen this done well was a fic I read (can't remember what it's called) where parents had hard-to-guess private names for their children (such as Haraldr) for official documents because 'true' names like that could be used to enter people into magically binding contracts. They also had public nicknames like Harry for everyday use. I also remember in the fic that Harry just kept calling himself Harry, because to use his private contractually-binding name for everyday purposes would completely invalidate its benefit.

** If this is a genuine problem that you feel exclude a lot of fics you genuinely want to read, desensitize yourself by forcing yourself to read fics which portray it. You'll get over it and be able to properly read fics that do it afterwards. Personally, I don't think there is that many fics that do this enough to the point where having it be a dealbreaker is a real problem.

A year ago-ish, a certain pairing affected me so badly that I was unable to read fics portraying it, even as a background pairing. Had this been something like Tomarry, fine, who cares. But due to the pairing's popularity killing off fics that seemed genuinely interesting, I forced myself to deal with it to the point where it no longer became a dealbreaker. I still don't read fics which has it as a focus, but I no longer shy away from the mere mention of it like I do with, say, mpreg.

Nowdays, only mpreg, bad spelling and romance-based soulmate fics are dealbreakers for me -- but those are rare enough to ultimately not matter, it doesn't kill off any interesting fics for me.

** Those that change it for the sake of changing annoys me. But those that do change because of plot are good in my book. In any case it's Harrison that annoys me since it's not significantly meaningful.

I've read good fics that use Haraldr or equally old gemanic name when in relation to Nordic myth. Named after a Nordic king. Either used as a true name to prevent being bound by magic (see fae folklore, xxxholic or even spirited away where no one gives true names to beings of power as a reference of good story telling where name is power). But few fanfic goes this route. The 90% is sh*t

Following on the topic names have power.

Herewald is ruler of armies, a knightly king. Haraldr( and it's variants) in Germanic is also ruler of armies but it's more a conquestor. This both names of Harry is militaristic oriented. Henri means ruler of home, thus giving a protector characteristics instead of a conquestor. Hadrian means the Dark or son of Adrian or from the Roman emperor. The name becomes the individual. Which is often used by "dark Harry trope" or the "Slytherin Harry". Son of Adrian version is basically, son of water, making Harry flexible fluid but you cannot contain this can also fit, "ravenclaw harry" or"my own side of war trope"

Meanwhile, Harry is a diminutive form of a name, thus the person is a lesser form of a ruler. Perfectly fit for a "I'm just Harry trope" which fit the story... Harry James Potter is always seen as just the son of James or the son of potters with relation to others. Even though it changes later on. The name becomes him. Harry is just the boy who live.

Like Tom marvolo riddle means twins he was cursed to be lonely, brilliant but unreadable/double meaning. Remus lupin is werewolf of wolf. Sirius black is a black dog.

So if it's Demigods, blessed or related to the fairfolk then out landish name is fine. Rumplestilskin is weird but a fae name. But otherwise, stick to the original.

Another uses it for a better arithmancy out come. Or is it a branch of divination.

What annoys me is if the female version of names that has no bearing and is a generic name. At least have the decency to use flower names or Harry variants or make the name meaningful.
