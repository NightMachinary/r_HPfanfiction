I have food poisoning right now and this was inspired by a Tumblr post I read while hugging my porcelain throne and waiting to die... TMI sorry.

When Hagrid takes Harry to diagon alley the first time he actually takes him into the pet store to find his pet.. Hagrid shows Harry literally every pet in the store, and then Harry hears a little voice saying something along the lines of "typical, missed me again" and Harry ends up finding a ball python (whatever morph you want) in a little tiny, much too small cage under a table. It's skinny and cold and has nothing to do. No heat, no hide, no substrate, no water dish, etc. Basically like Harry before he found out he was a wizard, so he wants to save it too.

Hagrid thinks it's a very Slytherin pet, and that Harry should get an owl, cause they're so useful.

Harry gets the ball python anyways, brings it to school, puts it in a proper terrarium, gets Hermione to do a heating spell on one side, goes out and finds hides and plants and such for it, whatever it as for really, and baby rats from Hagrid....

Just don't name the snake Hedwig.. And maybe make it a boy or something.

Bonus points for a Long fic.. bonus points for snake research in the library and with Hagrid, bonus points if it eventually eats scabbers... Maybe at the beginning of third year. Then they can find out after and Hermione and Ron can finally like the snake as much as Harry does.

Bonus points if Harry takes or to class in his robe pockets when it's a baby.

Bonus points if Harry wears the snake around his neck around school occasionally when it's bigger and people call him Slytherin and he ends up secretly making friends with Malfoy because he doesn't care that he had Slytherin traits, he even tells people that he was considered for Slytherin, and he has no problem with it.

No pairing necessary.. But I'd be cool with Harry/Malfoy Harry/Neville Harry/Hermione Harry/Fred/George Ron/Hermione Hermione/Fred/George or really any pairing you want... I'll still read it.

I dunno, expand on the idea as much as you please, I just need this in my life, and I love longish fics anyways (although I'll be happy to get anything), so the more the merrier.

Forgive the lack of proper punctuation etc.... Not feeling good at all.


** I recall reading a wrong-Boy-Who-Lived fic with a pet snake (not a ball python).

**** I mentioned the story rather than trying to find it because it doesn't really match OP's parameters beyond 'Harry has a pet snake'. However, it is one of the better known works with that premise.

** I've written a oneshot where Sirius is a snake animagus and Harry carries him around.

  Instead of a grim, Sirius Black had a different Animagus form, one that Harry adopted as his new pet. The result of a Reddit prompt.
