I'm searching for good heavy AU stories. And by "Heavy", I don't mean fem!Harry, or Slytherin!Harry, or TBHL!Neville or something like that.

I mean things like:

- the action takes place in the year 5000 in a colony on a different planet

- Earth has floating islands and flying whales

- every wizard is a wizard because their parents had sex with an angel or a demon, and it shows

- there's no SoS, and everything in the world is magitech


** 3 somewhat. Silent and Cursed are ridiculous. linkffn(2686394)

The Star Empire fits #1. Totally is out there, but one of my favorite AU's. A few thousand years in the future Harry wakes up and becomes a spaceship pirate amongst other things. A great read. [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8637910/1]]

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): no magic, no Voldemort, Harry and Hermione are Americans, and [[/spoiler][Lily Potter is the President of the United States!]]. This fic is also a wonderful Harry/Ginny romance.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in another non-magic AU, but the story generally follows canon stations, so that may not meet your criteria.

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is sufficiently 'Total AU':

- Muggle world never developed nukes
- Harry never went to Hogwarts
- James and Lily survived
- SoS collapse in 2009
- World at war after that

***** I second this. While this is an oversimplification, people love Harry Potter (and other fantasy/sci-fi stories) for a combination of 3 reasons: the characters, the plot, and the world building. Personally, while I clearly loved the actual story and thought the world JKR created was amazing, my true connection to the series and why I read fanfiction is because of the characters. So while I generally enjoy character-driven fics that take place within the canon universe, I can easily a total AU fic so long as the characters remain true to their book personas.

** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent)

Salazar Slytherin is the immortal ruler of the magical world and basically has controlled how the society is set up. Hermione and Harry both want to change it for their reasons. There's also sort of an endless civil war between Salazar's empire and Grindelwald's forces (with Dumbledore causing both of them trouble).

I'm sad because it'll likely never finish, but the world building is amazing and there's like 200k words that are all pretty well written.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

That's really part of what's so terrible about the curse: if not properly contained, the werewolf would /remember/ viciously killing innocents, or even their own family, when they wake up in the morning.

And Muggle werewolves are very unusual, because usually Muggles don't survive a werewolf attack (wounds inflicted by werewolves can only be healed with magic).

But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

**** Its honestly a must read. There are definitely issues with the universe don't get me wrong. But Darth Marrs really created something special, while still holding to what makes it feel like Harry Potter. The third book is where he kind of wrote himself into a corner and it shows but the universe he created is thought provoking. Well worth your time, at least the first two installments.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.
