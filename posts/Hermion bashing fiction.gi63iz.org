Some suggestions with Hermione bashing fanfics? And stupid mods, stop deleting my posts. I get it you're obssessed with her, but not everybody is like this.


** Your posts have not been removed for "bashing Hermione"; they have been removed for the insults used inside of said posts.

Calling the mods stupid is not conducive to your posts staying up. Watch it.

** a) Insulting the mods sounds like a dumb idea, particularly since posts asking for Hermione bashing fics have been posted in the past with no issue.

b) Your previous post was mis-flaired ('Recommendation' = you recommending a fic, 'Request' = you asking for a fic)

c) Your previous post was really bad - using 'Nigerian' as an insult is just pathetic, for one. If I were a mod here, I'd definitely have deleted that post.

Just take a look through [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=Hermione+bashing+flair%3ARequest+&restrict_sr=on][this search]] and you should find some previous recommendations towards bashing Hermione. I'd recommending doing a search in the future first, and to take a moment before submitting a thread to make sure that you've written appropriately.

As another aside, insulting a character too strongly (Hermione or otherwise) will be received worse. For instance, asking for fics bashing character X will be received fine if it's asked neutrally - but worse if it's super aggressive. "Any suggestions for bashing Hermione fics?" will be upvoted. "Any suggestions for bashing that buck-toothed, troll-faced, fuzzy-haired bitch?" will be downvoted. Your previous post was worded along the lines of the latter - what do you expect to happen?

  Hey fat fuck. I read your reply. You are so fucking retarded you should just get a 5 star vacation to Auschwitz. The world doesn't need you. Calling me a troll and then asking the mods to remove the thread? You are such a pussy."

You ever thought about getting professional help and not just sending PMs like that because people around here don't appreciate blatant racism and misogyny by starting threads like:

#+begin_quote
  "but I imagine that whoever bashes Bucktooth Granger will also bash the weasel family and the all-mighty old vision impaired nigerian calling himself the hogmaster of Hogwarts."
#+end_quote

and

  "Oh, and for the cunts who downvoted my every comment, just because you have a fetish for bossy things and want to have sex with buck-toothed things, that does not mean you get to downvote like a petulant child. Just go fap or something."

** Not a fan of bashing in general but there's always this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/HJG-The-Smartest-Witch-of-Her-Age]]. Also they might be deleting it because of incorrect flairs. I think the correct one is request in this case.

** I can personally relate to your frustration. Hermione as a character is nice, but all ff writers make her act like an absolute goddess. I believe in all the very many ff's I read, I've only read about three to four with Hermione bashing...

I'd recommend reading *Golden Bullets* by /CescaLR/ on Ao3. It's the best-written book out there and the author has emphasised many of her flaws that others just choose to either ignore or downplay.

** Here's my recommendations:

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]), along with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]). And these communities on FFN have some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Hermione-Bashing/123454/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/]]) has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to her about her long essays.

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. Its more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) 6th year fic. Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]) Hermione gets dressed down during a job interview.

(SELF PROMO): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]) More Hermione-critical than outright bashing. AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike.

  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not. But with years of advantage over his peers even he can become something more than a tired Auror with a wife that hates him. Amoral!Sly!Ron.
