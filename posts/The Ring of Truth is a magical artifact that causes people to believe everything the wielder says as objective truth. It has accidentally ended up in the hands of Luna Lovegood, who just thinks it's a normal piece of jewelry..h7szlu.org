** "The nargle infestation has increased in you, Harry" Luna said in a soft, aloof voice in greeting, such that only Harry could hear it.

Harry was about to laugh in a pleasant way. Luna's out of the blue statements always managed to lift his spirits, and Luna was probably the only one who could make him smile after Sirius' death.

But shockingly, he found himself getting... /scared?!/ He had been infested with nargles! Of course, he would be scared! Oh no! Luna had said it had increased! This was bad! He had to see a healer! Shocking everyone else in the compartment (except Luna), Harry got up, stepped out of the compartment and ran down the isle towards the on board healer.

"What was that all about?" Ron finally asked.

"Dunno... He just got up and ran!" Hermione said.

"Do you think Sirius' death is affecting him badly?" Ginny asked in a low voice and the compartment fell silent.

"Harry has gone in search of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack" Luna said

There was silence yet again.

"Of course, he has! Where else would he be?" Neville said.

"But Crumple-Horned Snorkacks don't exist!" Hermione whined.

"So what? Harry has gone in search of them even though they don't exist!" Ginny said.

"Reckon Harry's finally gone bonkers?" Ron asked.

"RONALD!" Hermione admonished him.

"Crumple-Horned Snorkacks exist." Luna said, preventing any other squabbles.

This time, the silence lasted only a mere second.

"Of course they exist! How could we be so stupid! But what do they look like? What do they eat? What Magical properties do they have? Are they - " Hermione stated shooting off but Neville cut her off.

"Deep breaths Hermione, deep breaths" he said, patting her back.

"What do we do now? Harry has gone in search of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. They could be dangerous, for all we know!" Ginny said.

"They aren't dangerous. They are cute." Luna said dreamily. Her eyes were glassy and staring off into nothing.

"Yeah, they are sooo cute!" Ginny said with a fond smile.

"Why would Harry want to search for cute, Crumple-Horned, Snorkacks?" Ron asked.

"Do you think he wants one as a pet?" Neville asked.

"Of course not! He has Hedwig, why would he want another?"

"Because Hedwig is the owl ambassador sent to live with Harry to improve bird-human relations." Luna said.

It took a moment for it to sink in.

"How did we not know that all this while! Of course the birds would send their ambassador to the boy-who-lived!" Hermione said

Just then, Hedwig, who had been flying swooped in through the open window and made herself comfortable in her cage. Just as she was about to cover herself with her wings and go to sleep, she noticed a strange sight.

All the humans in the compartment were looking at her as if they were only clearly seeing her for the first time.

"A good afternoon to you, ma'am" the bushy haired human addressed her. Hedwig lifted her head and regarded her with curiosity. She bobbed her head once, not knowing what else to do. Why were these humans acting strangely?

"Is there anything we could do to make your stay comfortable, My Lady?" Neville asked with a slight bow.

Hedwig was confused, but she was enjoying all the attention being heaped on her. She tilted her head towards her empty food tray.

The humans seemed to have understood, as they bustled about trying to find Owl treats. Finally, the red head human girl stepped out of the compartment and came back in a few minutes later with something in her hand.

"Nicked it off Malfoy." She said proudly and tipped its contents into Hedwig's food tray.

Hedwig bent down and put two or three treats into her mouth as if just having a taste. Her wide eyes widened, and she fought the urge to do a victory fly-around. Such behaviour was unbecoming of an owl of her station.

The owl treats which the young girl human had gotten her were the most premium available on the market. She had tasted it only once before, when an eagle owl had dropped one in the owl tower. Now, she had an entire tray, all to herself! She was in paradise. Not forgetting her manners, she gave two bobs of her head towards the humans in gratitude.

The members of the compartment finally settled down, pleased that they had perfectly accommodated the bird ambassador.

"Do you think Voldemort knows about the human-bird relations?" Neville

"I don't think so. I mean, even Dumbledore didn't know about it. He would have told Harry otherwise, wouldn't he?" Hermione said.

Just then, Harry stepped into the compartment, looking angry.

"Did you find cute, Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, Harry?" Ron asked.

"Cute what? No! I went to the healer to get my nargle infestation checked! And do you know what she said! She said that nargles don't exist, and that my pranks won't work on her! I need to get checked soon" he said with a sigh.

"But Nargles /don't/ exist Harry!" Hermione protested and the others nodded.

"Oh! But they do! And Harry, it seems all that anger has driven them away" Luna said with a smile.

The entire compartment heaved a breath of relief.

"So what have you guys been up to?" Harry asked.

"Nothing much. We served the bird ambassador some owl treats" Ginny said.

"Bird ambassador?" Harry asked confusedly.

"Yeah. Hedwig is actually the bird ambassador." Ron said.

"What!? What is going on here!? Are you guys having me on or something?"

"No Harry. I know it sounds hard to believe, but Hedwig is the bird ambassador sent to improve human-bird relations" Hermione said as if explaining a simple thing to a child.

"Are you serious?" Harry asked incredulously.

"No, she's Sirius" Luna said.

I may continue this later, but I'm short on time currently.

*** A sudden jolt of shock and confusion ran through the compartment. Ginny and Neville looked scared. Harry and Ron seemed hopeful.

But Hermione just nodded quietly.

"My full name is actually Hermione Jean Sirius Granger. My dad's best mate growing up was named Sirius and I would've been named that if I were a boy."

The tension in the compartment rapidly ebbed away.

"Anyway, what's this about Hedwig being an ambassador?"

"Honestly, Harry, how have you lived with Hedwig for the last four years without realizing her position? Really, you should be calling her Madam Ambassador or Madam Hedwig," Hermione chided him.

Harry's eyes roved across the compartment. Four sets of totally sincere eyes met his. One set of eyes - Luna's - remained focused on her copy of last week's Quibbler.

He exhaled slowly and sat back down next to Ron, deciding not to make anything of the issue.

"So, er, Luna," Harry began a moment later. "I'm still a bit worried about that Nargle infestation. Is anger the only thing that repels them? I wouldn't want to have to spend all year a little angry just to ward them off."

Ron snorted a quiet laugh. "Yeah, can you imagine, mate? Spending your entire fifth year all moody and angry? That would be intolerable!"

"Oh no," came Luna's calm reply. "There are any number of acceptable means of ensuring a Nargle-free life. You can use a necklace," here she indicated her butterbeer-cork neckwear, "or get tiny sprigs of mistletoe and keep them in your pants."

Her declaration was met with a moment of silence.

"I believe you, of course," Hermione started slowly. "But why mistletoe?"

"Normally mistletoe is infested with Nargles," Luna informed them. "But it's a basic property of sympathetic magic that you can repel something by using a very tiny amount of what normally attracts them."

"That sounds like Muggle homeopathy," Hermione couldn't keep the skepticism out of her voice. "And that's just a bunch of nonsense. How can that be when Luna is right about the mistletoe?"

"Must be heliopath interference in the Muggle world," Luna nodded to herself, clearly satisfied with her solution to Hermione's confusion.

Ginny suddenly perked up, "Hey Harry, what normally attracts Malfoy?"

"Money?" Neville ventured.

"Muggleborns to mock?" asked Hermione.

"Nah, it's obviously Harry. Malfoy's drawn to him like a glittermoth to a light."

Harry looked at Ginny, a wide smile appearing as he suddenly realized where Ginny was going with this.

"How about a single hair?" he asked her.

"Good idea!" Ginny answered.

Harry quickly leaned over, presenting his mop of dark curls to Ginny. With a pinch and a swift yank, she pulled one of his hairs from his head. A moment later, she exited the compartment and used a sticking charm to affix Harry's hair to the outside of the compartment door. She re-entered the compartment with a triumphant air and plopped back down on the seat.

Luna blinked up from reading, glancing around. "Good thinking Ginny. Now we just have to hope Malfoy isn't secretly a member of the Rotfang Conspiracy."

Ginny gasped. Ron paled (an impressive sight on his already-pasty complexion). Harry cocked his head slightly.

"Oh no!" shrieked Hermione. "Err... what's the Rotfang Conspiracy?"

"It's a secret group of Aurors and other high-ranking Ministry officials," Luna explained. "They're working to bring down the ministry from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease."

"Harry! They're certainly working with Voldemort, now that he's back! We have to do something!" Hermione insisted.

Everyone in the compartment looked around with a frantic energy. They all seemed to simultaneously realize they were stuck on a moving train and could take no immediate action to offset the evil deeds of the Rotfangs.

"Uh, Luna? Should we do anything about the Rotfang Conspiracy once we arrive at Hogwarts?" Harry ventured.

"Oh no," she replied happily. "The smaller giant squid and Hagrid already do quite a neat job repelling them. We've no worries on that front."

"Smaller?" Neville asked, his voice weak and breathy.

"Certainly! After all, the Black Lake has a full seven-member colony of giant squids. Harry surely must've seen them when he was busy rescuing Ron last year."

Harry furrowed his eyebrows slightly. "You know, I think I did, at that. I thought it was all seaweed and grindylows and merpeople, but I did see some shapes I didn't recognize. Er, in the distance, that is."

Neville looked as if he were about to faint.

The moment was interrupted when Malfoy's voice carried down the central aisle of the train car, through their door. The noise was muffled enough that they couldn't make out his exact words, but they all clearly recognized his pinched, arrogant tone. His voice approached.

Of course, everyone in their compartment was well aware of Luna's unfailing truth-telling. They were absolutely certain that her statements about sympathetic magic were completely correct. Even Hermione, who had never even before heard of sympathetic magic in all her long hours of research in the Hogwart's library, was certain it would work. Yet there was, nonetheless, the slightest bit of tension.

Well, in everyone but Luna.

For a long moment, they held their collective breaths as Malfoy's indistinct voice came through their door. He was standing right outside the compartment. A moment later they heard him knock on the door across the way. Some words were exchanged. Several very long seconds later, Malfoy said something to his ever-present bully sidekicks before moving down the hallway, ignoring their compartment entirely.

None of them would later admit to having the slightest doubt. But there was something of a collective breath released as Malfoy moved on, successfully repelled by a single hair on Harry's head.

Luna hummed happily to herself, kicking her feet slightly, now reading The Quibbler's "Home Remedies" section with the paper held sideways.

**** Yeah, but if Luna says to Fudge, "Minister, what are your plans as the leader of the Ministry-lead Rotfang Conspiracy? Are you planning to use your new Heliopaths to further your goal of rotting everyone's teeth?", then Fudge and a bunch of the Ministry now believe they are part of a conspiracy to rot teeth, and that they have new Heliopaths to help them do so. So they'll act to that because they'll believe that's the truth about themselves.
