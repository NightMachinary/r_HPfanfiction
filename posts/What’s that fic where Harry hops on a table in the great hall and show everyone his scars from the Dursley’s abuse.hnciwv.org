*** It was under the pretense of him having eidetic memory and knowing that the adults there were the cause of his suffering at the Dursleys, so he was mad. But then Voldemort possessing Quirrell also was fucking with his Horcrux by proximity, so he had a serious headache or something. I'm not justifying it, that scene, like the rest of the book, was fucking garbage.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
