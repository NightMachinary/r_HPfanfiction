So going into Deathly Hallows I expected Snape to be good and the Snape/Lily thing was kind of obvious to everyone. Still brilliantly written by JKR though and I enjoyed it fondly.

That being said, in the back of my head, I always wondered in some parallel universe what it would have been like if Snape actually was the main antagonist at the end [a double reversal twist.] So in other words, Snape only helps Harry throughout Deathly Hallows to get rid of Voldemort, and redeems himself, but then does another reversal and after Voldemort is dead and gone in the last chapters Snape goes hypervillain and becomes the final boss after Voldemort is gone. So Snape was grey and out for himself all along, but was only waiting for the opportune moment to strike. It would have been so cool if Snape had helped Harry finish Voldemort off for this part.

So in other words, Snape plays his cards to help Dumbledore and Harry's quest throughout the series only because he sees Voldemort as the only threat to him taking over, and then becomes evil at the very end after he redeems himself to Harry and the Order after Voldemort is dead. This would have been so interesting to me. I can only imagine it some parallel universe somewhere lol.

Really? While we know they had /some/ form of interaction (Snape's Worst Memory), we had absolutely no idea what form this interaction had -- past lovers, friends, rivals (like Harry-Draco) or something else. I do remember reading an oneshot that nailed his motivations and rough chain of events that was written before HBP was even released, which I found really interesting, but that was /one/ fic. There's also couple of pre-DH Snily fics, but I think those were mostly a result of "the author didn't have any other choice of known female company that went to school the same years as Severus" and his Potter-complaints being suspiciously lacking in allusions to Lily.

I remember reading a fic where canon-Harry inadvertly stumbles upon an AU where Snape wasn't the bad guy in the "final boss" sense, but was definitely evil. Neville was the BWL, and Snape had arranged to poison James to death (very horrifically, no less), marries Lily and has a kid with her and also intended to do the same with Harry but is thwarted. But it wasn't obvious from the getgo, but rather a plot twist -- he seems to be your typical redeemed!Snape at first (retaining snarkiness+etc, but overall a good guy). He doesn't mistreat Lily or their child -- he genuinely loved her and it was obvious in the aftermath when he is arrested that Lily couldn't just "stop" loving him in spite of everything -- but his actions otherwise were so horrific that he was pretty much a psychopath.

However, I don't remember the fic title. Sorry.

*** Well, it was a common fan theory since PoA. It only picked up in popularity during Snape's Worst Memory in OotP. A lot of people guessed it. That being said, that's no detractment on JKR. A good plot twist is one that is foreshadowed and the clues were set.

** I'm gonna borrow this idea for my fic when I eventually decide to continue writing it. Snape is easily in my top five of most hated fanon characters, and this might be just what I need to start liking him in my headcanon.
