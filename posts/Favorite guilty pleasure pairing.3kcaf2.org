  They say there are many things a wizard shouldn't do while ridiculously drunk; flying, apparition, and testing unknown spells just to name a few. But as the BWL just learned, listening to one of your equally as drunk godfather's 'brilliant ideas' is another one of the things you just shouldn't do.

***** I have to mention a recent fic I came across - it is one of the best Snarry stories I have EVER come across. Ever.

Sticks to canon but with major tweaking on the side lines due to one of the best uses of time-travel I've ever read. Excellent character development, slow building relationship and wonderful characterization and building of Snape. Very funny especially early on, but gets darker and more intense as the time in the story passes. I highly recommend - it is a one-shot but very long and spellbinding. Added it to my uh, Snarry collection. Lol.

There is an ongoing one I'm reading, has Snarry...but a very realistic and painful take on what would have happened if /they'd/ happened while at Hogwarts. What makes it interesting is that it is from Lupin's side as he's having his own personal problems with Tonks. Features varying amounts of horror from the Order of the Phoenix as well. If you're interested, I can link it. (And the author also writes some seriously excellent Harry/Hermione).
