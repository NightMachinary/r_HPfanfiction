Hi, I've asked this on a few other sites and have mostly come up blank. I am trying to find if there is any fanfic where Hermione goes back for her 7th year instead of horcrux hungting but has to deal with Snape being headmaster and the Carrows as teachers? I've seen many a trope with her in 7th year with Mcgonagall as headmaster but never Snape. I know she's a well known muggle-born but I think it could still be done.


** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: all three of them went back, the reason they could afford to do that was because [[/spoiler][they killed more than 60 Riddle minions between Dumbledore's death and start of the new school term, so that Riddle ran into serious personnel and logistic problems]]

[[/spoiler][They also held meetings with their followers at school and settled on using Harry as the bait and planned on using Hogwarts as the battleground.]]

[[/spoiler][Because Riddle's control over the Ministry was shaky due to personnel shortages, he made his first move against the Trio only after a few months.]]

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]]: Hermione was hiding in RoR and directing the uprising against the Carrows from there. Harry never went to Hogwarts in that fic.
