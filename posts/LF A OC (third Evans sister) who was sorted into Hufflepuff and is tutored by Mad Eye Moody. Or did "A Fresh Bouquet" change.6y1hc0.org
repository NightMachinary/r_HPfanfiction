Did the author replace the original fanfic in an update, gutting the entire backstory of a spunky female OC and jumping straight into a OC/Regulus Black romance?

Unless it's not "A Fresh Bouquet" and I'm simply misremembering the title.

  Reborn into the world of Harry Potter, Poppy Evans has only one goal; make sure she's not the only magical Evans alive by 1982. And maybe save that smug Potter while she's at it. Regulus Black didn't fit into the equation; he wasn't suppose to be so distracting.

** Huh, I have an old version of the story in calibre, and while I haven't read it or the new one, it does have a different start and I get quite a lot of hits when I search for 'Moody' in the old one.

Tsume Yuki does change and delete a lot of her stuff, so that's probably what happened.

  When I was reborn into the Harry Potter world, I'd have gladly have continued life as a muggle, as I was born into a flowery family that would see one sister dead and another estranged. So when it became apparent I would be attending Hogwarts, I was not going to do so quietly. A SI fic.

Is the old summary.

*** Thanks! It's been annoying me; I was positive it was "A Fresh Bouquet." Damn shame, though. I quite liked the old one.

Link will run out in 30 days. It says.. Never used that file share service before, but it was the first google result, so it's probably fine? idk.

You'd have to convert it if you don't have a kindle/kindle app, but have fun. :)

** Yes, Tsume changes her plot sometimes and is always jumping to a new fanfic without finishing others... It's a bit annoying as a reader, but her imagination is quite far-reaching. I'm actually surprised by how long and how much she has updated "Tell it to the Marines" but unfortunate it's a One Piece story.

*** Thanks. Unfortunate that she deletes the old instead of posting a revised one. I was so excited when I saw it'd been updated, only to find a changeling in its place.
