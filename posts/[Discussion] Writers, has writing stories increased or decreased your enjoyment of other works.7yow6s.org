Personally, I've become more sensitive to poor grammar and poor characterisation, though with certain works I'm all the more impressed by the stories that others have told.


** In some ways, both. My position is very similar to yours, though.

I've always hated bad grammar and spelling, particularly relating to items from the books - /Luscious/ Malfoy, anyone? - but I've definitely started to hate more and more tropes in stories after working on my own (which I tried to avoid - although likely missed a fair few - using tropes in) to the point that stories involving stuff like the lordship trope, nice Goblins, politics, almost /any/ Slytherin characterisation I've seen in the last few months, just immediately switch me off to a story.

On the opposite side, I feel like (having had difficulty with writing some characters and word usage in certain scenes) that I'm appreciating well-written stuff a lot more. Authors who not only have a broad vocabulary but actually use that vocabulary correctly in their work stand out way more to me than they used to.

Also, I suppose I sympathise more with how difficult it can be to write consistently time-release-wise, as I've let more than a few posting deadlines slip due to RL stuff to the point I've just abandoned a regular schedule, as I no longer feel it works for me.

What Slytherin characterisations do you mean? And what would you /like/ to see as Slytherin characterisation?

**** I dunno, I guess I am sick to death of: anything to do with (poorly thought-out) politics, at all. Anything to do with betrothals, at all. Any Ice Queen shit. Any "Slytherins" are all actually smart and misunderstood (but when it's played off that blood is actually important and thusly validates all the racism). Any mention of an internal pecking order or hierarchy, or "house unity because everyone is against us" or special "Slytherins settle their disagreements in the common room" or weird nobility garbage that has no real grounding in actual court politics or aristocracy, and wouldn't even exist anyway at Hogwarts because /they're all children/.

I guess I either like Slytherins all being unrepentant arseholes (as that seems to be happening less and less these days and can be fun for entertainment value) - either as full on blood purist maniacs, softer blood purists who show little more than disdain and disrespect to non purebloods, or just some particularly douchey/unpleasant/maladjusted kids.

Or, I dunno, maybe I'd more like to see them written as /normal/ children, if at all. I draw more enjoyment from reading plain, interestingly-written normal kids than I do any special characters. Normal people are just more interesting to me than individuals defined by one thing or character trait. They can be witty sometimes, sad or hurtful others, brave, cunning, loyal or studious, just like any other normal person. Because they're in a house should not mean that (if the story is serious) they embody a single trait over others.

I mean, did Draco Malfoy ever really display so much as a cunning thought? I don't really think he did.

I'm sick of Slytherin being this hive of fucking edgy garbage, as if they're all special or more special than anyone else. God damn, at least people should write more Hufflepuff stories. If all the houses are gonna be /super unique!1!!11/ then I would be impressed if authors did more with the 'Puffs.

***** Thank you for this in-depth answer! ...So... I'm mostly in the clear as far as my own story is concerned, but I don't enter into either of your "would like to see" categories either, oddly enough. The idea wasn't entirely mine, but (do mark that this is a light-hearted story) I portrayed Slytherins as a /fun/ sort of schemers --- the sort the Marauders could well have been if they hadn't also been brave do-gooders. These Slytherins intentionally cultivate their "evil" image by dressing in black and trading meaningless rings and things, and they come up with weird plots at the drop of a hat, few of which they ever even bother to act upon. They're basically an extension of how I see some of the things the Slytherins do in canon --- like when they dressed up as Dementors to scare Harry. That wasn't "cunning" or "noble", it was /goofy as hell/, and that's the approach I've taken.

****** Regardless of whether I'd get invested in such a portrayal, you're in the clear in my book because you've done something fun with the concept that's not the same tired cut-and-paste tropes that proliferate so many popular stories these days.

***** It's not too far from canon really. In canon, they were all (Slytherin) racist, evil beings that knew no love.

So any actual characterization is welcome by me.

** Decreased. :( I won't read stories that have bashing or other random illogical character actions in it. I want characters that are like real people, not cutouts or exaggerations or things that just make no sense at all.

** Bit of both, really. I see the seams in most things now. I put a book down and go, ‘second time foreshadowing same element, it'll be pivotal in the climax' or ‘and that's the end of Act 1' and that difficulty turning off the technical analysis takes me out of the flow of the story quite a bit. But I've come to more greatly appreciate the artistry of novelists who have enough skill to keep me distracted from how they make the magic happen.

** Both.

But I can forgive a lack of polish /as long as the story is engaging/. I'm measuring a fic against other fics, not fic against published works. If it hooks me, I'm in.

Sometimes I end up pleasantly surprised, though.

... except when it comes to romance fics. I literally write romance stories for a living, so the slightest mistake puts me off. It's better for me to just avoid reading them.

** I grew annoyed by the same three plots you see all the time (Manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, good Dumbledore and Happy Weasley family, canon rehash) and can't stand them anymore. I think that this reflects in my writing since I try to subvert the common tropes. For example, Harry being dosed with love potions because someone wants to create discord amongst the trio, Andromeda getting the Black seat in the Wizengamot, Dumbledore staying true to his hands off/observe style of operations, Daphne working for Voldemort out of personal gain, just to name a few.

Coming up with creative approaches for problems is not difficult and if the plot becomes interchangeable with countless other stories, I'll drop the story. The "common" tropes just feel like the author is not even trying or is simply farming favs/reviews.

*** Yes that is exactly how I feel about bashing and illogical character actions and stuff! It doesn't seem that hard to me to just make actual CHARACTERS act like real people instead of weird cartoons or cutouts or just things for the author to twist no matter what makes sense. I don't understand why story writers actively decide to do this with their characters either. Why DECIDE to bash? Why DECIDE for a character to just randomly out of nowhere become an evil jerk?

** I have definitely started to look more critically at other author's work, which decreases my enjoyment of some. But on the other side I now appreciate creative plotlines and writing more, so it also increased for some.

In some other way I also became a lot more lenient with many mistakes. Typos, the occasional fucked up sentence,... You know, stuff that's often found by editors. I got really hung up on those before I wrote my own fics, but now I understand /how/ these things can just slip past you. Theres still a limit to how much I can take of that, and universe specific words are still 100% off-limit to get wrong, but again, I've become more lenient with it overall.

What I became hyper-aware of is out-of-character actions. I absolutely began to hate stories where there are scenes in which characters turn 180° because the author didn't have the foresight to plan the plot accordingly. It's preventable by a minimum amnount of planning and just shouldn't happen, period. I probably became so aware of it because it's what ended my own fics in a way. I ended up at crossroads where I realized I'd have to make my characters go through a tremendous development to get them to the point I want and just didn't have the muse to write that.
