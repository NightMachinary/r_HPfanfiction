I'm trying to 'fix' a lot of things that annoyed me about the series in my current fic but this is one that I just can't get my head around. While I very much like both characters separately, I find the age difference (14 years or there abouts) just a bit icky. Especially since no one (that I recall) really comments on it. The same with Bill and Fleur, even though the difference was much less with them. It just sits uneasily with me that it was so readily accepted.

I have two questions: What do you all think about it? And can you recommend any fics where the age difference of Lupin and Tonks is properly considered.


** Gotchu fam. Just make it so Remus and Tonks get together one year after when they get married in canon, she's now 26 he's 38, making it universally acceptable according to the master rule (divide by two add seven).

EDIT: Same for Bill, Fleur is acceptable to date if it starts one year after their canon marriage. Let's say you're writing a fic were everyone is just very very patient you know (could be the effect of a spell or something).

*** The Creepiness rule states that the youngest you should date is *"half your age plus seven" or (Age/2)+7=X*. The corollary to that is *"Age minus seven and double it" (Age-7)*2=X* for the oldest you should date.

It might be alright for Lupin to date Tonks, but it wouldn't be alright for Tonks to date Lupin. She could go as high as 36.

**** Are you suuuuure you got your math right ? Because you didn't. If it's alright for Lupin to date Tonks then it's alright for Tonks to date Lupin unless you used an euclidean division. A year after their canon marriage Tonks would be 26 and Lupin 38, making the acceptable maximum age for Tonks to date (26-7)*2 = 38.

**** fleur must of been 18 or close to it by the time they started getting together cause they met when she applied to gringotts to get a job, and all thats known about her birthday is that she was 17 at least when october 30th rolled around so if her birthday is in november she would have been 18 during most of the tournament. but even it was earlier, bill was only 24 when they met so only roughly 7 years separate them

***** Actually, they met in GOF when Bill and Molly go to Hogwarts for Harry as he had no family to cheer him on in the tri-wizard tournament. I re-read the book recently and had a little smirk at a line about Fleur noticing Bill and thinking he was cool. So they met when she was still at school, although it read like a very one-sided crush back then.

** I agree - I've never found the Tonks/Lupin relationship to be particularly convincing, and the age difference was a big part in it. More than any specific date, it's the /feel/ of it - where Tonks feels like she's a few years older than Harry, and Lupin is much older/his parents age. Even if it is 12-14 years of difference, it feels like more.

The Fleur/Bill relationship is one I didn't quite think of there - partly because it 'feels' like Bill is roughly Tonks' age, and a 6-7 year age difference is /reasonable/ enough.

However, at least with the Bill/Fleur one, it looked more natural - compared to the Tonks/Lupin, which looked to me like JKR wanted to write them getting together and just had Tonks pursue him aggressively.

Obviously everyone can have a different opinion - but I do agree with you that it's a relationship that didn't sit particularly well with me in canon.

** I would be more worried about it if there weren't other factors which lessen the potential power imbalance. After all, Lupin is poor, discriminated against, and has a chronic health problem, while Tonks is a fully qualified Auror (which seems a fairly prestigious job).

** I really have no problems with consenting adults of any age dating each other.

In some cases there may be a power dynamic problem, but I think the distribution of power is, if anything, actually more in Tonks's (the younger partner 's) favour here.

Bill and Fleur? I really see no problem there, either. They are just 6 or 7 years different in age anyway and both were legal adults when they got to know each other.

*** To tell more...

It felt like JKR wanted to intigrate another Black offspring (besides Sirius) into the fold and Tonks was who she chose and this was how she chose to do it. It felt forced. They never really seemed to fit together to me. I always wondered why not Andromeda? She's actuallymuch closer to Remus' age the other way, and an older woman/younger man relationship would have been much more interesting.

**** The problem wasn't the age, it was Remus being A) initially completely not interested in any kind of romantic entanglement and later on B) being too much of a coward to stand by his forming family. Age had no bearing.

** Well, maturity is not a disease and sex is not a spectator sport. To me, most people of any age would be "icky" to visualize having sex. Not their problem if they're enjoy themselves. As for dangers, teenagers have as much potential, and far more proclivity to be manipulative and casually hurtful, to be honest. My own mum always recommended my sisters to marry men some ten years older, on account of male immaturity. A Magical culture were you're done with your education and are a working adult at 17, not at all strange in traditional cultures, would easily explain the discrepancy. The endless adolescence of the modern industrial world is probably a bigger problem than the romantic partner of a mature twenty something woman. Just my 2Â¢

** You could explain it away in universe with the ages Wizard Folk reach. The life expectancy of wizards is almost twice as long as a muggle one. Wizards casually reach the age or 150. A 14 year difference might not be a lot in their eyes.

Outside of it; I don't like it. It's creepy and the only good thing that comes out of it is Teddy who is my favourite next gen child. Remus should have settled down somewhere in those 12 long years between his friends dying and teaching at Hogwarts.
