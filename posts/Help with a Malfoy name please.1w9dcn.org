My character is a female and part of the Malfoy family so I need a name that has to do with like the stars or a constillation or something since that's like a black/Malfoy tradition. I can't seem to make up my mind so please help me :)


** Malfoys are usually ancient Roman names, I think? Following that,

Flavia, Drusilla, Faustina, Octavia, Sabina, Livia/Lydia, Cassia, Claudia

** Not all Malfoys had stellar names, but some names had suggestive / ominous overtones. Examples include Narcissa, Brutus, Lucius, Draco. The names of Greco/Roman deities also seems to be common. Some ideas:

Octavia, Anathea, Pandemia, Hecata (Magic), Lilith, Euthenia, Cephissia, Despoena, Lyssa (Rage), Macaria (Blessed Death), Megaera (The Jealous One), Nemecissia (too obvious?), Poena (Punishment), Thalia, Bellonna (War), Invidia (Envied), Tempestra (Storm)

There are some good ideas here, I think:

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Greek_goddesses]]

Also the Roman goddesses. I think that's what J.K. did, along with a few alterations to make the names sound better.

Ooo! Edit: Nefaria. Insidia.

*** Right, but I think draco was based off or the draco constellation. So my character is going to be the twin of draco (au story) so idk I guess I felt she needed to have a star or constellation name as well lol

**** It seems to me that Astronomical bodies are a Black family tradition and the Malfoys use names that are significant either to Greek or Roman history. There's much more evidence for the blacks than the Malfoys obviously, since I can only remember two "Pure Malfoy" names from canon (Abraxas and Lucius)

The interesting thing here is that Draco was named in the Black tradition rather than the Malfoy one, and continued to practice that with his own son. So either the Malfoy tradition is unimportant enough that they bow to the coolness/history of the Black tradition, or the Malfoy family itself is unimportant enough that they bow to the Black tradition. That makes sense if "Ancient and Noble House" actually means anything.

To actually answer your question, though: Draco's sister would most likely be named in the Black tradition for the same reason that Draco would. One of the closest constellations to Draco is Ursa Minor, or little bear. Ursula is a name that means little bear. So unless you object to the name Ursula, that may be your best bet.

If you want her to symbolically be on the other side of the galaxy from Draco, maybe Carina would be a decent choice.

**** What is your character like?

J.K. did a lot of work to give characters meaningful names.

Examples:

Minerva - Goddess of wisdom

Narcissa - Someone who is self-absorbed

Remus - Brother of Romulus, suckled by wolves.

***** So my character is the twin of draco who gets sorted into gryffindor. She is very smart and very very very stubborn. She will do anything for family though and will put herself in harms way for family or even her close friends if it means it will protect them.

**************** It depends what you want. Some do it all: check for spelling errors, check punctuation, tell you when something isn't good, tell you to add more description to this paragraph etc. Some know canon really well and will tell you if you have something totally off, or if there is a better spell to use etc. If you read the beta profiles they tell you what they like to do. It's good criticism sometimes. I have chapters that my first beta sent me back and basically told me to rewrite and those chapters are now some of my best work.
