According to superstition, a mirror can trap a dying soul but in truth only a very specific mirror can do that. That mirror latches onto the soul and try to drag them into the mirror world prison even though bodies tend to hold on to souls tightly. This One mirror designed to ensare others had taken years to track down. It had collected so many trapped souls that it tend to show the living their hearts desire in hopes to trade the fools soul for a trapped one and steal the living body.

Dumbledore had this amazing plan. All he needs is to encourage Tom to gaze into the mirror. Without his original body, he cannot resist the soul trap like Quirrel who has a living body. Quirell lives and Tom permanently imprisoned despite remaining immortal. Of course he just have to make it seem he's at least trying to deter Tom or else he'll get suspicious.

Well.... That was the original until kids who think they know better tries to be a hero.


** I knew I had read this somewhere. Just double checked though. In the Prince of Slytherin the Mirror was designed to free victims of possession by offering the spirit what it wanted most, enticing them until they slipped free of their host and into the mirror. However over time it became corrupted by the spirits inside it and began luring the spirits of the living as well. Enchanting them with its images until they wasted away in front of it andnsteaking their souls when they died.

*** I have this headcanon that Albus has this elaborate plans but ends up having to improvise because a well meaning child keeps on messing it up and trying to "solve the problems" thus thwarted any chance of him finishing off Tom. In the end he just gave up and decided if Harry really want to be the hero then fine I'll give him the most griffindor solution and straightforward way to defeat Tom destroy the horcrux, a standard fetch quest.

If you combine this with time travel, Harry confronted Albus and tells him off. Albus then responds all the times Harry fucked up everything. Like how high and mighty Harry has been only to bitch slapped that Snape was right he was arrogant like his father in assuming everyone is incompetent and neglecting. He just had to play the hero.

Its why no one wanted to include him in the plans. My God I assume that Dumbledore didn't step in with the treatment with Harry because it's the muggle child services who should be doing things not him. I can totally see everything crashing down on Harry, when the truth comes out. Each gloating how he solved a problem only to be soundly trounced by the fact he made things so much worse before he 'fixed it'.

** The thing is, in this instance the Stone wouldn't be in the Mirror at all. It'd be a fanciful illusion with no material basis - ACTUALLY hiding the real bait inside your trap is idiotic.

Though, perhaps the stone really was just a glowy rock?
