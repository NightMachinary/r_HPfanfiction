I've never really liked Hermione that much. Not when reading the books and also not in FanFiction. Draco I can tolerate. Basically what stories (with pairing or not) do you think do these two characters justice?


** A fairly popular one would be Hogwarts Crammer. linkao3(7331278)

As far as converting you... it would sort of help to know what type of stories you generally read.

** Linkffn(REPOST-Vox Corporis : Original Author-MissAnnThropic NOT MY STORY)

This set the bar for H/Hr stories, and has never been surpassed. I only read Harry-centric fics, so I can't say for sure, but in my opinion the best romance fic in the HP fandom.

** Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire remains one of my favorite for this. It is set during the books and has a VERY canonnesk feel to it.

It is also a VERY believable point of departure. For the romance, it happens relatively late in the fic. Hermione's encounter with Victor doesn't end in a date because she is champion and Harry still gets turned down by Cho, and thus they end up going together.

It is one of the few Harmony fics that I feel completely avoid any of the pitfalls of fanon. Even the other really good fics tend to not so much avoid the pitfalls as simply power through them with good writing.

A spoiler of one of my favorite scenes in the fic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry, blissfully ignorant of the conversation, walked up to Hermione' side. McGonagall had no time for fripperies. "Mister Potter, do you have a date for the Yule Ball?"

  Realising her Head of House's intent a fraction before McGonagall pounced, Hermione thought: 'Well, this is pointless, as he's certain to have asked Cho Ch-'

  "Umm ... no." Hermione turned and stared open-mouthed at Harry.

  "Well, Miss Granger needs a partner." McGonagall left it at that, expecting her Gryffindors to act accordingly. Harry just stood there, looking bemused, as if he could not believe what was happening.

  McGonagall sighed, and then spelled matters out for the suddenly dumbstruck boy. "You are meant to ask her if she would like to accompany you to the Ball ... as your date," she added, throwing her hands up in despair at the general level of cluelessness on display.

  "Oh!" Harry twitched. "Sorry, of course ... Umm, er ... Would you, Hermione?"

  "Of course she would," McGonagall answered on her behalf, before the other half could muck things up even further. "Now with that settled, away with the both of you. Stop wasting my time."

** I'm not a big Harry/Draco shipper since it's hard for me to imagine a situation in which they would realistically get together (I like enemies to lovers as much as the next person, but they're a bit much for me). However, I really loved Running on Air. Absolutely beautiful language and imagery, and for once I thought Harry and Draco actually worked.
