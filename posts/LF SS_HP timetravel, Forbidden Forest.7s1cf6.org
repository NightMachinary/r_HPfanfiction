Harry is purposely sent back to change things. He goes back and somehow stays in the Forbidden Forest. It somehow turns into a hp/ss, Harry has a Manor/castle in the forest, he somehow rules over the area... My one recollection is Harry having a meeting with 'creatures' and a centaur comes over and was so uncomfortable they left. ðŸ™‡ All I know was that I loved it and it was from years ago... so help??? Please and thank you.
