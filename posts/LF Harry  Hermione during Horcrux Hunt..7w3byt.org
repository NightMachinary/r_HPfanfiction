The title is rather empty, compared with what i could written, but i didnt know, if that would fit. So, if i read the passages in the Book or watching the Moviescenes, they all come together during Winter. When Ron leaves, its raining. And if i overthink that stuff i came to the conclusion (or idea), that there are to few Scenes with those elements in the Book as well as in the Movie. So, i want to read stuff, where they are looking at Snowy places (others than Godrics Hollow, or they come to this place more than one time or stay longer, either before or after the Nagini attack) or Rainy ones, maybe Caves or something like that. Also the communication is a thing, i cant say between those. Do they talk at all or just the necessary stuff (no need for announcing Meal times or when to change Guard posts, since a single gesture is enough)? Does Hermione blame Harry (atleast a part of her does it a little bit, maybe?) for their Situation or is her current state only the result of her "Boyfriends" departuring? (no bashing, i just dont know, if he was her Boyfriend at that time or if it came during Hogwarts Battle or after it, thats why i put it into emphazise).

But anyway, i want Fics when they are searching locations (maybe even highly unlikely ones), as long as there is either Snow or Rain fall. And they share a very close developing. Whether its just platonic (some, you could (as H/Hr Shipper) murder the Author for torture ^{^{),}} H/Hr or even one-sided attraction (but where nothing happens because of "it would jeopardy their or their Friends Relationship", but more like "if this starts now, we might lose our focus"....hmm, ok could also happen during H/Hr scenario. Hmm, maybe it happens during H/Hr, but one of them cant bare it any longer and they let it happen for just one time. But in total, im open for all Fics, whether its Harmony or not, i leave it to the Author.


** I think [[/r/HPharmony]] can help you out more than this sub can

*** i wasnt sure if this Sub was the right place, since i would also read Fics that have them in Platonic View and it might end with Canon Pair

**** I think a lot of people still read Harry/Hermione fics even if they aren't shipped because they like the characters themselves. You might get lucky.
