** Curious, what is the appeal here?

I mean it seems a good portion of the non-harem Honks do this but I don't understand why. It feels like the least interesting pairing for metamorphmagus Harry. Or for that matter, the least interesting way of getting a Honks pairing. Is it just because Harry is the self insert character?

Not to mention the creep factor that tonks seems to fall head over heels every fic there is another metamorphmagus in.

Of course if they did something interesting/unique with it (goo/merging? I Donno) It would make more sense, but I never see those.

The best of these I read was with Harry under a false name in America. It has probably been linked already...

*** The appeal is that it's pairing like with like, and once upon a time, when people still thought that Charlus was James's father and Dorea his mother, giving him metamorphmagic seemed like a natural thing to do because the ability manifests somewhat randomly and fairly rarely in those with Black blood which he seemed to have some of.

I don't really get the fixation that some people have on particular pairings, a fixation that more often than not results in stories feeling forced in that regard, but I have to say that a well-written story written by someone who actually knows how to write romance can have almost any pairing feel believable.

**** Yea, but that usually isn't a thing? I mean, every once in a while you see the 'lets make a male student a curous-brave-loyal bookworm for Hermione, or lets make a female student a socially awkward chess player for Ron', but they usually fall by the wayside to doing pairings with, you know, differences to play off of?

I mean I know they do exist, but they seem a bit more popular for this particular ship than others.

***** I do not know and thus I cannot say. As hypocritical as it may sound considering the post we are commenting on right now, I generally don't read romance stories because most of them stink of cheap plastic.

That said, I've never seen a story in which someone is changed in character to suit Ron or Hermione; it probably has to do with me not reading most of “romance” stories.
