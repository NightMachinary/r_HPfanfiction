Time travel is preferable so they're the same age range.


** You may like Delenda Est. Time travel Harry paired with younger and sane Bellatrix who didn't join the Dark Lord. Things get weirder from here, but overall it's one of the best long and completed pieces I've read. I often see it recommended here.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
