Titling your request with "Help!", "Looking for a fic!" or "I'm searching for my fav fic!" is not helpful and I will not click on those. I'm not here for some kind of mystery tour constantly going "ooh, I wonder what's in box no. 45?!"

That is all.


** Also, please use the tags correctly. Requests are for "I'm looking for something like X" while "Fic Search" is reserved for "I want to find a specific story" (again).

** BTW, since this is meta, I have a question: why is the flair not added when I put it in brackets? I.e. I put the title like this:

[Fic Search] blah blah blah

and after some time it still appeared with brackets and not as a flair. Am I doing something wrong?

*** Flairs in brackets aren't really a /thing/ on Reddit, except on subreddits that have configured AutoModerator to automagically add flairs to posts. You need to manually add the flair to the post.

**** Ok, thanks, found the button. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3hvj3e/meta_automatic_link_flair_now_working/][The text here]] seemed to suggest that it is automatic, that is why I got confused.

#+begin_quote
  8: Request threads are for recommendations. Fic Searches are for finding a specific fic. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested. Flair accordingly.
#+end_quote

While the request/discussion divide is questionable, the fic search/request divide has long been a part of the rules.
