In Harry Potter you can't make food but What about taking food Transfiguration it into like a marble and then Untransfiguration the food when you Want to eat it because a marble is solid it shouldn't go off and you can just undo it when you want to eat it


** I think the most instructive example is Draco Malfoy the amazing bouncing ferret.

He is a person.

He is turned into a ferret and bounced around.

He is untransfigured back into a person.

When he is untransfigured, what do we see? He is wincing in pain and his hair is messy.

What this shows is that Draco's experiences as a ferret carried over into his human form when he was untransfigured. There is a continuity between the three states. Untransfiguration does not turn back time or delete an object's history. The "question" of untransfiguration is not "What was this object before?" but rather "What would this object be now, if it had never been transfigured?"

And thus untransfiguration gives you a Draco Malfoy in the state he would be in if you had bounced him around in human form.

What this suggests to me is that if you transfigure fresh food into a stone and leave it in that state for months, when you untransfigure it, the food will be mouldy.

*** Alternatively the state of the object maintains its state regardless of shape, so if food was transfigured to stone and then months later untransfigured it would be fresh as the stone changed relatively little if at all.

*** Yeah the preservation charm is good but then you and to have a place to store the food album a marble is a small thing that you can have like multiple dishes as different colour Marbles

**** store it in space expanded storage.

Hermione was able to carry their whole supplies in book 7 from a purse, storage capacity isnt a problem in the wizarding world

****** I mean, she was Undesirable n. 2 and yet no one did anything about it. Just don't show your cabinets to the pigs and you should be fine.

******* Not even that, it can't be illegal to own expanded stuff due to tents and trunks being a thing but it is possible that casting it is. In which case you just have to avoid blurting it out or having it appear to a prior incantato.

** The reverse of that would be a real fun way to threaten to kill someone.

Take one of those giant Jack-like tank traps and transfigure it into a pea or something small, then slip it into a meal and let someone eat it. Then you tell them to do something or you'll untransfigure the pea in their stomach.

** My best guess is that when you are dealing with food in the magical world, you have to think of every aspect of it. So even if the students are able to transfigure a desk to pig, only the outward appearance of the desk would be that of a pig but otherwise it would be just an animated desk without the nutritional values. Reversely if you don't think of all the cellular aspects of food, they still continue to function as they would normally.

We get the best example from the fact that Hermione, despite being a brilliant witch who can cast protective charms and expand her bag, is still having difficulties transfiguring a moldy piece of bread in DH.

** I found this law to be bullshit. Minerva turns the desk into a pig (bacon), she turns into a cat (people eat cat)....what counts as food?

** That would be an option, given that you'd already have the food in your hypothetical case.

The point of Gamp's exception as it applies to edibles is that while magic can alter things that are edible and even increase the amount of edible material you have available, you can't transfigure something nonedible into something you intend to eat. It is a plot point in Deathly Hallows, though as the main character is neither a ravenclaw nor particularly interested in the specifics, the underlying reasons remain up to interpretation.

It may be something as cut and dry as the part where no magic can revive the fully dead (something that simply cannot be done), have something to do with the inherent properties of transfiguration (like, for example, if all transfiguration is inherently temporary the inevitable untransfiguration would be incredibly harmful and painful) or have a memetic cause (it is taught and agreed upon that nobody can do it and, as a consequence, nobody can do it).
