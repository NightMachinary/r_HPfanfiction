I was wondering if there are any stories where Sirius and James are both Harry's fathers from a result of a polyamorous relationship between the three. Something like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3829808/1/Meant_to_be][this.]]


** Well, there's the one you just pointed out. However, that is actually impossible.

*** How is it impossible? Anything is possible in Fanfiction, that's the point.

**** It's physically impossible to have more than two parents, one male and one female. This would require having three parents, two male and one female. You could maybe have 'twins', one of whom is actually Sirius' son and one of whom is James', but you can't have one baby with two fathers.

Unless you're talking about just having Sirius and James both raise Harry like a son, in which case never mind.

***** It's the world of Harry Potter, and it's fanfiction. /Fiction: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story./ It doesn't have to be logical, or scientifically correct.
