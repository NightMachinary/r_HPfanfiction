Does anyone know of any good John Wick crossover stories, preferably on the long side?


** Wait, is John Wick's dog Sirius or Hedwig?

Or:

.... Then, right after his Godfather dies, you steal his Firebolt, and kill his @#$&ing owl...

***** u/PhilemonTheSuperior:
#+begin_quote
  After killing a bunch of Death Eaters in the Leaky Cauldron, a bloody Harry Potter walks into Gringotts Bank.

  - "How good is your laundry", asked Harry in front of the reception.

  A stoic Griphook looks down at him.

  - "No-one's THAT good".

**** Instead of voldemort make it so this takes place in an alternate reality where Harry BRUTALLY destroys voldemort and his followers and he is then made the Defense against the Dark Arts Teacher. Draco's Son kills his pet Owl Hedwig and causes Harry to hunt him down and Draco washes his hands of the situation saying "You fucked up kid"

***** Ok, I wrote it. If anyone's interested, here are the summary and links:

Summary - You simply don't kill the pet owl of the man who slaughtered Voldemort and dozens of Death Eaters. Too bad Scorpius Malfoy wasn't warned. Crackish one-shot.

****** So I read it, but my one complaint is the fact that you didn't do the whole Baba Yaga speech and really nail home how fucked scorpious was.

******* The BabaYaga speech was left out on purpose, and I thought of including a Scorpius POV of what actually happened, but it didn't work in this piece - maybe as a standalone it does, but it's unlikely that I'll go back to this.

** The year is 1980. Mad-Eye Moody's wand sprays fire as he forces the contingent of Death Eaters who'd tried to ambush him into cover. With a snarled "Reducto!," the waist-high picket fence they'd used to hide themselves detonates, sending dark-robed figures flying through the air.

"Incarcerous!" thundered the veteran Auror. The whiplike strands of cord that shot from his wand left ropeburn where they bound themselves to the prone figures of the slower Death Eaters.

The ones who'd been spared the brunt of the blast that had exposed them tried to reposition. They shattered the large living room window of a nearby Muggle house, diving inside, where they hoped to find a moment's respite and perhaps a hostage to turn the situation to their favor.

Moody spun, wand up, at the sound of several muffled bangs, like firecrackers going off in a nearby room. The house was lit up by a series of bright lights in rapid succession. Wand still at the ready, Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody checked the names of the streets on a nearby sign, before raising an eyebrow at the familiar words.

A lightbulb flicked on inside the house, and a shadow passed by the shattered window.

"Hello, John," said Mad-Eye. "You working again?"
