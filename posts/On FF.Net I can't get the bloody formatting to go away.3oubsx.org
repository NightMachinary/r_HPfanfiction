** You got some HTML tags in there. Either a weird text editor or you copied and pasted incorrectly from another site.

Its under 4k words so you should be able to just pop that into something like Notepad++ (don't judge me, I write my code and fanfic together) and use the search+replace function to remove it all and fix up the spacing.

Code should be written in an IDE, not in notepad++...

**** Most professional developers use a lightweight text editor like emacs, vim, or Sublime. IDE's are a thing of the past.

I wouldn't say that yet, lots of developers that I know (inc. me) write code in IDEs, at least for some languages. I really like Netbeans, but I wouldn't write code in the Python IDE ever.

** Alright so what it looks like is all of the angle brackets < and > have been removed from the HTML of the story. As to why it happened, I can't really tell just from looking.

We're going to need a few more details in order to help you out. What format was the story in originally? What does it look like in the document manager?
