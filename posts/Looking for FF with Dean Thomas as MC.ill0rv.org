I don't care how long it is or what era or whatever. I just want some for inspiration as I'm thinking about writing one of my own. I'd prefer if they were about the start of the story and not one shots about his love life with Seamus though..no slash here! :)


** I like this one:

  Once a week, every week, Dean Thomas allowed himself to pretend nothing had ever happened.

** Really nice start in “To All the Wizards I've Considered Before by FullofWrackspurts” linkao3(17777138), but the end drags on. I have never read Hermione/Dean story before, but this is really nice.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)
