Just noted that there are lots of fics with Harry or Hermione going back in time and getting to redo stuff. Even Luna, Malfoy, Dumbledore, Snape and Fudge have stories like this. So now, I'm looking for fics where Ron is the star.

Please don't mention linkffn(Backwards with a Purpose) coz Ron traveled with Harry and Ginny in that one or linkffn(Gryffindors never die) coz he was with Harry in that one. Ron has to be the main character making the changes.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** My personal favorite is the cost of time travel. It is sadly incomplete, but what was put there was an interesting take on the time travel trope.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6905950/1/The-cost-of-time-travel]])

The Red Knight has a Ron who becomes reborn in a world where Harry is a girl, while still retaining most of his memories.

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** I'm really enjoying linkao3(A game of chess by kirinin)- it's not complete yet, but nearly is, and updates every couple of days.

I was a bit put off by the "author tries to use terrible tropes" theme, but they all fit with the story and don't impede the flow- I haven't noticed some of them until the notes.

*** This is a fantastic story--thanks for recommending it. You are right that the "teach tropes new tricks" doesn't impact the story. And I like the fact that the time travel isn't to first year, but later.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board?

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no one is perfect.
