I am aware that this is an EXTREMELY random mashup, but please, if anyone knows a fic of this kind, I would be very grateful if you were to comment. I'm just a part of both fandoms and have a hard time finding a decent fic. (Only one I've found is Project Motherhood and I loved it, but I do want to read more.)

**** Ah, okay. Thanks for clarifying. I remember that game, it was pretty fun. Don't know any fics of it though - my apologies.
