** Death has no Masters but Life has Servants - it's a pretty nice GoT/HP fic, that requires very little knowledge of GoT. Most everything is explained. It's also kind of unique in that x-over genre. linkffn(11910526)

Fair Lady - Requires absolutely zero knowledge of Sandman, but if you research just a bit, you will get some references and one minor character. It's, again, kind of a unique fic, with very short but numerous chapters. linkffn(11494031)

Harry Potter, Squatter - Again, no knowledge of Percy Jackson is needed. In fact, it's better if you don't know anything. Although some familiarity with Greek Mythology is required. Also it's probably one of the best current crossovers. linkffn(13274956)

I Fleetly Flee, I Fly - I've never seen Doctor Strange, nor have I ever read any comics about him, but I still can enjoy it. It's fairly laid back and enjoyable if slowly updated. linkffn(12928831)

â€‹

All of those stories are still not dead and updated semi-regularly.

  Another task had been given to him. Not one of prophecy, but of choice. He had long ago accepted his need to help people, to protect those who could not protect themselves. War was all he had known, all he was good at. It was time to help heal. But, sometimes, to save a life, you had to take one.

  A slightly different encounter with Quirrell at the end of first year leads to new problems, new abilities, and a gateway to the extraordinary. A HP/Avengers crossover that respects the timelines while throwing in new twists and characters you may not have seen coming. Now in Year 3. Enjoy!

**** I can confirm this one, when I read it I had no idea that it was a crossover (Since it's not actually listed under crossover and I'd never even heard of the lament configuration before this) but I still enjoyed it immensely.
