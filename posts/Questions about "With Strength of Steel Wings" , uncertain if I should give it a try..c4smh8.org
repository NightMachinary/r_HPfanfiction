I've just finished "Blindness" by Angela and I'm considering giving another one of their fics a try. As far as prose, dialogue and characters "Blindness" is outstanding, the plot though... not so much. At least for me. The writing style, while beautiful at times, is very passive, even during conflict and action scenes, there's just never a sense of urgency. I never feared for any of the characters. In more concrete terms, Harry was simply too OP, surpassing any need to act within what's considered normal in the magical community. I got tired of reading how brilliant and amazing Hermione and Harry are, it felt cheap, unearned and unbelievable. (Two teens making huge cutting edge breakthroughs in magic after only being introduced to the society a couple of years previous? not buying it.)\\
Given these pet peeves, should I give WSoSw a try? What I am hoping to read is a fic that's more focused on the actual rules of magic, while having the MCs limited by said rules and working hard to improve, instead of just blazing through everything because of inherent awesomeness.


** Unfortunately, "With Strength of Steel Wings" has a similarly OP Harry after the midpoint of the fic. It has a very interesting premise with well written plot, world building, and characters in the beginning, but you'll probably find that it falls into the same pitfalls as "Blindness". I recommend giving it a miss if "OP Harry" plotlines are not to your taste.

*** I guess I can make some compromises with personal taste for such excellent prose, I don't think I've come across any other fanfiction writer comparable (in terms of prose).

Are there at least satisfying challenges for the MC to overcome? a sense of urgency and excitement during action scenes? or is it as dull as "Blindness"?

**** I will say the action scenes are generally decent in WSoSW, much better than the ones in Blindness. /However/, after the midpoint of the fic it turns into a giant OP Harry thing for a while. At the point at which it has stopped it's beginning to lean back towards actual challenges for Harry though. I personally found it easier to read than Blindness, which I never have managed to complete.

**** I can only describe my own experience reading the fic.

I enjoyed the first half of it, but I got bored and stopped reading when Harry crossed the line into the OP category. To me, it seemed like the fic shone best when exploring the relationships between Harry and his friends, but those close relationships seemed to vanish as Harry got older. You could think of it as like Blindness, but without the close partnership with Hermione to keep Harry centered.

But that's just my opinion. Hopefully other people can offer their perspectives on the fic.

Of course, he's OP and has insights nobody else does. It would have been absurd if he didn't. Harry can literally see magic and souls. It is an unprecedented ability and the only other person hinted to have it was Merlin, and that was a millennia ago.

Unlike most, the story isn't about conflict and so maybe you expected something from it that it never planned to deliver. It's about Harry and Hermione's journey into magic and life as they deal with both their abilities and disabilities. The author wrote the story while/after she struggled with her own visual disability. /Blindness/ happens to be one of my favorite fanfictions.
