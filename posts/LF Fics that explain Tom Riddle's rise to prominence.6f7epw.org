Currently details years 1-4. He is still writing them and I believe he only puts out a year once the year is completely finished. Year 5 should be out soon. They're wonderful.

** linkffn(More Equal Than You Know) is not what the description say you're looking for, exactly, but fits your title: it gives a very interesting explanation of how Voldemort became the Dark Lord, told by Dumbledore in later chapters. See, the idea is that Death Eaters existed way before Riddle was even born, as a sort of wizard equivalent of the Klu Klux Clan. All the members were masked so that none of them could out the others.

Riddle started showing up to the Death Eaters meeting one day, and, through his intelligence, power and cruelty, soon became their de-facto leader --- at which point he began using the alias of Lord Voldemort as a way for his minions ot refer to him. They accepted this unknown, non-pureblood name because they still thought it was the alias of a pureblood. Then, when he was sure he had total control over them, he began rousing them for more than isolated attacks against muggles and the odd muggleborn.

** linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Conflicts of Interest) is technically HPMOR-based, but since HPMOR Riddle's youth is pretty similar to canon, it doesn't really matter. A nice little read.

linkffn(10972919) shows a version of Riddle's childhood where he has the spirit of a someone deranged Harry Potter fan in his head, giving him advice throughout. More serious than it sounds, and rather excellent.

There's a story I can't seem to remember the title of, that focuses on Voldemort having been a false identity for an actually good man who used magician techniques to make himself appear much more powerful than he ever could be, and led the pureblood supremacists into an absurd war on purpose so that they'd be wiped out.

  This is based on my interpretation of the Tom Riddle portrayed in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. I loosely follow the story and facts laid out by HPMOR but I do make a lot of changes, large and small.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  A canon compliant, no slash, serious attempt at a TMR JR origins story, inspired by things in the books that remain unanswered. Read the long-ish note at the beginning of the first chapter to find out if this is a story for you. Rating for much later chapters. Genres are more accurately Supernatural, Tragedy (we know how the books go), Humor, Adventure, Romance and Drama.
