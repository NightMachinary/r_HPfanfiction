Does anyone know any fanfiction where Harry travels back in time to the mauraders age and changes time. I am looking for fics where he befriends his parents and works to defeat voldemort and stop them from dying. I prefer if he went to school with them instead of being a teacher. Thanks

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  "What we need," Dumbledore said slowly, "is more time." He looked at his watch, "three turns should do it, Miss Granger. Good luck." Only Lady Luck wasn't on time. Time went back, but not to when it should have. "Well, we came from the future, but apparently it wasn't two hours ago as we first thought and if that really is Remus Lupin, I'd wager we went back twenty years..." AU
