I'm looking for complete fanfics in which Harry no longer sees privet drive as his home and because of that the blood protection falls down, and he leaves

Either before or during Hogwarts

Have tried google but I only get results of people asking what the blood protections are xD

Can ya'll throw me good fanfics links please?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469775/1/Escapologist-Harry][Escapologist Harry]] is this premise taken to the extreme.

Dumbledore is /very/ insistent that Harry stays with the Dursleys; Harry, for his part, is /even more/ insistent on being free.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

One of the best fanfics I've ever read.

  Isolating Harry over the summer before 5th year didn't work out like Dumbledore had hoped. Now, with her friend having run away, Hermione is left to pick up the pieces, trying to stand strong against the challenges in a school where racism and injustice are not only tolerated, but actively encouraged by some teachers. All she can do is wonder how Harry made it all look so easy!

**** So, I read The Hidden Hero and liked the first act, but after his real identity was revealed, the quality kind of, I don't know, deteriorated. I'm not sure what did it for me but either way it was a nice read, so thanks for the recommendation!

  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.

  The Dursleys, fearful of their nephew, decide that the best course of action is to dispose of him. Where do they leave him? France. There, Harry Potter grew up and learned of his most precious ally: himself. Armed with a new name and a new face, Harry takes them all by storm. Smart, Metamorphmagus Harry. AU. First Year.
