Hello! Id like to read some stories where Harry has a phoenix or thunderbird or something like it. 80k plus words please. complete if possible. Thanks!


** I forgot that a thunderbird is actually something from FBaWTFT, so I initially cracked up, thinking of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbirds_(TV_series][this]]. (Add a bracket after the link, reddit doesn't like URLs that end in brackets.)

I imagined Harry turning up to Hogwarts in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbirds_machines#Thunderbird_1][Thunderbird 1]] instead of a flying Ford Anglia, him using Thunderbird 2 to have stuff delivered (trivial stuff, like sweets and odds and ends, not the kind of stuff you'd normally use a supersonic VTOL fusion-powered transport plane for), and him using Thunderbird 4 for the second task.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.
