What I mean by that is the MC due to circumstances (like oblivious to his exploitation of magic like in the snippet [here]([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g4c2lf/canon_harry_in_indyharry_universe/]]) or dumb luck/coincidence) looks/seems terrifying to others. Preferably they are oblivious to it and are confused by the fear/respect/shenanigans. Something similar is linkffn(Oh God, Not Again!), yet he is actively enforcing the image. I am looking for something where he does similar things unintentionally. The less serious the fic, the better.

Edit: f-ing dyslexia, meant *terrifying* in the title.


** tell me whether he is dead [sic]: linkao3(9191315)

Harry experiences some side-effects from his moment of self-sacrifice. He's still Harry, though, and Ron and Hermione still love him anyway. Takes something that wouldn't be out of place in a horror-fic, and puts it in a fluff fic instead.

Make A Wish: linkffn(2318355)

Harry decides that, if he's going to die, he's going to /live/ first. Shame everyone keeps getting in the way.\\
In this one, Harry just keeps /accidentally/ stopping Death Eaters and other criminals while on holiday, to the point he unknowingly gets a reputation as some kind of super-Auror.

No Competition: linkffn(11126195)

The Horcrux in Harry's scar affects Harry's aura, which causes all manner of Dark Creatures to think Harry's the cutest thing. This is bad news for all those Death Eaters that keep trying to sic Dark Creatures on him. Sadly unfinished.

  Post-DH AU: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying. “Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me." “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
