What's are worst and most overused ideas you see in crossover fics? For me, it's Harry going to a new world and taking everything he owns with him. That single idea can ruin a fic before it's even started


** Harry having to flee the wizarding world because everyone betrays him and the ministry labels him a dark lord.

** I really dislike Harry solving a different series' problems. I really enjoy, on the other hand, someone fixing all the Harry Potter problems. So I guess any crossover where Harry is the one who travels is kind of just out for me

** The Veil of Death being a portal between worlds. I can see why the trope started, but it is way overused at this point. I'd rather it be that the travel mechanism is a completely unanswered mystery than have to read about Harry deciphering how to unlock the Veil again.
