Preference for longer fics (discontinued welcome), but I'd understand shorter ones for this particular request as it is rather niche. Thanks!


** He's a side character at best, but in my AU story "Patron", Hagrid was rehabilitated early on and is the Care of Magical Creatures Professor - and one of the foremost experts on magical creatures in Magical Europe. He mostly makes appearances during the Tournament and later on, when breeding creatures and fighting in the war.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous Boy-Who-Lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
