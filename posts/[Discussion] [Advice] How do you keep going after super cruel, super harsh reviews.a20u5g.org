I got some bad ones a bit ago on my first story in probably 10-12 years. It was short, 4 chapters, and I had all of them written already. I've only posted 2. Now, I admit, my idea was weak, it was executed badly, and it was kind of dumb overall. But I feel like some people are unreasonably harsh. I quote:

"I don't fucking understand why you'd continue with this tripe. If it wasn't already made abundantly clear, this is a stupid goddamn idea and people better than you at this (everyone) couldn't even make it less crap, I'm sure. (...) and Harry isn't a weak ass fucking crybaby. Half your shit is from someone else's book and that half that isn't a shitty shoe-horned in reference but is ACTUALLY yours sticks out like a sore thumb because it's so clunky and bad. Also, referencing (...) and (...) is super cringy, but really I don't know what I expected from a fucking redditer. Like, tough love, but just quit this. You're wasting your time and ours."

(Some of that edited out to preserve my ff.n account a bit seeing as I apparently picked up that person by promoting on this sub..)

I was initially going to re-write the story, because I got some KIND, HELPFUL, AND DECENT feedback on HERE, and felt like "yeah okay, I can fix this." But every time I start to write, I just 'hear' that review like a fucking Howler, and i haven't touched the story re-write since.

What was your cruelest review, and how'd you get past it? Am I just being oversensitive?

Mine was anonymous (of course), so I guess I can assume they haven't written anything either. Maybe I shouldn't allow anon-reviewers, but in the past (those 10-12 years back, when my stories were MUCH worse) I liked to hear from the people who don't have an account and just want to read.

Thank you, this and all the other comments is making me feel a lot better. It's just that the reviewer attacked the crap I was already super worried about, so it just had sort of validated all of my worst fears.

** First, you know you aren't alone because you asked how everyone else deals with these types of reviews. So take a minute and think about that. No really, think about that. EVERYONE gets these reviews. That story you were blown away by, the one that made you cry, made you laugh, inspired you to put fingers to keys. Yep, that story, that one, that author has one if these reviews. Think of them as the bus you miss by a minute, the traffic jam when you're going on holiday, the hole in the toe of your favourite socks. They suck, but they shouldn't/don't stop you doing you. They are part and parcel of trying.

If it helps I once got a review from a reader, which, because my chapter length was a tad long, was split over three separate reviews (lucky me) and culminated in the pronoucment that I had RUINED their Thanksgiving. (Not being American I was a bit nonplussed and felt only slightly sorry.) It was chapter 52 and to me, one if the weakest chapters in my fic so I was a bit sensitive about it. I took a break and did a bit of reviewing of the chapter trying to prop up the bits I thought were poor and gave myself a day to indulge in self pity, but ultimately carried on and completed my story. So, in the spirit of answering your question here's a piece of only mildly related 'sage advice' that I learnt as a hapless teenaged equestrian - if you fall off the horse you have to get straight back on or you'll loose your nerve. You might get hurt, you might be afraid, but you will never get good at it if you stay on the ground.

Did /you/ like it? Because quite often, I'm writing HP fanfiction because this particular plot doesn't exist.

Also, was your plot better or worse than 'Harry has Draco's baby' or 'Draco has Harry's baby' or 'Harry Potter inherits somehow-ignored vaults from one or all Four Founders that none of his recent ancestors did and goes on to Show Everyone Up'?

** I'm really sorry someone did this, it's really mean. You have to wonder why they came back and read more if they didn't like it.

Everyone's been there. A while ago someone left an anonymous review on an old fic of mine where they just didn't get the humour and didn't hold back in their criticism or disappointment. Unfortunately I got the review in a hospital car park where I was visiting my mum, and I let it get it me more than I should have. I eventually realised it was silly to cry over something someone clearly knew was unreasonable - if they had faith in their words they would have signed in and allowed me a response.

You had constructive criticism previously and you were very good natured about it. That says far more about you than the person who wrote such nasty things about something they have made the decision to keep reading (for free!) And didn't have the balls to leave their name with.

It's true that the way we react to these things is coloured by the way we are already feeling. I had a pretty mean review on an old completed fic about eighteen months ago when I was halfway through sixteen weeks of chemo. It bounced right off me. I had so much shit going on, felt so rough and didn't know if I'd ever write anything again, it just seemed irrelevant. It would probably upset me more now.

I like your point here - I don't have a LOT going on in life except (briefly) that story, so I feel like that's why it stung SO bad. If I had more going on, I may have been able to laugh it off.

Also <3 chemo sucks, but so does cancer. Glad you're doing better, both health and keeping on writing. I had A.L.L. as a kid, and I don't remember it all well, but I remember some of the damn chemo and ughhh.

*** I think (iirc) they both came in once the second chapter was put up, so at least the person wasn't waiting around to attack me. That being said, the completed 3rd and 4th aren't ever going up - because I don't know if that guy will be back, and because people were right about the ridiculousness of my plot and characters. Just...most people were way more polite about it when they told me.

I started re-writing the story again last night after posting this here (hardly the same story, actually, only keeping some of the quotes I used that I felt embodied Luna and the -SLIGHTLY- same plot line, but replacing Hermione's part in it with a random 2nd year Ravenclaw Muggleborn, and Luna going to Hermione to have a reasonable and intelligent (and much less OOC) discussion about it instead.) but I found that I kept second (and 3rd and 4th..) guessing myself every paragraph. 'Is this said in a way ___ would?', 'Is this quote too stupid and cringey to use?', etc.

Basically my old fic is haunting it's own re-write.

While I will PM you the story if you really want, I have to say - it's pretty bad. Like, I go back and reread it, and it's exactly as stupid and OOC as people have said (both polite and not). In hindsight, I got waaaay too excited to be writing a story again after being inspired by someone else, and I didn't take it slow enough to be reasonable. I either shouldn't have used the characters I did, OR I should have gone slow and made it MUCH longer in order to explain why people were acting the way they were.

** I have been reading fanfiction for over 15 years now and I have read some really horrible ones, but not once have I left a bad review. I just close the story and look for something else. The reason I do this because I also used to write fanfiction (years ago and in German) and while I got some supportive feedback like "I liked this part, where you...", a lot of the feedback was very demotivating. Germans are sometimes real stickler for grammar rules. I was 14/15 and got reviews nitpicking my grammar, syntax and punctuation. But there was one review which stopped me from writing, while I usually wrote Alias fanfiction, this was my first (and so far only!) Harry Potter fanfiction. I made a one shot, changing the timeline after the 3rd book when Wormtail was randomly caught by McGonagall and concentrated on how happy Harry was to have a family. The review was "Changing the events of the canon because you don't agree with it, is a weak and cheap writing idea which makes all following books obsolete" ... That's what fanfiction is for!

Maybe I'll pick it up again but this time in English, don't want to write in German ever again :/

The Harry Potter forum I frequented had a great community with lot's of things going on and that year they had this Fanfiction competition , which I had written the one shot for.

** This is almost definitely a troll, and the other commenters so far have given useful feedback, but I know for me that having as many ways of framing things as possible helps, so I'll say this.

Even if you are as terrible at writing as the troll says, which I highly doubt, there's nothing terrible about sharing terrible fanfiction. I've read my share of fanfiction, and if it's outright terrible, I don't make it to the bottom to even review it. Even if it's mostly terrible, there's going to be something that drew me through it. Like maybe it was a structurless mess that I couldn't follow, but the dialogue was great and the characters felt alive while reading it. Maybe the spelling was really bad, but the core was solid so I could enjoy the story enough to get over my confusion at words.

Even if it's just a self-insurt or a deliberate sob-fest, those have their place. Fanfiction is a realm to explore yourself as a writer, without the obligation to make new characters every time. It doesn't have to be good. The more you practice, the better you'll get.

I wish you all the luck.

I can't remember the name now, but the self-insert was Ginny's twin sister who had read all the books before getting tossed into HP universe, and was really weak physically, but awesome magically. Even the description had me going 'eh, this sounds a little silly..', but reading it had me hooked instantly.

I also LOVE this older fic that, looking back, has some questionable writing off and on, but the plot and the portrayal of Ron kept me going; I've reread it probably 7 or 8 times. (Recnac Transfaerso by Celebony).

** I had two reviews from the same 'guest' troll as you. They managed to very accurately pinpoint my own insecurities about my writing (I even wondered if they had trawled my profile for clues, but that seems a ludicrous amount of effort to go to. Surely everyone has more productive things to do with their time than that?). One of the reviews was mean but relatively mild. The other was vicious and it still hurts to look at it. It said at length how boring my prose is and painful to read. Also that I had interesting ideas but anybody else would be able to make a better job of writing them (that was the most hurtful bit!) Both of those were on finished one shots. One of them I had been planning to delete anyway, but I've left it up for spite now. Along with the review which I think says more about the reviewer than the writing.

​

These are more sophisticated reviews that the usual 'go and kill urslef' type, which are easy to ignore. The reviewer knows how to aim their barbs for maximum hurt and effect. How do they know that? Perhaps they are a failed writer themselves? Anybody's guess. They can hide on the internet and be brave enough to leave anonymous insults where in real life they are probably frightened to open their own front door.

​

'Growing a thick skin' is all very well but I think creativity brings a particular vulnerability with it. Every time you post a piece of writing, you are laying a little bit of your soul out there and if someone wants to come along and stamp on it, there is nothing to stop them. All you can do is be prepared and have a strategy to deal with it---or don't look at your reviews at all. I've had a few of these over the years and they always hurt, though this was the worst. Sometimes it takes a few weeks to get over it and I don't think it ever stops stinging. I'm still reeling a bit, but I unexpectedly started writing a new piece and I'm sure that was a reaction to the reviews.

​

So I suppose my advice would be to start working on something new.

They also hit the nail right on the head with my deepest worries and insecurities. A lot of other people said, on here or FFN or PMs "hey, this idea is a bit messy and the characters are really OOC", but they were very diplomatic about it (and 100% correct, looking back) and didn't attack..well, the writing itself or me, personally, the way Really did.

It almost sounds like we had the same reviewer, honestly. Sharp tongued, seemingly intelligent enough, and able to cut right to the bone with what they say. :(

Harry Crow - agh. That was one I liked initially, it started out interesting enough, but I just couldn't finish it. To me, it wasn't bad, just SUPER not my style that I liked to read.

Thank you <3

** I've never gotten any downright cruel reviews (knock on wood), but I have gotten some negative ones that I found to be really unnecessary. Like, I got a review on a 5 year old story that just said it was too short, even though the word count is shown right there, and a comment on a different story informing me that the creators had contradicted the premise of my fic (although it wasn't contradicted within the show itself).

As for getting past mean comments, I think it's helpful to keep in mind that enjoyment of fic, like enjoyment of all media, is highly subjective. No fanfic is going to please everyone, because we've all got different tastes, so just because this person didn't like your fic doesn't mean no one else will.

** If they're so concerned about 'wasting time' one wonders why they bothered to spend so long writing out such a rant.

The fact is, nothing anyone writes will work for everyone. My writing may not work for you, your writing may not work for me, and that's just fine. Idiots will be idiots online, and as writers we just have to ignore them. I know it's hard. Especially if they're repeating things that your own inner critic says already, repeating what you already know to be the case, but overstating it so much.

I would suggest going back to the positive reviews. Remind yourself that the voice of dissent is not the only member of your audience. You're not writing for him. You're probably never going to be writing for him. If you give up, you're letting one jerk dictate the direction of your writing. Reclaim your power, write for you. Write for the encouragers. If you can't ignore or forget him, then use him as fuel; prove him wrong.

​

And no matter what, you're not wasting your time. All writing is practice, progress toward the ever-better writer you can become. Don't let him steal that from you. There is no such thing as wasted writing. Just press on.

** On the very first fanfic I ever posted, I got added into a community called "The Horrors of [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]" lol + received a review from who I believe was the community's moderator. I can't seem to find the review anymore but it pretty much was a very disheartening one that really discouraged me from continuing the fic. But there were a lot of other reviews who encouraged me and my story regardless, despite my admittedly less than stellar abilities to write lol.

​

But at the end of the day, I just thought to myself "Why am I writing this fic"? It's not like I'm aiming to impress anyone in particular. I just want to write the kind of stuff I want to read and hopefully improve along the way! I want to have fun doing what I'm having fun doing without worrying too much about highly negative reviews. I usually just thought along these lines while trying to stay positive about it.

​

That being said, I'm really sorry that happened to you. I hope you continue to write more in the future!

I mean, if this guy really feels that his supposedly valuable time is being wasted by reading your fic, then why in the name of Merlin's most baggy Y fronts is he wasting his time writing a review to it?

I know I'm being harsh (and a bit stupid), but I don't think you should bother yourselves with reviews from people who've written zip zilch nada themselves, unless of course it's constructive criticism. I've always had this problem with movie critics who love to shit on movies. Yes, the movie was probably crap, but what gives you the moral high ground to demean it?

** For one-line trolling, I got a variation on a classic: “this isn't funny, I hope you get AIDS and die.” The fic was then several years old, with 300+ positive reviews and 500+ favorites. It was a silly crack one shot, not something I'd poured my heart and soul into.

The formulaic troll review still hurt my feelings. Like you, I'm sensitive and I can't suddenly have a thicker skin because it would be convenient, or because someone tells me I ought to, or because intellectually I know that this is how the internet works. I can work on not being bothered by childish nonsense, but I can't flip a switch and be someone else who has a tough skin simply because it would be rational to have one.

So: if it's an anonymous review, I delete it so I won't be tempted to go back and look at it, unless I'm feeling uncommonly don't-care, and then I let it up my review count.

If it's not an anonymous review, I block the writer so I know I won't have to hear it again.

Then I write or post something else. I can't help my instinctive emotional reaction, but I can control what I do next. My advice to you? Polish up your next chapter one last time and post it. You wrote this story because you wanted to hear it. Likely someone else does too. And when this story is publicly completed, on to your next inspiration for a while. Then, when you're over the emotional reaction, decide whether you want to rewrite, take down, or leave up the fic that for the review.

Sorry that happened to you, by the way. It may be the natural way of things, but it sucks.

***** While I won't deny that he might have changed at the end of the war, that does not magically erase his countless crimes. Just his sixth year had earned him several lifetimes for war crimes (not wearing distinct insignias, hiding between civilians, attacking civilians) as well as the usual fare of using Unforgivables, treason and attempted murder, all of which fall under adult law and do not recognise coercion as an excuse. Even taking everything and a plea bargain into account, that should give him at the very LEAST a decade in prison. Otherwise, it is an insult to justice and someone like Hermione would make it her life's mission to see him punished. And Romance in Azkaban does not sound feasible, even without the Dementors.

He was absolutely a bigot, but I don't have a great need to see him rot in prison.

I think Dramione /could/ work (though it would be unlikely) if he got five years probation, and we actually saw him go through that and unlearn the blood purist views his parents taught him before there was any hint of him and Hermione getting together.

There is a small window where a redemption would be feasible, between her prison break and the DoM battle (so there is no bad blood between Harry/Hermione and Bella). She would have to prove her value to Harry's cause (preferably by slaughtering Death Eater) and she would never be a good person. At the same time, her actions significantly helped the war effort and together with her already served years in Azkaban it should amount to enough to leave her past behind. This would, however, lead to a rift between them and Neville, who would undoubtedly never forgive her.

For war crimes the perpetrator usually was taken to the nearest ditch and shot? All things considered, it should be way more than 5 years on probation. He might avoid execution with a plea bargain and snitching on other Death Eaters, but there are hundreds of counts of war crimes he would be guilty of AND the assassination attempts on Dumbledore with their collateral damage (eg Katie Bell).

Why should I give them the satisfaction of letting their words hurt me when they themselves aren't even consciously aware of them anymore?" and that really helps.

Another think I learned (from Stephen King) is to have someone is trusted and loved to read your material first before ever showing it to anyone else. This person will be honest in their critique, but also loving in the way they deliver it as to make it more conducive to a writing environment. Me personally, I have my cousin or my aunt.

Of course it's hard. That's why you have to work at it and practice it every day. It doesn't come naturally to anybody.

  It isn't useful at all. Don't you think OP already thought of that? It's not that easy you know.
#+end_quote

Most life advice is pretty obvious. I know exactly what I should be doing in my current situation... actually doing it is a different beast entirely and doesn't make people wrong for giving me the correct advice.

also yes gas based executions are pretty horrific compared many other possible ways of executions, hell a proper hanging, where the neck gets snapped, is more humane than death by cyanide like Zyklon B, or suffocation by carbon monoxide.

I've noticed this is pretty common in a lot of amateur art communities, especially fanfiction, and I have the idea it is because there's not many with formal art education in them. After all, one of the fundamental things you learn in it is not to take criticism personally, and that attacks are not criticism.

People used to just insult people back when they were insulted. This created an aggressive society where people weren't allowed to feel upset. Now, people speak out about issues they feel are important, and we have a supportive society that brings people up, and gathers to fight for what they believe in. People are more accepting of each other, and while I won't say it's perfect, I prefer this to a society where it's not okay to get upset sometimes.

Emotions are good. Learning how to express them them in sensible, good ways, is good. Suppressing them is not.

#+end_quote

To be straight up: Yes [[/u/ChewsOnBees]] , you are being oversensitive, this is an overreaction. There's always going to be a selection of people who flame in reviews, and making a massive deal of it like this is telling them exactly what they want to hear. Criticism, whether unwarranted, vulgar, inaccurate, or otherwise, is something all artists deal with when putting their work out for the people to see. If you can't deal with things like this, I can only recommend sharing your stories with just your friends and family until you don't let it get under your skin.

********* Every human being is different. There is no such thing as "oversensitive". You can't say something like that without knowing OP's entire life story - perhaps they have experienced things that make them more sensitive to hate. Telling someone to "man up" or "grow a thicker skin" is telling them to suppress their emotions, and that's not good. Instead, people should teach how to express these emotions in good ways. But I do agree with the last part - you're going to get hate. If you can't deal with it, you should probably stop posting fanfic

Of course OP has their own their life and experience and whatnot. I am only offering the practical advice that if his reaction to a single flame is putting a stop to his entire writing process, they need to remove themselves from that situation. Especially since there's no real way to stop flamers on FF.net.

Note that I did not tell him to "man up" as you say, but to not expose himself to things he can't emotionally deal with, until he becomes better equipped to deal with them (if ever).
