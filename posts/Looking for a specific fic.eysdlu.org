Hey guys,

I'm looking for a specific post-war fic where Voldemort had forced his inner circle Death Eaters to have children. The Golden Trio et al end up finding a bunch of babies and eventually figure out who they belong to and are stuck taking care care of them in Grimmauld Place while looking for extended family members or adoptive families to take them in. Snape also lives in this fic and is in a coma in an upstairs room in Grimmauld place.

Thanks!
