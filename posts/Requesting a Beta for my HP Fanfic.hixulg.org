Hello, all.

So, a little info about myself and my story.

I am currently writing my first ever fanfiction, and I have completed two chapters of it. The story is titled "*Chaotic Halcyonics: A Single Mistake*' - I specifically chose that tile for the acronym of CHASM, haha. It is a heavily AU fic with a sci-fi, futuristic, feel to it, you know?

The first chapter has been posted, and I would like a beta reader to review the second one before it goes up, giving me their thoughts on it and if any parts are ambiguous/contradicting information/bad grammar, sentence structure, et cetera.

The basic plot outline is an AU Harry of an 'alien' species encounter the civilisation of earth, and the story is basically what would occur and how the interactions between the two parties would play out.

As I am a first-time writer, I am a bit inexperienced in the art of writing good HP Fanfiction. So I would appreciate it if someone would lend me a bit of their time to go over my story with me.

If anyone is interested, please do let me know.

Thanks!
