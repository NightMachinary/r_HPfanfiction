I don't remember so much of this fic besides the fact that it was Harry/Daphne (I'm almost certain) and there was this scene where the belgiums were sheltering Harry and his friends and they betrayed him to Voldemort and Harry discovers this because of Dumbledore talking to him in his mind.

Sorry for any english errors.
