I always thought Harry didn't treat Neville very well, it would be interesting to see them both being friends! Neville would teach Harry things about the heir and customs of the wizarding world, etc. Something like that, well, thanks in advance.


** That's about 40% of the fanfics out there

Harry Crow; Familial Bonds; Partners; Marriage Contract... Etc.

If the story has "Lord Potter" in it, pretty sure you'll find what you're looking for, about 80% of the time.

** It's in almost every fic that starts in first year and has Ron/Weasley/Dumbledore bashing. If 'Ron W.' is not in the character list and 'Harry P.', 'Hermione G.', 'Neville L.', 'Daphne G.', etc is , then there's your answer

*** Funny, I'm re-reading the second book and Neville is nowhere to be seen when Harry is dealing with the heir of Slytherin stuff, and Ron is there to explain things to Harry...how odd.
