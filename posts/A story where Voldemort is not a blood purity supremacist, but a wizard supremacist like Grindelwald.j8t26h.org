Exactly what it says in the title: I'd like to read a story where Voldemort doesn't care about blood purity, but wants the wizards (no matter what their ancestry is, maybe also including other sentient magical humanoids such as veela, goblins and so on) to rule the world.

  One-shot. In an alternate history where the Blitz lasted a few months longer in London, the young Tom Riddle's life takes a very different turn.

*** Actually the only Voldemort that makes sense is a Voldemort-supremacist (anyone who isn't him is inferior). He uses the hatred of the rich and influential families for the Muggleborns to give them a cause to fight for and support him. However from Hagrid suggesting that he tried to recruit Harry's parents, the fact that he worked with giants and werewolves, it may seem that he doesn't really care what you are as long as he can make you a powerful yet obedient soldier fighting for his supremacy.

**** That's why that doesn't make sense... he's not giving his followers anything really. And he doesn't stick to his ideals or really even represent them. He would actually have needed to build a system of superiority before enforcing subjugation.

A wizard supremacist has a platform to garner wide scale agreement (rather than just the few and influential), target a group that can't effectively argue against him because they don't know he exists (muggles), and enforces a easy set of beliefs that actually looks like progress while also emphasising the importance of the past without alienating new comers. It's how you would take over a society if you were smart.

***** In the books he doesn't even take any position of authority, opting to name a puppet minister and a puppet headmaster of Hogwarts. He basically allows the Death Eaters to run the world as they please, while he prefers to remain a threat in the shadows. He only takes charge when situation becomes critical, but otherwise he is more interested in the power he holds over the people. In my headcanon, he wants to be a god, above Muggles and above Wizards who changes the world order based on a whim.

*** But his relatives are so "pure" that they can barely function. He, the half-blood, is essentially the result of the gene pool going: "Finally! Not another inbred wizard!"

I think Voldemort just uses the entrenched racism in the moneyed conservative circles of wizarding Britain to gain power and allies. No one cares that he's technically a hypocrite if it furthers their own agenda in getting rid of "those kinds of people."

** I think linkffn(11752324) and its sequel linkffn(12934044) fit, albeit loosely.

It is a very well written AU of a female Riddle that helps out Harry (to an extent). It does a great job of exploring her character, and I binge-read Limpieza de Sangre in one day. Its sequel is incomplete though, and I am dying for an update.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  Ten years after the battle at the Ministry Harry Potter returns to England to take up the post of Headmaster of Hogwarts. But across the ocean an old threat emerges as Gellert Grindelwald rises once again for the Greater Good of the Magical World. Sequel to Limpieza De Sangre.
