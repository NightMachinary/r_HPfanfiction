I've written about 3k words so far, but I want to hear some opinions.

So far, I have the OC “becoming” Harry Potter (as in, his mind has replaced Harry's mind). The story begins 8 months before “Harry” turns 11. I'm currently stuck at a part where the OC lays low for a few months and tries his best to “not make trouble” with the Dursleys (avoid Dudley at school by hiding in the library, doing chores wherever and whenever he's free, staying silent and controlled). I'm at an impasse where I'm about to have him approach Aunt Petunia privately, inquire about Lily Potter, and apologizes about causing trouble and all that. He approaches her privately without anyone else around.

How should Aunt Petunia's reaction be? Keep in mind, “Harry” has been “well-behaving” for a few months and hasn't provoked Aunt Petunia's anger in a while. And now he's asking about his mother (sorrowfully, as an act), apologizing, and asking for information or pictures about her.

Would Aunt Petunia soften just a bit and allow him to go through some of Lily's stuff (MC wants to get a head start in being a wizard and wants to have plausible deniability since he knows about the wizarding world already). Or does she explode and such?


** If you trust Vernon in the first chapter of the first book, he suggests it is Petunia that has the issue with magic and the magical world. Most people can agree that while he's a right dick he really does love his wife so it isn't unreasonable to suggest his dislike of magic and desire for a normal life is an attempt to make his wife happy. What I am attempting to say is that Petunia might be the worse one to ask. I know fandom sometimes portrays her an an innocent victim in all this but we really don't see that in canon. If and it is a big if, Vernon as telling the truth you might get away with asking about young Lily but Asking about Hogwarts-era Lily will get the frying pan swung. Also remember that the Dursley's had ‘no questions' as a rule so it is possible Harry did in fact ask all this stuff.

*** Hmm... What if the OC doesn't imply anything about magic and simply asks about his mother in a passive manner? And try to find any clues to see if he can find information about the wizarding world?

Thanks for the tip by the way!

**** I hope you don't mind me asking but what does the SI/OC stand to gain from asking about Lily? The no questions thing really stuck out to me ask Harry seemed to ask Haggrid so many questions before arriving at Hogwarts and losing that level of inquisitivness. Harry didn't know much about Lily in canon so it's not as if the SI needs this infomation to sucessfully pass themselves off as Harry. It just seems like they're setting themselves up for trouble.

**** I'm with Barco on this one. Petunia in the series really seems to have resented Lily, so I'd imagine she'd either yell and pull a Home Alone with the frying pan or just tell him a bunch of lies about how terrible and arrogant Lily was or some such.

** Steal some money and run away. Get a taxi to London and some makeup to not be recognized. Get a wand and some wizard cash and either knight bus or floo to the Burrow. Don't forget a rat cage and some sleeping potion that works on animals because you're going to need those. After that you should be able to get Sirius free and with him access to a Horcrux that you can accidentally discover. Dumbledore's going to be very interested in that. It should be possible to get the full set by early second year. Don't forget to swap the Philosopher's Stone with a fake before accidentally destroying it while defending it against Quirrel in first year. And go for all subjects in third year to get your personal time machine. Now you're an immortal time lord with infinite cash.

*** SI could just inform dumbledore about everything he knows. That way competent adults could handle horcruxes, squirrelmort etc. If scarcrux is still important, there should be years to find a way to deal with it.

** I can picture her either be indifferent and send Harry on his way without answers or yell a little bit then send him on his way without answers. But even if she chooses to entertain Harry that wouldn't be as unbelievable as her somehow first getting and then keeping Lily' stuff involving magical world.
