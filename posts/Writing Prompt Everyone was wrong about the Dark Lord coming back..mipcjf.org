How did Dumbledore know that the Dark Lord will come back when he disappeared after his attack on the Potters? It's all speculation, from Sybila's prediction, his own theory about the Dark Lord having made horcruxes, and the general whispering of the Wizarding world.

What if he, and everybody else, was wrong? What if Harry was put into an abusive household and been denied information about his life for years, because of speculation of a mistake of a man who he has trusted for years?


** One of the biggest reasons Dumbledore gives for putting Harry with the Dursleys is to protect him from Voldemort's followers like Malfoy. So the idea that Harry was put into an abusive household "for no reason" is still wrong. Dumbledore put him there for two reasons: to protect him from Voldemort, and to protect him from Voldemort's followers. Even if Voldemort is gone, the first reason is still there.

As for how Dumbledore knew, back when the books were still coming out, my theory (which has been jossed) was that Voldemort's true death would also take every marked follower with him, and Dumbledore knew this. So the fact that Snape, Karkaroff, Malfoy, and everyone else didn't just drop dead was how he knew Voldemort wasn't really gone. That theory doesn't hold anymore, because there are Death Eaters who survived. So I'm not really sure how Dumbledore "knew." Since the mark seems to fade or bleed darker depending on Voldemort's strength, which we know from Snape's conversation with Karkaroff, maybe the fact that Snape's mark didn't disappear completely was why Dumbledore suspected.

** Then Dumbledore still made the right choice, because Harry was still protected from all the Death Eaters running around.

In fact, without Voldemort coming back to shake things up, people like the Malfoys would still be incredibly influential, so things would probably end up worse.

*** I don't know, but I don't think so. Lucius made much effort, despite his personal views, to appear moderate and be a respectable progressive wizard. Voldemort returning was the worst outcome for him and his family.

If Voldemort was truly dead then Harry's first year would be pretty chill. He would win at Quidditch, goof off with Ron and generally enjoy life. Hermione would become an anti-social loner. I doubt she would react well to Harry feeling sorry for her the day after Halloween (as he probably would). Remember no Voldemort, no troll.

Second year we have a problem. Does the diary exist? If it does then Ginny dies (due to Harry not getting Hermione's note) and a 16 year old Tom Riddle is quickly apprehended by aurors or Dumbledore, no way would he be worldly enough to restart his reign of terror. He's just a teen without any background, resources or friends.

Third year, would be pretty much the same, apart from Sirius getting the Kiss, no time turner, no saving him.

After that it would be simple. Harry would finish school with average grades. Probably be a Quidditch player after that. Dumbledore would tell Harry before he dies about Voldemort, but without any signs of him returning Harry would probably live a life as a celebrity and do whatever he wants.

Not much would change from the way it was in 1991.

EDIT: By saying does the diary exist, I mean as an enchanted item not as a Horcrux.

**** In linkffn(seventh horcrux), Voldemort doesn't read about what, exactly, horcruxes do before he makes them. So maybe the diary is a horcrux, but the way horcruxes guarantee immortality is by being a restore point for the maker, not by anchoring the main part of their soul to the world upon death.

Respectable, sure. Moderate or progressive, not really.

***** Nope. He was extremely polite to Harry in CoS and warned his son about appearances. He presented himself as a moderate and progressive wizard who supported the Boy-Who-Lived. If that isn't progressive, I don't know what is.

He was against Dumbledore and Arthur, sure, but that was behind the scene. I didn't say he wasn't a bigot, but that he tried to appear as just another progressive member of society.

He wasn't on the Wizengamot, he had to sell his Dark artifacts to a shady businessman to get something out of them and he tried to plant a Dark artifact on a daughter of a Ministry employee in order to make them look bad.

That is not a Dark wizard image. He wants to be seen as at least a moderate, if not progressive. More power to him.

****** He did also get into a public brawl with Arthur, and wasn't particularly subtle about his dislike for Hermione and the Weasleys at the World Cup. And he definitely didn't do a good job of teaching his son not to act like a bigot in public.

But you are right that he was not as blatantly evil in the books as he often is in fanfics.

But regardless of what image he projected to the public, he was still pushing his bigoted agenda in private, as the events of CoS show. And if Voldemort had never returned, Lucius would have continued to do so, and his influence would likely have continued to grow.

******* Would it? I mean, consider it rationally. In canon he had no real power. His one ploy, the removal of Dumbledore from the position of Headmaster of Hogwarts, ended in disaster. He was not obscenely wealthy (not to fanfic levels at least), he could not bribe himself out of jail (post OotP)...

He did push his bigoted agenda in his household, but I doubt he projected that image outside. Nothing supports that assumption and several things point against it.

He wasn't the hidden ruler of Wizarding Britain as fanfiction likes to show. He was a person of some influence, but that influence was severely limited.

In my personal opinion, he would be a bigot in private, but would try to appear socially acceptable in public.

******** I would say that his ploy worked very well...until Harry ruined everything at the end. If things had gone a bit differently, as you would expect them to in this situation, it could easily have worked perfectly.

And he did still have some influence with Fudge, and I think his inability to bribe his way out in OotP had less to do with his wealth and more to do with the fact that the people he had ingratiated himself with had just been kicked out of office.
