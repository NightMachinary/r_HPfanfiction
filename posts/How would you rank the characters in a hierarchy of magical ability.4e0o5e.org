I would suggest the following:

*Tier One: Prodigies*

Wizards who achieve complete and rapid mastery of all magic they turn their mind to, understanding magic at a deep level and showing creativity in multiple magical disciplines. The have a level of magical intuition that is deeper than other wizards can even imagine, and combine it with an unusual level of dedication to studying magic.

Examples: Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald.

*Tier Two: Pioneers*

Wizards who master a broad variety of magical disciplines, including some obscure magic, and who display a level of inventiveness. These people not only have knowledge of magic, they also have good magical instincts which mean they can often master a piece of magic with minimal work.

Examples: Snape, James, Sirius, maybe Lily (because of her pre-Hogwarts controlled magic)

*Tier Three: Skilled generalists*

Wizards who master the majority of "standard magic" i.e. the Hogwarts curriculum. Straight O students who had to work hard at it, rather than having magic come to them naturally.

Examples: Hermione, Remus, Percy, maybe Lily. Probably most Aurors fall into this category.

*Tier Four: Skilled specialist*

Wizards who achieve mastery in their specialism and competence in other disciplines.

Examples: Harry, Draco, Arthur Weasley.

*Tier Five: Competent generalists*

Wizards who are competent in most magic but excel in no particular area. The "straight E" student. Still considered above average.

Examples: Ron

*Tier Six: Competent specialists*

Wizards who are competent in a specialist field or two but who struggle with other areas of magic. The average wizard probably falls into this category.

Examples: Most of Harry's peers such as Dean, Seamus, Parvati.

*Tier Six: Weak Generalists*

Wizards who struggle with all areas of magic but just about get by. Getting As in most subjects with a few fails.

Examples: Lavender

*Tier Seven: Weak Specialists*

Wizards who struggle in all areas of magic but just about get by in their chosen field. Mostly failing with one or two As.

Examples: Crabbe and Goyle

*Tier Eight: Basically a Squib*

Wizards who fail at everything.

Examples: Marcus Flint, early Neville.

*Tier Nine: Squibs and Muggles*

Have no magic.


** I'd agree with essentially your entire demarcations.

Except, I'm not sure Harry fits easily into a category. He is very good at Defense Against the Dark Arts type magic, and only competent in pretty much the rest of the Hogwarts curriculum, which would put him in the Skilled Specialists as you say. Except he also seems to display an instinctual grasp of really weird shit, the kind of stuff Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald were good at, just without the dedication to actually expand his knowledge to such levels. I'd probably put him in his own category of "Strange as all Hell." Not better than the people you have above him, not as good as the people you have above him, but not necessarily worse. Just on a different kind of scale, either orthogonal or parallel to the one here.

**** Harry has a far better understanding of concepts such as the soul or the Deathly Hallows than Voldemort.

Just reread the final duel between Harry and Voldemort. Harry explains all those deep magical concepts to Voldemort which Voldemort fails to understand and which leads to his second and final downfall.

Voldemort is messing with things he does not comprehend. Voldemort is capable of some very powerful dark magic. However, his view of magic is very simplicistic. It all comes down to what he tells Harry in the first book: "There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it." That's why Voldemort fails.

** I wonder where Fred and George fit into this. It's mentioned that they were pretty weak academically, but at the same time, they do some really outstanding stuff for Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Especially in Charms, they would end up in the "pioneers" tier, and I imagine that they'd need some very good knowledge of Potions and Transfiguration as well. I imagine that they focused exclusively on these practical subjects, completely neglecting subjects such as Astronomy, Herbology or History of Magic.

In contrast, we aren't aware of any particular magical accomplishments Lily may have made, other than her pre-Hogwarts controlled magic. All we have on her are generic descriptions and implications about her being intelligent and hard working. But the details are all absent.

Dumbledore and Tom Riddle are mentioned as being great wizards and great students in the same breath.

It therefore seems quite difficult to be a talented witch or wizard without studying in one form or another. Fred and George do, in fact, do a lot of study: they're always doing experiments, and they must have to do a significant amount of magical research to create the things they do.

The incompetent are unable to effect great control, leading to people like Fudge.

Most stories that have rankings are, sadly, just wank. They show Harry as a prodigal super sorceror with Dumbledore binding his powers to hold him back while stealing all his gold and trying to keep the glory of killing Riddle for himself.

** Generally, I rate characters by experience/exposure to magic, intelligence, sanity and imagination.

That said, there is no accurate power scale you can actually use since it's a series about a teenager managing to gank the biggest & baddest villain in that 'verse's history and features six teenagers taking on a dozen of said big bad's finest foot soldiers without incurring a single fatality. That's not even taking into account the number of times the protagonist kills and/or escapes from monsters that are so good at what they do they regularly supplant wizards as the pinnacle of the magical food chain.

Yet he's still a teen and evidence suggests he's not alone in his monster murder capabilities.

Magic in that 'verse is about imagination. It's imagining something, wanting it and translating that from will to power. Power scaling relies on nothing more than seeing how easy/hard it is for the character to go from imagining something happening to making said something happen. The older, more intelligent, knowledgeable and imaginative the character, the easier it will be for them.

Voldemort was at the top because he was a genius that didn't let minor concerns such as fear for his own sanity get in the way of making what he wanted real.

The trio 20 years after the Final Battle will be much the same-Hermione's knowledge, Ron's early exposure to magic and Harry's imagination would make those three something truly powerful in the magical world. Hell, by that stage they would be able to take down a Dark Lord without having to break a sweat. Same thing with the other students too-imagination coupled with intelligence & capability equals massive power.

** personally, I would not use your tier system. I would rank them much like Naruto and Smogon does.

In case you are unaware, in Smogon each pokemon in Uber, Ou, and NU is ranked S,A,B,C,or D. Each shinobi in the Naruto World is ranked the same upon entry into the international Bingo Book. S is the highest. They are the to quote a Kishimoto interview, "Army slayers"\\
S-class -Dumbledore, Grindlewald, Voldemort Snape* Bella* Flitwick* Mcgonagall*

A-class wizards would be those who are able to survive an S class wizard for around 3-10 minutes one on one. I would place Harry*, Marauders, Hermione into this area. These characters excel in one or two specific areas and with study can perform magic in the other fields. Harry fits here due to his physical capabilities, his DADA, and his understanding of obscure magics. Also of note is that while Hermione is extremely knowledgeable about spell theory, she was also one of the only ones injured when in the DoM. Harry was not. She also spent a lot of time studying.

B class. I would place those wizards who are capable enough with magic to be a threat to most people. These are your standard death-eater, your standard witch or wizard. They can cast most of the Hogwarts Curriculum, are capable of learning unique spells but unable to create their own.

C-class. These are the witches and wizards who are poor at most all magics. These are your Crabbe and Goyles, Umbridges. From a pure magic perspective, these are barely worth the wand they carry.

D-class. Non-magicals

it is important to note. that in a situation of extreme opportunity to quote Naruto fanon "even a genin can kill a kage" This means that it is entirely possible for a C-class wizard or witch to kill an S-class. all it takes are being in right place at the right time, and doing the right thing at that moment.

- I placed these here because the ranking system is not equal. Just because two people are S-class does not mean that they are equal in any form. it is the same in Smogon. All those in the Uber tier are gifted the label S-class pokemon. yet you do not fight a Arceus with a Greninja unless you are fully prepared for that thing. The same holds true for Naruto S-class shinobi. Itachi admits when he and his partner (a fellow S-rank shinobi) should flee before Jiriaya of the Sannin, another S-rank shinobi, under the pretense that the pair could not hope to survive, that at best both of them would die killing him. Meaning, that there are levels within the classes.

** Harry with the elder wand was capable of dueling with Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts. It is also of note that the Master of Death may have abilities that would label him/her an S-class threat. It is not shown in canon if that is the case.
