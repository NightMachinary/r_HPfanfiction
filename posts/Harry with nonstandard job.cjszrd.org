This was asked awhile ago and I got some amazing responses. This is a new request for some possibly different or new jobs. Any completed fics where Harry has a different job


** I think my thread from earlier about Harry staying at home and raising kids (which totally seems like something Canon!Harry would be into) got only one real response (which was a Harry/Cho epic). I still can't believe there are not more of those.

There was a short oneshot (under 5K), and there was Flying Squad. I really was expecting more, given Harry;s cannon personality.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis)

Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider style action archeology. Let's hire a pirate, cause several international incidents, break into the Sultan's palace and steal a unique historical submarine from a muggle museum, but hey it's alright because we just found Atlantis and immediately wrecked the place!

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.
