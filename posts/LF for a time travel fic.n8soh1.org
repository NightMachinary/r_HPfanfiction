:END:
I'm looking for a time travel fic. Harry is left on the Dursley's doorstep but Merlin came and took him to the founders' era to be trained? I think this is a wrong boy/girl who lived. Possibly wolfstar(but they're just a background couple that adopts Harry when he returns to his own time). Harry is also kind of friends? with Voldemort (he visits his castle for the library, I think)
