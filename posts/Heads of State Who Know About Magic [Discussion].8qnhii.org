So, we know some heads of state are told about magic by the head of their national magic government, at the very in times of upheaval and chaos on the magical end (WWII there was a working relationship between the MoM and Churchill due to Grindlewald I guess, Fudge and the then-current PM, etc.) Are they allowed to keep their knowledge of the existence of magic once out of office?

If there's no canon answer, how do you think this would be handled? Was rereading an Avengers crossover and Fury was cleared by the ICW to keep his knowledge of them, wasn't sure I bought it (I know he's not a head of state, just an aside).


** I doubt they'd bother to Obliviate them, at least in relatively liberal nations. It's pointless since their several years of term would have proven them to be trustworthy, and while Obliviating a Muggle who's only known magic for a few hours is safe enough, trying to change the memory of someone who has lived with it for many years would be much riskier, and unethical.

In short, English or French or what-have-you officials probably keep their memories, but this may not have been true of, say, /Bulgarian/ officials.

*** The thing is, outside of maybe Churchill (since Grindlewald was active at the same time as WWII) I doubt most heads of state who are informed about magic have to deal with it frequently. Would there even be enough memories about it to worry about the damage should it be Obliviated?

** Just a small but important detail, Churchill was never head of state. The Queen is the head of state not the Prime Minister.
