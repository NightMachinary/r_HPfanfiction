  Ron thought he was so discreet and surely nobody would notice this habit he had developed, right? One-shot. No pairings. Cross-posted on ffnet.

  Ron is struggling, and though he knows he's not alone, sometimes it feels that way. ‚ÄúI'm sorry. I know it's late.‚Äù Ron can hear the whine in his voice. He knows how small he sounds, knows that his voice betrays everything his family believes in. He hasn't felt brave in a long while. ‚ÄúI just...‚Äù he continues cautiously. ‚ÄúI'm looking for something... to help.‚Äù‚ÄúHelp with what?‚Äù‚ÄúPlease, George.‚Äù

**** I never suggested otherwise, but it's also undeniable that the incidence rates are highly gendered. Ron, especially, seems like a poor candidate for an eating disorder; his history (growing up poor, living in the shadows of his brothers) makes him far more likely have issues of being too small, if we must stick to the realm of body image issues. Thus he'd be more the type to turn to steroids rather than anorexia or bulimia.

***** I know that the Weasley's are always pictured as having enough to eat and go around, but irl poor people going from worrying about making food last to suddenly having an abundance of food and never having to worry do often develop a.. problematic relationship with food. Often eating despite not being hungry, eating more than actually necessary, because you never know when it'll be taken away and you'll be hungry again. A friend's family thought I loved this one meal they made because I always had seconds, but really I was just making sure I ate as much as I could when I could. Eating disorders aren't always linked to body image.
