It goes something like this.

After the events of Legend of Korra, a group of radical Fire Nation nationalists succeed in infiltrating Fire Lord Izumi's government.

They successfully assassinate the Avatar, and kidnap her reincarnated self in the Earth Nation.

To ensure the Avatar is out of their hair for as long as possible, they proceed to scramble their brains using bloodbending, to ensure they are cut off from their past lives. They then send them to an alternate timeline, the wizarding world.

In the Avatar World, they succeed in reestablishing the Phoenix Empire, enslaving the other four nations and destroying the United Republic.

In the Wizarding World, the messed-up Avatar, cut off from their previous lives, is adopted by a wizarding family. The Blacks. They name her Bellatrix.

And /that,/ my friends is what makes the story grimdark. The bad guys have won, and the world's only hope is a psychopathic monster, mutilated by the greatest of villains.

The only problem I see is, how does the story end? Is that it? The Phoenix Empire rules eternal?

Any thoughts?

EDIT: Bending and magic are merely two different expressions of the same force. Two different techniques for harnessing the same energy if you will.

EDIT 2: Yes, evil Avatars are possible. Raava, the Avatar Spirit, merged with Vaatu, the spirit of darkness at the end of Korra Season 2.
