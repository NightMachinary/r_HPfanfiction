I noticed that in a lot of fics that has a Harry who has a secret, or secrets for that matter, author forgets that normal kids his age lie everyday to everyone.

At least I and my friends did when we were teenagers. Plenty of times, to get out as much out of trouble as possible.

What I don't understand, is how Harry doesn't have a sly bone in his body, and always tells truths or caves in when pressured by his, recently befriended at best, friends. Especially in fics where he grew up with Dursleys, or fics where author ephesizes how savant Harry is at politics, cuz 11 year olds understand politics. Right.

Hell, even the supposed "lying, slimy Slytherins" don't lie that often, when it was supposed to be their go-to action. Majority of the time, the introduced Slytherin characters are more like Hufflepuffs(not that there's anything wrong with them) but instead of lying, they say vague words to describe the situation.

It seems like majority of authors just forget that characters in their stories are not always dosed up by veritaserum. It's like they forgot that characters don't always need to tell the truth to people who ask the questions, or that the dialogue between characters doesn't need to be truthful all the time.

And as wise men said once: Wee Wiz azkz tze queztionzs!

Edit: Holy shit this exploded! Almost 300 upvotes! Thank you guys so much.


** Yeah. He grew up in an environment where telling the truth or lying would get him the same punishment and that never actually went away in school either.

Omission, evasion, just do it and face the consequences later, say nothing and let people draw their own conclusions.

Harry would let stuff slip. Sometimes you don't know or think about how abusive something was or remember how it would sound to people. You learn very quickly from other people's reactions what not to say.

That would be tough to articulate in fic though.

I think people confuse lying with scheming.

** Totally, if anything living with the Dursley's would have made Lying come almost naturally to Harry and you'd think he'd be better than average at snooping around? Also why is harry written so articulate at such a young age when up til Hogwarts he had very limited social interaction and realistically would be a socially anxious mess. So many fics seem to throw the effects of childhood abuse and bullying out the window as soon as Harry leaves the Dursley's.

*** Because different children respond to abuse in different ways. Even when it's the same abuse. I used to be an early intervention specialist in an elementary school. The primary purpose of my job was to identify children like Harry who would have flown under the radar since they didn't come in to school emaciated and with two black eyes, and make sure they and their families had appropriate resources and authorities overseeing things if it was needed.

Very frequently in families with multiple siblings in the same school, the siblings would be have completely different ways of coping with the same home life. One might be withdrawn and twitchy, where the other might become extra sassy or physically aggressive with other students at school.

**** My brother and I are living examples of this. We are only a year apart, grew up in the same house with the same father, but we responded entirely differently. I grew incredibly reclusive and quiet, became very introverted and focused on my schoolwork, then graduated a semester early so that I could leave and hopefully find a fulfilling career as soon as possible.

​

My brother started acting out, was incredibly social (with the wrong crowd), started committing crimes (slowly escalating in severity) for attention/venting, then eventually did some stuff that led him to start serving a six year sentence in prison. We were incredibly similar as kids (as per family members), but both of us just handled things differently.

​

I feel like canon Harry is certainly a real possibility. He's quiet at first, not very trusting of authority figures, and incredibly independent. People seem to think that he's going to be an absolutely broken child if this happened in the real world, but I think this is far from the case.

** I have to interject here that the Canon-Golden-Trio are rather duplicitous lying little s**ts.

First year Harry shuts up about almost being a Slytherin and his spot at the Quidditch team until the last possible moment. Hermione sets her teacher on fire and doesn't suffer consequences. Ron is bitten by a dragon and keeps mum for Hagrid.

Second year they successfully scheme to steal boomslang skin to brew polyjuice potion, which is apparently such a notable ingredient that Snape threatened Harry about it with veritaserum in book 4.

In Book 3 Harry starts of by overhearing Molly & Arthur's fight and not mentioning it, even though it was kind of relevant to do so. Harry sneaks into Hogsmeade and doesn't tell anyone about it & even overhears another conversation he has no business listing to which gives him burning questions. Those three manage to keep their gobs shut about aiding and abetting a known mass murderer, Sirius Black, and Hermione kept the Lupin-is-a-werewolf & time travels on a daily basis secrets on the side.

In book 4 Ron is petty enough not to tell Harry to go see Hagrid. Harry is busily contacting Sirius, and accepting stolen goods from Dobby, and crushing silently on Cho. Hermione is quietly dating Viktor, and at the end of the book kidnapped a known reporter and blackmailed her into silence. Also, did you see Ron have any public "oh my God my pet rat was a Death Eater" freak-outs?

Don't get me started on book 5 and their DA club where we all know that only just 1 person squealed. Not to mention Ron & siblings keeping silent about his parents joining a secret anti terrorist organisation. Let that sink in: being able to trust your underage children to go off to boarding schools and having them keep silent about their parents efforts and contributions to the effort against magical terrorism and facism.

And that is not even going into books 6 & 7.

Frankly, we all know the big canon lies so well they hardly register anymore when the reveal comes in a fanfic. While having a whole lot more secrets on top of that would make it they REALLY have a lot to keep silent about.

If you as an author add another set of earth shattering secrets on top of the canon ones you get the teenagers that either are crushed by them all, or overcompensate by being honest about everything else. Add into that that the canon secrets are so well known and common place that they barely register as the plot twists they were when Rowling revealed them it is very easily for a reader to feel completely underwhelmed by how the rest of the secrets are treated in fanfics.

** You're right that realistically, more of the kids would lie in the early parts of the series, but eh. It is a children's book, so I can understand why canon doesn't have it, and sentiment probably has people continuing that pattern (also the aging of the original audience of HP). Definitely a missing link though that could make fics more interesting. :)

Lying has its flaws as a technique, anyways. The real trick that I think we need to see more (that'd work for the adults, too) is the Faerie Approach - to tell the truth dishonestly. For a basic example:

Person One - "Hi, what's your name?"

Person Two - "You can call me Bertrand."

The answer isn't a lie - Person One can indeed call Person Two Bertrand. It's not their name, so it's a dishonest answer, but they can still call them Bertrand, so it's not untrue. For a more fandom-appropriate example:

Angry Indy!Harry - "Where's my inheritance, Dumbledore? Did you steal it?"

Manipulative!Dumbledore - "I'm afraid many inheritances were lost in the war, many ancient family lines ended and family manors destroyed. Even funding the war itself was costly indeed. Many members of my own Order contributed to fund medical necessities, potions ingredients, safe-houses and equipment, all the little logistics of war."

Again, none of that is untrue (assuming a Noble!Family world, anyway), but he never actually answers the question. With that answer, Dumbledore could've stolen every last knut and still not have lied.

******* I'm honestly not sure if I have any Death Eater Harry fic that are good. They're usually one of two - either too fucked up for my taste, or trying too hard to keep Harry as a 'good guy' via trivial reasons.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise) is one of the better ones I've read. Full, completed fic of Harry's rise to the very top of Death Eater society.

The only other one I can rec is the Downward Spiral saga on FFN. I don't remember the names of the fics, but it's decently popular and should pop up on google. It's an incredibly fucked up series. Like not your everyday shock-gore fucked up, but that brand of fucked up that takes a couple seconds to process once you read it. Although it does have it's fair share of gore.

At some points, I actually had to take a break because the fic made me feel sick (and I'm saying this after finding the Black Queen series to be light reading), but I feel like it has the most realistic portrayal of Harry's descent into darkness out of all the fics out there. Like what I'd expect a death eater's story to truly be like. Harry there feels like an actual human being, one with dreams, goals and regrets.

** The thing is that originally he /is/. The early chapters of PS are fun for just that reason. He's quick-witted (recall that parry about stuffing heads down toilets?), he's /not/ got a temper, but a very controlled approach to living with the Dursleys in peace ("don't ask questions", so he doesn't), he sneaks food at night out of kitchen even when he's grounded with no dinner ... I don't think I recall a direct instance about lying, but it's implied, when he comes up with explanations for his accidental magic so that they aren't traced back to him.

So IMO, he's a reasonably sneaky, sly person. So there is that; -- but once he's at Hogwarts, it all just disappears. A notable exception is HBP (ex., when he manipulates Ron into believing he's drunk Felix Felicis) which I quite enjoyed, for that reason, and of course, there's this, in Slughorn's memory:

#+begin_quote
  It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.
#+end_quote

I guess it has to be written off as author's intent, Harry's character is a point that was made; going back to the general core theme of the series, that Harry and Tom Riddle's backgrounds are similar, but they chose to be polar opposites, amongst which, one's a liar, and the other is not.

.

In more general matters, of course a lie only helps you selectively. Really big lies, in fact, have a habit of coming back to bite you, so it's hardly ever worth the hassle. I dunno there's much to be gained going down that route. The easiest way through life is letting people hear what they want to hear, not lying (not lying, because this is only using their own perceptions and biases against them). With actual lies, you always have to balance your loss in reputation when the lie is discovered with the gains achieved by it, so it's a headache, and the best statements include as much truth as possible, and only as many lies as needed.

And the closer you are to a person, the less consequential the lie should be, because by definition closeness is what you achieve by sharing truths. It doesn't really matter whether you or I like Harry's friends (I don't, my idea of friends is leaving things be whenever asked for that, precisely because I don't want to hear lies instead): Harry does, and as such it's natural that he would tell the truth.

The rest -- as far as FF is concerned -- I'd simply put down as a lack of skill on the author's part. Regardless of what they think, most people are actually terrible liars; and at the very least, for obvious reasons, not consciously making an effort, i.e. looking at their tells, and practicing to get better at lying. But if that is so, it's no wonder they'd be bad at writing about it, too; and so you get mostly dumb/unrealistic scenes.

** Harry probably lied a lot in primary school- to teachers asking probing questions, and in his actual work so Dudley wouldn't look bad or whatever- I honestly can't remember if that's fanon or canon at this point.

Yeah, he's always struck me as a pretty good white liar, but for bigger lies I'd bet his face gives him away a lot- not always though. He's probably a 6-7/10 liar.

Hermione's a rubbish white liar, but she's had a few good big lies (like the troll thing, hiding the DA, lying to Umbridge). Seems like when she's got prep time she can spin a tale, but she doesn't lie often enough to be good at it on the fly. 5-6/10.

Ron probably white lies quite easily like most kids with fussy parents. Lies about if he cleaned his room yet, if he's done his homework etc. I feel like he has the potential to get very angry and forget his lines for a big lie, but most of the time he can lie very well. As he matures and can keep his head better, his lying score increases. 8-9/10.

*** Yeah, the trio lies pretty regularly. I don't really understand where this idea that Harry spills secrets like a sieve comes from. Here's a fun example of Harry (and Ron) deceiving Professor McGonagall.

#+begin_quote
  “Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?” It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines.

  “We were --- we were ---” Ron stammered. “We were going to --- to go and see ---”

  “Hermione,” said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him. “We haven't seen her for ages, Professor,” Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron's foot, “and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry ---”

  Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.

  “Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. “Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been . . . I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.”

  Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose.

  “That,” said Ron fervently, “was the best story you've ever come up with.”

**** Like I said below though, such situations are rare. It's got to do with the very nature of a lie. Its most common use is in creating a better image of yourself, but naturally, this hinges on people actually believing what you say /and/ not discovering this particular lie, because if they do, you're off worse than you were to begin with. It's rare that there are situations where the backlash of the discovery still makes the gains achieved beforehand worthwile. So in other words, it's usually a bet, and one where you can't control the odds at that. That's not a particular attractive proposition, to be honest. And of course, you only have so much credit to spend; if you get caught repeatedly, no one will believe you anymore, making lies redundant (and life complicated).

So it seems to me that the "benefits of lying" isn't a straight-forward, obvious concept at all, which explains why people don't lie all the time (if that is what you were asking).

Also, as a side point, every teacher ever and any other person who spends time around teenagers will assume they talk nonsense by default and until proven otherwise. There's a reason why "my dog ate my homework" doesn't work even once. Teenagers think they are clever, but in fact, they are eye-roll-worthy obvious and predictable, and it doesn't take long until you've seen it all before because it's just always the same.
