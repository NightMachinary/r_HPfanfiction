** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Puppet of Time) is okay. The magic's quite good (esp. the alchemy) but I remember being annoyed by the side characters. There's a bit of bashing as well. Abandoned.

linkffn(Regrets Collect Like Old Friends), astonishingly, is complete after something like 9 instalments. I remember enjoying it quite a bit, but getting frustrated at the pacing. There's also an extremely annoying American OC.

I think there's one other, very similar to Slytherin at War, but the title eludes me. It's a shame there aren't more time-travelling Draco fics (or Draco-centric fics in general -- I forever bemoan the preponderance of Harry-centric fics in fandom), since he has the most character development over the 7 books.

  Time travel. It's always about Potter. Draco Malfoy doesn't like that fact, but there is no one else who has the power to change the world. Sending his memories to his younger self he hopes to create a better future. Intelligent Grey Draco. No slash.

**** OMG, that makes sense. I have the tendency to call fics abandoned if there were no updates for a year. Then I get pleasantly surprised if there is an update!

I remember reading the PhD stuff on your profile. This is probably one of my favorite Draco time travels, especially because of the premise and how you write his character.

***** Oh, thank you! I really appreciate that.

I will admit I go in and out of love on stories I write, but there is an outline to this one. I just... somehow have to balance fanfic writing time with publications and comprehensive exams and conference papers and marking. And, you know, Reddit, which distracts me something awful.

  AU, time travel. Voldemort won and Harry lost. Life under Lord Voldemort's rule isn't what the Purebloods thought it would be... so a half-baked plot to twist time to save their sorry hides is concocted. But will it work? [WIP]

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

** I'm surprised linkffn(Time To Spare by EmySabath) hasn't been mentioned yet.

It's not just Draco time traveling alone, but also has Harry along with him. It's not a bad fic actually --- probably one of the best I've ever read --- and the fic slowly evolves into a really great Harry Draco friendship fic. Much recommended
