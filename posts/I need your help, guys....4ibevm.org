Hey everyone, it's my first post here! I found this brilliant fanfic awhile back that actually released novels, or free novels I think. I can't really remember, but people praised them a lot.

Apparently J.K Rowling was to sue the writer but she cancelled it and said "she encouraged this kind of this", or something similar.

Thanks for reading, everyone!


** Was it the James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert?

**** The author of that series has not released book 5 yet, as he is working on original works, so you might want to read something else to pass the time :)
