I am supposed to hate Harry's parents right? The fic make me so angry that I have to stop reading to calm down occasionally.

EDIT: I also hate Connor.


** Yes. The whole series caused me to strongly feel a wide variety of emotions. Anger, relief, despair... and very rarely happiness. I skipped school because I had to know things got better for Harry and, honestly, I fell a bit into depression. This was in high school, mind you. I did eventually stop reading somewhere in the sixth book since I realized none of that was healthy.

Still, a story that can cause such a reaction is impressive and thus I always recommend it.

*** It's definitely a remarkable piece of work, but I have to admit I only read the lot because I hate to leave things unfinished and it's not something I would ever read again. As a writer, I envy the author's skill, but the story is intense and as you said very emotionally evocative, but a lot of those emotions are negative ones that you have to be in the right mind to handle.

I didn't have as much problem with /what/ emotions it was trying to instigate as with /how/ it was trying to do that.

The regular formula that was used over and over was that 1. there is an OPed person currently in control of Harry's life; 2. they think\say they want to help Harry but their actions are much more harmful than helping; 3. Harry eventually manages to “win” against them against all odds.

The problem I had with it was that /all/ OPed characters like this were acting like fucking idiots. Dumdledore, what's-his-name Dumbledore's mentor, Lily, etc --- if you think about it, their only /real/ motivation was not to effectively manipulate Harry in-universe, but to manipulate the reader's emotions out of it.^{1} Once you realise this, you don't even get frustrated by their idiotic actions --- you either close the story entirely or start skipping frustrating parts to read the interesting ones (e.g. descriptions of magic and battle scenes).

^{1} well, that and maybe to support author's opinion that preventively disabling a walking potential WMD controlled by a child's mind is /eeviii~l/.

**** Well, mostly. Looking back, the plot is a bit far reaching and overly complicated. The author also expands upon things that don't necessarily need explored. Still, the author's way with words and emotions is astounding. Their ideas were, at the time, new and amazingly immersive- which still hold up over time.

** Yes, you are.

This fic is extraordinary, and I assume the author has some experience or study in mental health issues because it is so accurate. It caused me to experience a lot of emotions and thoughts that hugely improved my life and helped me work through things that I hadn't even realised were an issue until I saw Harry face them.

It does get a bit bogged down later, though, although it does wrap everything up at the end.

Also, look at the dates: it seemed to update with a new, extensive chapter every single day for 7 long, novel-length books. How?
