A friend just suggested a very interesting hypothesis to me: what if Harry was black? What if the Dursleys were racist? That could be why Petunia hated him, why his hair never laid down, even why he was subject to much discrimination even after rejoining the wizarding world. It could be the basis of people's objection to Lily and James' marriage, and it could explain why Severus hated james so much.

Rec me fics if they exist! I will take anything!

** If I were writing a book that dealt with issues of race, I probably wouldn't use a story about evil wizards to do so. Most fanfictions are about entertainment. I don't see how much entertainment could be gotten out of "what if Harry was black". My general rule in evaluating fanfiction is that changes from canon should only happen if there's a reason for them. Someone could write fanfiction with a more serious purpose, of course, but those fanfictions in general are rare. I think most authors with the skills to do this would be better off writing an original fiction.

Fics where Harry is more or less incidentally black would work better. But I'm not sure why you'd want them. But, it's not like that's my concern.

** I've seen this posed so many times, I think it's totally unnecessary. The Dursley's reasons for hating him were his magic, pure and simple. He faced discrimination as a Half-Blood. Snape hated James because he got the girl and he was bitter. Why add in him being black?

Furthermore, there's absolutely no indication that people of other races are discriminated against in any way Kingsley is a Senior Auror, Cho was immensely popular and the Patils never had anything like that levelled against them.

EDIT: Lee Jordan commentated on quidditch games, Angelina Johnson was Gryffindor captain, Zabini was black and Slughorn brought him to the Slug Club. All of these are prestigious things and wouldn't be handed out in a racist culture.

Retelling the original series with that as the only change would not be interesting. Retelling the series with that as one difference, with several other differences that synergize well with this change, would potentially be interesting. Keeping all of canon intact aside from Harry's skin color gives the opportunity for other potentially interesting stories with some of the same characters.

It's similar to genderswap stories. If you /just/ genderswap and keep Harry's personality the same, it's going to be pretty boring. But you can genderswap and then make more related changes to create a good story.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes. White people enjoy a position of privilege relative to non-white people. White people see themselves portrayed in all circumstances. If you see a protagonist, a major character, or an interesting character of any sort, it is outrageously likely that they are white. Significantly more probable than we would expect if the characters were randomly sampled from the population.

So there are three problems with turning Shacklebolt white. First, that it indicates the author cannot stand to have even one black character in a series with few black characters. This suggests they have a strong bias against black people. Second, it's just plain boring. There are already a billion stories with all-white casts. Third, it reinforces the idea that all interesting characters /must/ be white.

Turning a character black, on the other hand? Instead of whining "I must see every character as my race! Even one character in fifty being non-white is too much for me!" it merely says "I would like at least the occasional protagonist to be my race, please". Black characters are less common than white, so it's a bit more variety and showing a less commonly portrayed viewpoint. It helps show others that not all characters must be white.

Even then, if the author provided a good reason for turning a character white, I'd probably be willing to go along with it. It would be a mark against the work, but not an insuperable one.

  Why is your justification valid when you use it and not valid when this hypothetical racist person uses it? Either both are wrong or both are right.
#+end_quote

It could be interesting to turn the Aurors into a company of skinheads in a fan fic. In that case, it would be sensible to turn Shacklebolt white or remove him from the Aurors. All else being equal, though, it's less interesting to turn characters white or male because there are already lots of characters who are white and male, so you're reducing the character variety within your story.

#+begin_quote
  Does turning Harry black mean you cannot stand to have even one white main character?

Hermione and Ron ring any bells?

Someone writing fan fiction does so generally because they've read and enjoyed the source material. In this case, that means finishing seven books with a white protagonist.

#+begin_quote
  Why does what other people do (write more white characters) justify changing a character's race?
#+end_quote

People generally want some originality in their writing. If few people are writing non-white characters, there will be more unexplored space with non-white characters.

People generally want to be able to relate to characters in stories they read. It is easier to relate to characters like you. This is not achieved simply by changing a character's skin color, but by changing their culture and background. Some cultures and backgrounds are highly correlated with particular skin colors.

  If I was at a creative writing class and everyone wrote black main characters, would I be justified to write a white main character "because obviously this class is biased against white people and there are too many stories with black casts in this classroom"?

If you wish to write something from a perspective that differs from the perspectives your peers in the class are using, then it might make sense to write a story with a white protagonist.

Trying to remove white people from their enshrined positions of privilege to make room for others isn't bias against white people.

Systematic cultural bias against white people does not exist in most areas of the world. Personal bias against white people can exist. Systematic cultural bias against non-white people exists in many areas of the world.

******** I agree it would be interesting if accompanied by other differences that synergized with it. But I can't think of any synergistic differences to add that don't sound like they'd make a bad story. I don't mind the change, but I don't understand why anyone would want to make it. What do you think race could add to Harry Potter?

I don't think that changed race alone counts as interesting, at least not interesting in the way I want fanfiction to be. I want fanfiction to have a purpose or story motivating it, to be more than just a collection of arbitrary decisions on the part of the author.

OP mentioned racism motivating existing relationships that Harry has. If racism is an issue in the wizarding world, then it's quite likely that it would affect more relationships than OP mentioned. If Ron's racist, then he's not going to befriend Harry unless strongly induced. Several others would feel the same way. There might be a small band of non-white people sticking together to keep their sanity, or maybe Harry would expect such a thing but find out that the minorities are fracticious, with the Patils being happy enough to interact with Cho Chang but all three of them looking down on those of African descent.

Perhaps the blood purists also tend to be racist. Perhaps Voldemort is supportive of minorities as long as their blood is pure, making his support base less enthusiastic and less firm, but not in a way that could help Harry, resulting in a three-sided war. Perhaps Voldemort is actually the lesser evil here, resulting in an uneasy alliance.

If that doesn't seem potentially interesting, I'd guess it's because people are getting tired of hearing about racism. It's fine if it's elves versus dwarfs, but white people against black people? That's been an issue for, what, five hundred years? But black people can vote now, or at least the laws say they can, so we're done and we can stop talking about it and go back to pretending that black people don't exist. And if you read something portraying the ins and outs of everyday racism, you might recognize some of that behavior in yourself. Safer to just ignore it.

Per se.

Do you only go for canon-compatible fiction? Campaign against all AU works?

As for racism in the wizarding world being unnecessary, you're dealing with long-lived people, many of whom grew up in the muggle world. It is a clever bit of magic that would force them all to think that black people / Asian people / Arab people / the French / Manchester United are humans and fellow citizens. Does the Sorting Hat do it? Or do racists simply not get their Hogwarts letter? How does it distinguish between racism present in the Muggle world and blood purism? You might say that the whole Potterverse is distinguished from our world in two ways, the presence of magic and the absence of racism, but that strains credulity to the breaking point. Did the Obliviators put in extra hours to make people forget their racism?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It was phrased inconsistently. "Rec me fics" -> "has anyone done fanfiction in this vein?" versus "hypothesis" -> "this might be canon". Since this is [[/r/HPfanfiction]] rather than [[/r/harrypotter]], you might reasonably assume that this person is probably talking about fanfiction more than canon.

******** Not at all, but other AU changes generally add something to the story. Changing Harry's race changes absolutely nothing. Literally nothing. Race was never as big a deal in the UK as it was in the US and if Harry was black there would be no real difference and the fanfiction would be identical to the books except there might be a line about him being black and maybe the odd race joke tossed in. Look at Lee Jordan for yet another example of why noone would give a damn about skin colour. Hence it is an unnecessary change. A necessary change to make it AU would be something that actually adds to the story like Harry being much more powerful or something.

Well that whole long-lived thing is a pretty fanon idea but lets run with it. A 200 year old pureblood will be used to the days when muggleborns are scum, and it's acceptable to curse muggles for fun. Skin colour will not come into it.

********* Lee Jordan is mentioned all of what, maybe twelve times in the series? Mostly in passing or as a commentator. Saying that Lee Jordan is proof that there is no racism ignores the fact that the books are from Harry's perspective, who as a probably white boy with very little connection to most of the minority characters, isn't likely to A)be present for or B) actually notice instants of racism that aren't of a larger magnitude. Pointing to Lee Jordan isn't a valid reason--if there was racism that he was facing, Harry is a biased narrator who isn't likely to see or mention it.

I understand that you personally don't like the idea, but you are blatantly ignoring several good points that tries_to_explain is bringing up. The fact that a 200 year old pureblood might also think that muggleborns are scum does not negate the very high possibility that a muggle raised witch who is also 200 was raised with very racist ideas during her formative years when she lived with muggles. A 200 year old pureblood not paying attention to skin color does not mean that another wizard wouldn't, it just means that your particular hypothetical character doesn't.

Changing Harry's race could absolutely change things. It could change a lot of things. It could introduce racial tensions that canon harry wouldn't have noticed minorities facing, it could introduce cultural or character traits that canon harry didn't have, etc. It depends on the author.

In fact, Tries_To_Explain has a list of potential changes above.

Honestly you can claim that it would change it all you like but at the end of the day race plays an extremely small role in British culture and I don't think making Harry black would change a thing. You talk about cultural or character traits, where would he have picked those up? He still lived with the Dursleys they wouldn't have taught him anything about his culture.

I just think the only people who think this would change much are American and seeing as the book is set in the UK I don't think it changes anything.

I really can't see it. Most of the events in the books happen inside the wizarding world, which isn't racist at all. It seems to me like you think Harry being black would make him react differently to situations, which unless I'm really misunderstanding your point makes you kind of a racist.

Hell, the situation with the Dursleys already mirrors racism a bit with their abuse of an innocent because of their irrational prejudice against wizards. Harry Potter is at its core a story about how your blood doesn't matter, but your choices do, and how people who think different are dumb. Thinking that changing the ethnicity of Harry would make him a different character is missing the point.

The phrase 'whiteness' doesn't really refer to race/ethnicity in a modern context and has more to do with power differences between majority and minority, representations of issues and how one dismisses the other, such as a narrow view of the world as afford by being assumed and thus unaffected by expectation (e.g. when in the majority you can do whatever).

Nothing rides on Harry or any other character for being white because they are assumed to be there, he doesn't have to /think/ about being white. Whereas, realistically, if Harry was black/minority this probably wouldn't be the case.

But the book as a whole doesn't have to worry about this because its a children book and its set in a white world where blood status takes president, it just a little disappointing that as a device it wipes out nuanced discussions of the issues and differences effecting race, gender and sexuality.

Someone else already pointed this out to you but i'll say it again since you clearly didn't get it. The reason it is a hidden message is so that people who are already racist/sexist/homophobic will read it and think "why the fuck is Malfoy so annoyed by something you're born with...oh..."

Also once again it has been shown that people who read HP are less racist than those who don't.

And again "correlation does not imply causation" the article your referring to didn't show anything about or anything about HP and reading that we didnt already know, which if that those who read are more socially open and accepting, /because/ they are open to different perspectives.

In the HP verse by not addressing real world differences everyone regardless of who they are and their creed becomes homogenized.

Because the majority of the UK are. They aren't in power, there's just more of them in government because there are more of them. You make that sound as if white people are a political party.

"correlation does not imply causation" except in this case HP is used as an example for the study because so many British kids started reading for pleasure because of it.

You know what maybe it would have been good for Hermione or Harry to be black, sure. The only thing is noone gives a fuck. Really. Not a single fuck. Frankly it disturbs me how you see the differences between races. There would be no change in the books plot whatsoever, no difference to anything really. Honestly only Americans could possibly care this much about skin colour.

No correlation and causation still applies, harry potter was such huge cultural phenomenon that I can cross tabulate those that rape with those that read hp and come to the conclusion that hp causes rape. It simply doesnt work like that.

I bet you don't see race right, it's meaningless, has no bearing on life chances, how people talk to you, how people react to you on the street, how their presented in the media, what people expect from you. You've suggested your from the UK did you not see how the roma were covered, or pakistani people and muslims portrayed, or how people talk about Bradford?\\
Race may not be as politicised in the UK, and due to the size of the population has never been as aggravated the state of america. But race and racism remains an issue. That no one gives a fuck is not true, because obviously you do, why are you so adamantly against the idea of black Harry? Why is it important to you that harry is white? It doesn't matter remember.

Moreover, this whole thrend is a hypothetical over fanfiction, the real story is over the horse has bolted, and no one as far as I can tell is suggesting that it be rewritten, only explored through fanfiction like gender and sexuality has been done a 1000 odd times.

************ "the colour of the ruling power"

Again, skin colour isn't a political party. You don't seem very well versed on British politics, frankly you sound like you spend a lot of time on Tumblr.

But anyway, Kingsley is MoM by the end of the series, so I'm standing by my position of skin colour being irrelevant in this universe. If for no other reason than by making it a non-issue JK is able to draw peoples attention away from it and show how irrelevant the circumstances of one's birth should be.

I'm actually Irish so i've well and truly seen how British people treat other races and it does affect things, not much here but some things yes.

However in the /fictional/ HP universe all racial issues are overshadowed by blood status, that is what I meant here. Harry being black or not is secondary to his being a Half-Blood. I'm not adamantly against him being black, I really couldn't care less, however I stand by my point that him being black doesn't change anything in this fictional universe.

I didn't call you racist at all, I said you seem obsessed with race.

I dont use tumblr, I have no need of it, im not 12. What I have is experience of seeing how ethnic minorities are treated differently on basis of their skin daily from outright racism to sublet exchanges. Something that I dont have to think about because i'm in the visual majority.

You didn't call me racist but you implied it and I take offence to it because its not true, as presumably would you. What you have mistaken for obsession is a reply to thread in which race is the key theme and me disagreeing over the idea that race wouldnt play a part in character development. A point you disagree with for whatever reason. I would like to see a black Harry fanfic, you would not. But that I have to be interrogated and attacked for why I would like it or why i think it might be important to have another point of view is bizarre. The point of a Black Harry fanfic would be to explore how race interplay's with the wizarding world, whether JK world does or doesn't if neither here nor there because its told from Harry's perspective as an assumed white person. We have 1000s of fics where Harry is a girl, gay, part animal, pregnant, but even /suggest/ that he be black (and face discrimination because of it) and everyone loses their minds.

Kingsley as MoM as a basis for claiming discrimination doesn't exist is a stawman argument. Look at Margret Thatcher did her being elected didnt end sexism or that sexism didnt exist, look at Harvey Milk in the US, did his raise in politics mean that homophobia ended, and obviously Barack Obama as president, didnt end racism.

Which you have no basis for because our perspective is narrowed by Harry being white, and possibly JK saying race doesn't mean much, but that doesnt mean race wouldnt effect a black Harry or the way people would interact with him. I doubt people suddenly become colour blind after they get magic, its too simplistic. But it works in children story where race isnt a concern because the lead is in the majority and thus is not put position to consider it.

****** Okay I'll give it a go.

First. No method of data collection can be unbiased, this is one the most illustrative points in all academia. Qualitative methods (methods which usually use second-hand statistical or numerical date) fall short in in understanding populations in that people develop questions for specific purposes and then other people interpret those questions how they understand the question and often what they perceive the correct answer to be.

If this /person/ is using demographic developed from a UK census you'd have to know how that census at the time understood nationality, sex, race, social class and ethnicity before you could form anything resembling a demographic for UK population before scaling down the Hogwarts (whose population of students is also disputed sometimes its thousands others less than 300). This is not including the fact that census only applies to those who have a home address, and those who you consider people within the household, if you're an illegal immigrant or homeless you and your children are not going to be included on the survey, and the UK census has always been a little bit... dodgy towards minorities anyway.

So there are a numerous problems to demographics as quantitative method of data analysis at their source, but particularly when applied to a macro to micro population, for example you could end up with 0.5 percent black Caribbean. So while Demographics are useful for some things (such as health problems in populations in which multiple categories of sampling are used to identify population) as a tool to identify the quantities of ethnicity needed to make something representative, it's not so good. Moreover, it will be more useful if we knew how much more likely a particular ethnicity is to being magical before we make any assumptions about representations of minorities.\\
The melting pot comment was in reference to my personal opinion derived from experiences of why HP didn't feel as expansive and true as it could have been* to me*.

Second. Again the Wizarding world wouldn't seem racist towards black people from Harry's perspective as a white person because that's not his priority; he doesn't have to think about it because he's white in a world where the majority of people are white. Moreover, let's not assume that because there are some ethnically diverse characters that the Wizarding world isn't racist towards minorities. In our world there are black CEOs, there's even a black president, and racism continues throughout the echelons of government and society, and while racism is not as massively pervasive in the UK as it used to be it is still an issue regardless of who is present, else sexism would have ended with Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in the 80s.

Furthermore, the plastering over of race as a non-issue due to blood status is in itself quite a white thing to do in literature because it means that you don't have to expand on, comment or include people of different ethnicities and the issues that face as minorities. Terry Pratchett does a similar thing with specism, there is no racism when there are other species to hate on. But really it's just a copout and away to ignore and remain ignorant of the importance of race to individual character and experiences of minorities in general. Moreover, the Dursleys form of hatred of magic has more akin to homophobia than racism, because anyone can be born a wizard/witch, and Dursleys wanted Harry not to be a wizard and tried to quash it out of him, and Harry ‘pass' as a muggle if he wanted/had to.

I think accusation of racism was uncalled for and actually quite ignorant and naive. I am under no illusion that my existence as a white person influences all sections of my life and the opportunities afforded to me, and that this is equally so for those of different ethnic heritages. The idea that being born with any other skin colour would allow me the same privileges and limitations in life, or that I would be the same person had I been born black, is preposterous.

However, I get the point that in the book the main events may happen the same. Through I feel the experiences of those events would be completely different. For example, Harry as a half blood puts him in an either/or category as far as blood status goes, and so he doesn't receive the same level of discrimination that Hermione does. For her, her life is completed tipped upside down by being considered inherently lesser. Therefore, in a racially accepted society as we're assuming the wizarding world is, for a black Harry it would be the exact opposite he would go from a world where he was racially discriminated to a world where that isn't the case. That in and of itself would change him as character more so than being a white boy in the muggle world escaping to world of magic where everybodys still white.

******** First. The problems with all methods is people, no matter how many times you collect or recyclable the data, it will always be bias. The every idea of unbiased research involving people is a fallacy because people cannot be objective; we are fundamentally tainted by our experiences, desires and assumptions, and research reflects that, that's why we have peer review. So even if it was possible to collect data that was wholly unbiased it would still have to be interpreted by people who are inherently biased, if a computer was cycling the data, it would still be programmed by people. Blind studies are good for elimination purposes, testing behaviour, effects of drugs etc. but they're not unbiased. No research method is unbiased.

Second. I don't think you understood what I said. You were the one that suggested you could downscale a demographic so that representations of race could be reflected in the books as done by “somebody”. The only way to do that would be to know the population, aka using a census.

Third. Correlation does not imply causation. A more general point you could gather is that people who read are more likely to be more accepting generally because they are already open to new ideas because they chose to read.

Fourth. Which I addressed in the next sentence.

Fifth. Because Harry's not black he's not going to experience racism, thus we don't see racism because it's not directed at Harry. Had harry been looking for racism or been black, he undoubtingly would have found it. By making blood status the main discriminator, all other identities (and issues there in) are voided in the story.

Lastly. I'm not, but you kinda are by denying the differences of people. Check out Jane Elliot and watch it all the way through, and you'll hopefully have a better understanding of what I'm saying [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZKWkhnSb5k]]

I didn't say that. I said that it couldn't be unbiased, which if true, and what you at first fundamentally disagreed with.

Bias is the human error of research, it will always be present whether you attempt to avoid or not. The move now is not to /eliminate/ bias but to acknowledge it in the body of your work and have peers critique it.

********* I agree no research methods are perfectly unbiased. But I think the demographics data are pretty good. I don't think perfect information is necessary or desirable. Avoiding bias is not possible, but that doesn't mean we should ignore what data that we do have, even though we should acknowledge that the data's strength has limits. Ignoring data is just another form of bias, more severe.

If we can justify ignoring data due to human subjectivity, then racists can too. So the best solution is to agree that we should use the data we have, unless there are obvious strong flaws with the data. In this situation, I don't think there are any.
