Prisoner of Azkaban, page 155 when Fudge is speaking to Madam Rosmerta about Sirius Black.

"Is it true he's mad, Minister?"

"I wish I could say he was [...] Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark, there's no sense in them ... but I was shocked at how /normal/ Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You'd have thought he was merely bored - asked if I'd finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the Dementors seemed to be having on him - and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place, you know. Dementors outside his door, day and night."

--------------

So to clear it up, Sirius Black does not need a psych eval following Azkaban, or any other medley of rigourous treatment plans you wily writers are devising for him.


** He's not psychotic, but that doesn't mean he wasn't damaged by the decade long stint in Azkaban. There could easily be periods of time where he gets flashbacks or has difficulties keeping it together mentally. Heck there are people who have issues from just going to real life prisons where they aren't mentally abused day in and day out. Regardless, I don't think he's as bad as some fanfic writers make him out to be.

  He keeps on referring to Harry as James
#+end_quote

Not in the books, and even in the movies it was only that one time at the DoM. We do get this:

#+begin_quote
  "He's not an adult either!" said Mrs Weasley, the colour rising in her cheeks. "He's not James, Sirius!"

  "I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly," said Sirius coldly.

  "I'm not sure you are!" said Mrs Weasley. "Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it's as though you think you've got your best friend back!"
#+end_quote

It's suggestive, but I think Molly's opinion is somewhat biased so this can't be taken as definitive proof that Sirius thinks Harry=James. There is a scene later in OOTP where Sirius expresses disappointment at Harry not taking a risk that Sirius claims James would, implying that Sirius wishes/would prefer that Harry was more like James, but at no point does Sirius actually call Harry "James" or do anything else to explicitly indicate that he's mentally mixing the two of them up.

All that said, I do agree he needs therapy.

He wasn't mentally mixing them up but I do think Molly had a point in that Sirius projected fantasies of larking about with his best friend onto Harry. The movie was just more obvious about it.

** ...Now that makes me wonder. If Sirius was so calm and collected in Azkaban, despite the dementors, why didn't he retain that calmness and rationality once he escaped? Send an owl to Lupin that "BTW, I didn't do it, Peter was the Secret Keeper all along. Also, I'm pretty sure he's alive and hiding as the Weasleys pet rat, look at the missing toe."

I suppose there could be a number of reasons for that, aside from the Doylist perspective of 'things need to go this way so a relatively-normal teenager ends up saving the wizarding world'.

It might be that after Sirius escaped Azkaban, his emotions came surging back, and he abandoned the idea of a rational compromise in order to try and kill Peter himself. Harry does similar when Sirius is killed in book 5, going after Bellatrix alone.

Or maybe he was paranoid and believed that Dumbledore, Fudge, and the like would cover their ears and have him Kissed rather than investigate Peter's survival; considering that the Dementor's Kiss was authorised on sight, while Dumbledore was the Chief Warlock, Crouch was still in the Ministry (though not in law enforcement), and Malfoy and his ilk were not-in-Azkaban, he might have considered all of them suspect. This briefly comes into play in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Fugitives of Azkaban]], where Sirius ends up in a three-way duel with Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end.

And, another quote for you:

#+begin_quote
  "If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil."
#+end_quote

There's a what-if lurking in there; what if Sirius's overexposure to the dementors corrupted him and turned his 'I am innocent' into 'everyone else is guilty', and he broke out with the goal of not just killing Peter, but everyone else responsible (in his eyes) for killing James & Lily and letting Peter get away?

Like, your average 'Harry is betrayed and wrongly sent to Azkaban, gets revenge on everyone', but with Sirius instead?

Bingo. I imagined that Sirius was so calm because he was resigned to his fate. When he realized Harry was in close proximity to the person who betrayed him and his closest friends, he probably snapped.

My hypothesis is, that while he was imprisoned he centered himself around the idea of revenge, i.e something like repeating to himself "be calm and collected, if I get out of here they will all die". So once he finally escaped the torrent in his mind unleashed, after gathering strength for twelve years.

** Ah...no. Just because someone gives off the appearance of being fine dones't mean they are, and thus doesn't require a psych eval. You can't just spend five minutes with someone and declare them okiedokie. Plenty of psycho/sociopaths know exactly what to say/do to get what they want.\\
In Siri's specific case, however, Padfoot dampened the effects of the Dementors, but didn't block them completely. He could use a bit of therapy.\\
Besides, in many places, a full psychological workup is standard procedure regardless. A general eval and a day or two in St Mungo's to make /sure/ he's fine is a perfectly reasonable response.\\
Days/weeks in some kind of treatment regime? (Probably) not required.

** Not that I have personal experience with the kind of isolation and abuse that Sirius had gone through in Azkaban, but with my own personal mental health struggles, it's generally easier for me to keep it together in the moment and then /afterwards/ is what really fucks me. Not that I'm saying that this is a universal experience, of course.

That line, to me, doesn't discredit the fact that he spent over ten years in isolation, under near-constant mental assault (and only 'near' because Dementors don't affect animals, IIRC, which worked to his advantage as an illegal animagus).

** Extrapolating this quote as proof of sanity is an over simplification with many flaws:

1. Several have already stated that acting normal does not mean you are okay so I won't elaborate.

2. When was the last time Fudge inspected Azkaban? Mental states deteriorate over time and with added isolation and dementors that's brutal.

3. Fudge is a politician and a total jerk off, who's to say he wasn't lying to sound impressive?

4. If the Minister was to visit Azkaban the dementors would surely be removed from the areas he was visiting, so he wouldn't have experienced the full madness of an inmate subjected to that torture.

5. Fanfiction is a creative take on the universe, even canon stories allow author freedom. If you don't like it you don't have to read it. Authors work hard to produce thier stories and shouldn't have to try and please every reader.

*** Hi, thanks for the response.

1. Completely agree. Sirius wasn't OK, but he wasn't catatonic either.

2. Not sure how I'm meant to answer that. No doubt Azkaban is brutal, and you're correct in that it may have been even more than a year or so since Fudge met Black.

3. JK Rowling, as the author, wants us to know more about Sirius Black. Fudge is irrelevent this early into the series.

4. The same would have been true if the Minister visited other inmates too; and they were in much worse condition than Sirius.

5. I know, it's what I most enjoy about reading fanfiction. I think sometimes that one author decides to rewrite canon one way and suddently it becomes the /thing to do/ for many authors to treat Sirius in their own stories, instead of looking for interesting avenues to explore his rehabilitation (i.e. through bonding with Harry or Remus / through hobby etc.)

I'm a fanfic writer myself.

** What really makes me sad is the thought that this quote basically overtly states that Azkaban is basically a prison where they lock up mentally ill people.

Dementors suck the life out of people but they don't suck out their sanity. It honestly makes me think about how we have a long history of throwing people with mental illnesses into prison and basically leaving them in horrific conditions until they die.

** One thing maybe to consider perhaps -given the quote- is that if the minister was visiting Sirius and spending time near enough to chat then the minister was likely being protected by patronus and potentially the dementors guarding Sirius had been moved away to protect the minister. Perhaps Sirius was in higher spirits that day as he got some human company and a lessening of the dementor effect. Potentially Sirius wanted to project calm and rational for his own purposes either to make him feel normal all make him seem normal etc. Sirius was clearly, given his actions in the series neither someone who had fully recovered the trauma of the previous war, to a degree his childhood or his stint in Azkaban but he was also someone who was not totally broken and was still able to function. I'd be interested to see, if he had survived, if he could function seemlessly in a non-violent society after a childhood of dark magic, vitriol and ruthlessness and having spent his postschool years immediately drafted into a war/auror(?) and shadow war societies where violence/ruthlessness would have held him in good stead then years in prison reliving all of the worst bits of that only to be released and living as a dog and then being held under house arrest in his childhood home with an old rival picking at your insecurities..

** Insanity doesn't mean you have to be a raging lunatic. While Sirius wasn't as affected as others were, partly due to his animagus abilities, he was still held in solitary confinement for over 12 years. His only company at that time were Dementors....not the best mates to have. Let's not forget that the conditions in Azkaban are deplorable.

No matter how calm Sirius looked, he definitely needed treatment. That's basic human psychology.

** I have no idea about these fics being A Thing (please recommend any good ones where Sirius sees a shrink, if indeed they are trending). That said, I have impressed many people with how "normal" and "intelligent" I am despite having oh so many problems.

The idea that you don't have issues unless you're screaming babble in the corner is kind of... I don't know if it's insulting or dangerous or just wrong. Probably a combo of those?

I mean, go to the average real prison. Those guys are mostly not in a fetal position repeating a mantra or something. You can have normal conversations with them. Many will just "look bored". Odds are the vast majority of them would still benefit from a psychiatrist. Either to work through trauma (which they're disproportionately likely to have endured), or to deal with illnesses (which they're more likely to have. Which, hey, when you realize the mentally ill are overrepresented in prisons AND still more likely to be the targets of a crime than commit a crime... That's super fucked up).

So... Those are my two cents.
