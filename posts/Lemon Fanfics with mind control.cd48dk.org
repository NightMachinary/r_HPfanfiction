** In this type of fic, is the controlled person aware of what's happening (as in their body acts against their will) or is it more like Imperius where they happily do whatever's asked until they wake up?

Don't shoot me, I write bad smut sometimes and was curious.

*** To my knowledge, the only 2 "canon" mind control power in HP are the Imperius Curse and Love Potions. In both case, it's more of the later than the former so I guess you will be more likely to see scenes like this in this kind of fics (really "rapey" though).

***** I always considered the Confundus as an inferior Imperius. So you can use to it "push" someone in the right direction but it can't make it a puppet like the Imperius do.

In the case of this thread, that would mean that you can't really use the Confudus to make a girl sleep with you, unless she really wanted to do it in the first place.

​

As for the Memory Charm, does it really count as mind control? You can make someone forget what happened, but you can't "control" that person with it (unless you take the road of "Wipe everything and make the person believe you are her Significant Other to gain favors) but it seem really risky and too much troubles compared to the other spells.

​

On another not, thanks God Rowling wrote children book, in an adult setting, her world would be extremely disturbing.

  Ignored by his friends, humiliated by the ministry, hated by the public, and hunted by his enemies... Suffering under a weight that threatened to shatter him, the mind arts finally gave him a tool to strike back to the world. And he was going to use it, no matter the consequences.

** Good luck with this one, I asked this once before, fruitlessly....

That being said, if you're in the mood for good mind control stories, and you can't find the fix here, I'd direct you to a [[https://mcstories.com/Authors/Jukebox.html][favorite author of mine]]. [[https://mcstories.com/Authors/Pan.html][Pan]] is also good. [[https://mcstories.com/Authors/Downing-Street.html][Downing Street]] is often recommended, but is overrated.

It's not Harry Potter, it's all original, but you'll be hard-pressed to find better MC material.

[[https://mcstories.com/Bobblehead/index.html][This]], [[https://mcstories.com/EasilyLed/index.html][this]], [[https://mcstories.com/QuietTimeJukebox/index.html][this]], [[https://mcstories.com/ReliefIsJustASwallowAway/index.html][this]], and [[https://mcstories.com/UpAllNight/index.html][this]] are some of my favorites for MD MC.

If you're looking for something longer, then there's [[https://mcstories.com/CollarSinsub/CollarSinsub.html][The Collar]]. A very slow burn, but very good.

****** Not as far as I'm aware, although some are certainly less explicit than others, and focus on different themes and such.

Some center more around exploring the psychological experience from the subject's perspective, while others are more blatant and blunt in just using mind control as an excuse to write poor smut.

You'd have to browse to find those yourself. As with anything, there's a spectrum, but in this case, it'd be tough to find something that doesn't include some degree of sexuality.

****** We are not censoring discussion, just requesting that it gets moved to a discussion thread. OP did not want to discuss mind control lemons; OP just asked for recommendations of them.

You can see [[https://redd.it/c4fz8u][Rule 9's announcement here]] for further clarification.

You also noticed that we did not remove the comment in which you gave recommendations, just the one that broke Rule 9.

******* I understand now what the rule is, I'm not arguing it, it's not my subreddit.

But to be clear, the effect of this rule is censorship, even if that's not the intent. Obviously if someone recommends a story, and someone else has an opinion on the request as it pertains to the story, they aren't going to make that it's own thread. That's quite honestly rather ridiculous to expect of people.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

How would you know? If I'm not mistaken, I remember a time before this rule, and I had some great discussions with those OPs.

Honestly, I think this is a well-meaning rule, but misguided in implementation.

If the concern is that an OP might not want to deal with discussion, I have an idea; why not give the option to tag the request thread with something to indicate such? Like "Request - No discussion"

That way both the people that don't want discussion in their requests and those that welcome it are happy, and there's more potential for positive engagement.

Thoughts?
