I've just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][ASIM]] and realized that the author published an extended version of the first year in their website as an ePub. I see the ToC of the ePub and the chapter list is practically the same with ffn. Does anyone know the difference between the extended version and the one on ffn?

​

For anyone who haven't read it yet, it's a Harry Potter/BBC Sherlock crossover where Harry gets adopted at 9 by Sherlock and Watson after Moriarty incident. It's good, I love the interaction between Sherlock, John, Greg Lestrade, and the rest of Potterverse cast.

*** Damn, I was expecting more Backstreet Trio fluff. Thanks for the info anyway.

I love the characters here. Each OC (and Potterverse character) is alive, flawed in their own way, and no one is overly OP; except Grandmaster Shin, but even he's not omnipotent. Harry is not a mini-Sherlock, Sherlock doesn't solve the mysteries in five minutes.

The thing that bother me the most is how after everything that happened it still follow some canon plot points. Did they really doesn't do anything to Quirell? Malfoy has a mission and Snape taking Unbreakable Vow? Slughorn and Felix Felicis? Why did Snape still has to be killed by Nagini?

** I read that fic a long time ago and remembered liking it. In spite of what other people said about the OCs, I liked them at that time.

Times change and there are some thing I can't remember about it anymore, especially since my memories of the Sherlock series have become blurry\tainted by the introduction of Sherlock's sister in the last season.

** I started reading it but never finished it. I may try again but it was lacking the of Sherlock sass and deduction in my opinion and I was highly not hyped by Lestrade being linked to magicals for some reasons. Seemed forced to me.

I would love to see a Sherlock like (for deductions and maybe a bit of the sass) adult Harry though (detective or auror).
