  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

Linkao3(Stumbling In Love by WaskeHD)

It's an AU where Harry wasn't raised in Britain so he was never the BWL. It's more of a slice of life with a small subplot related to being Aurors. Most of it is about their relationship.

I try to be rather active and I don't think there is going to be more than 10 chapters more fifteen maximum. Hopefully I am done with the story before October ends definitely before 2020 ends.

  So this is a completely different AU, short thing something.Honks story. Lily and James flee to America, while Lily is pregnant with Harry, who then grows up in the States. Ilvermorny and becomes an Auror. He keeps feeling outside of the norm because he has copied his parents accent getting called the British kid.He ends up too good at being an Auror, because James and Lily are training Harry in case Voldemort comes after them. He doesn't and dies without the Potters.Harry has a confrontation with his boss which gets him fired, so he decides to go to Britain instead to help rebuilt a war-torn country. Sirius is still alive in this timeline. Let's go!

** My favorite Honks story by a long shot is Grains of Sand in the Hourglass. linkffn(12188150).

Highly recommend. Has a unique time travel (Tonks goes back one year), well written and great characterization on the golden trio.

Recently there have been a few attempts at 'Time Traveling Teddy tries to hook up bio mom with adopted dad). Fun idea but I haven't seen one with flawless execution yet. Best is probably Teddy's Excellent Adventure linkffn(13021745)

Another idea that I think has a lot of promise is the "Tonks gets assigned as Harry's undercover bodyguard". However, the ones I know here are very incomplete. Best is probably Bodacious Bodyguard linkffn(13065793). I think it is going to have pacing problems though.

(Recently I have been reading another of that type, Rotfang Conspiracy, which is a smutty Tonks as body guard story. The Honks scenes are fine but unfortunately Harry's characterization varies a bit too much, swinging from edgy/independent/op to insecure/teenager. Also Tonks does the "I'm a sexual creature" thing a bit too much...). Clearly one you should avoid given your dislikes
