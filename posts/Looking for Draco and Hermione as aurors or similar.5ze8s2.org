I recently saw a piece of gorgeous fan art that depicts Draco and Hermione as auror partners, and it led me to wonder whether there were any stories that could complement it. I really like stories where the two of them work together, as fanon has tended to make them the two most intellectual magical people of their generation. Sadly, I have found few stories that do more than use the pretense of Draco-and-Hermione-as-antagonist-colleagues as the thinly-plotted device to get them in bed together. Not that I don't mind well-written Dramione, but I'd love to find a (preferably long) story that depicts a well-developed Draco-Hermione friendship. It may develop into more organically - or not - or it could even be subordinate to the story's main pairing.


** Okay, so I only really know Dramione, but here are some pieces that may or may not fit the bill...

On the longer spectrum that is a prologue to another piece, there is [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1412][The Observer]] by Powerofthebook that doesn't have an established Dramione relationship, but it does lead to it in the second piece in her series, [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=3022][The Remedies of Love]].

I wouldn't be me if I didn't recommend something by everythursday, and based on what you are interested, I'd say that [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1034][When the Bell Tolls]] might be up your alley, but again, it's Dramione, though the lead up is good.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=14][The Fool, the Emperor, and the Hanged Man]] by ianthe_waiting also involves Draco and Hermione working together, but in this case it's Draco as an auror and Hermione helping out? If memory serves correct...

I could list a crap ton more as I love to see these two work together, but they are all pretty much heavy on the Dramione. I'm so sorry! I'd love to see what others have to recommend though...

EDIT: I couldn't remember the title until now, but there is also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/762410][Find Your Way Back]] by Musyc. They do a lot of Draco and Hermione co-worker pieces, but most of them are shorter, fluffy pieces.

**** Thanks for the suggestions! Here's the picture: [[http://arriku.tumblr.com/post/121260566857/auror-partners-u-v-u]] I love the way they're serious and yet their body language suggests they care about each other. Also, Arriku's work across fandoms is beautiful.

***** Oh! That's absolutely lovely! Thank you so much for sharing :) Ever since I read your post, I've been thinking about it... the wheels have been turning, so to speak...

It's unfortunate that there aren't more pieces that focus primarily on their working relationship, as it has SO much potential. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the fluffy one-shots that pop up, but I would /kill/ for a massively long piece that focuses more on their years at the ministry being an absolute super team (Much to Ron and Harry's annoyance!) with a very, very, very, very, very slow burn, rather than a brief glimpse at the beginning followed with 15+ chapters of pure romance. Does that make sense?

****** YES! I would love to read a story like this. The story recommended below, Conviction, reminds me that there are a number of stories where Draco or Hermione are lawyers for the magic community. What about Granger & Malfoy, Attorneys-at-Law?

Edit: This doesn't actually exist, just providing an idea of something fun to read. Sorry if confusing.

** linkao3(Conviction by Dragongoddess13) It's a WIP, pretty sure it's going to be an eventual dramione.

** Know it has been awhile but I like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1055377/chapters/2113373][Straightaway Dangerous]]--it's Dramione and unfinished, but it does have a pretty comfortable friendship (and partnership as unspeakables and fellow werewolves) so far.
