We know that Snape was friends with blood supremacists and that he called every Muggleborn other than Lily a Mudblood. We know that he was famous in school for extensively studying the Dark Arts, and that he studied it extensively before even coming to school. The movies don't highlight these facts about him, but we know from the books he was acting every bit a junior death eater, going as far to laugh when his best friends Avery and Mulciber cursed Muggleborns for fun, very likely doing it himself. James' relationship with Snape was completely mutual, they antagonized each other, the cursed and embarrassed each other, at least James was only cruel to people who bullied innocents.

Snape isn't some bullied little victim who went to the Death Eaters as a last resort. He chose his path, he chose the Death Eaters over Lily, even if he did regret it. While I suppose there is an argument that James marrying Lily was the last straw for him, he still made the choice to join, he could have improved himself and become a better person and chosen the right side but he didn't, he chose the Death Eaters.

It should also be noted that Snape didn't even care that James and baby Harry were going to be killed by Voldemort. In the books, he only asked to spare Lily, he didn't care that a literal baby was going to be murdered because his lord wanted to, only the person he 'loved'.

If anything fully pushed him to become a death eater it was not changing himself after the Lily incident. If Lily noticed genuine change when Snape asked for forgiveness she would have very likely accepted, just like she did for James.

So please stop writing fics as if James is the single reason he joined the Death Eaters, it was very clearly his own idiotic actions.


** I agree. In my opinion, Snape always walked the path leading to Voldemort and Death Eaters. James and the Marauders bullying him or Lily "abandoning" him probably didn't help, but I don't think those incidents had a big sway on his decision in the end.

He hated muggles and felt superior to them, and his prejudices are clear from the memory of when he met Lily for the first time.

I doubt his love for Lily was anything but some sick obsession. I never felt like he cared much about her feelings. He was alright with James and Harry dying, and he didn't stop for a second to think how would she feel if her husband and son died. He didn't care about her and Petunia falling out even though it's clear she was upset about it. He didn't care about her feelings about his friends and their actions.

*** He liked the idea of Lily, a seemingly 'pure' woman who cared for the dark and brooding loner, she was put an escape for him.

It's why I hate fics that try to redeem him or have him as some sort of mentor and it's honestly my biggest critique regarding Dumbledore despite the fact that I feel that 90% of fics do him dirty.

**** Why's that a Dumbledore issue?\\
Dumbledore probably could have made him act like a better teacher, the keeping up appearances excuse is really dumb when you think about it, he's meant to be pretending he's on Dumbledore's side to avoid Azkaban and that's plenty of reason for Dumbledore to limit his actions.\\
But that's an issue more with the plot in general than Dumbledore's character, since everyone in universe does seem to buy the excuse.

Dumbledore's decision to use him as a spy was perfectly reasonable. Such loyalty is hard to find, even if the reason is distasteful, and he's one of very few people who could ever deceive Voldemort.

*** I'm pretty sure the Mudblood incident happened around OWLs, so they were 15/6. And Lily died 5/6 years later. Which means Lily hated Snape for at least 5 years, and Snape was convinced he still 'loved' her despite that many years of her not talking to him and her hating him. That type of one way relationship is an obsession for sure, not love.

It's the other way around. His fights and antagonism with the Marauders and his fight with Lily didn't cause his problematic behavior. His behavior caused the fights and enemies and probably a certain reputation. Putting the burden of your behaviour and choices on other is immature and simplistic.

I figure Snape was always going to go dark. He's a half-blood who has nothing in the mundane world, growing up in a Slytherin entirely poisoned by Riddle. It was inevitable that he'd fall in line to try and gain some worth in the eyes of people he thought could give him a place in the magical world.

EDIT: I also always hated that Harry named one of his kids after him. The man was a bully. Sure it can be said that James and Sirius were as well, but they grew up. It's literally the reason why Lily gave James a chance, because he grew the fuck up and matured. Snape could have been the better man, he could have tried to mend bridges instead of burning every single one. We all have choices, and we all know right from wrong. Snape knew that what Voldemort was doing was wrong, he knew what his "friends" were doing was wrong. But he chose to side with them regardless, and the ONLY reason he "saw the light" was because the object of his unrequited teenage love was going to die. Like fuck off.

The more I thought about the entire situation the more I realized that not only did he not care about toddler murder but assuming Voldemort kept his word he was most likely planning on using the grief and loss from the death of her son and husband to worm his way back into her good graces by playing the I've Finally Seen The Light card and comforting her in the aftermath.

***** He did actually love her though. The fact that he didn't care enough abt James to plead for his life is hardly surprising (he is a bastard after all), and the fact that Voldemort was doing this 𝒕𝒐 𝒈𝒆𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝑯𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒚 would've made it clear that the murder of the one-year-old was not something he could talk Voldemort out of.

When he went to Dumbledore, he asked the same thing. Honestly think about that for a second. Why? Why did he not ask for protection over her husband and son as well? One reason might be that he simply grouped her together with her family and couldn't imagine anything happening to them if she was safe. More likely, however, is that he was still in the mindset of 'I-can-only-save-one-person' that he learnt from Voldemort. Possibly both. WE DON'T KNOW.

And after that, he was Dumbledore's puppet. Literally. He used his love for Lily against him in order to make sure he didn't go back to Voldemort. He was manipulated. For sixteen years. And there is no way anyone, no matter WHAT they did, deserves to have their emotions used against them like that.

So yes, it took an EXTREME wake-up call, and he probably didn't really believe in Dumbledore's cause until three years later or something, but he 𝒅𝒊𝒅 leave. That doesn't excuse his joining the Death Eaters in the first place, especially considering how many people he likely killed and tortured, but it is something.

He was not a good person. He was, however, a hero. And he was, in fact, in love with Lily. I get it: You hate him. Me too. But he was not trying to get into Lily's pants. He basically left well enough alone from fifth year until her life was in danger. Does that seriously sound like someone who's obsessed? Who doesn't truly care about her? Please.

** I blame the movies (Alan Rickman's superior acting) and how JKR flipped it at the end. She never fleshed out James enough to truly show how he changed, so instead, everyone just ends up feeling sorry for poor old Snape when he was no victim. He gave as good as he got, IMO. If anything, Lily probably just slowed down his full transition into the Dark Arts. If he had never met her, nothing would have held him back. That fact that people try and put blame on James or Lily for what Snape did is so stupid. Snape was no hero.

*** I definitely blame the movies not just because of Alan Rickman but also because they cut out alot of the bad things Snape did. Like in book 3 when Neville's Bogart is Snape you had so many scenes of Snape being an ass to him in potions. In the movies you barely have any. I mean to be fair you couldn't keep in class scenes just to show a side character was being treated meanly.

But even apart from that Snape comes across more grumpy helpful like when he sheilds the kids from Wolf Lupin which not in the books . And they cut out his rage at not getting a Order of Merlin when Sirius escapes and outs Lupin as a werewolf in rage despite figuring out that Sirius was innocent. They don't show the moment Dumbledore is disgusted that he'd let Harry and James just die as long as Lilly lived. And you get comedic scenes of him trying to get Harry and Ron to stop whispering.

It seems the movies try to indicate what the books should have more but that it didn't so much. That he is redeemed for actually being against the death eater ideology. Changing his mind because its a hateful bigoted ideology and not just cuz he liked Lilly.

** The people who defend Snape and blame James are like if people said the kids that got shot at Columbine deserved it for bullying those two kids. It's an incredibly cruel position to take.

Let's say Snape was an angelic student, who never did anything wrong (besides frequently use racial slurs and endorse genocidal beliefs). Let's say James was a terrible bully, who picked on Snape for no reason at all.

Would that, then, justify Snape putting a hit out on James and his infant son? Would that justify him being responsible for the attack on the Longbottoms?

Of course not. James may have been a bully, but toddler-murder is a class of its own. Snape is an unadulterated evil individual.

James grew up, and died a heroic death protecting his wife and son. Snape grew up, joined a terrorist organization, and plotted to kill a woman's husband and son because he was obsessed with her. His death was way, WAY too quick.

It takes serious derangement to think "this person was mean to me in high school, so i'm going to facilitate his and his infant son's murder." And THEN, when the infant survived, Snape dedicated seven years to belittling and emotionally abusing the child he was directly responsible for orphaning.

***** There wasn't just bullying. He grew up in poverty with an abusive father, whereas James grew up in a loving, well-off household. Snape was sorted into Slytherin, where he would need to act in a certain way to be accepted by his peers. If he openly protested against the abuse of muggleborns, he would be facing bullying from the children he shared his dorm and common room with too.

Rather than school shooters, I would compare Snape to a former neo-nazi. School shooters decide what they're doing on their own, rather than following a group credo.

Personally, I don't think Snape thought too hard about what the prophecy meant. He definitely didn't know who it referred to. He just wanted an in with Voldemort, to prove that he was useful. He was probably blinded by his loyalty and the feeling of being part of something.

He was terrible to his students, and really shouldn't have been allowed to teach young children!

So in another universe when that didnt happen and Snape was raised in the Prince fammily he would probably just end up just like a pampered predujice asshole like Draco, then to be accepted on Slythering and everything would happen just follow its course.

I guess you interpreted the bit about Dumbledore asking about a message as that Snape was already a spy? I can sort of see why you'd think that, but given the first words out of Snape's mouth are "Don't kill me", I don't believe they're in cahoots at this point.

Admittedly we don't know much about what the death eaters did during the war, but we do know that in the second war muggleborns were killed as well as resisting magical families, and there were many attacks on the muggle population. It would make a lot of sense that Snape did more than torture people on raids especially on muggles, considering his canon dislike for them.

********** I'm personally of the opinion that you got that backwards. Snape didn't go dark because he was being harrased, he was already dark and a dick, and James and co harrassed him because he was choosing to be dark.

Based on the practiced actions of Snape and Draco in the books, the Slytherins of the time during the ramp up of the civil war were most likely taunting the Light siders that had relatives die.

Draco to Harry, paraphrase: You'd better be carefull, Potter, if you don't want to go the way of your parents.

What a dick.

So yeah, I'm sure that James and co. did all kinds of embarrassing things to junior death eaters to try to fight back and teach them lessons. You know, when they were mocking family members of victims of Voldy's attacks, or cursing their fellow students in the halls with dark curses.

And yes, actually. I would say the smart thing for Snape to do would be keeping to himself rather than joining the murderous Wizard Racists who like to go out and torture people.

I really don't know why this is so complicated. Snape /chose/ to join the Death Eaters. James /chose/ to reform himself to be less of a git.

James matured, became a good person, married his girl, had a son, and sacrificed himself for the miniscule chance they could survive.

Snape never matured and continued to be a bully while doing the bare minimum to get Albus to protect him, and was a general dick all his life. He could have changed his ways to be a better example to the Slytherins of how they don't have to be evil, but instead he continued the same pattern he learned from junior death eaters in his youth.

I hate fanfictions where James is portrayed as a horrible human being while Snape is being seen as he smells of roses. James is the far better person/friend, he and Harry are really simulear, both go to extremes to protect their friends, James broke the law to help his friend with his incurable condition.

*** James v. Snape is one of my fav discussions in the Harry Potter series.

Snape came from an abusive household and carried a lot of emotional baggage, and thought muggles are scum coz his father was a drunkard. He wanted power so he could fight people like his father, and thought his power is gonna impress Lily. He kept going down that path and lost Lily in that process.

James on the other hand also tried to impress Lily with Quidditch and his pranking. I would like to believe he grew up when Sirius left his house and came to stay with the Potters. The war must have felt real at the time. He realized fooling around isn't an option anymore, dedicated himself to fighting Voldemort and Lily fell in love with him.

I would like to believe both loved Lily but it was easier for Lily to love James I guess..he came from a set of loving parents and she probably saw him as a star in the darkness or something. I'm pretty sure if Lily and Snape had pursued a relationship, it would have been toxic. He wouldn't have gotten along with her Muggle parents, and would have tried to cut her off from the Muggle world.

It doesn't make what they did "right", but their behaviors also don't condemn them to the worthless, evil piles of trash so many people make Snape out to be.

*** Snape isn't a good person, but I totally agree he is capable of good. He did horrible things for the death eaters but he changed sides and spied on Voldemort when the known consequences were a painful death. He hated Harry and bullied him in class but he didn't hesitate to save his life.

The point of the character is that he isn't totally good or totally evil, JKR wrote him to represent what you are saying. That there is still kindness and that you can still do good when you have wronged others.

My point in this post was that James is not responsible for Snape's decision. Snape was stupid in his youth when he joined the death eaters but he certainly proved that he wasn't irredeemable trash. I don't personally like the character, but I can appreciate his complexity and realism.

*** The thing is, that most people who are Snape champions won't admit that he was wrong, he was a bully or that he had his own free-will and agenda. That he was not just some innocent misunderstood victim.

Sure, he also was a victim of abuse, and bullying. And he deserves some compassion for it. But he was not the only one. far from it. And not all decided to join a group of supremacist who wanted to do a total genocide of the majority of the population.

I can feel bad for Snape, but still consider that he made his own choices when he was old enough to understand the consequences of them, that he had fucked up beliefs, and that he does not deserve a sympathic protrayal in fanfictions. At least in such extend what we see.

And solely blaming James for Snape joining the DEath Eaters is completely ignoring what make Snape...well Snape.

And sorry but, I don't care how kind, creative and desperately someone want to be loved. When you decided it's fine to let someone kill a toddler, you're beyond redemption and yes, you are a pile of trash.

Your kids might turn out better, thanks to your help, we can only hope so. And I'm sure it's what will happen. But Snape didn't turn in a good man.

I do think interesting that you said ttheir behaviors also don't condemn to turn like Snape. And I agree wholeheartedly to this. But here the thing : your kids aren't Snape. Snape is not a representation of your kids. They may share common traits and experiences, but they still can do good.

I do not judge Snape on what he did as a child, or even a teenager. But what he did as an adult.

Trauma is an explanation. But in the same vein, a lot of people lived through trauma, some even worst than Snape, and didn't become Supremacist feeling that a toddler's life is a good bargaining tool against the life of their teenage crush.

It's undeniably a strange outlook, but one more people should aspire to have because it can have such an incredible effect as you stick around for people who often haven't really had that kind of stable relationship before. Kudos to you. :)

I've been on hiring boards for A LOT of mental health practitioners over the years [I'm in the voluntary sector of Mental Health services in the UK] and one of the most striking stories I remember was a young-ish woman talking about this utterly misogynistic kid she'd worked with. He had very distinct and oft-stated views on the place of women in the world and the basic right of men to do pretty much whatever they wished to them.

Due to the nature of the role she was in, she and this kid had to come into contact on a regular basis. A long story short, she was patient and kind and fundamentally non-judgemental with this kid, exploring why he believed what he believed and trying to gently question those beliefs and help him build new internal concepts. Most people would have disregarded the kid as a misogynistic dickweed and thought no more about him. But she stuck around and really made a difference for this kid where just dismissing him as 'a bad kid' absolutely wouldn't. And in the end, he thanked her for it. Not a big transformation, sure, but he sure as hell wouldn't have thanked her when they started. That attitude you have is strange, but it's so important and I do hope you continue it because I bet it's making such a difference to those little Snapes you're working with. :)

While I think I'm a compassionate and understanding person, I really can't imagine not thinking that someone is bad when they willingly kill other people because they think they lesser than them, or to gain some sort of power. Or to advance their agenda. Whatever isn't accidental, or self-defense.

Don't forget that Snape tortured, and at the very least support and actively facilitated the murders of people only because he thought they were lesser than him. And there's a strong argument to be made that he did some murder himself. And so, when he was an adult.

To me, no matter what qualities he had, what suffering he went throught, what good act he did, it makes him, and anyone like him, a bad person.

******* Yeah. I mean so many people say he was 'okay' with Harry being murdered, but I don't think that's true. He loved Lily, and that became his singular constant in life. He cared only for Lily, and didn't care about the consecuences of his actions as long as he didn't hurt her.

He then hurt her. He killed her indirectly, or at least that's how I imagine he would see it.

He deserved to find out that his actions had consequences, and this was the only way for that to happen. Lily didn't deserve to die, but Snape sure as hell deserved the heartbreak after she did. He would have to reevaluate everything after she was gone: Try to come to terms with all the heartbreak he caused other people. Try to find someone else to care about. Yet he never really stopped loving her.

So he would have opened himself up to actually care about other people. He would consider himself a part of the fight against Voldrmort, and perhaps even felt Remorse. This is implied when he asks Albus (on the topic of killing him), 'And what of my soul?' You will remember that Albus didn't want Draco to kill him because he wanted to protect a young child's soul. Snape has undoubtedly killed before (he wouldn't be in any place among Voldemort's ranks if he hadn't), and yet he is concerned for his soul. It could, of course, have simply been that he didn't want another tear in his soul, but the implication is that his soul is whole, mended. That it is undamaged. The only way to achieve this is through remorse. In Hermione's words: 'You've got to really feel what you've done.' If Snape really, truly felt remorse for the deaths he inflicted, he has earned his chance. Not absolvement, of course, but the chance to change. To be a better person.

The attitude towards Gryffindors and Slytherins respectively is possibly the most obvious sign of him not completely letting go of his past. He probably realises at this point that the things he did at school were not excusable, at all, but it seems that he is projecting a leniency towards Gryffindors and more strict rules towards Slytherins onto other professors, especially Dumbledore, and is trying to 'make up' for it in his classes. He hates Harry with a passion, because he reminds him of James; 'Lazy, arrogant...' However, his attitude is not at all like that of teenage James. As Dumbledore said, because Harry looks like James, 'You see only what you expect to see, Severus.' If he could stop letting his hatred of James blind him, he'd see that Harry is, in fact, far more like his mother than his father. The same attitude goes towards Neville; He goes extra hard on him whenever he makes a particularly foolish mistake because he can't contain the anger that if only this 'useless' child was the one Voldemort picked, Lily might still be alive. He likes Malfoy for some reason; Some fanfictions say he was his godfather. Honestly, I'm not quite sure about that one. He is obviously quite good at potions; Perhaps Snape just feels a kinship with him because of that. He also hates Harry: Maybe Snape can tell and likes him because of that. Either of those options would work better, but hating Harry is probably the reason. At least I think so.

I like the fanfictions where Snape gets a wake-up call about Harry's life and starts to see Lily in him. Where he actually becomes a decent person. However, the transition should be a slow one. He does not suddenly become Harry's mentor and friend because he knows what he went through. He just starts to see him. Really look at him, not just project James's attitude onto him. He then sees what all the other teachers see: A young boy who has seen far too much and just wants to be left alone. He would then start to feel sorry for his attitude towards him, and perhaps even improve his attitude towards him. He would then see that he fares better in Potions without the added pressure of the teacher apparently hating him, and so he might think that the same could be true for Neville. And what do you know, it works! That is the kind of fanfiction I want to see. Snape slowly realising that his own attitude towards certain people is hindering their ability to learn. Learning how to teach. (Because really, you might like your sarcastic wit, but it has no place in the classroom!) And finally seeing that flicking pufferfish eyes at Harry and Ron across the dungeon is, in fact, a punishable offence- Even for a Slytherin, and even for someone who hates Harry.

If they said they "liked" yelling at children, I'd explore that: what does it mean for you? How does it contribute to your sense of self? Do you know how to talk to children in a way that isn't yelling? (Assessing skills.) Do you know how yelling impacts children? (Assessing insight.) Do you consider your behavior yelling, or is it your family culture to speak that loudly? (I've worked with many folks for whom that one was true.) What leads to your yelling? If it's stress, what skills do you have to manage your stress?

And as for joining hate groups, I'd explore feelings of disenfranchisement, resentment, lack of belonging. I'd wonder whether joining up resolved any of those, and I'd wonder how else it impacted him. I'd encourage him to consider if there are any other ways to meet those needs without the negative parts, and if he said no, I'd apply a cognitive-behavioral approach to examine his core beliefs about himself and why he didn't think he could possibly belong anywhere else.

  Cops choose to become cops.

And criminals choose to be criminals, but the majority of black people commit crimes by their own choice. I know you get sick of hearing this true statistic, but kinda weird that ~15% of the population is committing about 50% of the violent crimes. Weird, right?

Yeah, I'm just gonna answer your second paragraph with a simple question: have you personally experienced any of that? Also, again, not all cops are like that and considering they put their lives on the line in high-intensity situations......

No, what I originally posted was a series of questions requesting the facts. I have no idea what happened to cause the arrest. We only know two things: people swapped tags which is considered stealing and police were called. We don't know what happened between those two events. The fact you're painting all police officers as criminals is very telling of your mentality. Also, you're looking at the bed things that are reported. Did you see the report of a police officer saving a woman's baby from choking (black skin color of the woman and her kid) or were you unaware of that? Wonder what other good things the cops have done that you ignored because it wasn't broadcasted by the anti-police protestors and media.

Because he absolutely /does/ bully his students (harasses Harry and mocks his dead father, demeans Neville and tries to kill his pet, denies Hermione medical attention and mocks her appearance in the same breath), and you've spent a lot of time talking around how his actions affect the people around him (which includes a /lot/ of children over whom he has explicit power) and very little about it.

** Oh ya for sure in the last book you see some of Snapes memories of Snape confronting Lilly after the mud blood incident.

He apologizes for calling her that. But she points our he's hanging out with and supportive of people who use words like that. People who are bigoted towards people like her. He points out not her but she is a muggle born. She's not actually an exception.

That's why he says mud blood in the first place. Sure he was upset. But if you get really upset what drops out of your mouth aren't racial slurs unless you are already racist. I guess muggle borns aren't a race but like the same logic applies here.

Though even if she was the exception it didn't mattet he was still supportive of a ideology that made things worse for her. Being friends with her didn't make his bigoted thought process stop and she was done making excuses for him.

I think people like to think of Snape of this lonely recluse who had no real friends other than Lilly and then post mud blood incident he was pushed further into death eater territory by her rejection.

But really they both had separate friend circles and Snape chose to befriend bigots. It wasn't a survival thing. He was dismissive of their faults and bigotry when pressed by her. He wasn't saying ya they awful but I got no one else to befriend in that house. And he befriended them long before the mudblood incident. It is indicated he had the bigotry bias early on. So there a good chance he was being supportive of ideas and people like this before James started bullying him.

In fact its pretty likely their intense hate might have started because Snape was a bigot. And they constant back and forth was more like Harry Draco style. But James lashed out way more than Harry and may have hated Snape way more than Harry did with Draco to a uncomfortable intensity that neither Harry nor Lilly could approve of.

But that didn't push him to befriend blood purists he was already friends with them despite "liking" Lilly. I've seen some say they were fighting over a girl and from Snapes pov it seems like it. He gets salty when ever she brings him up and it definitely possible he saw James as a romantic rival. But you never see if James felt the same. Its possible but also possible that James looked down on Snape enough that he'd never think Lilly would seriously consider him.

From Lilly's pov she just had a really toxic friend and she finally broke it off with him. But you see it instead from his pov his pain of being rejected for being a wizard Nazi.

I understand that they are trying to make him morally grey. But they are bending over backwards to make you sympathize at all. I know it's sympathy because he is forgiven in the name by Harry as indicated by Albus Severus's name. And I think it fails to really make him morally gray.

Because it seems his redeeming quality in the narrative isn't getting past his bigotry and hate and joining a good side but "loving" a woman who didn't love him back and was actually fighting against the bigotry he was enthusiastically enabling till she was targeted. Which isn't a redeeming quality at all. And it arguably isn't love. You can't love someone and support a hate group that wants them dead.

I don't dislike fanon Snape or deviating from canon to make Snape more likable. But Im not a fan of canon Snape and more than that im not a fan of how Rowling frames his storyline. I feel like Rowling seems a bit too supportive of one-sided feelings to the point where having them alone is enough to be sympathetic for her and it really isn't. Instead it comes off pro Incel. She does it with Merope too.

Everyone else, including Mcgonagall whom is extremely stern/fair and has even made fun of Dumbledore, has said that James was a good man. Also, we have no idea when the bullying started/ramped up. Maybe there was some jealous bath and forth cuz they both liked a girl, a million kids have that rivalry RN. But the serious bullying seems to have occured when he started being close with the Nazi's.

** Snape was pushed into being a Death Eater by a variety of circumstances in his life. To be clear, this does not excuse the crimes he committed or the mistakes he made or the decisions he made, but ~that's the point~. Severus Snape was an abused, lonely, desperate individual lured to the dark by promises of power and solidarity with other likeminded people. Yes, Avery, Mulciber and Voldemort all did their part to draw him in. As did his father. But James, Remus, Sirius and Peter all share equal blame for his descent. They played their part to make the desperate boy more desperate.

Can you honestly say that Snape would have fallen as readily if James and Sirius hadn't been the assholes they were? If, instead of pushing him out with pranks and mockery and bullying out of jealousy of Lily, James had instead attempted to befriend the boy?

Snape has his faults and he should not be forgiven for the mistakes he made. I am not a “Snape was perfect and completely faultless” type of person. In many ways, he was an intrinsically bad person.

But I think reducing the influence James had on his path to “he married the girl I loved” paints James with too light a brush. James Potter was an arrogant, selfish bully. So was Sirius. To a lesser degree, so were Remus and Peter. And their actions cannot and should not be excused any more than Snape's should.

Snape agreed with DEs views before even going to hogwarts, Lily being the exception because they were "friends".

Snape during his childhood/young teens flirted with the dark arts and hung around pepole that wanted to kill his friend, while James went out of his way to help his sick friend deal with his condition.

Add to that James was chosen as head boy, he is constantly put in good light by his former friends and professors, died in an attempt to save his wife and son from certain death.

Snape chose wrongly at every turn and blaming much on the Marauders is wrong, he lost it all on his own, like when he lashed out against Lily in their 5th year.

****** I will give you that it stands to reason Snape spread Levicorpus around given that James knew it. However, the idea that he was actively using it on people is an inference. Not a fact. On the flip side, James eagerly and without hesitation used it on Snape, as well as mocked him in a compromising situation and intended (and possibly did) go further than that and humiliated him. This speaks to me of routine behavior. It's far fetched that the first time James ever acts against Snape is something this aggressive and direct. But I'll give you that, that is also an inference and not a fact.

What is a fact is Sirius' attempted murder of the boy. And there is no other way to describe Sirius sending Snape down the path to the Shrieking Shack. Yes, James saved him but it's as up in the air if he did this primarily to save Snape or primarily to protect Remus.

To your point about him sharing the Death Eater's views before even going to Hogwarts, what proof do we have of that? I don't remember him ever espousing those ideals, save maybe his disdain for Petunia which A. It's Petunia B. Lily was his only friend, he was a child and he was jealous and C. He was routinely abused by a ~muggle~.

Again. I'm not defending Snape's actions. This is less a defense of Snape and more an indictment of James. Yeah, Snape was a dark minded individual. I'm not excusing that. That said, James getting Head Boy doesn't really strike me as a point for his character. Dumbledore has routinely displayed favoritism before towards Gryffindor, and in the height of Voldemort's reign who was he going to give it to?

I'm not ~blaming~ anyone for the decisions Snape made. Plenty of people have lived in horrible, shitty situations and gone through terrible things but still chosen to be good people and make the right decisions. Like, for instance, Harry fucking Potter. But no person is born evil. They are made evil by the actions, reactions and decisions of circumstances and people around them. And James shares the blame for that.

** It does a disservice to efforts to halt bullying to suggest that bullies have no responsibility for what their victims do.

If Snape attempted suicide after the underpants incident, would you absolve James so thoroughly? JKR states James bullied Snape /relentlessly/ - and James's stated reason (not Sirius's guilty excuses twenty years later) for that bullying was that /Snape exists/. That is not minor meanness, that is years of abuse by James. (And yes, Snape fought back; that does not make it any less abuse). Yes, James did share some (though certainly not all) culpability in shaping the adult Snape! (I do put a much larger load on the shoulders of the teachers who had much greater power to change the situation, not just for Snape but for all the students. Hogwarts is not a healthy place for adolescents.)

Moreover, you cannot justify treating a child horribly by "he did bad things when he grew up!" You just can't. James at age 11-17 did. not. know. what Snape's future choices would be. Adult Snape's actions cannot be considered an acceptable excuse for schoolboy James.

Even if James did have a role, nobody pointed a gun at Snape's head and made him join. I think it's important for people to understand that we are ultimately responsible for our own actions. There are exceptions of course... but Snape's life choices led him to where he was and his tragic end was of his own making.

This is not to say that Snape doesn't possess laudable qualities. As Harry said, he was extremely brave and he had a capacity for deep and enduring love. When we can, we have to try to judge people holistically.

** I blame Alan Rickman for being such a good actor that so many people forget what a horrible person Snape was. I'm also convinced that JK changed Snape's roll in the last two books because of Rickman. (Likely Tom Felton also got Draco's future changed as well.)

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) was released in 2002.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (book) was printed in 2003.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) was released in 2004.

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (book) was printed in 2005.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) was released in 2005.

The timeline just suggests to me that she gave Snape a better role because so many people liked Alan Rickman's portayal of Snape.

Anyway, I seem to recall an anecdote from an interview where Alan asked JK if that really was all there was to Snape during the first few films. He seemed to be dissatisfied with the character. JK said that there was more to Snape, and supposedly shared a secret, that from then on influenced Alan's portrayal of the character.

Situations like this are usually the fault of some combination of the actor, the director, and the screenwriter. Or, in this case, the actor, the two screenwriters, and the four directors. Rickman is partly responsible for failing to accurately portray book Snape, but only a small portion.

** Completely agree! Snape was his own man. Nobody else was responsible for his choices. James was a child and just 21 when he died. Snape while regretting that his choices led to Lily dying, continued to be cruel throughout the books, even going as far as to bully children, his students. While he does earn his redemption to an extent, it certainly isn't James Potters fault that he sided with blood purists while having a muggleborn best friend. Not very smart is it?

People take it too far by blaming all of Snape mistakes on James. James was cruel but so was Snape, he called his own best friend a Mudblood. Add into that the natural hostilities that come with Hogwarts houses, and James liking Lily, the entire thing was a recipe for disaster. Snape made a mistake thinking he had exclusive rights to being Lily's friend. He continued to make mistakes throughout his life but in the end managed to break even in saving Harry. He was still cold, cruel and completely responsible for his own actions though.

***** Snape hated muggles from the very start . And you have no idea when he started getting into blood purity. You know he and James immediately got off on the wrong foot but you don't know when the bullying got bad.

And of course abuse and bullying has consequences. But as far as the books go nothing suggests that the bullying had any impact on his ideology. As far as you know Snape was just a bigot who happened to be a bully victim. It would be in line with the no one is all good or all bad message. And bigotry in general does not exist because of abuse or bullying.

You could say Snape grew up in a very bigoted environment he was raised in. But the message of the books is you often get a choice. And Snape did through Lilly.

She was constantly there offering another path an out pointing out the problems in his fixations and the fact he was befriending bigots who did fucked up things. And she kept giving him that opportunity to walk away from it makes a change and he kept dismissing it making the wrong choices until finally she gave up on him.

He did eventually change but he did later after school. He didn't take the opportunity Lilly gave him to walk a different path earlier. And nothing in the memories indicate that James was making him turn towards more bigoted Slytherins.

He doesn't say ya Avery is a dick but he strong and Potter and his goons are harassing me. Instead when Lilly points out Avery does bad things he's like why you only worked up about bad things my friends do other people do bad things you don't get this worked up about. Like James Potter.

This is a set of memories explaining his motivations and his feelings and there is not one memory he puts in that shows his bigotry and his interest in the dark arts being tied in any way to James Potter.

That would be like saying Harry is ok with muggleborns only because his Bully is Draco who is a bigot and if that wasn't true Harry would be a bigot. No he wouldn't.

In fact he'd more likely be a bigot if he saw Draco being a dick and was like no I think this guy is ok and befriended him instead then went along with the bigoted things Draco said because he didn't really care that Draco hated muggleborns. He didn't consider it a reason to distance himself from Draco.

James Potter made Snape paranoid sad, paranoid and bitter. Snape would have been a nicer person who didn't feel the need to harass Griffindor kids . Not that I'm excusing his abuse of his students. Nor am I saying all bullying victims are going to do this and Snape had no control over his behavior. He was in his 30s and perfectly capable of not behaving like this. He is responsible for his own actions

But that grudge against Griffindors wouldn't exist if James hadn't bullied Snape. That is the impact James Potter had. He was a dick to Harry because he looked like James. That too was driven by his feelings towards James ( though it doesn't excuse his behavior).

Snape makes this clear repeatedly.

But James didn't make Snape into a bigot. It was not bullying that made Snape join the Death eaters. And nothing in the books indicate otherwise. The order wasn't just the Marauders it was also Lilly and plenty of others Snape didn't hate. And you don't become bigot and join a hate group just because your bully thinks hate groups are bad. That's not how bully or abuse victims work. You are really underselling bully and abuse victims by suggesting this. Snape was just a bigot who also happened to be a bully victim. Someone you feel bad for but the bullying doesn't justify excuse or even explain him joining the Death Eaters.

Its not hypocrisy she is pointing out its fucked up he is associating with bullies who use dark arts. He is being defensive for his friends by bringing up James Potter even though Lilly and he aren't friends or even close. Once she says she doesn't like James he ignores everything else she says.

The problem was always those friends because they were dark arts supporters and bigots. She wanted to believe her friend wasn't on board with that despite all evidence to the contrary. Until finally she can't anymore.

No there isn't. Unlike say Snape bullying Harry and pointing out constantly that it's directly related to his feelings towards James. Unlike say setting up that fixation Snape has on Griffindor Slytherin rivalry in the memories and his poor opinion of Griffindor from the start echoing his poor opinion of Griffindor students when he is teaching. The book goes out of its way to show you the impact James vs Snape had on Snapes behavior as a teacher. But it doesn't give any indication it had anything at all to do to his ideology.

The parallels are much more like Voldemort who also grew up in a environment that made him resent the muggles around him. Though unlike Voldemort you get to see Snape exposed to things that may reshape his view. Lilly's parents for example and Lilly herself. But Snape chooses to gravitate more towards dark arts and bigotry. And despite having the opportunity to do so the books don't tie this action to James Potter.

Your logic seems to be just because Snape was bullied it must have been a factor in his bigoted ideology. Why? If anything if James and Sirius are both rich purebloods he should hate rich purebloods.

James's bullying having a big impact on his mental health doesn't translate to James causing his bigotry. Especially not when you see indications of his bigotry even before he enters the train.

In fact that seems to exist to specifically counter James influence on his ideology. After all if you wanted to imply James's relation to Snape had any impact on his bigotry at all you only need to rearrange some scenes to be after the train scene. Snape was going home every summer and lived nearby Lilly. But the bigotry is established up front .

Snapes story was about a kid who made very bad choices. He was sympathetic but it didn't excuse or explain his choices. He finally grew to regret them when it was too late .

As for the muggles thing. Yes the voldemort childhood scenes being similar to Harry exist to prove that you are more than your environment in the narrative. You still have choices and Voldemort wasn't doomed to be a bigot because of his upbringing but he chose to be. Just like Snape. Snape chose to change later but that doesn't stop him from choosing to be a bigot and join a hate group before he chose to change.

Just because Snape can be sympathetic as a bully victim doesn't mean someone else must be the reason he joined a hate group or even a major cause. There is nothing in the text that indicates James had any impact on his opinions on blood purity.

Only that James had a impact on how he treated kids as a adult. Again not that I'm saying Snape has no control or responsibility over his actions and its James's fault he harrases Harry or Neville. But James has a major impact on the mentality that powers Snapes actions towards the kids. Snape would be less of a dick to them if James was less of a dick to him. Unlike with the blood purity while it doesn't excuse Snapes actions it does explain them.

#+end_quote

Why would we have to invent reasons when even adult Sirius explicitly admits it was just them being 'prats'? Even in the resulting, incoherent tirade, the worst he calls Severus is greasy (and some synonyms) and 'up to his eyeballs in dark arts'. So James -- who's trying to impress Lily -- and Sirius -- who's trying to salvage his image with Harry, can't explain their hatred anymore than Severus being a swot with bad hair habits.

Sirius is even sceptical that Severus joined Death Eaters /after/ being with him all those years, so it was not about him being a budding Death Eater. Remus' comments about James' continued hexing of Snape while being head boy, and 'well, [James] didn't hex Snape in front of Lily did he' point to James being in control of the supposed 'rivalry', not Snape. He could have stopped it, especially since he was head boy, could have used his powers as head boy to shut down Severus whenever he wanted to, but he didn't.

Because how would he cure his and his buddies' boredom otherwise? Severus was a loner, friendless, and made an easy target for James, who used Dark magic (impedimenta, levicorpus, body bind, etc used in SWM /are/ dark) on him because apparently, he was that much against dark magic. It was a flimsy excuse by Sirius. We know why James hated Snape since the first time they talked on the Hogwarts express. Did he see a dark magic book then, or did he just see the poor Slytherin wannabe who was protected by just the little girl?

The following points should be clear:

A) Marauders bullied Severus Snape relentlessly, without provocation. James and Sirius are aggressive, while Lupin and Peter seem to have been in the background.

Snape tells Harry in a fit of rage how his father only attacked him four on one, Remus thought it was out of line (undeserved) and managed to make them guilty about it multiple times. The bullying is described as relentless on Lupin's pottermore too. Lily does not think Severus has done anything to deserve their hostility in SWM. In SWM Snape takes out his wand at Potter's voice quickly, as though this scenario has happened multiple times. Peter's face shows anticipation during the incident. Everything is practiced.

B) James and Sirius were bullies in general, not just to Snape. Marauders did not think much of putting people in danger as long as they got to have fun.

Harry finds multiple detention slips of their acts in Filch's office. McG comments on their antics, though mildly so, since she's talking to an orphan about his father. Lupin minimises their acts, but let's slip that they had multiple close calls in Hogsmeade during the excursions. Lily equates James to the friend who's called her mudblood, and tells of how James hexed people in hallways because he can. SWM happens after the werewolf 'prank'. James targets a guy who can spill his friend's secret, and whose life he saved, and, showing remarkable callousness, tells Lily 'its because he /exists/'.

C) They didn't have any noble reason to hate Severus for most of their time at Hogwarts. The reason for the bullying is not future order member beating up future death eater. It's much more pedestrian and personal between them and Snape, and evolved through the years.

- Initially starts as an exchange of insults and house pride, and not about light or dark, but childish things like being brainy or brawny, since apparently this is what Slytherin is. James, ever aggressive and entitled, starts the physical bullying with the try to trip

- Sev and James' crush on Lily comes into the picture. James is jealous, Sev is insecure. James trues to show off for her by tormenting her best friend and showing her and everyone how poor and pathetic Severus is.

- Severus trying to find out what they were upto, and Marauders' distaste for his nosiness and knowledge that if he knew what they were doing, they /could/ be expelled, since it was illegal and dangerous for others.

- James' and Sirius' distaste for Sev (whether it being a swot, knowing dark arts, distaste of his general looks)

Their future affiliations may have come into play later, but I doubt it. They didn't think he was a death eater even after swm and the resulting two years where he hung out with many people who turned out to be death eaters. Also, Tom was gaining power during this time (see Lupin pottermore), there was no open war until they graduated. This could not be a factor in earlier years.

If they had any noble reason, James would have said it. Or Sirius. Or Lupin. They didn't, because there wasn't. They were assholes drunk on power.

I've listed the concerned sources already in the first para of my response. In addition to all this, JKR has commented that James' bullying was dueled in part by James' suspicion that Snape [[https://aminoapps.com/c/harry-potter/page/item/lily-and-james-potter/5KT5_I0P6rYeBM2d82pggZDVqn6Vr0][had deeper feelings for Lily]]

/I hope we're clear that this was full fledged bullying fuelled by personal beliefs, and that Severus did not 'deserve' it./ [1]

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

We don't know anything about Lily's parents and their relationship with Severus. As far as we know, all the muggles in Snape lives have been horrible people who hate him and atleast in Petunia's case, people like him. 'That Snape boy' is viewed negatively, as a weird boy, by others too. With his poverty, ridiculous clothes and magic, it's no wonder. All things hint to a pretty terrible and isolated life, magic and knowledge that he'll be able to leave all this behind being his only solace. Petunia is horrible even to Lily. She's jealous of her sister's magic, and tells Lily that Hogwarts isn't real, to stay away from the weird Snape boy.

Wizarding world in general has a poor opinion of muggles. James displays dismissive attitude when meeting Vernon, and in the short story with Sirius. McG and Hagrid, two of the nicest people according to the fandom use the term as derogatory slurs 'nastiest muggles I've seen' 'you great muggle! '. These are grown people on the good side who've had multiple experiences with muggles. Snape is a child whose only experiences with muggles are negative, and is not basing his low opinion on half baked stories. This is not prejudice. In 11 y/o Sev's world, muggles detest you for your magic, belittle your dreams, and jealous of things they cannot have, try to make you suppress it.

For Sev the child, magic is a wonderful thing that makes flowers bloom and makes little girls fly. It's an escape from the horrible world he's born in. 15 year old Severus is withdrawn, jaded, a loner, but the child is eager to make a friend who he can teach magic and think about Hogwarts, the place where he'll study magic and make friends and be greater than that Snape boy from the wrong side of the river. He'll learn soon that Hogwarts is no refuge, that where you come from matters here as much as in the playground where Petunia judged him.

Re: Dark Magic, and Severus' interest in it

From your comments, it seems you consider Severus' interest in Dark arts as something inherently evil. I'll have to break it down, since it requires an examination of multiple sub points:

*Was Severus interested in the dark arts? How much did he know of them?*

Sirius is the one who tells us that Severus 'came to the school knowing more curses than half the 7th years', and that 'he was upto his eye balls in dark arts.' Harry in 6th knows about 8, including Sectumsempra which was not a curse that would be known to anyone else. He is the best DADA student in their year, so I have to assume that he'd have equal or greater knowledge than an average second year. That means Severus knowing 8 curses would qualify him in Sirius' eyes. That is... not that impressive. This is also Sirius' recollection of his excuse of his 11 year old self hating Severus early on. Given what we know of their relationship, and Remus' observation of Sirius and James having an old prejudice against Snape when Sirius isn't there to sway him makes Sirius' makes 11 yo Sirius a biased source. We don't know how much Dark Arts Severus knew at

******** *Why did he know so much about the dark arts?*

We can no more guess why he initially got interested in potions than we can dark arts. However, Rowling gives us a clue

#+begin_quote
  Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
#+end_quote

As a bullied child with an unhappy childhood, Harry was very interested in Viridian's book. With his general aesthetic and love for all things morbid (how can someone love potions otherwise?), it's little wonder that Severus was too.

The difference between others and him is that he is the king of swots. As with potions, he didn't let the school's curriculum limit him. He delved deep into the knowledge, understanding their nature, applying his knowledge to make spells and counters for them, ranging from the harmless muffliato to mildly painful toenail growing hex to the fatal sectumsempra. Unlike Harry, another student who's great at DADA, he does not limit himself. He knows more about dark arts and defense from them than most, and shows it in his owls. He is like Albus and Tom, a genius who studies and pushes boundaries in whatever he does.

Still, like Viridian's book says, there's a hint of desperation to get back, to have revenge, to protect himself from people who would play fatal pranks and get away with it, that slowly makes his spells darker, more harmful. From muffliato to levicorpus to toenail hex, and culminating in a spell to be used just on enemies, Sectumsempra. The spell that, in Harry's hands, almost kills Draco.

I do think the relentless bullying that gives way to feelings of helplessness and anger has a part to play in this progression. Still, in SWM, even after he's being humiliated and tortured, the sectumsempra only makes a small slice on James' cheek, hardly the full potential of the spell that nearly killed Draco when cast by an inexperienced Harry.

Despite all of his knowledge of dark arts, and the spell even being known, it's never used to seriously injure someone by Severus, not is it given out to others. In fact, Snape never uses knowledge of Dark Arts to seriously injure (atleast during school) or kill anyone. His learning dark arts echoes his interest in learning potions. Learning dark arts is more about knowledge and defending himself than harming others.

Dark Arts: Are they evil? Does practicing them make you evil?

Dark Arts sounds ominous, but the truth is that dark magic is endless and varied. All the jinxes and curses come under Dark Magic. Owning and using dangerous animals also comes under Dark arts. Hagrid having Aragog would be racticing dark arts, as will Sirius using Lupin to scare or hurt Severus. The Marauders map was a dark magic. Ginny is considered precocious for her use of Bat bogey hex. Hexes and curses are taught in school, including the unforgivables to 4th years.

All magic can be used to do evil, and dark magic is no exception. Tranfiguration can send objects and beings into non being. A simple scourogify cleaning charm was used to choke Severus during SWM. To say that Dark Magic is evil and the use of it makes you evil is childish. It doesn't matter to a dead man if he was killed by a killing curse or turned into a broken teapot. The intent and how magic is used matters.

For all that Snape is known for his evil interest in Dark Magic, he uses it mostly for healing or defense. His intimate knowledge of Dark arts allows him to heal wounds and make cures that no one else can. + He heals Katie Bell + Heals Hermione from Dolohov's curse + saves Dumbledore from Voldemort's curse and prolongs his life + uses Sectumsempra to save Lupin from Death Eaters + heals Draco's fatal wounds + He goes against Voldemort himself and saves Harry by muttering the counter curse (muttered curses, as we know from Dumbledore passage in HBP, are exceptionally powerful)

As Molly Weasley demonstrates, without intimate knowledge of Dark arts, you can't counter them.

Hence, not only understanding dark arts not bad, but it's useful, and critical to countering it. Your intent and what you do with the magic makes you evil, not the magic itself.

Now, having established that Dark arts are an arbitrary label that are vague and do not make the act particularly evil by themselves,

#+begin_quote
  Its not hypocrisy she is pointing out its fucked up he is associating with bullies who use dark arts. He is being defensive for his friends by bringing up James Potter even though Lilly and he aren't friends or even close. Once she says she doesn't like James he ignores everything else she says.
#+end_quote

That scene occurs at a point where their friendship has frayed enough that Severus has to affirm if they're best friend's.

Lily tells him the people he hangs out with are evil. She subtantiates this by asking if he knows what Mulciber tried to do the other day. This implies that a) he wasn't there at the scene (otherwise Lily's Severus hating friends would tell her) and (b) Mulciber tried to do something evil with dark magic but wasn't successful. We don't know what it is that he tried to do, or how evil it was.

This is where the hypocrisy comes in. It's not about the Slytherins and marauders being Sev and Lily's friends. It's about how Lily is outraged that Severus would trivialise Mulciber's dark magic actions, while she does the same for the Marauders, claiming their actions to be less evil because of the arbitrary distinction that they don't use dark magic (they do). This is after she knows how they treat Severus. This is after the willow prank, so Severus tries warning her off them, alluding to Lupin's status because he can't say it outright. Again, Lily expects him to be grateful to Potter even though she hasn't heard his side of the story, she doesn't even question him if he was hurt.

She doesn't bring up purity stuff, only dark magic. She does not implicate Severus in this at all

Lily expects Severus to believe that his tormentors and their relentless bullying is better than his housemates /trying/ to do some vague, bad dark magic on her friend because they apparently don't use whatever Lily considers dark magic to bully him. Lily is not the steadfast figure of liberty and justice you think of her as. She is a fallible teen girl who very likely finds some of the marauders antics charming. She almost smiles during SWM, ffs. Right after Snape calls her a mudblood in his humiliation, she calls him Snivellus right back. These are teens, not bastions of morality.

******** u/nuthins_goodman:
#+begin_quote
  Your logic seems to be just because Snape was bullied it must have been a factor in his bigoted ideology. Why?
#+end_quote

It is /a/ factor, not the only one. It's a factor in the path he chose.

The relentless bullying by James, that started on Hogwarts express didn't stop. Hogwarts didn't turn out to be the new start, the place where he'd only be judged on his merit, not on his looks and background. Authority figures in magical world still favoured Potter, they rewarded Marauders relentless bullying by making one of them prefect, the Leader of the Light and all things good, Albus Dumbledore, callously threatened him with expulsion if he told anyone of his traumatic ordeal. Lily believed the Potter positive story without asking him his side. Slytherins were the only ones who welcomed him and treated him well. He hung out with them, drawn to their power and wealth and protection ('--weak seeking protection--', 'Your father wouldn't attack me unless it was 4 on 1!') The group slowly influenced him. Blood purity was not new, Fudge discriminated years later. As horrible it seems, discrimination based on blood was common, especially before Voldemort went too far and made it distasteful.

Snape, moving with a crowd including scions of powerful families would be more aware than most. He is also a half blood, half his blood is mud. Bellatrix certainly considers it filthy. We don't see Lily chastising him about the mudblood thing before swm, so we can't know who he referred to as such, if Lily was telling him things she'd heard from people or if he'd been uttering it in her presence. And if so, why did she not speak of this in the last memory? Was it a recent thing? It seems likely that he started muttering it offhand. He couldn't have used it often enough that Sirius would think he'd be a death Eater, because Sirius didnt think he had been one, in GoF. And again, tehy would have mentioned it in any of the explanations about their bullying.

His reason for wanting to join Voldemort and joining the death eaters was likely because of a need to belong, rather than genuine bigotry. Also a need to rise above his station. Jkr has even mentioned in an interview that he thought it would impress Lily. That's such a weird thing to think that I think at the time Voldemort and his campaign wasn't focused on purity, but on something else like power, or freedom from corruption. He was able to get a lot of other magical species by promising more rights to them, and Hagrid didn't think it would be weird if he'd offered an invitation to Lily based on her skill. Rowling has also said he offered Lily and James a chance to join. It's definitely not like second war, atleast initially. And at the time Swm happened, Voldemort was still gathering allies.

James bullying is important to making Dumbledore's side completely untenable to him, for making him insecure enough to seek protection among Slytherins and dark arts. Marauders' popularity despite how awful they were to him, and their murder attempt, and continued bullying /after that/ made him jaded in authority (he wanted to get them expelled before, he trusted in Dumbledore. That trust was irreparably broken) and especially after the loss of his only friend, made Voldemort's group a very enticing option.

#+begin_quote
  Only that James had a impact on how he treated kids as a adult.
#+end_quote

I like how you want to bring that here (sneaky boi), but I think it's long enough as it is. The aftereffects of bullying and a hard life are not selective. James has little to do with Snape the teacher, but his actions in part influenced the path Snape took, culminating in the ex death Eater who was partly responsible for his ex friend's death, and the bitter but enduring potions master cum double agent who really shouldn't have been teaching 11yos who knew nothing about potions or what bezoars are

********* Damn that was pretty impressive ...but sorry to say my response is going to be way shorter. Partly because I'm lazy.

But also I feel like we are drawing this out more than it needs to be drawn out.

You think Snape was pushed into being a Death Eater by James or James played a considerable part.

So why be a death eater? Well one reason is genuine interest in their group. What they are about is vague but the 3 consistent ones are blood purity, dark arts, and gaining power through extreme means. The actual ideological part is the first 2.

The second reason you could be a death eater is being pressured into it regardless of your ideology. For example the Malfoys while being blood purists and pro dark arts didn't want to be death eaters.

Is there any evidence to suggest that Snape was pressured in anyway to join? No in fact he seems to be on board with the ideological part and there is no reason Voldemort would be particularly interested in him before he joins unlike say Draco. All passages in text indicate he joined because he was interested and didn't regret it till he found out Lilly would be targeted.

I agree that dark arts isn't the best defined. After all people use jinxes and hexes all the time. Its considered technically dark magic but isn't controversial or really called out for being dark. So we don't exactly have the best parameters for judging dark arts. Or an interest in dark magic in particular.

So let's let dark arts go for now since it's hard to make a point with something that ambiguous. You are left with blood purity. For James Potter to have any impact at all on Snape becoming a death eater he must have had an impact on what would have led Snape to be a Death Eater. So his beliefs about blood purity.

So to prove James had an impact on Snape's beliefs you need some piece of text that shows Snape getting more bigoted because of some action James did. One that isn't very ambiguous and very open to interpretation. And that piece of evidence just doesn't exist. You don't know enough about James. You don't get to see him enough to be able to say for sure.

That can definitely be a valid interpretation. Things are ambiguous enough that could be true. Your logic can be sound. But there are so few details the opposite could be true. Some could make just as good a case for the exact opposite being true. The relation between Snape and the Marauders based on just the canon books is so vague that your interpretations are pretty much down to how you feel about the characters.

There is no claim you can make about James having a impact on Snapes bigoted beliefs that doesn't require a great degree of interpertation and theorizing. Most of what you suggested while well thought out were interpretations. Any set of theories could be true and well reasoned logical ones but they could be that while being the complete opposite of yours. You just have too many blanks to fill in because of lack of info. Its just down to how you feel and what you prefer. But since I can't be sure I won't say I hold James responsible for Snape joining the Death Eaters.

********** I think James played a part in Sev's paths. I try to think of scenarios where Snape doesn't join death eaters. In my mind, if the bullying isn't there, he has the highest likelihood not joining. I base this on canon and Rowling's explanations of Snape's motives. Re: Bigotry - I don't believe it played a big role in his decision, and Rowling confirms that he joined because he wanted to belong. If he said mudblood frequently, it was out of habit after staying with people constantly using the term than actual hatred. He is a muddy half-blood himself.

Rather like Wormtail. Wormtail isn't a blood purist, but he joined Voldemort anyway. For power. To belong, to be recognised.

Now why they thought it'd be okay comes down to how Voldemort was percieved during the first war. I think he was much less focused on blood purity during the first war.

There are multitude of other factors which affected his life as much as the bullying did. His home, slytherins, Dumbledore's lack of care, stigma (deserved, probably) towards slytherins and dark arts

There's also the death eaters themselves. As said before, their goals at this time are not clear. Hagrid think Voldy should've invited Lily, he actually did invite her, according to Jkr. Snape wanting to join in part because he thought this would impress her. Volsemort's group was not a small terrorist organisation. It was supported by most powerful families. From Remus' statement of 20:1 of DE:OoTP, there were around 400 witches serving Voldemort directly. Population of magical Britain is 5k (JKR) . That's a full fledged civil war. It is more comparable to IRA than KKK.

The Black family themselves didn't know the depths of Voldemort's darkness until it was too late. It seems unlikely that a half-blood whose trusted sources on Voldy are kids with DE family members and thus having positive bias for Voldemort, would know.

To summarise: James' bullying was a factor. It affected Severus' personality, and even James' best act ended so badly that it eroded any residua trust Snape had in authority and OoTP. James and Sirius were roaming around with OoTP shirts before 6th year. It would be well known which side would have them. Just this would sour Snape to Order's prerogative. We know what both movements came to be about. The characters didn't.

No issue about length. I was listening to some music and got carried away on that one. I'll salvage some essays out of that responses ha

** I've wanted to say this for a while so I'm using this post as a platform to say it. Snape isn't a glorious hero, but he isn't the terrible person a lot of people seem to think he is. His actions are mostly understandable and partially justifiable. He joined the death eaters because that's all he really had. The slytherins were the only person who gave any kind of a damn about him apart from Lily. James, like it or not, used his popularity to isolate Snape. Look how people reacted in that one OOTP chapter when he was attacked by The Marauders. He called Lily a Mudblood not out of hatred but out of anger and humiliation. He instantly regretted it because he didn't mean it, it just came out after spending all his time with blood supremacists. It's weird how people can justify draco's behavior and not Snape, even though Snape has more of a reason to dislike muggles and more negative influences then Draco. Anyways, after Hogwarts, since Lily cut Snape off, all he really had were the Death Eaters. Then the wizarding war happened. Now something that's dumb is that people expect Snape to Want to protect James and Harry. He owes them nothing. They are in opposite sides of the war, even if the Death Eaters are evil. He's on their side so he owes the Potters nothing. Also it's not like he begged Dumbledore to intentionally not protect James and Harry. He just prioritized Lily.

Now I can't and won't defend his actions towards Harry and the other numerous Children at Hogwarts that he bullied. That's awful. But people exaggerate how Neville's greatest fear is Snape. What else would it be? There are plenty of scary things in Harry Potter but they aren't actively a threat to Neville. That goes for Bellatrix too, who's safely stored away in Azkaban. Neville's fear of Snape is nothing more then a child who hates or fears their really cruel teacher. No need to exaggerate it.

So in summary, Snape had a tragic backstory and he made some awful decisions early in his life but he did become a Hero and did end up choosing the right side. He was a cruel bully but he saved the wizarding world. Snape is a hero who has done some despicable things, but saved the world in the end.

Yes he does; he's the reason Voldemort is targeting them.

  Also it's not like he begged Dumbledore to intentionally not protect James and Harry. He just prioritized Lily.

One, that isn't how boggarts work: there's /nothing/ that implies that they prioritise practical, immediate fears. Two, /it is not normal/ for a child who regularly visits his parents, war veterans who were tortured into catatonia, to be more afraid of one of a teacher than of: a) the specific people who tortured his parents, regardless of whether he has any rational reason to think they'd ever be a direct threat to him, personally, b) any of the other members of the terrorist group to which said torturers belonged, many of whom went free, which is an open secret that children are casually aware of, c) the leader of said terrorist group, who is rumoured to be alive and in hiding, waiting to make a return, d) something happening to his aforementioned catatonic parents or elderly grandmother, or e) any of the traumatic events to which his family casually subjected him over many years in order to force out some magic.

You're welcome to that interpretation, but it's just that: /your interpretation./ It in no way invalidates anyone else's, and it certainly isn't a fact. Personally, I think a far fairer summation would be "he was a despicable person who did some heroic things." And to be clear, I'm not trying to change your mind: I probably can't, and I definitely don't want to. I'm just really sick of Snape stans taking a hardline stance against people who refuse to overlook all the awful shit he did in favour of all the good he achieved.

**** There is a lot to unpack here. Idk how to do that quoting thing your doing so I'll just go point by point.

I mentioned this somewhere else but Snape is hardly a Child abuser. He's a dickhead teacher. A terrible teacher isn't necessarily a child abuser. He doesn't seem to be physically violent and his verbal attacks aren't necessarily worse then any other horrible teacher. If you consider terrible teachers child abusers then maybe he is a child abuser in your eyes but from my point of view he's no worse then any other shitty unfair teacher.

Like I already mentioned, he isn't a blood supremacist by nature. His surroundings gave him blood supremacist tendencies but he himself doesn't truly believe Muggle Borns are inferior. His limited and negative interactions with muggles gave him a negative view of them for some time but I don't believe he ever thought muggles or Muggle Borns were actually biologically inferior.

Who said I am blaming Lily? She is perfectly welcome to cut Snape off. Just because I don't think Snape is a villain doesn't mean I think Lily is.

Like I stated multiple times in this thread, his choices were heavily impacted by his friends. A lot of people, if they spent seven years being told how great an organization was by their friends, would probably support that organization. Do you think all people in the Nazi army hated Jews? Some of them were just nationalists who wanted to support their country. I think it's the same idea, but instead of supporting their country, Snape is supporting his only friends left. Like I said, he spent seven years being spoon fed the idea that the Death Eaters are really great and that he should join.

That is what it looks like from an outside point of view. Think of it from Snape's POV. He's in a war and the leader of his side is at risk. He holds the information needed to possibly save his leader.

After looking through the chapter in question, it is true that he wanted to barter for Lily's life. However, Voldemort was likely going to kill the whole family regardless. Snape just appealed to him to spare Lily. And when Dumbledore confronts him about this, his reaction isn't confusion, but shame. The way it's worded is deceptive, but really Snape just asked Voldemort to spare Lily. And when he goes to Dumbledore, the first the he truly asks of him is to save them all, as Snape had not yet asked anything of Dumbledore in the prior conversation.

When it comes to the Death Eaters, Neville has feelings more of anger then of fear. The threat they pose has come and gone at the time so Neville would probably hate them and feel anger towards them more then fear. Look at Harry. While he briefly considers Voldemort as a fear, he ultimately concludes that his greatest fear is the dementors. The more active and present threat. And Ron. His sister was kidnapped and almost killed the year prior, and he's known about the death eaters and Voldemort his whole life, but his greatest fear is still spiders. The death of a loved one that isn't currently in critical condition is more of a passive worry then an active fear. And I think the idea that he should fear his family more then a teacher is kind of concerning. Especially when his family seemingly wouldn't have been putting him at risk since he actively showed to all of them that he truly was magical.

Everyone can have their own opinion, im just here to give my thoughts on Snape's character. I just think it's fairer to think of him as a hero when his final moments were dedicated to stopping Voldemort. No child seemed to suffer any long term damage from his actions, and we don't have visible proof of any crimes with permanent consequences from Snape, so I think it's fair to say Snape is a tragic, but also despicable hero.

Edit: Also would like to mention I'm not really a Snape Stan. I'm indifferent to him at most. When I reread the books I'm still gonna dislike him most of the time until the end where I can appreciate his heroics more. He isn't one of my favorite characters, nor even one of my favorite Slytherins.

*** I'm not sure you can justify joining murderers and torturers by saying, 'that's all he really had.' He wasn't forced into joining, but I suppose following his friends and people who liked him is probably a more human response, but that doesn't make it the right thing to do. And despite the fact I don't like Draco as a character and don't think he is a good person, he was at least forced into serving. Voldemort himself literally lived at his house, Voldemort lived where his mother was, there was no way he could deny his orders to serve and kill Dumbledore without him and his family being killed or tortured, especially considering Lucius' failure...

And what says that he did? All we have is 1 incident to base this off of and people like to make it look 100% one sided. It more than likely wasn't. + Sirius mentions that Snape came to Hogwarts knowing more of the dark arts than most graduates. Or something in that direction at least.

#+begin_quote
  He called Lily a Mudblood not out of hatred but out of anger and humiliation. He instantly regretted it because he didn't mean it, it just came out after spending all his time with blood supremacists.

False. The war was going on while they were still in school.

#+begin_quote
  Now something that's dumb is that people expect Snape to Want to protect James and Harry. He owes them nothing. They are in opposite sides of the war, even if the Death Eaters are evil. He's on their side so he owes the Potters nothing. Also it's not like he begged Dumbledore to intentionally not protect James and Harry. He just prioritized Lily.

James was also noted to have a deep hatred of the Dark Arts and their practitioners. So not exactly the best way to not agitate him. Doubly so when there is a war going on where those who studied the Dark Arts are rebelling against the government.

**** We have no proof as to whether he was rude to anyone outside of the marauders from what I can tell. People were prejudiced against Slytherin, which was fair at the time since most of them were death eaters. Despite that, it's still the house he fit in best and he shouldn't have to go against his natural house because of its reputation.

And he clearly wasn't against making friends outside the house but people treated him like they would treat other death eaters, despite the fact that Snape wouldn't have joined them under other circumstances. We may just have one incident to go off of but it's telling that when the marauders attack Snape for seemingly no reason everyone just goes along with it. Snape's friends were cruel to people but not Snape himself, or Lily would have called him out for it. Knowing a lot about the dark arts on its own isn't a bad thing. It's how you choose to use that knowledge that's defines you as a person and he didn't use it for negative reasons until he had joined the death eaters.

From an outside perspective, it may seem like Snape should have wanted all of the Potters to be safe but in his mind, his only reason to care was Lily and it makes sense that would be his initial concern. Again, he doesn't want James and Harry dead, it's just that saving them isn't a priority, and in Snape's situation, it doesn't need to be.

In fact outside of her awful quill that scarred children, I'd hesitate to say Umbridge was that bad.

Idk what Snape creating one of the spells James bullied him with has anything to with what I said. He still had no reason to attack him.

Also Snape did more then three things. He made sure Draco didn't have to kill Dumbledore and misled Voldemort on his path to get the Elder Wand. He alerted the Order of Harry's message in book five so the kids would be saved from the department of mysteries. He made life at Hogwarts the least shitty he could possibly make it in the last book. Remember when I believe Ginny, Neville, and Luna stole the sword and he simply gave them detention with Hagrid. Would the awful hateful child abuser your describing do that? He took over one of the Quidditch matches in book one to make sure Quirrel didn't try anything. I'm sure he did other things too that I can't think of right now.

What your suggesting would imply Snape had nobody after Hogwarts so he decided to go to the death eaters. His only friends were the Death Eaters and outside of them he had nothing. There was a massive war going on and pretty much everyone he knew that didn't despise him was joining the Death Eaters. It was a poor choice but he ultimately chose the death eaters.

Sirius at least has the excuse of having an even crappier childhood, Lupin is scared shitless of rejection, Pettigrew goes along with everything so the bulliying doesn't happen to him.

**** You make it sound like he regularly calls Lily a mudblood behind her back. Newsflash: He loves her. He wouldn't do that.

You also seem to have forgotten what James told him directly ~before~ he said the m-word: He implied he has feelings for Lily. Hmmm. I wonder why someone would call someone a slur because somebody else implied they liked them romantically. Because he panicked at the idea that anyone could ~know~. So he said the first thing he could think of that would throw off any and all suspicion that he had romantic feelings for her. Of course, he couldn't say that to Lily, because he didn't want ~her~ to know either, and in any case, he kew that wasn't enough of a reason. He was an asshole. But he didn't mean the word mudblood.

Ofc, Lily's reason for not believing he didn't mean it was that he calls everyone 'of her birth' mudblood and 'why should I be any different?'

There are a few possible truthful answers to this question, but none more likely than this one: 'Because I love you'.

This, of course, means that Snape has begun to believe that Lily is 'the exception' from all the bigoted and racist beliefs about muggles and muggle-borns. That just because he cares for her, she is 'different', and therefore does not deserve the racial slurs and injustice that, in Snape's eyes, everyone else of her birth does.

Snape would start to lose sight of this way of thinking after becoming a spy, I think, because honestly, how would he ever have become 'close' /shudder/ enough to Voldemort to ~actually ask him to spare the life of a Muggle-born witch ~and for Vodemort to listen to him~ (seriously how many people are going to overlook this like hejustwalkeduptoTomRiddleandaskedhimtospareaMugglebornbecausehelovedherthisabsolutelygetsa100ontherecklessGryffinforscale)~ if he didn't actually believe in the cause in the first place.

He would feel remorse for Lily's death, and then he would be manipulated by Dumbledore for the next sixteen years by his love for her, and the way Dumbledore makes him feel like he still has to prove himself even though he's been spying for the Order for a year and a half. If he needed to pay for his actions, this MORE than makes him pay. Sixteen years' emotional manipulation because you're the reason the woman you loved is dead and there's nothing you can do about it. Honestly, does he need any more penance? And to top it all off, he died before finding out that Harry survived, that his protection did matter in the end. He died thinking that Harry had always been going to die, and all he's been able to do over the years has delayed the inevitable, and he's finally given Harry the knowledge he knows will make him walk to his death.

What Dumbledore manipulated Snape into doing was the very thing that, if he'd actually cared about Lily Potter the real (within the fiction) woman, he'd have done without prompting. "Oh, the woman I claim to love died in order to protect her son, which, through no fault of her own, painted a massive target on his back? Well ain't that some shit. Anyway, here's Wonderwall." I think it's telling that what Dumbledore says to manipulate him is (paraphrased) "if you ever truly loved her, your way forward is clear," and I think it's telling that Snape finds this confusing.

Here's the thing: if Snape had truly loved Lily, then this wasn't manipulative, it was instructive. If he didn't, then he was manipulating a man who just got an innocent child's parents killed into protecting said child /who is only in danger because of him./ Dumbledore manipulated a former (but not reformed) terrorist into taking responsibility for (some) of his own actions? Unforgivable.

#+begin_quote
  and the way Dumbledore makes him feel like he still has to prove himself even though he's been spying for the Order for a year and a half.
#+end_quote

He does. In case you've forgotten, /Snape was a Death Eater./ Giving Voldemort the prophecy simply /could not/ have been his sole contribution to their "cause." Snape, as an /active participant,/ bears some, not all, but unquestionably /some/, responsibility for the lives they ended and the lives they irrevocably damaged. So, yeah, I'd say that he has a responsibility to do what he can to oppose the Death Eaters when they come back for round two.

Also, if you're referring to the end of the first war, when you say "he's been spying for the Order for a year and a half," he, at that point, hasn't. Harry was 15 months old when his parents were murdered (because of Snape, who would go on to use his position as Harry's teacher to emotionally abuse him, lest we forget); unless Voldemort committed to the idea that the Potters were the family to whom the prophecy applied three months before their son was even born (which wouldn't make any sense; why would Voldemort choose a target whose viability as a subject of the prophecy is predicted on his birthday /before he's born?/ Snape is both clear and shameless about the fact that he's only switching sides to protect Lily; if Harry had been born a /day/ later (which can totally happen; a baby's due date is just an educated guess; I was born a week after mine), Voldemort would've gone after Neville, instead, and Snape would've switched sides again the moment Lily was no longer in extra danger because of him, specifically), your timeline doesn't add up.

#+begin_quote
  If he needed to pay for his actions
#+end_quote

He did; two people are dead because of him at a /bare minimum,/ and he's orphaned an innocent child and, in so doing, consigned him to miserable childhood of emotional neglect and abuse.

That might mean something, if Snape wasn't outraged at Dumbledore's suggestion that he might care about Harry on any level other than "Lily Evans' (not Potter's) son whom I must protect because he is Lily Evans' (not Potter's) son." Unfortunately, though, he went to his grave refusing to see Harry as anything other than an extension of his dead parents, so . . . I kinda feel like that undercuts the alleged tragedy, here.

Also, I'm sorry if I implied in any way, shape or form that Snape putting Lily on a pedestal is a good thing. I am not trying to convince you that that would've been a healthy relationship. (The opposite is true.) The only thing I was trying to say was that he didn't mean the m-word ~in relation to Lily~. Not that makes him any less of a bastard. More, in fact.

Also, when Dumbledore says, 'If you ever truly loved her' (which, btw, if not proven by Patronus is proven by the fact that she was important enough to him to actually walk up to Voldemort and ask him to spare her [a muggleborn] her life), he makes it sound like Severus needs to prove to Dumbledore that he loves her. Like he doesn't believe him or something. That's what I meant about 'proving himself' and yea sorry, my timeline was messed up. Oops. But that's what I meant about emotional manipulation. He has extremely mixed feelings about Harry because his parents are people he hates and loves, respectively (notice how I'm not saying that any of this is a positive thing). He protects him from harm because he is Lily's son and abuses him because he is James's son. Honestly, he adds up to the same person who came running to Dumbledore for help (whatever ur opinion is of him at that point).

He gets unfairly angry at Harry and finds every reason to berate him for something. That is abuse. I know. He needs to keep his bloody emotions in check. (Like find a therapist it's not THAT hard, right?) But yea. Honestly, he shouldn't even be in the position of a teacher in this school. Sarcasm is not a good mix with a position of authority in a classroom.

Yes, obviously it undercuts the tragedy, but 'the tragedy' is still there. He feels like he failed Lily all over again.

Having a crush isn't a redeeming quality.

Being on board with a hate group that wanted her dead and not caring that the people she loved most in her life ( like her kid) would get killed, is not something that indicates love to me.

He was super interested with Lilly. He was fascinated by her. He found her company enjoyable. He likely wanted to be with her. But nothing about his actions in those memories indicate love. There were I think supposed to. I think they were supposed to represent his love. But what got shown wasn't love.

Obsession maybe, desire yes, but not love. Love requires a care and consideration he never gave her. His feelings towards her were all that ever mattered to him. Her existence beyond what she meant to him didn't seem to matter. That's what his actions indicate.

If he did love her he wouldn't consider joining the Death Eaters in the first place. You can't join a hate group that opresses and wants to genocide muggleborns and claim you love any muggleborn.

But that was when he was a teen what about later? Well if he did love her at all he'd immediately go to Dumbledore after he realized the target of the prophecy like he did when he thought he could loose her after trying to negotiate with Voldemort. He wouldn't have tried to bargain with Voldemort to kill her kid ( who she loved) in exchange for her life before even attempting to save both by going to Dumbledore first.

I would also like to point out that he would be in no way affected by her death except with the knowledge that Lily Evans Potter is gone. It would literally not have any other impact on his life. Do you think he's actually deluded enough to think he still has a chance? And that's why he hesitates to let her die? Because if that was it, that's all he'd do- hesitate. If all it was was desire or obsession or whatever, he wouldn't even hesitate. He'd just go 'Oh alright, this will give me closure, whatever, get on with it.' What has he to gain by Lily being alive? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Except the continued torment of knowing that she's married to James Potter. Honestly.

People have circular logic. He himself was a half-blood. He was also a Death Eater. Obviously, Voldemort didn't care about blood status as long as you had magic. He probably figured this out within a year of joining.

As for joining in the first place: As I thought I already established, Snape put Lily on a pedestal. He thought of her as 'better' than all the other muggleborns just because he loved her. THIS WAS NOT OKAY. I do not support Snape/Lily /at all/. But it does explain why he would join Voldemort.

I would argue that it was not love that changed his mind. He didn't change his mind about his beliefs when he started helping Dumbledore. What he did was finally choose to try to value something she did. Not very well given his treatment of Harry but at least it would make her death more meaningful.

It was after he started working for Dumbledore things changed. His beliefs genuinely changed. Perhaps just from viewing things from the other side, perhaps because of his relationship with Dumbledore. But it wasn't feelings for Lilly that changed his mind. They weren't enough to change his ideology in school or when he went to tell Dumbledore. His feelings for Lilly just gave him a chance at a path he repeatedly rejected in school despite her trying to talk him out of being closer to his more bigoted friends.

The redeeming thing about Snape the actual good thing about him is the fact his ideology changed. He stopped being a bigot. You see it when he doesn't like Mudblood being used near the end of the memories. He did not have to change his beliefs to save Harry. His change wasn't driven by his love for her because as you said she was the exception. Her existence didn't change his beliefs. He did that outside of her. If there is anything redeeming about Snape its that. But I won't say that having a crush on her is inherently redeeming in anyway.

******* Let me be as explicit as possible: I do not, for a second, believe that what Snape felt for Lily was anything approaching love. It was a one-sided obsession which showed no regard for what its object actually wanted or valued and which was predicted not on who Lily actually was, but on Snape's idealised version of her. I think that to call that love is, at best, painfully naive and shallow, and at worst, legitimately concerning.

** I disagree. Although Snape is a horrible person, ignoring the effects of bullying on people is a horrible thing to do . We do not know if he laughed when they cursed muggleborns, since Lily was mad that he was friends with people who did it, so he probably wasn't even there when they did it. The most we know about how he treated muggleborns is that he called them mudbloods. James did bully Snape, since Draco never started twitching like a rabbit and running away when Harry looked his way and Harry never started cursing Draco while everyone was watching and laughing because he was bored. Even JK Rowling herself said they bullied him and it wasn't mutual at all. They also did curse other people, as seen in HBP. If James and Sirius had not bullied him, he may not have joined the Death Eaters, and that's a fact.

No, we don't know if he laughed or was even there. That's true, but we do know he tried to excuse Mulciber's attack on Mary MacDonald as 'just a laugh,' which is no better than James bullying him because he 'existed or because Sirius was 'bored.'

**** It is not as bad as that. There's a difference between excusing people's actions and actually doing them. JK Rowling, in that tweet, said Snape bullied children, so it was referencing his actions as an /adult/, not as a teenager.

Regarding hitting Petunia with a branch, he was a kid younger than her who already had a distaste for muggles since his muggle father abused him. It was wrong, but Petunia also had some fault in that situation. It's like saying Ron is a cruel bully for how he talked bad about Hermione behind her back. He is frequently nasty to people, but he's not a bully.

Did he do it while everyone in school was watching in laughing. Ignoring the power dynamics between the James-Sirius duo (Popular, rich, and Sirius was even described as extremely attractive even when Harry thought he was a traitor, so they were probably both good looking) and Snape (Everyone besides Lily, who smiled for a moment and canonically had a crush on James even then, was laughing at Snape, and he was also very ugly and poor) is a bit weird.

I misremembered him twitching like a rabbit, but he did react "so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack" after James called him Snivellus.

I don't see him as a good person necessarily, but rather a tragic one. He's like if a mixed race kid that passed for white who was abused by his non-white parent was sent to a boarding school and forced to share a room with the kids of KKK members for 7 years. Those other kids are going to make his life hell (or worse) if he doesn't fall into into line with them. And up until this point in his life he hasn't had much experience to prove what they're saying wrong.

If he hadn't been sorted into Slytherin, he likely would have never become a death eater. If he hadn't been so terribly bullied by people who eventually became core members of The Order of the Phoenix, he might have seen that as an option.

** I'm by no means a Snape apologist - however, he did /start out/ at least redeemable (if still a deeply flawed character who'd have to work /very/ hard to be considered anywhere near on the positive side of a hypothetical alignment chart). As per Deathly Hallows:

--------------

"“Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?”

Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.

“No,” he said. “It doesn't make any difference.”

Yes, he hesitates to say it, probably because he doesn't really believe it at that point. Yes, it's to Lily Evans, who he has an unhealthy obsession with. But that one moment shows a "could-have-been" - a could-have-been of him choosing Lily over all the ideas that ended up making him a Death Eater. A could-have-been that's negated by pretty much everything that happens afterwards, usually by Snape's own actions.

And yes, it was pretty much entirely his own actions and ideas that made him turn to the Death Eaters - he was friends with nascent Death Eaters during Hogwarts for a reason, and he was /nasty/ to Petunia just for being a Muggle.

** I agree and disagree.

Yes, I'm the end it was his own choices that led him down this road. However, context matters.

Snape was an abused child and, like most abused children, acted out against people. This behavior was reinforced once he was put into Slytherin as many Slytherins at the time were active death eaters, they no only didn't fault him for lashing out against muggleborns, but most likely encouraged and rewarded it. Snape is the one and only good portrayal of abuse in the Harry Potter series.

Adding on, Lily was Snape's out. Snape was certainly surrounded by people that only reinforced this behavior and, had Lily been thinking above her age (not unlikely for the HP series), she'd have tried to integrate him into Gryffindor, something that, had James not been bullying him, might've been possible. (Sidenote: that would be a really cool dynamic for a Maurader era fic, where Lily tries to get Snape into the Mauraders and that's how Lily and James' relationship develops... might have to write that one). Which really goes into my next point, James was specifically bullying Snape to break the friendship between him and Lily. Which succeeded and got him the girl. (There is a reason the only characters I hate more than James are Pettigrew and Umbridge).

Now is where terms are important. I can honestly say that with the regular timeline only difference is that Lily and Snape stay friends the only difference I see is that Snape might become a spy sooner. I will not deny that (barring my hypothetical side note earlier) the most likely situation is that Snape becomes a death eater. So is it James /fault/ no, but I cannot deny his actions encouraged it.

Second note. In Harry Potter the “dark arts” are defined as combat spells. Technically with the definition Harry Potter uses, expelliarmus is dark arts. Not to mention that most Jinxs and all curses are Dark Arts as well. Personally, learning the Dark Arts doesn't seem that bad to me, it seems on par with Martial Arts. Sure, some people will misuse it, but not everyone is Johnny from the Karate Kid.

Edit: Before people start coming at me. I'm not arguing Snape is a good person. I'm giving the context and saying it's important.

*** I'd argue that Snape wasn't really a out for Lilly not in terms of like an out from that kind of ideology. You see in his memories with Lilly in the last book that she pressed him about those bigoted beliefs. Supporting them/the people who think like that. And he dismissive of it. He not taken aback or defensive. He doesn't reconsider anything. Its the same after the mudblood incident.

He wanted to applogize and came back a few times to applogize for the slur. But not applogize for the ideology not try to do better not get away from it. Even after she died. He joined Dumbledore to help her child and get revenge for her death. Not because he was pro muggleborn and anti dark arts.

I think he eventually got to the point where he was anti pureblood Supremacy before dying himself but it didn't happen in school. And I don't think Lilly could have helped him in school in canon ( fanon a diff story). If all Slytherins were bigoted supremacists ( which i doubt but still if ) then the adults needed to step in educate do something.

And if they weren't all like that then he purposely gravitated towards the bigots because he had those beliefs. Either way I don't think Lilly really had the sway to change his mind then and it really wasn't her responsibility to either. Makes perfect sense for her to value herself and leave behind that relationship where a guy supports the terrorist group that wants you and people like you dead.

As for James its hard to say why he bullied Snape. You don't get his pov. But you know he looked down on Snape. Snape disgusted him and based on Sirius's rambles it was partly his hygiene and partly the whole dark art support thing. Trying to ruin things between him and Lilly is more possibly something Snape might have thought.

And it might be true or it could be James was fucking with him and it happened to get in the way. Personally I see it more as the latter. Because James looked down on him I think he didn't see him as a romantic rival but just someone he hated and so it wasn't really necessary to get him out of the way. Hell because Snape and Lilly were friends it would probably be in his best interest to butter Snape up be nicer to him. But he doesn't. And James isn't canonically an idiot he's actually the opposite. So that kinda indicates to me that he likes Lilly and wants her to like him but I don't think is actively trying to make her like him.

James might or might not have ended up with Lilly if Lilly and Snape stays friends longer. But very definitely in book 7 you see what got between Lilly and Snape isn't James but Snape's own bigotry. James bothered him ya but he's the one who dropped the slur. Thats not the automatic response to that situation. Not unless of course you are already a bigot. He could have told her to fuck off cuz he was upset but that doesn't have the same significance.

Snapes views weren't created or reinforced by James. James Potter isn't the reason Snape was sympathetic to death eater ideology. James was just a dick who fucked with Snape and liked the girl Snape did. James could do literally nothing and I'd argue Lilly and Snapes relationship would have still turned out the same in canon sooner or later because of the bigoted beliefs Snape had at the time and needed a while to work on himself to get over.

**** By the timeframe of the mudblood incident I completely agree. The out would've had to happen sooner, and only would've worked had James not been bullying him. The only way a later out works is if they stayed friends, and that's the scenario that Snape becomes a spy sooner.

That's fair. Personally I don't think he was ever anti-muggleborn (not the same as pro-muggleborn). Honestly, I peg him as a black character anyway (mtg colour alignment), he does the right thing for selfish reasons. As for anti-Dark Arts, I genuinely don't think anyone is (simply because of how broad the definition is).

Yeah. Really the only way the in school conversion happens is if in first year Lily decides she doesn't like the people around Snape and decides to bring him into her friends group in Gryffindor. Even then I'm unsure at how effective it would be because, the timeline puts this during the rise of Voldemort and nearing his peak. Which goes into why I believe the support among Slytherin's was most likely at an all time high. Voldemort was nearing the peak of him powers unrivalled, saying what many of the families in Slytherin wanted to hear. Even by the battle of Hogwarts in canon, they locked the Slytherin's in the dungeon. As for the adults getting involved, this was essentially their religion. You try to tell a group of Catholics in what essentially is an echo chamber (as most of the believers of this ideology were in the same house) that they're wrong and they should follow [insert literally any other belief here], it doesn't tend to work.

I agree that really it was too little too late by the time of nearly anything we're shown. As for the helping your friend out of a shitty place, I do feel it's part of being their friend that you do try. That being said, she did, she just gave up sooner than I or my close friends would.

Personally, it makes the most sense to me. Mind you at the beginning he wasn't trying to break it up because romantic rival, but because “Gryffindors and Slytherins can't be friends”, more or less house rivalry enhanced by the fact that the man currently trying to overthrow the government was an ex-Slytherin. If I had to put a time line bullying started 1st year and James infatuation starts 3/4 year. All that being said, we don't have a timeline (that I can currently recall) on these events so this is certainly head-canon.

Again, I think infatuation likely started after the bullying. Also, I doubt James saw Snape as a romantic rival (quick tangent: while I like the trope occasionally in Severitus books (which I love), I personally don't think Lily x Snape could've, would've, or should've happened in canon. I honestly feel like their relationship didn't need the crush on Snapes side, and would've been more interesting without it...).

Honestly, it's not like their relationship would make any less sense than in canon. Also my point was never that James was the sole reason, or even a primary reason. But much like how drag isn't a huge factor on your running speed/form, you'd be faster without it. Snape becoming a death eater was a result of the factors I pointed out. If James hadn't made himself a factor, it's still possible, likely even, that Snape would become one. But like the example given, James closed an out. James was the most influential Gryffindor, and he decided that he'd bully Snape, Snape wasn't about to fit in with Lily's Gryffindor friends which is what I meant by an out. James didn't lock him in the room, but he closed a way out of it.

I think the most telling way is this. Had Snape been put into Ravenclaw, I doubt he'd have been a death eater. He'd have (probably) had proper support of his abuse, and would've found a better outlet than the normalization and rewarding of hatred of a certain group. Even if he still had the back and forth with James, he wouldn't be surrounded by people manipulating him into what they want. Literally only the house has to change, that'd change the people he talked to regularly. Which would affect his future path. You don't even have to change his character, still fundamentally a black character who put him and his own above anything else.

***** /"Haven't been spying," said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. "Wouldn't spy on you, anyway," he added spitefully, "you're a Muggle."/

/Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone./

/"Lily, come on, we're leaving!" she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left./

This is the first scene with Petunia and Lilly he had. Clearly he still has that anti muggle bias from the start and this is pre hogwarts

/Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair./

/"No," he said. "It doesn't make any difference./" However he seems less on board with anti muggleborn rhetoric at this time though he is at this time exposed to it already. This was in response to Lilly asking would it make a difference that she was a muggleborn.

/"Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile./

/"My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said./

/"Blimey," said James, "and I thought you seemed all right!"/

/Sirius grinned./

While James seems to be anti Slytherin from the start  it seems pretty light hearted the "you seemed alright" comment. Hence Sirius smiling. So its an anti Slytherin bias but not intensely so. Course Sirius has a poor opinion of Slytherin due to his family so he is going to respond better than Snape would since Snape is at this point already pro Slytherin.

/One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the ..../

/"'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad."/

/Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him./

/"Got a problem with that?"/

/"No," said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy ¨/

/"Where're you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?" interjected Sirius./

/James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike./

/"Come on, Severus, let's find another compartment."/

/"Oooooo..."/

Ok first its a bit odd to me that he says Brainy to Brawny but says he wants to be Slytherin not Ravenclaw. But here is where the antagonism starts and its not over Lilly but rather James and Snape just being at odds. Kinda brings up Harry Draco parallels a bit and then Sirius backs up the kid he was talking to and getting along with before just like Harry had done on instinct when Malfoy insulted Ron. But unlike Draco Snape isn't that confident nor does he have like minion friends he has Lilly.  Which I think is noteworthy. See Draco is dickish from the start but seems to have no openly anti muggle or anti muggleborn bias in first year. He is then more openly bigoted second year. While his parents are bigots I expect they try to be more subtly so.

They don't want Draco parroting what they say and getting them in trouble. And so they may just avoid talking about such things in his presence. But Draco's first friends are super bigoted from the start. I can see things turning out different if they perhaps weren't. Snapes first friend is Lilly but after he becomes friends with the death eaters. Not even more subtle ones like I expect Lucius would have been which might have allowed Lilly to not realize at first. But she does and confronts him.

/"...sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?"/

/Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face./

/"That was nothing," said Snape. "It was a laugh, that's.."/

And he's dismissive already this is before the mudblood incident. But despite her explaining her discomfort and trying to draw him away he doesn't actually care what she has to say. He only cares that she doesn't like James Potter.

/Mulciber's and Avery's idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don't understand how you can be friends with them."/

/Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape's step.../

As long as he can keep the guy he hates away from the girl he likes he doesn't really care about the rest of her opinions and feelings.

/You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends' too! You're not going to ¨ I won't let you ¨/

She of course responds poorly to this and he back tracks but he does not really respond to any attempt she makes to try to get him to distance himself from these guys and their ideology.

So she is trying being a good friend he's just not listening.

And then you get to this point.

/"Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice. "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends ¨you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?"/

/... I didn't mean"/

/"to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?"/

This is right after the mudblood incident and at this point its too late. He's openly saying mudblood not even denying he and his friends want to be Death Eaters.

At some point Snape on his own had to choose to walk a different path neither Lilly nor anyone else could have made him. It's fun to imagine hypotheticals where he did earlier and wish he had but sadly in canon he chose not to until after she died. And he did despite her trying to draw him away from them and trying to show him how hateful they were. She was never going to be enough if he didn't want to make that change and at that point in his life he didn't. And so their friendship was ruined.

Now this is just based on the context you get for Snape at the time in book 5 and book 7. And admittedly that's not alot. But in book canon we don't have much else to base it on. Its not much but to be fair we get even less context for the Marauders at that same time period. Maybe id reach a different opinion if the books had explored this Snape vs Marauders and Snape + Slytherins stuff more. But they didn't got to work with what I got for canon readings.

James is certainly a factor, albeit not a massive one and there were certainly bigger ones (what I was attempting to show with the Ravenclaw example). But I feel that completely disregarding James as a factor is just as foolish as claiming he's the only factor.

The next is your shot at hypotheticals. Firstly, we're on a fanfic subreddit, that's kind of what we do. Secondly, hypotheticals are the best way to show how big of a factor a given factor is. You cannot discuss the importance of a factor without hypotheticals to show, because canon happened in one specific way.

Honestly mate. Quoting the passage doesn't help your point as we've never disagreed here. I've specifically said that changes in Lily's actions needed to happen first year or all that would've changed is how quickly Snape becomes a spy.

******* oh no my only point with Lilly was that she in canon couldn't have helped Severus out in that situation and did try alot.

But I guess I do disagree that in canon James had anything in particular to do with Snape gravitating to Voldy.

James was a dick and a bully and made Snape miserable but like I be never saw anything that connected James bullying to Snape being a death eater. Like i guess in a more vague sense as in it was another thing that made him feel weak or want power. But nothing super significant like say Snapes dad influencing his anti muggle bias. I figured while James had a bad impact on Snape I don't think James had much of a influence  on the death eater stuff for Snape.

******** Okay. Yeah I completely agree (again lol). By the time she tried it was too little to late.

James didn't make Snape gravitate, but he closed a potential door to help. Potters are an influential family and with James actively going against Snape, most Gryffindors likely wouldn't want to associate with him. This essentially shuts down any ability for Lily to have brought Snape into her Gryffindor friend group, thus keeping Snape surrounded by Slytherins (whom openly supported Voldy) and Lily.

Certainly though Snapes house placement and home situation were bigger factors without a doubt.

********* I mean so while James was still popular and Head boy by the end of schooling Lilly was also popular and Head girl by the end of her schooling and it seemed like Lilly had a separate group of friends than James . Lilly wasn't a big fan of James for a long time and she seemed pretty open about that fact so I figured her friend group was a bit like that too.

Snape may have never had a chance to be friends with the Marauders. At least not till they matured a bit but I think she could have theoretically drawn him into her own friend group if he wanted to be more separate from Slytherin influence. Or rather influence from his friends. There were influential people in Slytherin who were death eaters or associated with them.

But I really doubt everyone in Slytherin was a death eater/aligned with them. I also doubt the other houses were free of that. I do think it was possible that Snape could have made friends who weren't bigots in Slytherin and then he maybe wouldn't have gone that route. I actually have the same theory for Draco. I think who they got attached to at that age kinda shaped their views a bit as it does with many preteens. And they ended up friends with bigots and I don't think cared enough about the bigotry to distance themselves. Or maybe even thought they made good points.

So say if Lilly's friendship with Snape made him uncomfortable about those beliefs he could like distance himself from them and go towards a new group of friends in slytherin and end up closer to Lilly's friends who would then not have a issue with him.

As opposed to in canon where he kinda decides to treat Lilly as the exception and retain the same beliefs. So alot of people would have a problem with him.

James could still be a dick but I honestly think if he had a group of griffindors who were alright with Snape he wouldn't be. Or at least way less of a dick.

When he was picking on Snape none of the other Griffindors minus Lilly said anything and you know Lilly's friends already didn't approve of him and thought it was a toxic friendship for her. I think James can only get away with that kinda thing if pretty much everyone in Griffindor dislikes Snape. The marauders are troublemakers sure but they are popular charismatic troublemakers not outcast ones so if Snape was more liked in their house I think they'd tone things way down.

Though that goes both ways a bit I doubt Snape trying to find out what they were doing sneaking out when they were helping Lupin with his werewolf issue helped their relationship any. And if Snape continued to do things like that it would still be a rivalry tho I still say a much less heated one.

I do agree with the fact that the Potters with their crap ton of money and influence could have been a escape for Snape from his shitty family like to run away to just like Potters were for Sirius. In like an AU where they somehow end up friends. Which would be a fun au I think . But he I think would have to be friends don't think it would work if James just tolerated Snape or wasn't very close to him. Dont think Snape would consider going to James then.

********** By the time Lily would've needed to start bringing Snape in, she would not have been a house head yet. I'm saying this needed to have started first year to early second year. The absolute latest I could see with a reasonable chance at Snape not joining DE is third year.

Potters are one of the most influential wizarding families in the history of the HP-universe. I'd imagine they effectively were the Malfoys of Gryffindor (in terms of influence). If he wanted to bar someone it didn't particularly matter weither or not you liked James, you did it. This was simply Wizarding society, we see this current day Wizarding world too. (Side Tangent: why are you giving Head Boy to James? This is supposed to be a role model and someone responsible enough to look after the rest of the house! That's like giving HB to Fred/George, they're some of my favorite characters, sure, but neither of them should be head boy!)

Yeah that's going back to the comment that i thought it'd be an interesting albeit unrealistic fanfic. Would be cool to read, but I doubt that would ever be a real possibility.

On Slytherin house. This was when Voldemort was at his most influential. This also would've been pre-war to very early war. This means that there were more purebloods and pureblood families around (the main demographic for what Voldy was selling), considering most purebloods end up in Slytherin. It's probably safe to say that Slytherin was an echo chamber for pureblood ideals, even if you were a rare Slytherin who didn't agree, you most likely weren't saying anything. Another thing I want to point out was that it was stated that people were less willing to follow Voldemort the second time around, and even then the support from Slytherin house was such that they locked them in the dungeons during the Battle of Hogwarts. (Side Tangent 2; Electric Boogaloo: I've made the comparison previously, but I still think it holds true. Draco was raised in a blood purist household for the first 11yrs of his life, much like religious families your not going to convince an 11yr old that every thing should be approached differently. Even with less levels of echo chamber, it's a very difficult task.)

This is where I'd argue that friendship and the nature of it comes into play. Friends (in my opinion) are supposed to keep you from messing up and if they see you with the wrong crowd (or even just one they dislike) they should try to interfere. I do believe that in this situation Lily should've taken action as she took issue with the people around Snape.

It was probably more that everyone in Gryffindor had come level of indifference towards Snape. The only Gryffindors that seemed to actively dislike Snape (to me at least) were James and Sirius. Which does extend to how the Marauders even chose Snape, where James chose him, Sirius went along because he's Slytherin and the other two didn't really put up an argument. At the beginning only one had an issue with Snape specifically.

*********** For James being headboy i thought it was canon? I could be remembering it wrong but I could have sworn Hagrid said that.

Honestly I have no idea how the influence of the old pure blood families work as far as school goes. The inner workings of how Slytherin works as a house you don't get to find out. As far as you know Malfoy has only a handful of friends and the rest put up with him cuz he rich but others have more influence.

As for Griffindor you never really see like the popular ones have much of like big family names in Harry's time minus the Weaselys but that could also just be because there's so many of them . Harry's popular but not because he's a Potter but because he's the boy who lived. Dean Thomas is popular but he's half blood and no famous family ties you find out about. Parvati and Lavender are also popular but again no popular last names here. Neville on the other hand does have a famous last name but he doesn't get popular till way later and it's because of the things he does not what his family is known for.

All the stuff with barring people by using your families influence you don't really get to see in the books as far as it goes with students. Maybe it happens in Slyrherin but you don't get to see it. Usually the getting shunned comes from like loosing alot of points or like speaking passeltongue.

Draco was raised by people who were huge bigots but I find it odd that he at 11 wasn't spouting anti muggleborn rhetoric. I mean he is 11 he not going to really censor his beliefs that much and may not even expect much pushback having been raised by that . But he's not blatantly racist till 2nd year.

In my opinion the malfoys talked far more about things like how to grow in power and influence and how important it is Draco be good at things. And not at all about things that displeased them like muggleborns. That's why Draco wasn't dropping mudblood when he first came. Draco could have picked up on the disgust they felt anyway but it was more implied and not ever the focus of their conversations with him and around him.

Friends definitely can and should call you out when you are heading down the wrong road. And Lilly does she calls him out . Calls his friends out. Tries to give his friends a chance sees she can't. Has his back during the bullying when no one else is on her side. And gives Snape chances at the point where everyone else is saying its too late and finally gives up.

I think she did enough. But in the end he had to respond to those chances and what she was saying about his friends. And he didn't. He joined a hate group for people who hated people like her. She did everything a friend could and he was honestly a pretty shitty friend by doing all that so it ended.

It was never her responsibility to make Snape stop being bigoted and she never could if he didn't want to. And in canon you see he didn't.

************ He was. That was the basis of my side rant, I don't think he should've. He's one of two known head boys that wasn't a prefect first though. You only become head boy in 7th year.

Less of within the school and more within society. Purebloods hold many positions of power in the wizarding world so it'd be kinda like messing with the child of your boss. At least this is how most magical-raised would probably see it. We see the effect of a name as soon as the first book (the interaction between Draco and Ron).

Many big family names in Harry's time lost importance. Again, there is a difference between popular and influential. As for the barring, you don't really see Harry interact with anyone from any other house (DA exception) and in the case of Luna (the major one) she's shunned from Ravenclaw.

I grew up in a split family. My mother and her side were religious, I and my fathers side are not. Honestly, people don't really talk about things they consider fact unless it or a related topic is specifically brought up. You'd mainly see it in Draco's interactions with Hermione (as wel follow Harry), and those don't really start until 2nd year either (if I recall correctly).

That mainly had to with the way you worded what I was responding to. Snape wouldn't have been uncomfortable with Slytherins as they were the first large group to accept him. He was blind to the negatives because he finally had an accepting group. Lily noticed this issue and mentioned it, yes, but that isn't enough for that situation. She needed to gently force him out of it and into another group. I've been the Lily in this situation before, I've even been the Snape in this situation once (without the abuse mind you). Honestly, it's not something very difficult to do.

************* Ohh ok I mean it is mentioned James matured by 7th year so maybe that could be why. Also the headboys and girls I think are for having a good reputation with their peers ( like in their house) having good grades and having a good enough reputation with the teachers or at least the headmaster who appoints them tho I imagine the head of house had input.

James had good grades he became an animagus at a young age, he helped create the map so you know he was smart. He was popular in Griffindor house his relationship with the other houses wasn't as relevant I don't think. After all Draco and Ron both became prefects.

And of course Dumbledore and Mcgonnigal both liked the Marauders. I mean would others be more deserving than James because they had all those qualities and didn't have the reputation of being rule breakers or a history of bullying? Probably.

But given the set up makes perfect sense James got picked ( especially since rule breaking and Griffindor ...idk I feel like it not such a big deal). Just like it makes perfect sense Tom Riddle Jr was picked despite there being others who were more deserving. Because he was smart charismatic and the headmaster at the time liked him.

Not saying that James Potter is anywhere near as bad as Voldemort but you kinda hopefully get where I'm coming from. It makes sense for this school.

I do think Draco and Ron have a unique thing cuz of their fathers having a feud. Ron gets very insulted maybe because of the family names but he is very sensitive of the fact his family is poor and Draco hits that button. You don't see Draco really acknowledge any of the sacred 28 in that way. Only Ernie and Slughorn seem to pander to the big families specifically and that's considered kinda laughable. It could be just the griffindor house culture. I think Griffindor has fewer in Harry's time and Slytherin has more big names but its really hard to gauge how their influence plays out because you really don't get to see it.

As for Luna I mean she gets shunned because they see her as really weird even Harry and his friends get that reaction to her initially and most of them aren't really pandering to the big families.

As for Slytherins as a group I don't know if they did. I know his friends in Slytherin probably did but no idea if he just had a small group of friends or not. My suspicion is that he had a small group. I suspect the more popular Slytherins if they were bigoted ( like Lucius) hid it better. I think if he was more popular more would have spoken up. After all he was like in the courtyard it wasn't just Griffindors there but only Lilly defended him.

The clips of memories you see with Snape and Lilly aren't all memories between them but in my opinion enough to tell a story to explain what happened between them.

I mean technically yes if she brought it up once did nothing else and then broke off their friendship she could have pushed more. But when she does finally does break of the friendship she says things that indicate alot more stuff happened in between those 2 memories you don't get to see.

I think that memory of her calling out his friends and him being dismissive is a summary of the problem.

She tries to draw him away from that group he refuses to be drawn away, or admit there is even a reason that sort of thinking could be hurtful to anyone including her when it actually directly effects her. He does not care beyond the fact that they remain close and she dislikes James Potter.

Anything else including the harmful actions of his friends towards people like her doesn't matter.

Basically I don't think Lilly failed to put in enough effort. Snape just was that attached to those other friends and did not want to leave he was close to them he liked them. If his first group of friends were different maybe things would be different.

The house system also doesn't really help i think it would be harder for Lilly to have as much of a connection with him from a different house unless he chose to be more disconnected from his house. But again I do think it was still possible for him to theoretically be friends with non bigots in Slytherin and things would have ended differently if he had been but he likely wouldn't be a spy and Neville might have ended up the boy who lived.

As for Draco I see the Death Eaters and their ideology kinda like Nazis. Are there super religious ones? Ya for sure. But you don't need to be super religious and in a fanatical cult to be a supremacist.

I personally think the Malfoys were just bigots who benefitted off that ideology rather than on board with joining the equivalent of the more extremist religious movement. Which is why they were on board in the fist war and struggling way more and not having a good time in war 2.

So Draco with the right friends from the start could have ended up more like Sirius but with the wrong friends he would get more extremist and face 0 consequences from his parents.

Thats more my take on it anyway its I think vague enough you could see it in other ways easily but that just how I see it.

************** Head boy is a title given to prefects, their job is to be a leader to all the prefects and role model for the school. They need to be responsible, trustworthy, good leaders, role models. Also given that they need to be unbiased towards houses (as they lead prefects from all houses) I would imagine inter-house relationships would be important.

As you mentioned Tom let's do a resume comparison.

Tom: Great Student near if not the top of all his classes, Has a good relationship with nearly everyone in the school, Generally considered a good person, as a prefect he cause and brought to justice the person that brought in a category 4/5 beast that had killed a girl.

James: Great Student (his standing unknown), definite leadership qualities, he's the leader of the largest group of trouble makers, he's a known bully, he's had multiple detentions, balanced his school work with being the quidditch team chaser (maybe team captain, I cannot remember), and was not a prefect.

You might notice a few things left off. First no one knew about the map thus it couldn't have factored into the decision. Similarly, James was an unregistered (illegal) animagus, if people had known about that he'd have been sent to jail. Also you might point out that the last point of Tom's isn't entirely correct, but like the Map with James, people didn't know about that. Based on these resumes one of these students is much better for Head Boy than the other. Dumbledore personally didn't like Tom but that wouldn't be enough of a reason to veto the position. Tom clearly deserved the position whereas James failed to meet the most basic requirement (be a prefect).

I'd also point out you don't really see Draco interact with very many people. Especially since the book follows another character. What we do know is that members of the sacred 28 hold positions of power.

It's not that Lily didn't give enough effort, she gave the wrong kind of effort. Think of it like pushing a boulder. She pushed it to a hill and decided to go over it, she could've looked to the side and noticed a flat planes beside the hill and gone around. It wouldn't have seemed like much progress at first but once you're there you're cruising.

As for Draco I used religion as an example due to the fact it's something you're raised in and accept. I presume you know it's a dumb idea to put your hand on a hot stove, I'd consider it common sense. Draco is the same way with his beliefs.

As for the Malfoys in general this is mentioned on Pottermore. The more radical pure blood families consider them technical purebloods, as they are known to marry half-bloods. They are certainly less radical than say the Gaunts, who only married Gaunts because Gaunts are pure, or the Blacks who only married purebloods. Malfoys too advantage of the fact that you only need the previous 4 (I'm pretty sure, honestly cannot remember the number of the top of my head) generations to have been muggle-free. But they do still take notable pride in being a pureblood family.

*************** According to the wiki the headboy is not necessarily given to the prefect but can be and is likely to be. Not sure if the rules were ever established in the books.

But as long as the grades are good enough and your standing with the students in your grade is good enough the headmaster can choose you. I assumed the head of house has input but nothing to actually suggest they do. But regardless if they do or not James head of house and headmaster approved of him. Dippet liked Tom Dumbledore didn't but Dumbledore wasn't his head of house or the headmaster at the time.

The map and animagus isn't to suggest anyone else knew about these accomplishments. Just that it requires profiency in magic that would have come across in his grades.

Really what I'm getting at here is as long as you are good enough that it wouldn't be a scandal for you to qualify its really down to if the headmaster likes you. Which is why I said it makes sense James would get picked even if others could be better or more deserving. Not saying they were just saying even if there were.

In all fairness to Lilly she may not be in the best position to sway Snape she was basically the target of the bigoted ideas he believed in. Someone who was supposed to be beneath him based on the beliefs he was being told and believed in. It might be easier if he was being told this sort of thing by someone that same ideology told him to respect. Someone like say Sirius who grew up around that bigotry knew where it came from and rejected it and was this high class pureblood. He'd be pretty ideal. Course if that someone had more access to him that would make it easier too. Like being in the same house as him which Lilly wasn't.

I completely agree Draco the Malfoys Slytherin house in general is very vague in the books ( I don't really use pottermore much or give Rowling thoughts post books much credit I generally just base it by just what is told in the books) .

Honestly you could make alot of conficting theories on Draco and the Malfoys that all hold up based on what little you know. It really just comes down to your interpretation and this one is mine.

**************** Your right. My original rant/issue was that he didn't deserve it. Which, if he got it through good relationships with head of house and headmaster, he didn't.

Lily was in a unique position as she was Snape's most valued friend. That in and of itself is the main reason the strategy I mentioned works, it starts with getting the person to forgo the people unwanted (by original friend) then over time would allow Lily to bring Snape with her to her other friends (you'd start with closer ones who do know what exactly your trying to do) this would build Snape into Lily's network and effectively cut him off from his previous one. From there is where you start addressing the major issues (lashing out at undeserving people).

That's fair. I read it on the wikia and it cited pottermore. I checked the cited source (just to see if they took something wrong) and the wiki copied pretty much word for word lol.

As a bullied child in senior school (ages 11-15 for GCSE's and 16&17 for A Levels), I found a group that tolerated me enough to stop the bullies from being a problem in their presence. I was lucky as they were genuinely good and nice people, but it could so easily have turned out differently if there were costs involved in that protection.

This could well have happened to Snape, where early on in Hogwarts he started hanging around with a group for protection, and he only got "pranked" when he was trying to see his other friends. When those friends were swayed by the rhetoric of the death eaters, he was carried along with it. It was only with the prophecy that he realised just how deep he was, and he tried to get out only to get caught in another's web.

I am wondering how, though, if Eilieen Snape gave up her wand for Tobias Snape. We don't have Snape's word for it, we have Sirius's word for it and he's rather biased.

By fifth year, yes, he's radicalised and set on his path. I don't buy that he was, at eleven years old, irredeemable. I think he was just surrounded by blood-purists and relentlessly bullied for hanging around with Lily. I strongly doubt he knew any dark curses at all, but I bet he learned a whole lot of them, very fast, if James and Sirius were ganging up on him right from the first day on the train.

My guess is that Eileen wasn't paying too much attention on which of her old books Severus was cruising through. Therefore, I do think that Eileen was initially at fault for allowing him to read those.

However I'm pretty sure that he never used a wand since it is forbidden for children to have a wand below 11 years.

My school was only slightly smaller than Hogwarts, and when I was in fifth year the new head teacher changed our house system from one with two houses and everyone sat in year groups for assembly, to one with four houses and we sat in houses for assembly. (It was supposed to promote older children helping younger children, etc) Suddenly I was away from my friends in my year and only had three other girls that I vaguely knew around.

Now, I try to imagine that, except that the houses are effectively self-chosen, based on character traits, and with peer pressure to act like a member of your house.... And if your friendship (or rivalry) with those small number of children your age gets toxic, you can't move schools, because it's literally the only school of its kind in the country.

My kid hasn't even started school yet, but I already know a few children who've been bullied or started thinking of themselves as "no good" at one school, then get to start fresh at a new school and thrive.

As I get older, the wizarding world looks more and more toxic. Like, I moved out of a little post-industrial town to a university city because I couldn't handle the lack of diversity, and I've realised that the equivalent of that in HP is either moving country, or living in the Muggle world.

It's just. No wonder so many characters become awful people.

***** It's a bigger truth than just fandom, too - there's been a lot of talk in the papers over the past few years about how so many of England's hereditary politicians are damaged by their childhoods spent in elite boarding schools like Eton.

I noticed recently that Percy is basically a poster child for "Boarding School Syndrome".

  We know that Snape was friends with blood supremacists
#+end_quote

In his 5th year. Lily's comments make it very clear that this was a new friendship. After 5 years of being bullied by the Marauders. He needed protection and they were the only people willing to offer it to him. People conveniently forget this timeline.

  "Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice. "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait join You-Know-Who, can you?"

** Outside of weather or not you're right what bothers me the most is that it absolutely does not matter for fanfiction. Its bloody fanfiction and its perfectly okay to make a fanfic where james is a little sociopath who pushed snape to far as well as a fanfiction where james and snape fall in love and snape never turns dark because of it or anything in between. Fanfiction is not beholden to canon.

  J.K. Rowling: Well, that is Snape's tragedy. Given his time over again he would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people (like Wormtail) he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive

"She's only a - "

"Wouldn't spy on you anyway.../you're/ a muggle."

He believed in the ideology before he even got to Hogwarts.

***** Well, he went from saying '/you're/ a muggle' to calling almost every muggleborn a 'mudblood.' He was so nasty to them they wondered why he and Lily were friends. He also grew up to verbally abuse children so...I guess?

****** Perhaps he was a product of his environment. An abusive muggle father. Bullied cruelly by Gryffindors throughout his teenage years.

It doesn't excuse his later actions, but it explains why he was the way he was - without either of those factors he likely wouldn't have ended up a death eater.
