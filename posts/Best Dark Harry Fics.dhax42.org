Looking for some really good dark Harry fics. What I mean is a story 1. Well written 2. Preferably a het pairing and not slash (lemons are fine) 3. A Harry who isn't friends with Hermione, Ron and Neville - simply because his a slytherin and he finds Hermione a know it all (or blood prejudice, really not picky as long as they aren't good friends) 4. A bonus would be Harry being actually politically savvy and acts like a slytherin 5. Finally I don't mind if his a son of Voldemort, black family whatever. Apart from the above stipulations I really don't mind what form the story takes. Thank you for any help you can provide

** linkffn(Antithesis) is a WBWL fic, doesn't meet the bonus, but it is pretty great. Decidedly tragic.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

**** Thank you I've read it but found the ruining of his face and the lack of a pairing (at least as far as I read) off putting. I read up to the point of his scarring and haven't continued since but I feel I will in the future

A Cadmean victory is on the the best FF's I've ever read, I don't know if he's properly dark in this fic but great nonetheless.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** We recently had a discussion about allowing the sharing of a story where a 17 year old Harry has semi-explicit sex and now you share a story were 14 year old Harry explicitly has sex with multiple 17+ year old women. I personally think that the rule is impossible to follow in the fanfic community without banning half the stories that exist, but rules are rules right?
