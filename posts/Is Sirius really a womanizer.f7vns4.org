I've seen this idea used in a few fics I read. A different girl every week or whenever he feels it's getting too serious. Do fans get this idea from that scene where Harry sees pictures of muggle girls in Sirius's room? Would Sirius really be unwilling to have a serious relationship with anyone? And would Sirius post Azkaban really charm any woman? Because he is shown as such a charmer even then that I wonder if it could be true about canon Sirius who mostly cared only about Harry. And while teenage girls are attracted by his good looks, I wonder if his personality wouldn't scare them off since he isn't the most pleasant person there. So how much of what we see in fanon would be true of Sirius Black?


** Those posters would have been hardly out of place in a teenager's bedroom during that time. And other than that, there is nothing in canon which would indicate anything in regards to Sirius' attitude towards woman. Everything else is pure fanon.

**** That and you know, he's a teenaged boy who lives in a very very conservative society. So seeing posters of sexy ladies in muggle London would instantly be something hes down for. It's a win win he pisses off his family and gets to see ladies in almost nothing

** It is all fanon. Their were posters of girls in his room yes. But they were posters of muggle girls that he stuck to the wall with unbreakable sticking charms IIRC. It was just another act of rebellion against people he hated.

When he was locked away in Grimauld waiting for Harry to call him would be when he would be the most lonely and vulnerable. If someone came along at that time and tried to charm him he may fall for the charms, otherwise he will focus on Harry.

*** The interesting thing is that I always see the girl being charmed by Sirius's personality, so he sort of is the one doing all the charming. I never imagined someone would actually have to do all the work lol. Maybe because with women it comes across more like seduction or something similar. But now I almost want to see your version of such a story.

**** If he was pre Azkaban then he might have been the charmer. We just do not know.

All we see in canon is a godfather putting on his best facade trying to be responsible for the sake of his godson. In canon Sirius was utterly devoted to Harry. We are talking about a man who left a safe place in the tropics and came back to place where he will be executed at sight when he learned about the vision Harry had at the start of GOF so that he would be able to help if Harry needs it. He spent the entire year living in a cave, eating rats, risking his life to talk to Harry and give him advice while isolated from the rest of the world.

He spent OOTP locked up in a place he hated and filled with bad memories so that he could spend time with his Godson. Not to mention the risk he took in POA to get Harry a Firebolt so that Harry could continue doing something he loves.

This is the sort of dedication he showed in canon. It would not surprise me if he was like this before Azkaban as well given his upbringing would make him devoted to someone he actually considers family (as shown by him agreeing to be a bait for Potters knowing that he would tortured till his mind broke when he is caught). Or this might only be because of the loss he suffered and subsequent twelve years of torture he went through. I believe in the first scenario though.

My headcanon is that he might have tried dating a few times and scared his dates off with his needy and utterly devoted behavior or had his heart broken when they walked away wanting something more casual than what he willing to offer and then given up on it instead focusing on his brothers.

This is why I think he would have to be charmed into a relationship by someone he at least trusts.

** I am really tired of the Womanizer! Sirius thing. It gets on my nerves when I read a fic and that's basically his most defining characteristic alongside immature jokes and stupid shit. That's not Sirius for me.

#+begin_quote
  Would Sirius really be unwilling to have a serious relationship with anyone?
#+end_quote

I think deep down Sirius hungers for family and familiarity. I think that if he DID find someone he would be reluctant due to his battered sense of worth after Azkaban, his mental health issues (How can you spend a dozen years there and come out completely mentally well? You don't!), and making Harry his highest priority.

It would not be because hurr durr I'm Sirius Black and I only do hook ups, I'm a play boy etc etc.

If you're talking about the fanon Womanizer! Immature! Idiot! Sirius, then almost nothing.

*** I really wonder how this particular portrayal got so popular. I haven't read a lot of fanfic, and even I am influenced by it. Could you describe the way you think Sirius would treat women and how he would act in a relationship? I really want to know what could be true instead of having to dig up the real portrayal buried somewhere under fans' ideas of what Sirius is like.

**** I think Sirius is someone who heavily values relationships and is loyal to the people he loves until the end. He has shown to have given up everything for the Potters. He loves Harry with all of his heart, this single minded, pure love that no one else really shows Harry and this is AFTER Azkaban, this is broken Sirius...

I think Sirius would always be hungry for a bond with someone else, for true companionship. He wouldn't be someone that relished in flings, he would want something lasting, perhaps the kind of relationship he saw develop with Lily and James. The kind of deep connection he had with his friends. He would want someone that he could build a family with, even if he doesn't admit it out loud.

I think that at the core of it, Sirius was a lonely person. Even as a kid in Hogwarts, he had his problems with his family. After Azkaban, it would be so much worse. I think that the possibility of a strong, real, caring relationship in that time frame would be to him like a moth to a flame. He would want that warmth so badly, but at the same time he's suffered so much loss and tragedy that he might not have the strength to take that first step and just focus on Harry. He would need a lot of therapy and mental help before he could take that step imo.

And this is why I despise Fanon portrayals of Sirius because they take away all the complexity of who he is, his struggle, and how he would be affected by the tragedy of his life and make him such a one note, shallow character.

***** I think what always made me doubt his willingness to commit was his single-minded devotion to James. I remember reading a fic where Sirius absolutely refused to leave Britain, even though he had a wife and a child, but helped James get into hiding and was concerned about him. What I mean that James was a special friend, Sirius seems to have shared a bond with him that was like that between brothers, and so he was loyal to James. I think I found it hard to believe he could have such a bond with a woman. And I actually nevr saw this shown anywhere, which is a pity. It almost felt to me like Sirius felt grateful to James for his acceptance and so gave him his loyalty. It makes me wonder just what a woman would have to give him to earn that sort of loyalty. In every single fic, it's always, always about James. Even in that fic I read, I thought Sirius would choose James over his own family.

****** Well, it's true in canon that Sirius is very devoted to James. Before the war, well why wouldn't he be? He was his best friend, his family. After the war, he became the symbol for everything Sirius had lost and that's probably what he latched on to in his broken state (those memories and times of happiness).

Fanfics focus only on that which I think is unrealistic honestly, especially if it's during a time when Jily are both alive. They're only taking into account his love for James and nothing else. Sure, there's nothing in canon to say that Sirius would have loved someone as much in a different relationship at that time, but there's nothing AGAINST that either. Remember that Sirius was so young at that the time James died; it's common to not find your "fated" person at that time. And when he was put in Azkaban, he spent 12 years in a this ambiguous state. He was never allowed to properly grieve for what he had lost, to heal and move on. People take the way Sirius focused on the idea of James so much after Azkaban as some strange obsession that would never leave rather than a consequence of being a broken man trying to cope with his reality.

** As others have mentioned, ladys man Sirius isn't canon, and is for the most part an unenjoyable trope.

I have seen one interpretation though that worked. It was a Hogwarts age Sirius whose sluttiness was due to underlying insecurities about his ability to love and be loved. He kept his relationships shallow and physical so he never had to risk real rejection. It was something that he didn't like about himself, and that he grew out of as a person.

*** It's not unenjoyable TBH. It seems quite reasonable to me to assume that Sirius - pre-Azkaban - would have been a bit of a womanizer. Obviously it's not the only viable interpretation of the character, and there's nothing wrong with taking it a different direction.

But it's just as enjoyable as any other interpretation of Sirius - and entirely depends on the writing quality, which is /exactly/ the same as the other ways he could be written.

** The evidence from the books are only the posters and the fact that Harry in OotP wishes he could talk to Sirius to ask about girls. You can make a lot from that or nothing at all.

Outside of the books there is JKR's twitter where she responded to someone asking about if Sirius ever married by saying "Sirius was too busy being a rebel to marry." Secondly, and perhaps most importantly if we're looking for JKR's intention, we have the essay she wrote about Lupin on Pottermore. In the essay, Remus is worried Tonks is interested in Sirius and says (bitterly) "he always got the women". So from that we can conclude that she did intend him to be a bit of a womanizer in his youth.

*** hmm I forgot about that Harry's wish and that essay. But I'd love to know how far Rowling imagined he'd go with his womanizing. From what Ive seen, a lot of fics show him not getting serious with anyone but having a lot of girlfriends. Rowling's Strike gives me that impression and now I fear that this was precisely what Sirius is like in her head. I'm strangely upset about this for some reason.

**** Yeah good question! I think she's left it open enough that fanfics can get creative about it.

I personally think you're right about how special his relationship was with James, and to develope on that I think it would take a lot for him to really fall in love with a woman. I think it's easier to see him having lots of meaningless relations with women (or men...) to blow off steam and then to feel very close to his best friends instead. If he shared a lot of poignant moments with someone who was fighting for the same cause as him, then maybe he'd slowly become friends and fall in love with them. But it seems to me as if James, Remus, Peter and Lily (and later Harry and his friends) were all he cared for.

** I totally believe leaving Azkaban would result in arrested development. In the muggle world it's extensively documented in addicts and prisoners. When they get clean and or are released they're often at the emotional age when they started using or entered prison. They haven't had a chance to naturally and healthily develop to their chronological age. So Sirius entered Azkaban at what, 19-20 years old? I believe when he was finally exonerated he'd be starting at the emotional and psychological level of a young adult. He had so much other psychological and physical damage and baggage from his imprisonment and time on the run, I don't think he would have had a chance to start "growing up" in that sense until that was all dealt with.

The question is was 19-20 year old Sirius a womanizer? If so I think there's some validity to this characterization.
