Whenever i try to look for some they are always written by some 10 year old who doesn't know basic grammar lol. I really dont care if its a long fic or just a one-shot. If you have any recommendations please let me know!!

*** Seconded - I absolutely love this fic. I believe the author (who occasionally hangs out on this sub too) has a few more of Harry's interactions with the Dursleys, but I'm not sure how actively she's been posting them to FFN. Take a look in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][this collection]] on AO3.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** Throughout Vekin87's Albus Potter series I recall seeing a few interactions between the Potters and the Dursleys. They are always awkward and Albus is always shocked that Dudley has two sons, the youngest one being quite scrawny and always being bullied by his older beefier brother. They are not major or significant plot points but Dudley and his family are quite supportive of Ginny when Harry gets into some serious trouble.

**** There are many idiots in the world (and the only way how to survive well on Reddit is to ignore scores). These are large stories, not one-shots, so the relationship with Dursleys are just small subplots of them, which perhaps might be somehow disappointing to some. However, these are truly good stories worthy of reading.
