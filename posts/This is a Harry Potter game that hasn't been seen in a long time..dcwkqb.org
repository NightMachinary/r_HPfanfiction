** Is it the same as the PS2 version? Cos I had that one. And the PS1 version. And the GBC version. And the PC version. And they were all different. There's also a GBA version which i didn't have.

** I actually have a copy of this on my shelf, but I've never actually played it, I don't think. I had the PC version growing up, though, and that game kicked raw ass.
