Just a showerthought on my part, but what if the wand does more than just "matching" with a witch or wizard?

With the release of information on wand woods by Pottermore, we know that certain wand woods suit certain personalities. We also know which wand woods make up the wands of some canon characters. However, what if it's also possible that a certain wand, choosing a certain wizard, leads to a different fate for said wizard? i.e., say, an Ebony wand, said to be suited to "warriors", "choosing" Hermione, instead of her Vine one?

For example, wands are said to be somewhat sentient. Another sentient object, or so it seems, is Hogwarts's own Sorting Hat. As we see with the Sorting Hat, the Hat itself must Sort students into one of four Hogwarts houses. Depending on which House the Hat sorts the person into, their path (and destiny, along with personality) seems to be altered. We've seen this time and again with many, many AUs of Harry being Sorted into a different House, usually Ravenclaw or Slytherin.

However, what if wands end up doing the same thing? Or, on the other hand, can the wand(s) sense the wizard's subconscious feelings, thoughts, and desires? Or is a particular wand "choosing" a particular wizard, perhaps, fate-related, as Harry's wand choosing him would seem to indicate? In which case, would a different wand "choosing" the wizard change his/her fate?

As I've seen in the books, by and large, wizards tend to prefer their "original" (first) wands - the first ones that "choose" them. We see this with Harry, Hermione, and Draco Malfoy in the series, namely in /Deathly Hallows/. That would seem to indicate that the first wand that "chooses" a wizard /is/ related to that wizard's destiny in life, an idea that is even mentioned by Ollivander in some of the Pottermore wand wood descriptions.

What do you think, [[/r/hpfanfiction]]?

***** Oh, I know. I meant more that if someone was writing a story along the lines of what [[/u/obversa]] is wondering, that Mrs. Longbottom making Neville use his father's wand in the hope of it helping him along could very easily be turned from wishful thinking to a plan with a reasonable plan that could work. Just saying you could view it through another lens and make it support the theory.

** Some wands are also better suited for certain activities as well, like transfiguration or charms. By assisting or resisting in certain kinds of spells, wands could influence (consciously or not) a student to a certain path. Like if a wand is suited for healing spells, that could lead to a career as a mediwizard or just a gentler personality.

It could also be possible that wands are choosing people like them. If a wand wants to be involved in evil things, it might choose a wizard who already has a cruel streak. Instead of pushing that wizard to a different path, they could both be working together to solidify the paths they were both already on.

Bellatrix, for example, is clearly a crazy, evil woman. Her personality is so strong (to the point of mental illness), that it would be doubtful that a wand pushed her to that path. Her wand is walnut, dragon heartstring, and and described as "unyielding" by Ollivander in DH. Walnut is associated with witches, evil, and poison. Dragon heartstring is for flamboyant, powerful magic, and the wikia says it [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_heartstring][tends to be easiest to turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not incline that way of its own accord.]] Unyielding could be a connection to Bellatrix's convictions, or her loyalty to Voldemort, or her lack of mercy. It seems like the wand chose her because they were compatible, and Bellatrix pushed the wand onto a path of evil, rather than the other way around.

** I have actually been thinking along those lines today when thinking about how wandless magic works.

Essentially, the way the Dresden series treats magic (will and absolute belief that you are allowed to/can do what you set out to do) is how I picture how wandless magic works in HP too. In short, doing wandless magic is more than just doing a spell without a wand-wandless magic is a whole different game. With wandless magic, you have to absolutely, completely and utterly believe that you have the right to do what you're doing, you believe that what you're doing is going to work and you have an idea as to how it works as well.

It doesn't help that, a lot of the time, you also have to know exactly what effects & side effects performing such a spell would carry, no mean feat when you consider the education level required to understand just how casting a muscle growth spell on yourself is likely to affect you in mind, body and calorie consumption.

Now keep in mind some of the rules the Dresdenverse has with regards to magic-don't kill with it, don't mindfuck other people with it, don't summon eldritch monsters from the whackier side of R'Lyeh, that kind of thing. The reason being is that, to do such things, you are basically saying 'yeah, I am willing to twist everything human about me to do /this/' before proceeding to screw up someone's day-and key components of your psyche as well.

This is a big problem in the HP 'verse since a lot of kids do accidental magic all the time. So when you have someone bitter, intelligent and curious enough to go exploring down the seedier side of things, they quickly find themselves on a slippery slope from which coming back would be very, very hard.

Tom Riddle is the prime example of this, using his magic to terrorise, torture and intimidate his former bullies at the orphanage shortly after discovering that, yes, he could do such things.

And we all know how he ended up.

This is where the wand comes into play. Their cores are composed of what is possibly the most magically potent part of the creature they come from-dragon heartstrings, veela hair, phoenix feather etc-though hair pops up so much in relation to creatures that affect people using a visual component (veela allure and thestral cloaking being two of those) that it probably warrants a discussion by itself, but I digress.

Basically, the most magical part of a magical animal is used in wands. Part of the reason I think that happens is because the role the wands could be playing.

Basically, the core of the wand acts as a buffer while the wood helps attune the buffer to a particular kind of personality likely to use magic. The wand interfaces with the wizard during casting, interpreting and refining the energies fuelling the spell to be more in line with the outcome of the spell the wizard/witch performing it is expecting. It handles the mental side of the will-shaping, keeping the nastier side-effects of memory tampering and transfiguration from becoming issues to either them or the victim.

That's why the wand chooses the wizard. It's not really a question of personality, but more a question about how the wand responds to a wizard's magic. The closer the match, the easier the job for the both of them. The worse the match, the greater the legwork that needs to be done by a wizard-with a badly matched wand no better than going wandless anyway, as wanded spellcasting doesn't work at all. You might as well try casting magic with a brick.

In summary, the wands shield the wizard's mind against side effects, interpret the order given through the spell and, most crucially, allow the results of the cast spell to be almost exactly duplicated by other wizards. In effect, it makes it possible for wizards to actually practice as much magic as possible in as orderly a manner as possible without going insane or driving others insane with you.

And while there are still spells that either require or generate an emotional component (the /patronus/, whose fuel is a happy memory and the unforgiveables, spells that induce feelings of euphoria on the caster in certain cases), their impact on the caster's psyche is considerably lessened thanks to the fact that the wand acts as a circuit breaker in case the feedback gets too intense-which keeps the wizard/witch from being flash-fried in a backdraft of wild magic.

In short, a wand is pretty much /the/ foci of preference because it relieves mental strain, provides wizards with a degree of confidence that a spell can be learned and replicated with close to no variance in it and, by doing so, picks up the mental slack where the wizard doesn't whilst shaping the spell.

That's what a wand does-it allows the wizard to treat magic as an academic discipline with more direct practical applications to less than are usually found outside of the sciences rather than the ultra-dangerous mental and physical gymnastics exercises punctuated by unstable magical flows, moments of extreme lethality and the occasional successful spell doing the exact inverse of what it was supposed to because the wizard discarded a set of variables he didn't consider important yet turned out to be vital that characterises the life of a wandless magic practitioner.

Miscast a fire spell, for example? With a wand, you get a puff & a spark. Without one? Congratulations, you just turned your arm into a chunk of human steak. Maybe the beastie you were aiming at will even thank you before chowing down.

In short, without a wand, being a wizard would be a whole lot more dangerous, lethal-and quite likely way more fun.
