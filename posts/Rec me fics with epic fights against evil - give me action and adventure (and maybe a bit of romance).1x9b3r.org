Hey guys - I'm looking for some awesome fics centered around the trio kicking ass and taking names. I'm wanting training, adventures, awesome plots and terrifying battles. (Bonus points for mentor!Snape to Harry). Basically, give me your epic fights against evil, lots of teamwork, hard work, and just all round awesomeness. Don't mind any particular ship, so long as it's well written. If it's not my cup of tea, I'll soon find out. :)

(And on that note, a guilty pleasure of mine - you could also rec me the best Hermione/Snape fics you know. Would again prefer something with a kickass plot, but doesn't necessarily have to be long.)

Please and thank you!

Edit: just nothing with the whole 'epilogue' shebang; I'm an EWE? kind of gal. :)


** It's an oldie, but perhaps sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]]? 250k words, complete.

  Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr.

Another oldie dialed to eleven on the "epicness" scale is joe6991's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][Hero Trilogy]], which is about a million words total and has the trio + Ginny playing a central role in an existential struggle over the fate of the multiverse.

** When it comes to "Epic", there is one go-to fanfic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]], by Joe6991.

  I've written this beginning so many times now.

  And every time I do, back here at the start, I carry with me that small spark of hope that somehow, this time will be different. That the choices I make will not lead to the end of the entire world. The hope never lasts long, such is life and the mistakes I make time and time again.

  Ah... but those choices never lead anywhere else, do they? And even when I die I wake up here again in my own personal never-ending Hell. A loop in time that I exploited once, at the end of what I suppose could be called my first life, and now can't escape no matter what I do, or how many times I fail...

  I'm not entirely certain why I write this every time it happens - I mean, I barely remember the last time, or the time before that, or the time before that, and so on, so on.... I know they happened, I know it, but the timeline itself is fuzzy, half-remembered, a dream. Unrealised realities that lived and breathed, and slaughtered the innocent.

  I remember her, and look how hard I press the quill to the parchment, but surely that can't be real - just a dream within a nightmare - a girl like that would never fall for a guy like me. Guys like me watch the world end time and time again, and always my choices fail to make a difference. Girls like her couldn't possibly live with the look in my eyes - the hungry, haunted look of a man who knows how fragile civilisation is, because he's seen it come crashing down around him... more than once.

  So what do you know so far? I think you know who I am, perhaps you've heard of my legend. Here are a few clues...

  I survived the Killing Curse at the tender age of one. I should never have seen my second birthday. I've battled with demons and monsters, defied gods and slain eternity. I've stolen forgotten years from the clutches of chaos, and shared my mind and my soul with a Dark Lord. I've seen the world end, and travelled through time only to see it end again and again...

  My name is Harry Potter, I am twenty four years old, always twenty four although I do not look it, and it is the summer before my sixth-year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The summer that everything must change, does change, will change, has changed...

  I have one question for you, dear reader, before we begin... do you believe that love can transcend the bounds of time and space, that romance can light the fires of the soul and that nothing, absolutely nothing, is more dangerous than the best of our good intentions?

  Do you?

  Hmm... do you really?

  Strap yourself in then, because this is really going to hurt...

  Oh and yes, before you write me off as an angst-ridden whiny teenager, I will say that there is one positive in all of this - the sex is always great. First time every time, ladies and gents, for Harry Potter, the Lord of Time.

*** I'd recommend Katling's HP and the Guild of Night. It was the first fic I ever read, and it remains a favourite to this day. Harry gets blinded after his uncle throws a glass in his face. It's all about how he deals with at, new magic, fighting Voldemort.

Also, another fic of hers, Trinity, is also amazing. Takes place after HBP - the trio decide to become something for Voldemort and the Death eaters to fear. Training, kicking ass, drama and action.

I've just finished reading Pet Project (ack, can't remember authors name!) which is about Hermione deciding that someone needs to start looking out for Snape. Very well written, new magic ideas I'd never come across before, excellent characterisation and the fight against Voldemort. Does eventually become HG/SS, so keep that in mind.
