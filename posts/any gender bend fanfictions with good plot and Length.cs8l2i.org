Trying to explore more types of fanfictions and be a little more open minded idc about the pairing and I want stuff like fem Harry or male hermione


** !linkffn(Weasley Girl)

This fic features a female Ron, and is heavily canon divergent. It's a great fanfiction.

!linkffn(Victoria Potter)

This fic is a fem!Harry fic that has almost exclusively original plot. It's very good.

!linkffn(The odds were never in my favor)

This is probably one of the most involved fanfictions out there, up there with Prince of Slytherin in terms of worldbuilding and complexity. Neville is the Boy Who Lived, and Alexandra Potter has her own enemies to face. Voldemort has barely been in the story so far, and the plot has a much larger scope with far more powerful players than Tom Riddle.

!linkffn(Limpieza De Sangre)

Fem!Voldemort. This one makes her into a very interesting and well balanced character. I don't care for the climax or ending of the story, but the rest of it is amazing.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

**** You don't sound like a dick. That is a valid point to make about the fic. Personally, I really like having the super long chapters and I know the story well enough now that I can usually read the latest chapter just after skimming the one before to remind myself where exactly I am in the story, but that's mostly because I've reread it, like, 5 times. For someone who's only read it once or is less familiar with/invested in the fic it can really hurt the reading experience.
