Frequently when I ask for suggestions I'll get fics I've never heard of before that I enjoy greatly. I want more of those. So give me all the less known fics you believe deserve better recognition.

No genderbending (unless there is a very. VERY good reason that has nothing to do with a pairing), no pottercest, nothing romance or angst driven, crossovers are okay, but no non-magic AUs. Also no mpreg Thank you!


** ffnbot(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) isn't exactly unknown, but I never see it mentioned around here. Definitely one of the better fics around: it avoids getting to revisionist and the characters are convincing and true to canon.

linkffn(Harry Potter & The Wizarding World: Book I - Dark Arts) is pretty inoffensive. It's very much a simple school-yard fic and the plot meanders. But it's generally decently-written without any 'red flags' and enough happens to keep me reading. Definitely deserves more than its 200 favourites.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7936530/1/As-Black-As-Night]])

This story is about Sirius Black's daughter, whose mother died a few months before the Potters. Dumbledore fakes her death so she won't grow up as the daughter of notorious Sirius Black and Marlene, who Sirius is believed to have had killed while spying for Voldemort. Maia Black grows up as an upper class snob, daughter of squib Marius Black and his muggle wife, and she's a very interesting character as she's a Slytherin, presumed half blood OC in the Black family who openly loves both her muggle mother and her pureblood Black family relations. Maia's mother and Cassiopeia Black have an interesting relationship based on mutual respect as well. It's in fourth year now.

** I've found this one pretty interesting, linkffn(12177140). It's an AU with the point of departure being that Ariana didn't die, so Dumbledore and Grindelwald never split ways. So now it's the 1990s and we're starting to see the changes this caused in the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  Albus and Gellert, two bright young wizards, would meet in the summer of 1899 and develop a strong friendship, but would part ways following the death of Albus' sister, Ariana. But what if Ariana survived this encounter? What would it mean for a boy named Harry Potter and the events that would unfold almost a century later?
