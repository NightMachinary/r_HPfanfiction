I asked this once in the H/Hr subreddit, but it cant hurt to do it here, too.

â€‹

during the defense time they get closer to each other, even so much that you could tell, she is biased (which she actually is from the beginning, since she is Harrys best Friend). It would be good, if they have a one night stand (whether detailed or just hinted), but its no requirement.

I remember that i once read a Fic, where Hermione indeed was Harrys lawyer, but there wasnt anything between them. Cant tell anymore if he was falling for a Femme Fatale or a Harmony-affair fic. But thats not the Fic im looking for, just wanted to mention it.

I might accept a Affair fic, that includes Ron being blamed or something like that. Or if Hermione is blamed and Harry the Lawyer, although i cant imagine Harry as a Lawyer :)
