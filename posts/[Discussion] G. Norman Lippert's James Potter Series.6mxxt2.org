I highly suggest reading the series, as not only are they well written, but also they incorporate new and interesting plot lines. Mostly though, I just want a place to talk about it because no one in my day to day life that I know of has read it.

THE QUESTIONS BELOW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS, SO IF YOU INTEND TO READ THE STORIES TURN BACK NOW.

1. I'm not an active member, but i'm on the subreddit a few times a week and I lurk. I almost never see discussion about the story come up. A search of the series in the reddit search bar confirms a lack of discussion. Considering how often people are looking for recommendations, it is surprising to me that the story is so rarely mentioned. Any thoughts as to why?
2. Something that struck me as impressive is the author's - G. Norman Lippert - minor details that became huge plot points later on. I'm not talking early on in a book and then later in the book. Rather, early in the /series/ resurfacing later in the series. An example of this is the 3 words that James wrote down in a latter to himself -- "Beware, Foul Donoven" -- and how that story line ended up playing out. The only logical possibility is that Lippert had the entire story planned out from the beginning. As a casual writer, I don't find myself planning things out like that. Do any of you?
3. I thought the story lines brought up in the series paled to none in the HP fan fiction world. It was refreshing for the magical world to feel magical again, as opposed to rehashed classic HP storylines that can feel like I've read it all before. (I do not mean to disparage people classic story lines or the writers of them. I've yet to find something written well that I didn't appreciate. However, in the HP universe, there are nearly limitless possibilities, and it was truly enjoyable being amazed and surprising again.)
4. Did you guys have a favorite plot line?
5. I enjoyed James and Petra's relationship, but I found the foundation lacking. I can understand why James was driver towards her, but there seems to be no real reason why she would respond in kind. Whenever Petra referred to her feelings toward James, the language would go something like this; "You're just you." While we can all empathize with that notion on some level, it feels insufficient for the story.

These are merely my starting points for discussion. I do hope there are others out there that have read the series and would like to discuss it.

** I've read the first book of this some time ago. It was very good, and very well written. But I couldn't get myself to like it, and I don't know why exactly. The best I could come up with is that it's simply good. It's written professionally, and good writers have their own styles that makes the story theirs. And so, this series didn't feel like a "Harry Potter" story to me anymore. It's got it's own identity already, and it's not the world of J. K. Rowling anymore. Specially with the American cultural themes included, which clashed horribly with my internal Potter universe.

But that's just me. Like I said, it's a very well written series and I think most people would really enjoy this. I specially liked how book 1 ended. But it's not really for me. Just my two cents.

*** I agree. It didn't have the HP feel to it. I'm glad I read it, but I would never reread it or think to recommend it.

*** Yup I can definitely understand being irked by the american cultural themes. I'm american so it was not a problem for me, but in addition to that, there's no fanfiction that feels like it was written by JKR so the fact that it feels different isn't a big issue. But to each their own!

I've actually never even heard of this, could you do a quick summary?

*** It's 5 books, so a summary is pretty difficult.

It's a coming of age tale for Harry's son James. It involves getting out from under his father's shadow, dealing with completely new evils, includes new types of magic, includes romance (which is a driving force, but it's far - far - from a fluff piece), and includes very imaginative story lines.

**** u/Satanniel:
#+begin_quote
  includes new types of magic
#+end_quote

Could you elaborate? The "magic" part is what I largely look for in HP fics, so this may either bump this on my reading priority or make me not read it.

***** - Well the stories include sorcerers/sorceresses who have different and more powerful magical abilities than wizards/witches. They have much greater control of the certain elements, particularly greens, oceans, and urban areas.

- A specific teacher (though it's in book 5) develops the ability to program spells into his wand which allows the wand to read the type of magic that is coming toward the holder of the wand.

- Fate plays a significant role, and while it's magic so plenty is left up to the imagination of the reader, in some ways Lippert does a better job of explaining the way things work than JKR did (at least, by the end of book). An example of this is the magic that goes into sacrificing oneself to save another, and the protections that follow. How that works is actually explained, at least in this author's opinion.

- Hand in hand with fate is the exploration of Seeing and predictions of that nature.

- Without going into too much detail, book 5 includes a completely new concept to me that tied specific powers and responsibilities to a lineage based on color. (e.g. the ancestral house of Black has a specific duty, benefits)

- There's also a lot of what is called "game magic" tied to a game like quidditch. This involves types of spells that can only be dodged to avoid the impacts of it, but also can't be used effectively outside of the game.

- One of main schools outside of Hogwarts features a boulder as a guardian, and it travels the people trying to get into the school to the school through time as opposed to through a gate.

I'm sure there are a bunch more I'm forgetting on top of my head, but seriously, the biggest pros of the story are the imagination of the author. He creates new magic, and uses old magic in new ways.

****** Thanks. Looking at what you wrote I would only get annoyed by this fic, so it saves me some time.

*** Same. Never heard of it either. Surprised considering how every once and a while somebody comes around asking for "all the Marauders era FF you guys know" or something to that effect.

** I know it's a silly reason not to like something, but as the guy apparently hadn't heard of fanfic before he contacted Rowling's management to check it was legal. Fair enough. But now I often see people saying it has been endorsed by Rowling and I think that's a bit cheeky.

** I've recommended this series a time or two when people were looking for good next gen stories. Great series. Elders crossing was the first fic I ever read, and it's still in my top 5

*** Me kinda, too. [[/spoiler][I think it was supposed to feel sort of like a happy ending with the ghost but becoming a ghost was supposed to be a bad thing, i.e. unfinished business. No one who died for the greater good in Harry Potter became a ghost, they all moved on. Also it seems weird that James would be content, considering earlier in the book he says/thinks something along the lines of that his love for Petra would be the flame that never dies. Especially as we've seen in Books 2+4 there is clearly some existance beyond death so if Petra has to die I feel like it would make more sense for him to go with her.]]
