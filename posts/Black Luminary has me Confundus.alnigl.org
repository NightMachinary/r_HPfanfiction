I was recommended Black Luminary by a friend of mine and got up to chapter 58 in a day.

Obvious spoilers for those who haven't read the fic.

However this fic has been especially hard for me to follow the plot.

For example, what's the deal with Aenor? It's been 58 chapters and we haven't got a single slice of information about her backstory other than she is from a pure blood family with “notable” and “proud” heritage.

Is there a single sided sexual tension between them? Harry seems to love to take peaks of her legs now and then.

Secondly why does Harry summon those Lethifolds and kill thousands of people? It is implied somewhere that the blacks experimented and put Lethifold blood in their own body but Harry isn't a biological black.

Why did Harry need a vial of aenors blood?

Why is he afraid of girls?

What was the purpose of the hollowing when nothing changed in regards to his mind magic and personality? He still seems super afraid of girls

Where is my man Tom riddle? Does he not even exist?

What the hell happened to Grindelwald? He escaped but it's been like 8 chapters and not a single word about it.

Who killed the potters?

Finally what's with that ritual involving Harry and Daphne? I was so tired I couldn't comprehend the purpose of such a thing.

This story is super awesome but it just keeps feeding you questions and rewards no answers


** Aenor is pretty obvious in my opinion. Remember that Black girl who was so good at memory charms she had to wipe herself from everyone's memory? Guess who her descendant might be.

The Letifolds were part of a duelling practice with Aenor where Harry cast that spell without properly knowing what it did.

The girl thing is childhood trauma due to the treatment he got from the "light" nannies which were taking care of/abusing him.

I ditched the story a lot earlier than where you are because I found everyone but Hermione and Bellatrix's daughter unlikable dicks in that fic, especially Harry and Daphne.

** I feel the same way. The author uses this kind of unreliable narrator, keeping-the-readers-in-the-dark thing as plot device (?) or something. TBH it is too convoluted to be read incomplete. Not that it is a bad story, I, personally can't accompany what's happening, every new chapter I had to turn back and read the previous 3-5 chapters so I could remember. In that way, it could be unremarkable, or maybe I'm too daft to understand YakAge's nuances. I will read it in its entirety when it's complete though.

*** I think my issue is more that I completely forget what the story was about in between updates.
