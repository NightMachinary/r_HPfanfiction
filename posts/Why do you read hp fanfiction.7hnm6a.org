** 1) I moved so I have no friends. And I'm too introverted to go out and make them. I burnt out on gaming around the time I listened to the HP audiobooks. HP fanfiction came to take up some time. Ended up taking up a shit ton of time.

2) Escapism

3) I like Harry Potter. A lot.

4) It's very easy to pick up a fic. I feel like I have to put in more effort to pick up a new book. HP is already familiar.

*** Agree on escapism:( Have to wonder what kind of person I would have grown up to be if I hadn't spent all my youth and adulthood obsessively reading fanfiction/fantasy/sci-fi. It led to me expecting the impossible from life.

** At this point it's just the familiarity of the characters, and the size of hp fanfic. It's a lot larger than the other communities so you get more varied stories, better writing, and more interesting plots. Also I get the feeling that a lot of the people who write hpfanfic are older, compared to some of the other communities where it feels like a bunch of 15 year olds are writing.

** multiple reasons:

everyone needs a hobby, fanfiction is cheaper than buying books. i dont even like the harry potter series that much, but i think its the biggest fanfiction community. I like to think about how big the consequences can be if just a tiny little detail changed.

** I read it to relax but get carried away and probably read too much. I also have fairly low fic standards and can quite happily read lessers works than some people.

** For me, it's a way to see my preferred pairing that didn't happen in canon (Harry/Luna). The chance to see non-canon pairings, I think (including slash pairings) is a lot of people's gateway into fanfiction. Then you realize that there are many more different directions that fanfics can go in, and you're really only limited by your imagination, and there's actually a lot of writers out there with really clever ideas.

** I love reading but often I not motivated enough to pick a book, HP fan fictions at least make me read, and since English isn't my first language it helps me better my english (well, not anymore really, since I've been at it for a while, but at first it was a very interesting bonus to interesting stories). I love non-canon pairings (AU and EWE only for me), some of them are rather unusual pairings and the authors are few but very good, and I'm always happy to find a new story to read. It passes the time better than some other hobbies. Also, escapism. It fuels my imagination (as if it needed to be fueled, really).

** Because despite all the work piled up that I should be doing, I still waste my time, and what better way to do that than reading shitty OP!Harry fics?

** Sunk costs. And fem!Harry.

Just those two, really.

For real, Fem!Harry and MoD!Harry are all I read these days. Everything else bores me.
