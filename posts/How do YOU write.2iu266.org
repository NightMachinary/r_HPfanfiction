Do you start your story at the beginning and go from there, chronological-style? Are you more of a jump around from idea to idea, and then go about linking the finished bits together? A bit of both? Do you actually sit down and draft out your story before you even begin? What do you think the pros/cons of each style are?

For myself, I go from beginning to end. I don't skip around. No drafting either, but I have a vague idea in my mind of where I want the story to go, or the scenes I'm mostly looking forward to writing, but I sort of just... let the characters lead me there. I feel this helps me keep them true to who they are, and in fact I do get numerous comments on how "real" my characters feel to canon. On the negative side though, I run into writer's block A LOT. Because I can't just skip to the next interesting scene, I have to sit there and figure it out/work through whatever the issue is before I can continue.

So those are my thoughts. Tell me about your own process!


** With great difficulty.

Silliness aside, most of my stuff comes from a random scene popping into my head (for example, what if Hermione accidentally stumbles onto pseudo-Moody's identity whilst in his presence and is caught up in a panicky duel - later Dumbledore sadly announces to the school the tragic accidental death of one Hermione Granger).

From there, I'd backtrack to find the one change that could be made to realistically lead me to that point. Maybe she overhears something she ought not to. Maybe she picks up a bit of Moody trivia that doesn't gel with Crouch, and gets suspicious. Perhaps spending so much time with Harry has caused her to feel things that make her feel conflicted, and is a bit distracted when sitting next to him in Defense; having realized she left her bag behind after class, she leaves her friends and hurries back to retrieve it and arrives right as Moody is taking a swig from his flask, and smells something she remembers from her second year... you get the point.

Then it's just a manner of connecting the dots to get from the divergence point to the scene, and then afterwards just let the characters be the characters and see where it takes you.

...yeah

** Extensive planning.

First: Come up with the story concept. E.g. "Harry Potter x Buffy fusion fic".

Second: Come up with the core elements of the fic:

- POV: Harry Potter, third person.
- Buffy universe dominant, but HP characters exist there
- Tom Riddle was a warlock who tried to take over the Watcher's Council, killing Harry's parents
- The Watcher's Council has a school (codename Hogwarts) for the kids of Watchers, and Harry went there. Magic isn't part of the curriculum, but many students dabble in it
- Fic set in 1999, when Buffy is at college (season 4) and Harry is in his second year at Cambridge university
- Harry is a warlock, tutored personally by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore
- A piece of Tom Riddle survived in Harry's scar and talks to him
- Fic to focus on Harry coming to Sunnydale to assist with a problem
- Big bad is a Grindelwald resurrected by a necromancer

Third: Come up with an ending:

- Grindelwald tries to use a ritual to ascend to godhood and is stopped by Harry and Buffy. Harry has to open himself up to his scar and its damaging influence to win, using Tom Riddle's extensive magical knowledge against Grindelwald.

Fourth: Break the plot into arcs, dividing up how to reach the ending from the opening:

- Arc 1: England. Introduction to Harry and the world, set in England. Introduce the idea of necromancers searching for Grindelwald's body. Ends with Harry (with a team of Watchers) being sent to Sunnydale, where Grindelwald's body was sent to be under the protection of the Slayer... the Slayer who no longer works for the Council.

- Arc 2: Sunnydale. Arrival in Sunnydale (on day of earthquake) and attempt to find Grindelwald's body. Ends with Grindelwald's resurrection.

- Arc 3: The Hunt. Buffy and co trying to stop Grindelwald's plan to ascend. Race to find the resurrection stone. Faith's escape. Ends with Grindelwald getting the stone.

- Arc 4: Climax. The last ditch fight to stop the ritual.

Fourth: Break down each arc into separate chapters. E.g. for Arc 1:

- Ch1: Introduction to Harry via a Norse ritual he's leading at Cambridge university. Establish the magic system, and the Watcher's Council. Sirius (Watcher) arrives and tells Harry he's needed in London.

- Interlude 1: Interludes look at Harry's past. Dumbledore takes Harry on as an apprentice following Harry successfully casting his first spell, which attracted Dumbledore's attention for both its power and danger. (Tom Riddle's voice had been guiding Harry, but this is not mentioned).

- Ch2: Harry and Sirius look around the burgled Potter home in London. They conclude the thief was looking for something in particular. Invisibility Cloak is gone. A hair left behind - enough to track them.

- Interlude 2: Harry gets into a row with a fellow student, itches to use magic to strike.

- Ch3: Tracking spell... leads to a Watcher's Council building. Loads of protection, but someone has attacked recently. Bodies everywhere. The thief is still there! Brief fight, red haired woman, but they get away - Harry shielding from bullets mostly.

- Interlude 3: Harry does something bad with magic. Hint at possession: glazed look, confusion at his surroundings when “waking” etc.

- Ch4: At the Watcher's Council HQ, briefing on Grindelwald. They want Harry to go to Sunnydale with Sirius' team to brief the Slayer and protect Grindelwald's body. He has the day to decide. He visits Hermione in Oxford, who tells him to go. Tom Riddle's voice surfaces.

- Interlude 4: Harry going to Dumbledore about Riddle's voice.

So as you can see, I kind of expand outwards, building from a concept and slowly fleshing the details out in rounds.

** I can be all over the place, but I always start structured. I'll use a fic (someone recommended it) I'm writing as an example.

Someone requested that I write a Draco! Veela/Hermione romance. So the firdt thing I do was decide what I want the Veela to be. How did he become a Veela? Is it plausible? What powers does it give him? How would people react? I did research, combining fantasy Veela with JKR's Veela.

Once done, I do character outlines. What year? How old? What are they doing in their lives? Mine is post-Hogwarts; so I have Hermione and Draco working at the Ministry. Luna is an Unspeakable, Ron plays Quidditch, etc. Who is married to who? They requested Ginny be with Blaise, so I tackle them and then who Harry make might be with post-Ginny.

And then I set up scenes. How do I want their relationships to be? That is established in the Prologue. What time of year is it? What's happening? What's the whole story? I then write down "Scenes", meaning point-form list of scenes I want to include. These are, generally, in no order. But I try to organize them.

Often, all of this is either typed in an "Outline" and printed or written in a notebook, so I can easily reference it.

I do often get inspired at work or school, so I write down those ideas and keep them with me until I can use them.

I'm kind of an organized mess. I start off right, then go all over the place when inspired. But, I always make sure that the story is structured and well organized; including physical time (I read a fic one that jumped from Fall to June to September and it made no sense).

It's funny, I kind of write fics the same way I write essays...haha.

Also, I always need popcorn with me and good music. Can't do it without either.

** A lot like your process, except my writer's block/lack of motivation is probably way worse. I started over a year ago and haven't finished the first chapter.

** It's been awhile since I've written fanfiction, but this is my approach to fiction and fanfiction writing:

- I sketch out my stories in a rough outline form first, writing down a few sentences to a few paragraphs to describe the highlights of each scene.
- Once I have the skeleton in place, I go back and write the most interesting scenes first, the vivid ones that drew me to the story in the first place. This is possible since I have placeholders for the other scenes.
- After that, I go back and fill in the rest of the scenes, always with the sense of what I need to accomplish in each (plot points, character development, foreshadowing, establish mood, etc.). Also, even for these less enchanting scenes, I try to find a way to make every scene interesting in some way. Otherwise, the scene doesn't belong.
- If the most interesting scenes /don't/ come out as well as I'd envisioned (which sometimes happens--you don't really know until you've put down the words), I drop the story before I've invested a huge amount of time on a subpar thing. If they do come out well, this gives me impetus to finish the rest of the story quickly to get it out there to be read.
- With one sub-par exception (my story /A Mother-In-Law's Love/), I've always written my stories to completion before posting. This ensures a sufficient level of consistency and polish in the final text. I tend to use beta readers and in the writing process will pick the brains of better writers--folks like the Alpha Fight Club crew and DLP (the Work by Authors threads), who often catch typos and consistency errors.

** I come up with the main events I want to happen. I write all my ideas in a notebook and pay special attention to each individual character. I have separate notebooks for each main character listing personality traits, likes, dislikes, habits, back stories, etc. I then create a time line for the events I want to happen in the book, followed by an outline for each chapter. The I start writing. :) It sounds harder than it is. I feel like most of it just plays out in my head, so the only hard part is just putting the words together to portray what I want. Then I have my beta look over each chapter before I upload it. I really don't have a problem with writers block, like I said it all kind of just plays in my head like a movie, but the outline helps ensure I stay on track and don't forget significant events. Or small ones that are meaningful later.

** Depends on what type of story I'm going for, If I want an epic-length, hugely intertwined story from multiple perspectives then I'm going to be thinking /all the time/ about what I could add in a certain place, whilst thinking of other plots that can link them together - with such huge stories you don't really get a choice or easy framework unless you stick closely to canon.

I don't stick to canon... like ever.

How it all could start for me in my head might be an errant thought about /how else/ the canon story might be manipulated - well within the realms of reason, yet still mess things up enough to recreate the world.

The good point is it's your world to mess up in or spend countless hours perfecting its every nuance. The bad thing is that it's /your world now-/, you've changed enough that entire canon plot-lines are /ashes/ and relationships won't come to fruition unless you really put pen to paper or have a genius flash of inspiration that will barrel along your plot quite nicely.

This is how it is for me.

*How I thought of my fanfic before I started note-taking and plotting.*

#+begin_quote
  /What if the reason seven souls are important is that the other soul pieces become more alive, and desperately want to become whole./
#+end_quote

This led me to think of ways I could get Harry to realize this - before I decided to scrap that later on due to the inconvenience it is to have /Voldemort/ as an enemy.

Thus through plotting and semi-serious thought processes I wangled my story down into a BWL!Neville story, with Harry in Hufflepuff and a competent Quirrell to kick-start Harry's training in stupidly simple but utterly practicable aspects of magic.

This doesn't mean I'm making my Quirrell lean backwards twice-over to teach Harry how to control fiendfyre (shudders at fanfic memories). Also while Quirrell is doing his usual unicorn killing he's also reaching out to Snape and Malfoy Sr (Voldemort didn't kill Lily, after all... why should Snape hate him... turn his back on the dark?).

I generally keep a pen and paper around with me to ink down stray thoughts that are so inconsequentially important to developing in a realistic way but I might forget in as soon as five minutes later - things likr

I must let it be known that I really, /really/ like noting down unusual thoughts and recommend straying into strange territory in order to bolster creativity and linking ideas into integral plot points -

#+begin_quote
  /What if Draco Malfoy was the most powerful student in the school - his arrogance at least somewhat earned due to his abilities - scorning his father to say he is the one people should fear, perhaps?/
#+end_quote

Thus we enter a new Hogwarts were arrogant Draco shows off his power with an aura reminiscent of the Dark Lords, he commands the Slytherins, Dumbledore avoids confronting him due to Lucius' political clout, Harry is egged on and defeated, Draco killed by Flitwick after taking it too far and professing his powers as unbeatable, Flitwick goes on rampage, clearing out Death Eater children.

I'd /read/ that. From then on all you have to do is have a Harry who starts strong - don't give him to Ron (the slacker), instead pair him with Dean, who has admirable moral fibre, thus we get a smart and cautious Harry versus overpowered Draco and a militant Slytherin house. From there you go into sub plots; what happens to Lucius? to Dobby? to Hermione? to muggleborns in general? to Neville?

From there you go to the logical response from students - a petition to have Draco expelled, signed by 300 people - not even a meeting with headmaster? twist that story into an anti-Dumbledore, anti-establishment, anti-Slytherin fight to the last man.

--------------

In case you missed it - I gather stray thoughts, compile them into points in my story (e.g. /Book 1= xxx Book 2= xyxxwx/). I move on from there to logical plotting (friends/family/affected individuals-for target or victim perspective), I will have then decided how /vast/ I want my world to be, do I want the ICW? no. Do I want Necromancers? No. Do I want Necromancy? Maybe. Do I want Sirius? No, he was unlawfully sucked of his soul.

Then I decide how far back to go - Godrics Hollow? When Lily and Sirius first meet eyes and later on Harry Black is magically turned into Harry Potter? First Year? The train, platform - Does he even /go/ to Hogwarts?

I'm waffling - which is funnily enough a good idea of just what my plotting looks like - forty-off pages of scenes I've decided on, OCs I'm introducing, my own theory of magic and how to teach it.

Hope this gave inspo to someone out there - it'll be months before my first book in my series is even close to being finished (And that covers 6 months of the school year and the rest is rehab).

/Sheesh./

** It depends on my inspiration for a story (I'm usually a one shot writer of hp). I usually hand write key paragraphs or sentences that I want to emphasize in the story. Then I grab the computer and free write. I'll go back and tweak if something pops into my head along the way. Once it's done, I proof read, let it sit for a few days to a week, and proof read it again. Then up it goes to the internet 😊

** Usually my writing preparation is a mixture of rigid formality and absolute chaos. In concern to characters I will usually spend weeks writing up important AND non-important characters relevant to my story whether they be OCs or canon. I like to know everything about my characters that is feasible, so I usually end up with a gargantuan file filled with profiles of characters big and small, vital and largely insignificant.

The story itself is far less organized, with bits and pieces of plot devices set while others are intentionally left vague so as to allow me to alter them how I see fit when I get around to writing that section (as I am want to do).

I find myself writing small scenes and the rare chapter whenever inspiration strikes. For the several projects I am currently sitting on I have a folder filled to the brim for each which holds all the small pieces of writing I have done for them whether they be good or bad.

I guess when it comes to Harry Potter I do like to have as much relevance to canon events as possible. I loath re-writing sections of the book unless its absolutely necessary, so I like to write more about things that could have/should have/did happen but weren't in the actual books.

Overall the writing process is wild but honestly I love it. Its fun and considering the way my imagination works I'm always keen to see how my ideas develop.

** Once an idea pops into my head, I make a document, which will then hold everything. First I write the basic summary, which is subject to change, and then whatever scenes come to my mind first, with snippets of dialogue and so on. Once I'm ready to begin writing the story, it just gets written at the bottom of the document, with all the scattered ideas at the top so I can easily look at them.

I haven't finished many stories, though, so this way is probably not the best. It's certainly not very organized. I'd like to try some of the ideas on this thread!
