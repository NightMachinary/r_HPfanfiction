** In POA Flitwick says that Voldemort could have pressed his nose (lol) to the Potters' window but not perceive them. That implies that the protected property is not taken out of space per the depiction in the films, rather it is taken out of knowledge and perception. You can still physically interact with the property, it's just that you don't know that you're doing so.

So unless there are also other protections in place which physically protect the property then yes I think a bomb (or indeed any peril) would damage the house.

This fits nicely with the general scheme of HP magic that everything has a flaw, and the fact that the characters do not consider the Fidelius to be a perfect protection.

***** Yep!

Partially Kissed Hero is a terrible fic, but the whole "All forms of magic have some sort of inherent weakness" was a fairly good description.

** Yeah, I think so. But because you can't mentally connect the people to that place, there'd be no reason to set a bomb there, unless you were just bombing absolutely everywhere. Even if you were doing that, I feel like that one place might somehow slip your mind to bomb, because you'd be absolutely certain there's no way they were there. And no one could check behind you and rectify that error, because they would all have the same problem if they weren't in on the secret.

Like the death eaters watching Grimmauld Place. I don't think they knew the hiding spot was actually there, I think they all felt like the trio just happened to be passing through there a lot, perhaps on their way to somewhere else. They knew they kept showing up around that area, but couldn't connect that to them staying or still being there once they couldn't see them. That's the reason they didn't just fiendfire the whole street.

If you mean would it destroy the charm, I think only if the people being protected were killed by the bomb, or maybe if the structure was completely destroyed. Like if Grimmauld Place was flattened but Harry, Hermione, and Ron protected themselves with shields or whatever and were fine, but standing out in the open where the house used to be? I guess it depends on if the "Grimmauld Place" in the charm counts as the house, or counts as the /address/. Like, even before you build a house there the lot might be counted as "12 Grimmauld Place" and in that case the charm would still work. But if the house counts and not the lot, and the house is completely destroyed, then it would be the same as if all the order members died. The charm would no longer have one element of the secret to protect, so it would be broken. But if part of the house survived and they were in the house I think they would still be protected even though the house was damaged.

I believe they were hanging around there due to the Taboo being triggered, they were using Voldemort's name and that got the Death Eaters to their location, but since they were under a Fidelius they couldn't actually be found. So the Death Eaters just knew that somewhere in that area there were people using Voldemort's name and were hanging around to try and find them.

** Sure it would. The Fidelius stops people from perceiving that something is there, it doesn't stop people or things from interacting with it.

The Fidelius of the Potters protected the secret that the Potters lived in the home in Godric's Hollow. It didn't stop people from seeing the home, it just made it impossible to find out that the Potters lived there.

The Fidelius on Grimmauld was probably a bit more complicated, as Grimmauld wasn't visible to Harry before he read the secret, and it was safe even though some Death Eaters like Narcissa or Bellatrix certainly knew about the existence of the place. I think it might actually be two Fideliused secrets, one about the existence of the house and another about the Order being there. Only people who already knew about the place could perceive it's existence, and only people who were told by the secret keeper could realize that the Order was there. So even though Bellatrix would know about the existence of the place and would be able to perceive it, she wouldn't be able to find out that the Order was there and she wouldn't be able to tell other Death Eaters about the existence of the place. Dumbledore's note revealed both secrets to Harry.

Since a bomb doesn't perceive anything, the Fidelius would be useless. So a good way to get someone hiding under a Fidelius would be to nuke the general area.

Although it was mentioned that Grimmauld had tons of additional ancient protections, and since it's in London and was owned by the Blacks for generations, it's quite likely that whichever Black owned it during the Blitz in WW2 added an enchantment to protect against bombs. Since a basic Protego stops physical blows, it's probably quite easy to protect against shockwaves and other nonmagical threats. So the Blacks would have been perfectly safe during bomb raids while Tom feared for his life in the basement of the orphanage and cursed the Ministry that didn't allow him to protect himself with magic or stay at Hogwarts.

Buildings in magical communities or in the middle of nowhere hidden from muggles probably weren't threatened by bomb raids in WW2 and wouldn't have any enchantments against bombs.

** Lore wise, I don't think it's fully established - both for the Fidelius charm, and for the way the Wizarding World handles bombs. Eg, we don't know how the Blitz affected Diagon Alley - were there charms/enchantments that deflected the bombs over it? Did they just Reparo? Etc.

I think Taure is right from what we can /glean/ from the lore, but it's clearly vague. I also happen to think it's the more interesting approach, so... I'd go with that. But it's vague enough that you could probably justify either approach if you prefer.

** In my opinion things like fire, explosions and so on should be able to bypass the fidelius. There could be other wards preventing such things.

** I've always had the impression that the Fidelius only hides knowledge. Thus, a theoretical work-around for it if you know you're dealing with Fidelius is brute force in a large area -- figure out where they are by figuring out everywhere where they /aren't/, and then send brute force through it (stuff like Fiendfyre, Reducto, whatever).

** I've seen the fidelius explained two ways:

1. (More common) the fidelius hides knowledge, specifically blocking the sentient mind's ability to comprehend and retain information about a specific location. This works with the idea that animals such as insects or owls can go in and out the hidden area, as they don't have the type sentient comprehension the charm blocks and are therefore immune. This is the more likely version of the charm, and is significantly simpler having a wide variety of drawbacks to go along with it. The way the fidelius was used in the books, it did not so much as conceal the actual place, as it did the potters place of residence. This is an important distinction, as the by focusing the charm on Godrics hollow as the place the potters live, rather than specifically the building they were hiding in, certain cracks in their defenses were opened and others closed. For instance, if one were to think about the building in isolation, they would likely have no trouble comprehending it, it's layout, the structure, even the paint on the walls. However, as soon as one begins to think of it in terms of its location, or in its larger capacity as Lily and James' home, it would become impossible to so much remember if the house had one floor or two. The main critical advantage to focusing the charm on the residents of the location rather than the location itself is in protecting from indirect attack. One does not need to know where the potters are hiding to send them letter, similarly, one does not need to know where they are hiding to create a curse that seeks them out. The fidelius would protect against these indirect attacks by preventing the mind of those creating the curse from comprehending even the idea that they exist in a place at all, causing the curse to fail when trying to find a non-existent location. This is also why the fidelius goes down when Lily and James die, the charm was tied to their home, and when they died it became little more than a damaged building having no relation whatsoever to the potter's residence seeing as they no longer lived there. This version of the charm is very powerful, very subtle, and relies heavily on the propensity of the human mind to make connections and draw correlations between pieces of information.

2. (Less common) the fidelius functions via a similar principle to a space expansion charm, manipulating space into effectively creating a pocket dimension which the concealed object resides in. In this version the secret acts as a key similar to the dark mark ward in book 6, where to those without the key (in this case the dark mark) would be completely stopped by the barrier, but for those with the key the barrier might as well not exist. With this version of the charm the secret acts as the key, using a form of soul magic to first bind the secret to a secret keeper to create the key to the ward, and then opening the ward on a case by case basis determined by either the soul of the individual in question has come into contact with the secret, which carries with it an echo of the secret keepers soul effectively acting like a passcode to the spell. There is only one accepted code, that code being the secret keepers soul, but when the secret keeper shares the secret it brings a reflection of that soul along with it effectively giving the person with whom the secret was shared a copy of the key and allowing them access to the pocket dimension. Oddly enough, this version of the charm is probably easier to make, as while its effect is much more complicated from a mechanical perspective, it does not have to deal with the extremely nebelous nature of the human mind in order to go about determining who is allowed in and out of the concealed location, whereas the other version relies entirely on regulating the information of the location rather than defending and hiding the actual location in any physical way.

<HP>

As far as the idea of an undetected attack penetrating the fidelius goes, it depends largely on which version the charm you're using. If you're thinking of the charm in the first way, where it only conceals information, then it is absolutely possible to destroy the concealed area through non-targeted means. If Voldemort dropped a Nuke on Godrics Hollow using this interpretation of the charm, the Potter house would be levelled along with the rest of the town. If you are using the second interpretation, then the very same Nuke would do nothing to potter home as it is effectively in a seperate plane of reality. That said, if one were to create a non-targeted weapon specifically designed to destroy pocket dimensions and spacial manipulations, it would have the same effect as the Nuke in the the first scenario.

** I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. The Fidelius makes it impossible for anyone to know a secret unless they're told by the Secret-Keeper. If there was a war, and some bomber planes flew over a town where one house was under the Fidelius, it's quite conceivable that one of the bombs might kill the people in the Fideliused location. Nobody would know they had been killed, and nobody would be able to find the bodies, and the pilot dropping the bomb would be completely unaware that said bomb had hit a secret location.... but the people would still be dead.

That said, bombs would not be a very effective weapon when it comes to destroy a Fideliused location. You'd never know if you'd actually got lucky or not, and you wouldn't be able to aim for it... Statistically, you're a LOT more likely to kill hundreds of people NOT under the Fidelius.
