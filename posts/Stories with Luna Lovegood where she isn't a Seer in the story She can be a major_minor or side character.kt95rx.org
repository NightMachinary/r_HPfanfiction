Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather have NO Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc.


** One of my favourite Luna fics is Crazy Little Things by Dreiser. It's a fun post-Books story about Luna and Hermione falling in love, and it actually made the relationship seem like it could work with something close to their canon personalities (it has been a few years, so they're not exactly like they were as teenagers, but they're recognisably similar). It's setting/plot canon compliant too - the fic starts with canon pairings and the breakup with Ron was the best and most reasonable I've ever seen in any fic ever.

  When Luna makes a terrible mistake and ends up in a time she never imagined she'd been in, what will happen before she gets back? And what will she do when she realizes that Tom Riddle is in her year? Rated M for language, violence, sexual content. *This story is in the process of an edit for more canon compliance & (hopefully) better writing. 12/32 chapters edited.* Sequel now up.
