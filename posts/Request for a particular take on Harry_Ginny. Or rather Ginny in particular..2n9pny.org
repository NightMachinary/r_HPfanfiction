I am not a fan of the pairing and haven't read any stories with it. However in my reading of harem fics I stumbled across an interesting interpretation of Ginny - except in that fic she was just a minor harem add-on and author barely explored it.

I once read a fic (years ago, don't remember name) that started to have an interesting Ginny before author dumped it. The interesting part to me was the mental state described/explained. Her character was presented as:

She starts out as normal girl when she gets to Hogwarts, just an average kid. For her, HP at that point is a mix of real life celebrity with same name as fantasy hero personage that starred in all her children's book. So somewhat similar to meeting an actor who portrayed your favorite character.

Then she has her mind invaded by Voldie who takes over relatively quickly and usually has nothing to do but mind rape the only victim he has access to 24/7. Coping mechanism for a kid is to mentally hide in her fantasies that mostly revolve around the kid's stories of HP saving people, even as she knows that those are fantasy books that stand in painful contrast to how things really are where she is in a world of trouble and no one even knows it, yet alone coming to save her.

So by Chamber of Secrets confrontation she is pretty much an abused little girl whose only respite was her fantasies and who over the months abandoned almost all hope. Here comes the end, she at mercy of greatest evil guy in known history, he has a huge snake monster, her life is getting drained - end of the line.

Then her childhood hero steps in, kills the huge deadly snake monster with a fucking sword, rips out a fang and stabs the evil guy with it (indirectly) - key point here is that while her body was not responsive, her mind was aware due to ongoing link to Tom at the time. There is even a heroic demise at the end with recovery at last moment.

So her most desired fantasies get fulfilled for real, her broken mind barely copes - and it does so by really centering on Harry as the hero of her story. In the story it was described as a fragmented/barely coherent mind rebuilding itself over time in the aftermath around the core idea of Harry being the one for her, to the point of obsessive worship. So she is insane and obsessed with him, but with good reason.

Reading that intro for Ginny, made me realize that my usual turnoff of her being a fan-girl and thus too obvious a choice for Harry is not a turnoff if properly set up by the author. A very key part of what made the above premise interesting to me was that while she was insane and obsessive, she was still intelligent and remained highly functional.

Unfortunately the story where I read that first, didn't really go anywhere with it due to different focus - harem and star wars crossover.

REQUEST:

Looking for recommendations of long H/G stories where Ginny at least starts out same or at least similar as described above.


** That sounds vaguely familiar. I want to say it was in a fic that focused on Harry, Hermione and Luna... and maybe was one of the "harry dies and gets sent back" setups?

OOC: is it the specific [setup | mental state] that you're looking for or just an H/G pairing where Ginny doesn't get wrapped in a cocoon and placed in cold storage for 3-4 books?

If memory serves, the fic I was describing above was setting Ginny up for a Bella/Tom style relationship. With Ginny being the crazed, obsessed minion who will happily burn the world to cinders for Harry, while Harry is only vaguely aware of her existence. Like Mr. J and Harlequin... hmmm... there has /GOT/ to be a Dark H/G fic out there that uses that as its model.

*** pretty sure you are recalling the same story because it matches all the details I remember.

That was very disappointing - made the time to make a good base for character, than basically shelved her.

I am looking specifically for the mental state. Would be great if it didn't come with Dark Harry, but beggars can't be choosers, and you are probably correct about that being the best fandom to start looking.

As for "cold storage", would be fine if the story started years later. In that crossover fic, the mental aftermath for Ginny took years - and considering how likely sex is to come up when the premise is an obsessed teenage girl and a guy her age, than having a later start would be much better.

**** I felt like it was setting Ginny up for her to go out with a very loud and messy bang... but I can't recall the fic name.

I /think/ Harry tried to get her fixed by a mind healer, but it wasn't working? I remember an analogy that used a chocolate orange being glued back together?
