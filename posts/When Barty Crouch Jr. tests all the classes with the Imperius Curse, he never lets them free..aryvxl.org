The majority of the school is under Crouch's control, and Harry has to find out who he can really trust.


** On the one hand, I feel Dumbledore (or the Ministry, forgot which one gave permission for canon Crouch to imperius students) would figure it out quickly. On the other hand, I really want to read a fic with magical mindgames with liberal use of imperius, obliviations, compulsions, even love potions to make the MC get tangled in a horrifically complex web of plots where they never know who they can trust, because there's a thousand ways to magically break trust and a thousand more to magically ensure it... that would be really cool.

*** I totally get why people find this sort of thing interesting, but does anybody else find this sort of plot horrifying? Like, I'm fine with (avoid, but willing to slog through) some pretty disgusting torture and gore, but the moment a story starts to involve extensive memory modification or mind control I quit out. Something about it just makes me feel really uncomfortable. Brainwashing and heavy emotional abuse make me react similarly.

**** Mind control/mind rape/memory modification/etc of a character I care about is one of the few things that'll make me drop any fic, no matter the quality. Which is a shame, because that's turned me off of some otherwise really good ones... (For example linkao3(worth the candle) - not HP but recommended pretty heavily in communities I frequent.) It's just... Enormously squicky to me.

On the other hand, I tend to be perfectly fine with the main character doing that sort of thing to other people, like linkfp(mother of learning). Consistency, I do not have it.

  From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that momentarily grabbed his interest. Over the course of eight years, he shared these worlds with his friends through twice-weekly sessions of tabletop gaming. Now at the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgam of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.Update schedule is, as always, whenever I feel like it. Most discussion for this work takes place on [[/r/rational]] whenever a new chapter is posted.

***** That's because it brings up uncomfortable questions about control. I am a bit same. I tend to write my MCs suffering the affects of, or at least fears mind arts but when it comes to reading (where I have no control over the characters' actions), I get queasy.

**** That's why it's so intriguing, partially because of how existentially horrifying it is to know that a powerful enough wizard can warp your perceptions of the world any way he sees fit. How do you counteract this? Occlumency? Pensieve memory dead-drops to protect important memories from obliviation? Screening for mind-altering magic? There's so much story potential there.

**** I always found stories about mind control, brainwashing and memory modifications deeply fascinating... though I also agree that is IS horrifying. Looking at it from a purely ethical point of view it's pretty bad... and of course, if the "good guys" do it without either narrative nor characters ever suggesting there's something wrong about it, that does tend to leave a bad taste in my mouth.

It's why I didn't like the ending of the first Fantastic Beasts movie, for instance. The authority figures just go "we need to mind-wipe an entire city, including that one guy who's been of immense help, proved he's trustworthy, and probably would keep a secret -- anyone who isn't US need to have their minds TOTALLY WIPED," and the heroes just nod and go "yes, that's the right ting to do." And the film treats this as the moral solution.

I would have been more on board with it, if the film had included even SOME instances of the more sympathetic characters wondering "are we really doing the right thing here?"

So... I like stories of mind-control and memory modifications, but I DON'T like stories that treat them as the unquestioned morally responsible thing to do.

***** I got the impression in that movie that the main characters were more "I don't like it but the government people out number us 20 to 1" they tried quite hard to pretend that the helpful muggle wasn't there and hoped the government people forgot him.

** I always imagined that there is a limit to how many people one person can keep under imperius at the same time (and the stronger willed those people are the less you can control at once.)

Without that limitation the curse would be so ridiculously overpowered there is no way the death eaters could have possibly ever lost their war.

Still, this is a really cool premise nonetheless.

**** The students were instructed to fight the spell, so even if they agreed to have the curse cast at them it still wouldn't count as willfully submitting to it.

I believe if one were to write such a fic the best course of action would probably be to just ignore the fact that there's probably a limit entirely. After all even though such a limit is very probable it isn't what I would consider fixed canon.

It would probably work better in a game, but I imagine something like that happens and Harry starts seeing a red aura around everyone who is being controlled (Luna gets him to where her spectrespecs?) and it turnings into a big running battle.
