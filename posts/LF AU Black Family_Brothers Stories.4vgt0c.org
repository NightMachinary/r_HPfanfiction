There are a lot of fics, where Harry or Sirius become the next Lord Black and destroy the dark side with their super powers, but I rarely find a good story, in which the Blacks are described in greater details. As said in canon, they were one of the most powerful and old family in Britain, so it doesn't make sense, that they all were crazy maniacs (pureblood ideology doesn't equal craziness). From what I know, none of Sirius/Regulus parents or grandparents were Death Eaters. Pureblood bigots yes, but they didn't bow down to a halfblood madman. I'm looking for fics with reasonable family interaction and politics, especially during the marauders era, since the family was dead during Harry's time. Interesting plots would be: - Arcturus or Orion Black as Head of the House and his actions during the first war - Sirius' interactions with his parents / his brother Regulus - political power of the Blacks in the ministry / Wizengamot

Personally I'm currently very curious about Sirius-Regulus interactions, as I like stories, that describe characters with rather minor roles in canon, e.g. the Bones. I realized, that, if they actually had a proper sibling relationship, Regulus wouldn't have decided to go for the Horcrux alone and Voldemort could have been mortal way earlier. Unfortunately there are really few good Marauder era fanfictions, and most of them focus on Lily and James. There are a few Sirius centered fanfictions, but they usually ignore his family completely, or are about raising/guiding Harry. Preferrably not slash and not Hermione goes back in time and falls in love (ugh, don't even know, why there are actually quite a few of those)... Gen or mild romance is fine.

These all have Harry or a Harry equivalent interacting with the Black family in depth. These may not be what you're looking for, but hey.

*** Seconding /Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is/. It is pretty short, well-written and has a good storyline.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
