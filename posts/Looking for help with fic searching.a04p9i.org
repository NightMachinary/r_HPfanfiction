Hi, please be gentle with me! I'm new to looking for fics. I've binge read HP for the umpteenth time and when I said to a friend it has left me wanting more from the 1970s Hogwarts characters she said I should read fanfic.

I am not having a lot of luck. I have found a lot of fics with Harry and Hermione and them paired with the adults but I am not looking for Harry's era or epilogue stories or Snape getting with Her.

I am interested in what could have happened in the 1970s timeline if something changed. Is there stories where Snape and Lily stayed friends or became involved?

What's best to search for? "Snape and Lily" or does their friendship or relationship have another name or search term that writers use? Thank you for any help and thank you for reading. I'd love to hear any recommendations too if anyone else is a fan.


** If you're using AO3, I would start by searching for fics tagged "Lily Evans Potter/Severus Snape" (for them in a romanic relationship) or "Lily Evans Potter & Severus Snape" (for them as friends). AO3 has a really good tagging and sorting system, so you can sort by kudos and include/exclude additional tags to narrow down the results.

If you're looking for specific fic recs, the only one I have to give is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306][Puzzle]] linkao3(11622306), though be warned - it's pretty dark.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.
