It was recced on this site so I thought I'd give it a try.

The writing was pretty bad. Not in the spelling/ grammatical sense, but in the way of the author “telling not showing.” There was a lot of telling what the character's relationships with each other were from the idea of “Dumbledore musing about them.” The idea of the army and gathering of help was pretty interesting and kept me reading. But when the freaking Japanese showed up and Harry starting learning “Chakra” I could not continue. I don't know why that's in the fic, it's also pretty close to the end and I don't see it as anything but a power wank. I've seen too many fics ruined by trying to insert a new! exciting! not British! power. So, for people who've read it, does it get better? Is the new “power” used at all in the last five chapters? Does it just keep going downhill?
