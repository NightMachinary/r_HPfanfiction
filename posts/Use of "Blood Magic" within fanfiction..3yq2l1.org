How do you see the use of Blood Magic and which stories do you feel make a good use of this element? Also what do you think of the /Blood Adoption/ in some fics.


** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] does blood magic fairly well. From what I remember it revolves around permanent self-enhancement via cutting runes into yourself.

*** linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat) does the same.

Also linkffn(Blood Runes by Darth Bubbles)

** Personally, I'm not a fan of "blood magic" being all-powerful. For example, the Bond of Blood Charm that Dumbledore casts after Lily's sacrifice is something I would consider being the upper limit. Despite its power, it needs a host of some sort, needs to be refreshed every now and again, etc. I prefer blood magic that works more like a lock and key as opposed to a super-serum, in short.

** linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) has a good approach to blood magic. As in it's quite powerful but requires a sacrifice proportional to the power of the effect desired. The sacrifice has to be meaningful to the caster too, so no killing strangers by the thousand to build a mega ritual.

That would be my main recommendation (found on this sub a couple weeks ago).

*** It definitely started neat, but lately I feel like the sacrifice is always just pain.... which is boring and lame.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I can't think off hand of what stories I think have used them well, but it's only been a minority of those stories I've read that used them period (which isn't that many).

I feel like good use is to use it as a 'primitive' magic. Where it's about the user's intent, and very ritualistic. Where words may not be needed (especially not some fancy three sentence ritualistic chant). Where it may not /work/ the way the user thinks it might, because it simply isn't used anymore. For example healing, or 'blessing' the birth of a child (where that blessing may just boost the immune system, but they think it's bringing on good health or something).

It can be a creative way to curse a bloodline, though. Not like where having a few drops of someone's blood means you can curse them from afar, but like they're doing genetic manipulation without realizing that's what they're doing, so by cursing the 'blood' itself, it gets passed on.

i'm iffy on the whole 'blood adoption' thing. I think because I only ever encounter it in a way where the person being adopted automagically has their complexion and height and hair change. Which, yeah no.

*** I've seen it used before as some kind of blood ritual to make someone magically recognized as a part of an others family. A lot of times its described as the two cutting there hands and mixing their blood together with some kind of incantation. I've also seen a story once where one person had to fill a goblet with blood, then an incantation was spoken over it, and then the person being adopted drank from it. I've also read a fic before where Sirius was blood adopted by the Potters when he ran away from home as a teenager.

*** The exact method of doing it varies, but basically a way to adopt a child in a way that makes them at the very least look as if you were their biological parent, either by overwriting one of the already existing slots (be it mother or father) or by adding to it Gilgamesh-style (2/3rd god, heh) so that you have more than two biological parents in the end. Though usually it ends up with more than just looking as the person performing the adoption.

Depending on the story it may or may not actually have even been intended for adopting children; I remember reading at least one story where thought it was used for adopting a child the ritual itself was for creating bonds of brotherhood of blood or something like that.
