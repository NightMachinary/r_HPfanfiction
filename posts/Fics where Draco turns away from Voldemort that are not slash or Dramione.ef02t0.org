Most fics with this plotline are Drarry or Dramione, any with other (non slash) pairings?!


** I always feel awkward recommending 1.5m word fics for something that takes up less than ten % of the total, but linkffn(innocent by marauderlover) (and it's sequels - we're in GoF territory now) has an amazing Good!Draco. It's far and away my favorite part of the fic. Draco has an Irish twin brother Hydrus, and Lucius has the idea to get one son in Slytherin and one son in Gryffindor . . .

*** I kinda like this fic better if you swap the names Hydrus and Draco. Like Hydrus literally says and does the things Draco does in canon.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

** I remember the start of one fic where Draco time travels to the day before he meets Harry at Madame Malkins before 1st year (of a bit before that).

It uses the 'V had him made a werewolf' theory and has the curse travel back with him, including the scar/dittany mark.

So, that and his memories of V from the original timeline, lead him and I think his parents to turn from V.

I don't know if the author ever got past the beginning....

  With a sly smile he eyed the time turner. It gleamed like gold, just the way the Malfoys liked it. With this, he could save his son. He went for the door but came to a sudden halt when realization hit him: With the time turner, he could save more than just one person. (Draco-centric time travel fanfiction, 3rd year)

** MoR has a nonromantic friendship between Draco and Harry and Draco gets turned from being a completely insane asshole to a somewhat decent person. I think there's more stories with a plot like that but I can't think of any right now.

** link!ffn(Innocent). A good fic with multiple sequels already written. It explores a Draco that has a brother, so one Malfoy ends up in Slytherin, one in Griffyndoor.
