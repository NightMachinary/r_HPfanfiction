I'm especially wondering how much fanfiction writes have read.I got curious how much fanfiction I've actually read versus the Harry Potter books, after someone made me realize that 500k words is about 1000 pages.\\
The Harry Potter books have around 1 million words in total. And I've read HP fanfiction for almost 4 years now, spending about 4-5 hours a day just reading. Doing some rough estimating, I've come to realize that I've probably read 150 million words at the very least. That's at least 150 times the original content. It's no wonder then, that people confuse fanon and canon so much. If I have read over 150 times the source material, I imagine that someone who is passionate enough to write fanfiction has read a lot more.


** All of it.

Its a sick, twisted, addiction of which there is no escape.

I've been reading for over 10 years, and when people irl find out I'm still reading it they ask 'after all this time?'

**** My absolute favourite fan fic is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/]['Perfect Slytherins']] by Jeconais.

Harry Potter raised by the Adams family and....not quite normal anymore.

Brilliant.

There are hundreds of great fan fics out there though, depending on what you like. linkffn(9860311) A long Journey Home is one of my favourites.

Sunrise and Sunset over Britain are both really long stories written by Bobmin, will take you a while to read as they're basically novel length.

If you're looking for something a bit different linkffn(2889350) Bungle in the Jungle is pretty good. People either love or hate this, but I enjoyed it.

BTW - if any of those links don't work, just google the titles with 'harry potter fan fiction' at the end, and you'll find them. I'm rubbish at using the bot correctly.

** I think a reasonable estimate would be about 100 million words for me. Over a 10+ year period that's only a couple chapters per day. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was much higher than that since the early days was nothing but churning through a 250k story every day.

** Too much. Way too much. I usually get through about 150k a day, and i've been reading for 7+ years. Let's be conservative, and say I spent only 4 years reading HP fannfiction(even though it's my main fanfic source). 150k times 1,461(leap year)= 219,150,000 words, and that's my average. Not including the times when I really get into a story, and forget sleep. I've been able to go through a 300k word story before sleep.

I'm pretty bad at contextualizing large numbers, so I didn't know how much 8 million words was. I fully expected you to say that's about ten Philosopher's Stones. I burst out laughing when you said 103.

** Probably about a 100 million words? 100million/(8*365) thats like 34k words per day and I generally kill a 250k word fic in 3 days so perhaps a bit of an underestimate?

UPDATE: I saw the math calculation by [[/u/ltouroumov]] and am going to have to revise my calculation since my reading habits are more on par with what he is saying but at double the speed; that would conservatively bring me to 40 million words per year but if we account for a year worth of vacation something around 250 million words?

** Let's do a little math.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute][According to Wikipedia]], the average reading speed for the English language is around 220 words per minute.

As an avid fanfiction reader, I read both during my lunch break for around 30 minutes, and after work for around 3 to 4 hours, during the week-end it increases to 6 to 7 hours per day.

#+begin_example
  --- during the week ---
  3.5 to 4.5 h/day => 210 to 270 m/day
  x220 => 46 200 to 59 400 w/day
  x5 => 231 000 to 297 000 w/work-week
  --- during the week-end ---
  6 to 7 h/day => 360 to 420 m/day
  x220 => 79 200 to 92 400 w/day
  x2 => 158 400 to 184 800 w/week-end
  --- total for a week ---
  389 400 to 481 800 w/week
  --- total per month (average) ---
  x4 => 1557600 to 1927200 w/month
  --- total per year ---
  x52 => 20 248 800 to 25 053 600 w/year

  --- over the last three years ---
  60 746 400 to 75 160 800 words
#+end_example

This is only a rough estimate, I had periods where I would read for 8 hours a day /all week/ at a much higher wpm (let's say 350wpm), which would put the weekly total to =840 000=, and monthly total to =5 040 000=.

This is across all fandoms, not specifically Harry Potter.

360wpm means you can read one 210k story in a 10 hour day (if you don't take breaks), which is about one Goblet of Fire a day (give or take a few thousand words).

In particular, I read WIP fics to the current end and then drop, not follow them. I note down the next chapter on the sheet so I can go back to it later.

Besides completeness, I also (sporadically) tag fics with tropes, so it's easy to find, for example, time travel fics in case I need to rec them or if it's the only thing I remember about a fic I want to re-read. I always tag the pairing, so if I'm in a shipping mood I can find exactly what I want. I also have a category for "reference" which I use to indicate something the fic explored really well. Of course, I also use favorite and quality columns to tell if a fic is worth re-reading.

That in 7 years of active fanfic reading. Would have been more but 2017 was mostly spent writing an app to help finding fanfiction to read and that's taken most of the time I'd have actually spent reading. Can't say it was a bad trade :)

And yeah, I don't realy regret anything. The creativity of some people really deserves an applause. Taking source material to new heights and/or places clearly not intended by the author and making it work fabulously is great.

** I have been tracking my reading since November, roughly, and that accounts for at least 13 million words. Assuming that the reading speed MoonReader reports is an average over time I should have read ~23 million words on my phone only over the last one-two years.

Adding together everything I read on my laptop, what I used to read on my Kindle and Kobo, and taking in account the last ~seven years it's probably more than two hundred millions^{*}. I don't know, though, how many of them are from unique works - I often end up re-reading them from scratch on a new chapter release if it has been a while from my last read-through.

** I have a spreadsheet I've maintained since I started reading fanfiction as an adult (before this, I had only frequented an old Pokemon fanfiction site in the early 2000s).

In this time, I've read over 100 million words of fanfiction at a rate of about 35 million words per year.

(This includes a number of Pokemon, Worm, Naruto, and Star Wars fanfics as well).

** I've been reading fanfiction since I discovered the internet. Back with dial-up modems. Probably about 25 years now. Which is crazy.

I only just started paying attention to word counts because my younger co-workers. We openly discuss fanfiction now, it's not a such a secret stigma anymore. Hooray for solidarity! My favorite fics are all sweepingly long epics. If I see that a fic has 30+ chapters or over 200k words I get excited like a kid on Christmas. On average I burn through at LEAST 1-2 a week. It has slightly spoiled me with actual books. I have a hard time getting through the exposition and character development in a lot of books. If they don't hook me by the 3rd chapter or so, I'll choose to just read a new fic instead.

At this point I've probably spent years of my life reading fanfiction, perhaps as much as I have spent sleeping, and I regret nothing!!

PS: REVIEW kids it's the best way to keep your ships sailing and your favorite writers happy and continuing writing. A little love goes a long way. They write 10k+ words for you, you can drop them at least 10 now and then. :)

This. I try to leave something like "Hey, thanks for taking the time to write this fic. I definitely enjoyed reading it, and hope to see more works from you" whenever I follow or favorite something.

You don't want to, either. Aside from the fact that you run out of material super quick (especially once you leave Harry Potter, which is an extreme outlier quantity-wise), it basically mean you're dedicating most of your reading time to fanfiction. Between the background reading required or suggested for my courses (which I really need to read since I barely ever go to class) and fanfiction, I haven't read a proper novel in months.

***** Mhm, I've already read most of the good stories out there. I've pretty much read read everything interesting in the first 300+ pages on ffn sorted by follows.\\
I tried going to other fandoms and branching out to crossovers, and there are definitely a few fandoms where I've read /every/ story on ffn.

You know, I just remembered something. When I first started reading fanfiction, and I saw the ammount of works in HP category, I told my friend that there would be a day where I'd've read over half the stories in that category :D How naive I was.... I envy new (HP) fanfiction readers. They don't know that for every gem, there's a few hundred bad ones in there.

** The thing for me is, I very rarely read fanfiction word-for-word. There's just too much of it and not enough time. (I don't know where some people find time to read 9-figure word counts.) After I read enough versions of the same story and characters over and over again, I found I could get a pretty good understanding of a story just by skimming (500-1000 WPM). Even on my favorites list, I've only skimmed most of them. A story has to be truly extraordinary to get me to read it word-for-word.

I probably read a few dozen stories word-for-word when I was starting out, about 5 years ago. I'm guessing that was in the range of 5-10 million words. Since then, I never really kept track, but based on my reading habits, I'd estimate I've skimmed about 50 million words, give or take 50%.

** I started reading HP fanfiction during the summer of 2003 when Order of the Phoenix came out. I lived in a small town that didn't have any places to buy books so I downloaded what I thought was a legit copy. It was not.

For most of the 15 years I read, conservatively, 5-6 hours everyday. At an average reading speed of 600 wpm I'd say I've read right around a billion words of HP fanfiction. Over the last year or so that rate has really dropped as I just can't get into a lot of the newer stories. I find myself reading my favorites multiple times but even that has lost it's appeal.

I've gotten back into reading other fiction and it's been fun because my mom loves to read as well so we will start the same series of books and the text each other randomly about it.
