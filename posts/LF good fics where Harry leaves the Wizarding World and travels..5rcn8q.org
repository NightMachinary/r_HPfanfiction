There aren't really that many good fics where Harry travels the world and learns new things. The only really really good one I can remember was the one by rorschach's blot. I'm asking for the best fics where Harry leaves the Wizarding World and travels, learning new spells and new things. I don't really care about pairings.


** I suggest that you consider reading A Long Journey Home. Based on your criteria

#+begin_quote
  best fics
#+end_quote

It seems to be well regarded in this sub

#+begin_quote
  leaves the Wizarding World
#+end_quote

During parts, yes

#+begin_quote
  travels
#+end_quote

Harry travels a /lot/ in this story

#+begin_quote
  learning new spells and new things
#+end_quote

This happens a lot

#+begin_quote
  I don't really care about pairings
#+end_quote

There are only two pairings mentioned with any prominent appearances in the story. [[/spoiler][One canon pairing features in a couple chapters as background, and the other non-canon pairing features heavily in the latter part of the story's middle arc.]]

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
