:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this a while ago, and there was something I think I forgot about it and it's nagging at me.

It starts as Harry intentionally going to another dimension bc of boredom and he thinks that finding Tom again would make life interesting. I remember he had a thing with Draco Malfoy at that point too.

When Harry arrives at the new dimension he possesses this French boy, Hadrian Black, whose cousin Alphard has a crush on him. This other boy, Cassius Zabini also has a crush on him as well. When he goes to Hogwarts, he starts a romantic relationship with Tom Riddle.

I've been looking for this for a while, it would be great if people could help. Sorry if I explained badly.
