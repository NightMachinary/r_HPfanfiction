Like the title says, non magicals (the word muggle makes me cringe) advance to a point where they have the means and tech to leave the planet. Can be at any time but preferably during the second wizarding war.


** All of them (since the moon landing preceded the series), though I doubt that's what you mean- if you mean abandoning the Earth entirely, I think there are very few indeed that do it, like linkffn(2857962)- touted as the best Firefly/HP crossover- leaving only a few diehards behind if I recall right, though that's all before the actual story.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

**** nonjon is such a great writer that if I ever considered reading a crossover, it would probably be this one.

His depictions of characters in Black Comedy is the best of all the fics I've read. Hell, even Alternate Dimension Hermione is top-notch.

  This tale intends to chronicle Harry and Hermione's adventures and lives well into their old age after World War 3. It starts off sweet but quickly heads into the thriller territory, and some parts of it are truly intense, going to never before seen places in Wizarding World with a Civil War brewing up, and a mysterious Auror with an agenda of his own. Romantic Thriller. Harmione.
