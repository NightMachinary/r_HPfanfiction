I would like for the fanfic to deal with Harry's real abuse. I don't enjoy the fanfics where they make his abuse more brutal, as it feels like the canon abuse he deals with already isn't enough. It's also hard for me to find a fanfic where it deals with everything he has had to go through without:

> Being only three chapters long.\\
> A "good" Snape inside of it. (I've seen far too many mentor Snape fanfics. I'm not a Snape apologist, and very much despise Snape, so any character bashing of him I don't mind. Just as long as the fanfic doesn't excuse his actions, I'm fine with it.)\\
> Ron bashing. (Not that I don't mind Ron bashing. I like his character, but I don't mind the bashing. It's just highly overdone to the point they even make it to where Ron physically attacks everybody, and usually in those fanfics Hermione is /never/ held accountable for her actions either and is made out to be an angel. That's where I draw the line.)\\
> Molly apologist energy. (I must admit, I'm pretty picky and have many other characters I don't like for thousands of reasons. I won't list them all, though.)\\
> Draco apologist energy. (Told you I'm picky. I have more characters I would list, but that would make this post longer than it has to be.)

But even if any of the fanfics that are recommended to me have what I listed, I'll still give it a shot. I would just like to read an immensely long fanfic that deals with the severe CPTSD Harry must have. I would also enjoy if he's not shipped with anybody in that fanfic.
