In canon, it seemes like Hermione is made to great at every Hogwarts subject. My question is, are there any branches of magic Hermione is shown to be less talented at? Flying on a broom and divination aren't really branches of magic, and she doesn't ever try her hand at the Dark Arts. It's shown Harry is better at Defense, but could she have gotten an O at her Defense OWLs without Harry forming the DA?

Anyway, to summarise, what types of magic is Hermione not good at?


** I'd go farther and say that DADA is not a branch of magic either: it's a subject incorporating domain-specific knowledge such as what Dark creatures there are out there and how to recognize them, Charms with applications in offense and defense (shields, jinxes, hexes, curses, and curse- and creature-specific counters), limited wizard-wizard combat practice, and some miscellaneous magical skills useful in combat, such as nonverbal casting.

That said, Hermione's weaknesses, such as they are, are not in branches of magic. Whenever a new spell or type of magic is introduced in class, she is invariably the first to master it; and that includes DADA-type skills such as nonverbal casting. In fact, I would bet that if you put Hermione a nice, well-lit room, and asked her to cast any DADA-related spell, she'd probably do it better and more reliably than even Harry.

However, it is the /non-magical/ aspects of her character that make her less good some /applications/ of magic. Put her in front of a Dementor, and she will falter, where Harry would bite the bullet, push aside the fear and self-doubt that the Dementor is projecting, and just rejoice. Similarly, put her in front of a Boggart, and Hermione --- a perpetual worrier --- would give it plenty of fuel to get at her, whereas Harry's simpler fears are more easily seen through and countered. Ultimately, put her in front of an enemy wizard, and she'd experience analysis paralysis or make suboptimal spell choices (which is what happened at the Department of Mysteries).

Lastly, to answer your penultimate question, do I think she could have gotten an O at her Defense OWLs without Harry^{1} forming the DA? I think that without DA, she would have probably still gotten an E, unless OotP year had gone /very/ differently. In a nutshell, she'd have no trouble getting the theoretical parts down, and she'd have no trouble learning the required spells from books, which is a common practice for her anyway, but she wouldn't be any better at spell selection and aiming under fire, confronting a Boggart, or any of the other things she might have to do on the practical part of the OWL. To get to an O, she probably would need experiences that would strengthen her nerve, the sorts of baptisms of fire that Harry has had at the Dursleys and on an annual basis at Hogwarts.

^{1} --- Technically, Hermione was the one who came up with the idea for, and organized, the DA. Harry had to be roped into it.

And because I already have this comment going.

The thing with Hermione is that people always look at her booksmarts and think that automatically correlates with great witch/wizard, when that correlates instead to skilled witch/wizard, with greatness requiring a different factor. Hell, Hermione says it herself.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry --- you're a great wizard, you know."

  "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.

  "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"

#+begin_quote
  ‘You drink that,' said Harry. ‘No, listen -- get back and get Ron -- grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbled ore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him really.'

  ‘But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?'

  ‘Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?' said Harry, pointing at his scar. ‘I might get lucky again.'

  Hermione's lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.

  ‘Hermione!'

  ‘Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know.'
#+end_quote

To me, that reads as a mix of "you're a great [person who happens to be] a wizard" and general words of encouragement and optimism.

Once Harry points out that Hermione is, in fact, better at magic than him, Hermione persists in her encouragement and downplays this fact, in favor of virtues generally unrelated to actual magical ability and skill, which Harry has and she perceives herself as lacking.

Also, Hermione is smart, but she's still an ickle firstie at this point, so I am not sure how much weight should be given to her judgment in this case.

****** Please note that for this entire post (unless otherwise directly stated) I'm using great/greatness only as a descriptor of magnitude, with no moral connotations. Well, let's start by taking a look at the Prophecy (I can't believe I'm honestly doing this, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4rtbig/discussion_what_if_snape_didnt_turn_sides_and/d542lgh][considering my past discourses on the prophecy]]).

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... *and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal,* but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies....
#+end_quote

Bolded for emphasis on what I consider the important part for this discussion. So, I don't think the prophecy is in any way prescriptive but rather descriptive of a possible future, but Voldemort out of ignorance of about half the prophecy basically frogmarches us to that future, so Harry is Voldemort's equal. Yet, Harry is in no way as skilled at magic as Voldemort, except in what I'm going to call the deep magics (the whole sacrificing himself thing, some wandlore stuff) which almost seem to be entirely character based. Tying that into Taure's headcanon document, plus everything not goblin-steel related of the Sword of Gryffindor shows how aspects of character are incredibly magically important. Greatness of character (whether good or bad) directly correlates to greatness of wizard/witch. Dumbledore and Voldemort both fall into greatness and highly skilled, while Harry and Neville (and maybe Ron? I would need to think about Ron more) would fall into greatness but not necessarily highly skilled.

This brings up an interesting question to me. What distinguishes jinxes, hexes and curses from Charms? Are they different subsets, are they as different from Charms as Charms are from Transfiguration? I've been waffling on this for a while, and have some leanings into both directions.

***** Charms is, first and foremost, a subject taught at Hogwarts, where magical skills and knowledge are grouped as they are for pedagogical and social reasons, not because of their fundamental nature or mechanics, though there is, of course, a very strong relationship between the two. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/52362t/hermiones_weaknesses/d7hn5v3][I elaborate on that, with examples, here.]]

Going by Snape's speech in HBP and other clues, Dark Arts seem to incorporate Dark creatures (e.g., Dementors), Dark spells (jinxes, hexes, and curses), Dark potions (e.g., Potion used to build Voldemort's body at the end of GoF), and WTFever creates Inferi. A Dementor does not stop being a creature just because it's a Dark creature, and nor does Pettigrew's concoction stop being a Potion just because it involves human flesh and blood taken under specific circumstances. So, in terms of "branches of magic" as transferable skills that one can be good or bad at, dark spells have all the mechanics of the type of magic that is covered primarily in Charms, even if Flitwick would have none of that in his class.

****** This directly contradicts JK Rowling's spell definitions as referenced:

#+begin_quote
  Spell Definitions

  Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex. Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas. Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:

  Spell:

  The generic term for a piece of magic.

  Charm:

  Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.

  Hexes:

  Has a connotation of dark magic, as do jinxes, but of a minor sort. I see 'hex' as slightly worse. I usually use 'jinx' for spells whose effects are irritating but amusing.

  Curses:

  Reserved for the worst kinds of dark magic.
#+end_quote

Counter-jinxes, counter-hexes and counter-curses, which we know are the same spells as jinxes, hexes and curses from Hermione's OotP chat, are not simply Charms which coincidentally have nasty effects. They are a) spells, not Charms and b) Dark magic. There is a fundamental magical difference between them.

******* Thanks for locating the quote.

My sense is that it basically confirms what I've been saying. That "the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas" suggests that these are socially constructed distinctions rather than ones grounded in fundamental magical differences. It even gives an example of the "classification" of the Stunning Spell being determined by how its name sounded, rather than any sort of fundamental nature, and qualifiers such as "usually" further reinforce that impression.

A Hogwarts student would look at an spell cast with a precise wand movement and a verbal and cognitive component to perform a fairly specific and inflexible function and call it a "Charm" --- if it doesn't have obvious combat applications; a jinx, a hex, or a curse if it has a Dark component; a Transfiguration if it involves creating or destroying objects; and a "spell" if it doesn't fit into either category. A Durmstrang student who doesn't have the same stigma against Dark Arts^{1} might group spells differently.

So, that "there is a fundamental magical difference between them" is an unwarranted extrapolation, in my opinion.

Instead, I would group them by their mechanics and skills involved in performing them. I would group what Hogwarts calls "Charms", along with very specific and incanted "Transfiguration" spells like Serpensortia or Evanesco, and the Dark spells into one branch; free-form, nonverbal Transfiguration and animation that creates a living thing (or whatever it was that Dumbledore did with statues in the Ministry atrium) into another; Potioneering and Herbology into two others, possibly related; then Divination, which might be grouped with Astronomy.

So, for example, Evanesco (the Vanishing Spell), while it's taught as a part of Transfiguration (because it's useful for in practicing Conjuration), actually draws on skills learned primarily in Charms, as would a curse --- except that one adds on an unspecified Dark component.

--------------

^{1} --- To be clear, I am not arguing that Dark Arts are just misunderstood and suppressed by that do-gooder Dumbledore oppressing poor purebloods who just want to practice Dark Arts with consenting partners. They are nasty stuff, though the precise nature of their nastiness is a matter of headcanon that I'd rather not get into at the moment.

******** I feel like you're trying to explain away what JKR said rather than genuinely accept it. Yes, she said they were flexible at the edges and admitted that she called the Stunning Charm a spell for its alliterative effect, despite it being a Charm. But that doesn't remove the fact that she identified a fundamental difference between Charms and Transfiguration in general - that Charms does not fundamentally alter the nature of its target, whereas Transfiguration does. And it also doesn't remove the fact that she separated out Dark magic from everything else.

(Incidentally, there's plenty in canon to support the idea that dark magic is magically different too, because dark magic is harder to reverse than other magic.)

I don't think grouping magic by the casting method makes much sense. To me classification by what the magic /does/ is a much more logical division than by how the magic is /performed/. The performance classification would be like dividing up the branches of physics by what equipment you use to investigate it rather than by what phenomena they describe.

"Turning a teacup into a rat", a transfiguration, is presented as a contrast to Charms. If the defining feature of a Charm is that it does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject, the corollary is that a Transfiguration does fundamentally alter the properties of the subject (because if it didn't, then it would be a Charm).

Incidentally, this explains why it is that you see conjuration in both Charms and Transfiguration. They may appear the same in the way they are cast, and in the apparent effect they have, but they are magically different. A "transfiguration conjuration" will create an object with its own fundamental existence independent of the caster, whereas a "Charm conjuration" is a magical bundle of properties.

#+begin_quote

I don't see any evidence that these fundamentally alter the target. Indeed I would suggest that the reason why these magical effects are so easy to reverse (whereas untransfiguration is a complex topic not covered until NEWT, and Dark magic resists reversal) is because the object's fundamental nature hasn't changed. You've just imposed a property on it. That property can be removed, returning the object to its "true" state.

Except from everything we see in canon, understanding of the magical theory (as you say, the "magical causes and effects, their similarities and differences") has a direct impact on whether or not you can perform said magic.

One example would be Aguamenti, which conjures water but was learnt in Charms.

The fact that it is a Charm also helps explain why it is that people can drink it to satisfy their thirst: Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration and its exceptions are a part of the magical theory which applies to transfiguration magic.

  So you would say that jinxes, hexes, and curses are actually closer to Transfiguration than they are to Charms in terms of the "magical theory", though they are closer to Charms in terms of mechanical components?
#+end_quote

I think it varies. If you look at the branch of magic as a whole, yes I would say that the Dark Arts are closer to Transfiguration than Charms. However on the level of a specific spell I think it varies.

The "heirarchy of magical theory", as I imagine it, is something like this:

1. General magical theory.
2. Branch of magic theory.
3. Spell family theory.
4. Individual spell theory.

General magical theory would be stuff like the power of symbols, representation relations, the nature of sacrifice, the use of magical tools to exernalise concepts, etc.

Branch of magic theory would be the theory specific to a branch like transfiguration. So for example in transfiguration it might include the Platonic forms, the 4-element conception of substance, etc. Some branches may be offshoots of more fundamental branches. If so they would share some common theory but at some point diverge.

Spell family theory would describe a group of spells within a branch that had theoretical concepts in common. So for example I picture summoning and banishing as part of the same spell family.

And finally individual spell theory would be the theory that is unique to a particular spell. So for example I imagine the fidelius has a lot of theory relating to how secrets are hidden in souls.

The complexity comes when two branches of magic have a similar spell family - such as the aforementioned charms conjuration and transfiguration conjuration. Though they share a fundamental different basis in terms of being based on a different "branch theory", I also picture them as both invoking some very similar concepts at the "spell family" level of theory. An analogy might be if you bake bread with two different types of flour. The flour is like the "branch level", the baking method is like the "spell family level". Because you're basing the two breads on a different ingredient, the result is going to differ in nature. However, the two nonetheless have much in common.

For those curious, the (partial) definitions of Charms and the Dark Arts were put on JK Rowling's old website, before it got replaced with Pottermore. You can still access it via the Way Back Machine. Aim for somewhere around 2009.

The stuff about DADA involving the use of the Dark Arts comes from Hermione's argument with Umbridge in OotP. Umbridge (and the book she assigned) proposed that the use of counter-curses was no different than using curses generally. Hermione disagreed, saying that she thought they have a legitimate use by people seeking to defend themselves. This indicates that "counter-curse" simply means using a curse in a defensive manner. And we know that in DADA, except under Umbridge, they learn counter-curses. So basically Hogwarts teaches the Dark Arts, they just stress their defensive use.

So DADA involves the use of Dark magic, and said Dark magic is a separate branch of magic to Charms under JKR's spell definitions.

******* Very interesting stuff about the relationship between jinxes and counter-jinxes; I had completely forgotten. And, that Hermione objected not to the connection between the two but to the claim that jinxes are themselves illegitimate is telling.

However, the counter-jinxes that we get to see still follow the same Charms-like mechanic as the jinxes they counter, and non-Dark spells have specific counter-spells as well. It seems to me to be a distinction without a difference.

That does not mean that someone good at the "nice" Charms would be automatically good at Dark spells, of course. Personality and experience are central to the practice of magic, and doubly so for Dark spells. Lockhart was good at Memory Charms but bad at all others, and there's no reason it couldn't be the same for Dark spells.

Not sure where the shield charms bit comes from. We know that Harry casts some rather good Shield charms at the end of Battle of Hogwarts, but it's not clear how much of that is superior skill, how much is that he doesn't have to worry about defending himself, how much is the new Sacrificial Protection, and how much is a general apotheosis. Hermione also casts some variants of Protego that Harry isn't shown casting --- though that doesn't mean that he couldn't and didn't, just like we have no idea how good or bad Hermione's Imperius might have been.

  Spell Definitions

  Every now and then somebody asks me for the difference between a spell, a charm and a hex. Within the Potter world, the boundaries are flexible, and I imagine that wizards may have their own ideas. Hermione-ish, however, I've always had a working theory:

  Spell:

  The generic term for a piece of magic.

  Charm:

  Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.

  Hexes:

  Has a connotation of dark magic, as do jinxes, but of a minor sort. I see 'hex' as slightly worse. I usually use 'jinx' for spells whose effects are irritating but amusing.

  Curses:

  Reserved for the worst kinds of dark magic.

And I'd figure that Charms could be incredibly useful in dueling. I mean, first of all, Expelliarmus is a charm if I remember right, not a curse, jinx or hex. Charms has some animation work to it (though different from Transfiguration animation, I think?), which opens up a whole new can of worm.

Here, I think that it might be helpful to distinguish between "branch of magic" and "Hogwarts subject": the former I would consider a grouping of magical skills and effects with similar mechanics, while the latter was put together as a convenient way to teach students the skills they need. It's a fairly close correspondence, but it's not absolute. (A Muggle analogy might be that a History class would involve using and practicing language skills even though there is a separate English (or other native language) class.)

DADA is an extreme case of this: a multidisciplinary subject incorporating many areas of magic, but there is no reason others have to be absolutely pure either. For example, NEWT-level Potions class on antidotes involved casting a diagnostic Charm as the first step.

Most of Transfiguration the students practice starting from their first year is nonverbal as opposed to spoken, involving limited wand movements as opposed to precise, continuous as opposed to discrete (with failed Transfigurations assuming an intermediate form, rather than producing random effects like Charms), and flexible as opposed to specific: there is no "Matchickus into Needlus" spell to learn, but rather an exercise to train the students to transfigure inanimate objects to inanimate objects of their choice of a similar small size and shape. So, it seems to me to be a distinct way of doing things from Charms.

Some magic taught in Transfiguration does seem to have more Charm-like mechanics (e.g., Vanishing Spell), and it might be taught in Transfiguration simply because it's useful for cleaning up at the end of class.

Jinxes as the most minor, most causing discomfort rather than pain, and can be reversed with a short spell or even a spell canceller.

Hexes are moderate and are probably the widest array, they cause pain or damage that while having to be looked after by someone with magical skill can be cured and solved quickly with no lasting damage, a Few Hexes can be considered Dark

Curses are the worst and if not cared for immediately could be permanent. A larger number of spells called Curses can also be called Dark. Curses cause sever damage.

*** As an addendum, [[/u/Taure]] has argued very persuasively (at least to me) downthread that:

1. Jinxes, hexes, and curses (JHC) are not actually Charms, and actually have more in common magically with Transfiguration than with Charms, which suggests that Charms skills aren't as transferable to JHC as I thought that they would be.
2. Counter-JHC spells are closely related to the JHC spells in the first place, and the skills involved are transferable between the two.

This further suggests that DADA, while a multidisciplinary subject, may, in fact, cover branches of magic not covered elsewhere.

In light of this, we have relatively little data (compared to other subjects) about Hermione's aptitudes for JHC and counter-JHC spells, except that she got an E in DADA, which has a number of possible explanations, from a lack of aptitude/talent for Dark Arts (and therefore for their counters), to lack of nerve when dealing with the practical exercises (because casting a counter-jinx requires being jinxed first, casting Riddiculus requires a Boggart, etc.), to favoritism (because the dialogue suggests that only Harry might have gotten a shot at the bonus points for the Patronus).

Overall, I think that my assessment holds up well, except that I am no longer as willing to bet that Hermione would be able to cast counter-JHC spells better than Harry under ideal circumstances. Evidence is mixed, favoring Harry somewhat: there's the DADA OWL, and Harry seems to have a fairly easy time casting Dark spells in general, though usually via uncontrolled emotion, with the Imperius in DH being the only exception that I can think of; whereas we don't see Hermione casting much Dark magic in the first place, though the Parchment Jinx appears to have been nigh-irreversible magic, cast in cold blood.

I think the answer to this is in a precursor question: "Why is Hermione successful academically?"

In canon, she frequently studies by reading in the library, makes copious notes during lectures, and is an organisational wunderkind. The fruits of these labours frequently appeared whenever JKR needed the plot to advance.

Fanfic authors take a shortcut and often say that Hermione is 'naturally' brilliant (a savant or something similar).

In my view, Hermione is good at types of magic that:

1. Can be learned primarily through texts.

2. She feels confident performing.

3. The author needs her to know in order to solve a plot issue.

Divination and broom riding fail the first test, Defence Against the Dark Arts (pre-OOtP) fails the second, but the third can get fanfic authors out of sticky situations.

It's important to note that Hermione suffers from occasional tunnel-vision, particularly when it comes to researching topics of non-academic mysteries like Nicholas Flamel's accomplishments or the Half-Blood Prince's identity.

I know, right? People invent all sorts of magical cores or magical power levels, when the "reality" suggested by canon is so much more interesting: personality and magic are inextricable. Lockhart is the ultimate shallow character, who mainly cares about what people think of him, rather than the substance of his deeds, so the only magic that works for him is Memory Charms: that which alters others' perceptions, without altering the underlying reality. Harry's reckless stubbornness and "wearing emotions on his sleeve" give him resistance to the Imperius and an unmatched Patronus, but also cripple his Occlumency (against general attackers; Voldemort is a special case), but also leave him incapable of taking advice and easily manipulated by the likes of Umbridge and Voldemort. And so on...

Though most of the dream journal stuff doesn't come true, if I remember correctly. OoTP is the one I've read the least, and that's where that stuff is.

******* Trelawney is, according to JKR, "at least ninety per cent fraud". From Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  Sybill is the great-great granddaughter of a genuine Seer, Cassandra Trelawney. Cassandra's gift has been much diluted over ensuing generations, although Sybill has inherited more than she knows. Half-believing in her own fibs about her talent (for she is at least ninety per cent fraud), Sybill has cultivated a dramatic manner and enjoys impressing her more gullible students with predictions of doom and disaster. She is gifted in the fortune teller's tricks; she accurately reads Neville's nervousness and suggestibility in his first class, and tells him he is about to break a cup, which he does. On other occasions, gullible students do her work for her. Professor Trelawney tells Lavender Brown that something she is dreading will happen to her on the sixteenth of October; when Lavender receives news on that day that her pet rabbit has died, she connects it instantly with the prediction. All of Hermione's logic and good sense (Lavender was not dreading the death of the rabbit, which was very young; the rabbit did not die on the sixteenth, but the previous day) are lost: Lavender wants to believe her unhappiness was foretold. By the law of averages, Professor Trelawney's rapid fire predictions sometimes hit the mark, but most of the time she is full of hot air and self-importance.

  Nevertheless, Sybill does experience very rare flashes of genuine clairvoyance, which she can never remember afterwards. She secured her post at Hogwarts because she revealed, during her interview with Dumbledore, that she was the unconscious possessor of important knowledge.

******** I'm not a big fan of WoG in general, outside of those authors who are incredibly meticulous about worldbuilding and documenting their process (basically just Tolkien) and the strangeness that was pre-Disney Star Wars canon hierarchy. JKR in particular seems to have particularly flaky WoG that pretty much is aimed to please the largest portion of her audience than fit in with what is present in the books, which is why I try to keep my interpretations of canon based on the seven books as much as possible.

********* I mean, sure, you can choose to believe whatever you want. The problem with your interpretation of divination -- where someone can predict little things about the future with tea leaves and what not -- is that undermines the theme of free will and choices (one of the central themes of the series) too much for my liking.

********** Well, my view of divination is that it is descriptive of possible/potential future events. Sort of like a quantum mechanics possibilities/uncertainty thing, but not mathematical or really very repeatable (like I assume Arithmancy to be). And the difference between futures here isn't due to quantum randomness but free will and choices. Which I think fits in with how most of the predictions and whatnot seem to be warnings.

******** Yeah, no problem. The whole "Trelawney is a fraud" thing we see claimed as canon by fanfiction just really bothers me. Yes, annoying schtick and focus is annoying, but that doesn't equal fraud. The only actual fraud I can honestly think of us actually seeing in the entire damn series is Lockhart.

**** And on a more random note, I will note that this means the whole plot of the Harry Potter series started not because of a prophecy but rather because Divination was taken seriously. Because had Albus deemed it a subject unworthy of being taught at Hogwarts to the point where he wouldn't have even given her a chance, it's likely that she would have been at home when she made the prophecy and thus nobody would have heard it. And this kind of prophecy would have only worked had it been heard, so it might not have been made at all.

Thus, the prophecy was made because Albus /chose/ not to dismiss it, and it got fulfilled because Tom /chose/ not to dismiss it either. Yup, free will there. It's so twisted that it's hilarious.

** I always thought of it like this:

What Hermione does in 3 spells perfectly, Harry does in one spell good enough.

Magic in the HP universe is mainly achieved by knowing about the spell. Knowledge is literally power. There are only a few spells that require emotions such as the Patronus and the Cruciatus. All the other spells are knowledge and execution, both things in which Hermione outclass not only her peers but even some adult wizards and witches.

The difference is that Hermione is not a duelist, she is an academic. What she lacks is fighting instinct. She is also extremely loathe to just wing something. She doesn't do "good enough", she does "perfect" and that makes her weaker in classes like Defense where "good enough, but fast" may be the difference between an O and an E.

*** I think this sells Harry a bit short when it comes to DADA. I think when it comes to Dark magic, Harry's understanding of it is as deep as Hermione's if not more so. Moreover his entire temperament seems to make him magically inclined to be good at spells related to DADA.

I don't think Hermione has a magical advantage over Harry in DADA.

***** Given that my interpretation of canon magic has your character as a magically real element which determines your magical "orientation", including your disposition towards casting certain areas of magic powerfully, within that system to say that Harry has a fighter spirit is also to say that he is more likely to cast DADA spells better than Hermione (ceteris paribus).

However, even without that I think there's plenty to indicate that Harry is better at DADA spells as well as their application. For instance, he has a tendency to pick them up first try, without any practice: consider levicorpus and sectumsempra. And on top of that, as I said above, his shield charm does seem particularly good: able to turn Snape's spells back at him by the time Harry is 16, and by the time he's 17 able to cover the entire Great Hall.

****** Yes, you're of course right. /If/ character traits have an impact on how good or bad someone casts a spell (no additional adrenaline, no outside pressure - in a completely sterile and neutral test-environment) then you're of course right.

Repeating myself, I say again that any discussion is rather futile if we try to find some canonical truth, not so if we kick back and forth ideas for writing and headcanon.

** Her weakness stems from practical applications. She can read and understand theories of magic with the best of them, but see her dealing with Potions in Year Six. She has little creative energy to invent new solutions. That's what sets her apart from, say, Dumbledore.

Take the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in Book 5. The killing curse is supposed to be unblockable, but he blocked it several times using ingenious methods, even using Fawkes as a shield.

I think that Hermoine in the exact position would realize fast all the details about the killing curse: mainly how unblockable it is. Seeing no way out of it, she'd lock up and take a full splash of deadly green to the face.

Conversely, Harry sucks at the theory part of magic, but excels at the actual practical use of it.

** I think Hermoine is massively over-hyped when it comes to her 'genius'. To me, it seems like in order for her to do well she needs to know the theory behind it, IMHO she may be good at using spells consistently but she doesn't master them as well as Harry. She may get the disarming charm down on the first try (and repeat it with the same results over and over) but after Harry's third, he would be able to disarm someone and knock them back with the force of his spell.

** Rowling wanted to write Hermione as being unusually intelligent. She actually wrote Hermione as an unusually dedicated student. It would be in keeping with canon if Hermione were bad at everything by nature but made up with it by working absurdly hard. The reason she gets good grades is that she begins studying five months in advance of the exams.

It would also be in keeping with canon if Hermione were actually that smart, didn't need to study all that much, but used her study habits as a smokescreen in a vain attempt to make people think she's not all that better than they are -- to make herself more socially acceptable. The reason she gets good grades is that she finds the material trivial to learn and recall at need, at least in a school setting.

In either case, it's likely that she would have gotten an O in Defence without Dumbledore's Army. She has enough time blocked off on her calendar to study Defence if she needs to. If anything, she might have scored better if she'd had more time to study on her own.
