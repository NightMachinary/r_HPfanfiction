I'm looking for fics that showcase Slytherin as a hotbed of wealth. I'm specifically looking for Hogwarts-era fics that have a Drarry pairing.

The ones I'm thinking about have the Slytherins spending money without a thought, constantly going off to private clubs, or bars, or to one of their many vacation homes. They drink and party fairly regularly, but also have strict social codes that they follow based on being upper class [and Pureblood, of course, but the fics I'm looking for are more based on a class system].

I'm looking for fics that show Draco introducing Harry to this whole new world of wealth and careless abandon, using it almost like a seduction technique.

I don't know if this is a very limited request so, on the chance that it is: I'm open to fics that are not Drarry, though I'd prefer if Harry was in the pairing, and I'm also open to fics that are not Hogwarts-era but, as I've mentioned, these aren't my top preferences.

Thank you!
