Come Together is a fic that is a crossover with the MCU. Tom becomes a part of the Howling Commandos, and his hatred of muggles is non-existant by the end of the fic.

I am imagining this version of Tom entering the canon universe by accident and helping to bring down his canon counterpart.


** Could you link the fic, please?
