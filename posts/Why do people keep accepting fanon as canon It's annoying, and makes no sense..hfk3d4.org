No, Ginny and Molly aren't spying, and stealing from Harry on Dumbledore's orders. No Dumbledore is not evil, manipulative and well meaning, sure. Not evil though. Ron is not spying on Harry. Ginny is not using love potions on Harry. Hermione is not perfect, and has betrayed Harry's trust as well as Ron. They're kids, what do you expect. Snape should not be as glorified as he is, ya'll like Alan Rickman, not Snape. Book readers know what I mean. Yes Snape did turn sides, and is no longer evil. A dick. Yes. Obsessed with Lily? You bet ya. To an unhealthy degree? Probably. Evil? No.

Thanks,\\

** RE: Snape, i agree mostly, but i think it depends on how much redemption you believe is possible. Personally, i think it is possible to do something so terrible that you will /always/ be evil, no matter how you try to make up for your terrible acts later.

Snape sold out a toddler and a father to a mass murderer so that he could try to make it with the mom. Idgaf whether he spent the next 20 years cosplaying Mother Theresa (incidentally, he spent the next several years emotionally abusing schoolchildren...), he is still an evil son of a bitch.

*** Meh. That's debatable. I never liked the guy myself, but i'm willing to take ab indifferent stance on him here. I wouldn't call him evil as much as misguided. When he told Voldemort of the prophecy, I don't think he was understanding what ramifications that would lead to. When he knew, he went straight to Dumbledore. Now him doing this purely out of his love /cough/ obsession /cough/ for Lily is highly likely, i'm willing to play devils advocate, and say that he did it after realising what he just did.

**** Then he lied about Sirius confounding the kids at the end of book 3. That opened up the whole can of worms that possibly bit EVERYONE in the ass at the end of book 4.

Throw in book 5's occlumency "lessons"... Something something punishing the son for the sins of the father something something...

Snape is an irredeemable evil asshole.

** Well first off, calling something evil is very subjective as your version of evil (as well as the level) may be very different than mine. And while there will definitely be areas we fully agree on there will also be areas we disagree on.

Now in terms of mixing canon and fanon unless you reread the books occassionally it is quite easy to confuse or meld fanon items into canon (especially after you read several hundred fanfics without rereading the original books).

Now as far as motives towards actions go, one problem with a children's book (which is what the Harry Potter series is) is that in order for a pre-teen to teenage child to be the hero the adults have to be unintentionally incompetent or intentionally negligent. In addition, as a children's book not all of the details are explained. Therefore, you have a lot of actions that occur that don't make a lot of sense when looked at via adult eyes.

That's where fanfiction steps in where various authors decide to write their version of the story providing reasons/explanations of the gaps found in the books. Oh and one other point every single fanfiction is AU. If it wasn't then JKR and her lawyers would be really pissed because all you did was copy her stories.

So you say that Dumbledore was manipulative but well meaning. Well yesterday I agreed with you. Today however after a wonderful trip to the dentist I'm more inclined to think that Dumbledore is Evil.

And guess what? I can look at canon and find support for my belief today that Dumbledore is evil. Now where does that come from well how about when Dumbledore knew he was condemning Harry to ten dark and difficult years by placing him with his abusive relatives. (And if you don't think that what the Dursleys did was abuse I'd be very surprised.

Forcing a child to live in a storage space under the stairs is abuse. And can never be justified especially when you consider they had 2 unused bedrooms upstairs. Having Harry doing all or most of the chores from a young age while Dudley does none is abuse. Never allowing Harry to celebrate any holidays including his own birthday is abuse, punishing Harry by denying him food is abuse. Only feeding Harry scraps/small portions while Dudley can eat his fill is abuse (and is abusing Dudley as well).

And Dumbledore condoned it all because he knew Harry would have a hard time and didn't check in on him. Are you saying that Dumbledore couldn't spare 1 hour a year to look into how Harry was doing.

Now with those items from canon it is easy to arrive at the conclusion that Dumbledore is Evil. Of course it's also easy to look at those items and come up with the conclusion that Dumbledore was well meaning and horribly naive believing that no adult would do that to a child. And guess what, canon supports both because in many cases canon does not do an adequate job of explaining why or how certain actions occurred.

And that could be said for most of the tropes that have shown up in fanon. Though depending on the trope the amount of canon support may be much more tenuous.

When I read fanfics I don't expect canon so I have no problem with the fic taking one of the unexplained actions and coming up with their idea for why or how it happened. I will also say that my feelings on whether a trope is valid or not changes with my mood. As I said yesterday Dumbledore was a well meaning but naive good guy. Today he's an evil SOB. (Just love those dentist drills). Tomorrow I may be looking for an Evil Remus or a traitorous Hermione. All I know is that I will be able to find some level of support in canon for whatever I'm in the mood for because of how many questions/gaps are unexplained in the books.

*** Fair enough. You obviosly dedicated a good portion of your time to this, and I can't refute a single statement of it apart from morality being different between different people. I agree with most of it, since even killing can be a moral greay area, but I figure evil is evil when it acts to cause harm with malicious intent. That doesn't mean the person is evil, but the act itself is.

** Meh. People can like whichever characters they want. They're all fake and make-believe. Folks can separate fiction from reality. That's the best thing about fiction, you can take whatever you like from a piece and make it your own. Every form of art is open to interpretation and re-interpretationðŸ¤·

*** Fair enough. I don't mind the tropes. What I dislike is when people try to use the tropes as canon. I've been arguing with this other guy who's trying to convince me Molly is evil, and trying to get Harry's money. He's saying how Molly meeting Harry outside platform nine and three quarters was Molly's plan all along, and a bunch of other crap. I don't mind the trope, but it's not canon. Molly isn't trying to get Harry's money, or trying to set Harry up with Ginny outside what a normal mother trying to set up her little girl with this polite young boy anyway.

*** Because everyone knows that, I don't see the point of arguing something that everyone knows to be fact.

Yes, people like their conspiracy theories, but there's a very small part who says the things you are saying are true, excepting the Snape part, in which you are right, I understand if you make an AU where he's a good person. But canon!Snape? Yeah sorry, no. He's more complicated than good and evil in canon.

People mostly argue Ron is not a good friend to Harry(which is a lie) and that Hermione is a Mary Sue(in the movies, maybe, books, no.)

People also argue Dumbledore is not evil, but Machiavellian, which for some people is the same thing.

**** Hey, like I said. Just playing devil's advocate here. I agree with your view of Snape mostly, but i'd say that end of DH Snape isn't evil. He truly made up for it to a degree with his death. He's still pretty bloody douchy, but reformed to some degree. In the end, he died fighting for good, while that doesn't discount the bad he's done, it at least makes up for some of it to a degree.

** It's natural bias, basically. Whatever you think is the real interpretation of Rowling's work, someone else will hold the opposite as true and wholeheartedly believe it and have a dozen reasons for believing it, that's true of any issue or topic on anything.

Here, it's a bit of Rowling editing her work as she went (and apparently there being edits in the translations), a bit of her contradicting stuff all over the place, a bit of her inserting some weird opinions and decisions (Molly and her entire family do what they love, but apparently the Twins can't?, for example), a bit of the fact that this series is decades old now and came out over decades, and watching movies and reading fic is a lot easier than rereading the novels, a bit of Mandela Effect from Fanfiction Tropes, a bit of people's experiences priming them to interpret tihngs in certain ways (eg. people who were bullied by a teacher will be primed to focus on Snape picking on children rather than being necessarily strict over what is essentially a bomb making class), and a bit of people just getting emotional about things and confusing themselves over them (eg. getting sad over characters dying and subsequently glossing over their flaws, or getting angry at them and focusing on them), which all adds up to give people a lot of different interpretations on virtually everything in the books - and people in this fandom are really, really, really willing to fight over their interpretations of things in the books, so that sets it in their minds even more.

There are also people who don't see fanon as canon, they see it as better than canon.

TL:DR - /shrugs/ People be people, yo.

** Yeah this kills me. I want to engrave a heart onto this post.

To me:

Molly is just an overprotective mother who is kind of overbearing, but she's brave and a genuinely good person.

Ginny started as a young girl with a crush. She grew up.

Ron has inadequacy issues because he sees his siblings outclass him and it clouds his judgement. He just doesn't see what he's good at.

Dumbledore? No one is That Good at manipulation. People are unpredictable. Absolutely 0% of people are that good. That man is a giant pile of guilt mixed with secrets which he'd rather die than deal with.

Snape is a horrible person. He's done horrendous things. He pushed her away and got her killed. He spent the rest of his life making sure what she died for wasn't pointless.

Anyway those are my opinions and that's kind of the point of fanon. It changes every day. Some author will come out with an Excellent Fic that becomes well loved and people gravitate to those interpretations. Someone's head canon gets popular.

I just try my best to filter out the bashing fics.
