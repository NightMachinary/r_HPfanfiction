I have seen quite a few interpretations of that scene, ranging from canon rehash up to Snape setting events up so that Lupin would kill Harry while transformed. But I haven't seen one where Snape, with his substantial skill in the dark arts, decides that this would be the perfect opportunity to get back at Lupin for his part in the Marauders, helping Black (that's what snape believed) and him "stealing" the defence job. After all, he would be valiantly defending a group of innocent children against a bloodthirsty monster.

Preferably Harry centric with Sirius surviving. Please no slash, no Slytherin Harry, no unrelated bashing.


** What about killing Sirius for betraying Lily? Since he would think he did it. :o Nobody ever does this!

*** Snape almost definitely knows Sirius is innocent. Sirius says in the Shreiking Shack that the Death Eaters who are locked up in Azkaban mutter Peter Pettigrew's name almost as much as they do Voldemort's name.

If the Death Eaters locked up inside Azkaban know, then the ones outside know as well. And considering Snape's exalted position in the Inner Circle, he definitely knows.

**** Or more likely Voldemort took elementary precautions and did not tell one spy the identity of the other.

*** He was listening to the conversation for some time, the door squeaked way earlier in the Pettigrew encounter (Snape entering the hut under the cloak). So Snape should have known by then that Pettigrew was the traitor, if not even earlier from his Death Eater Days (Pettigrew was marked after all).

**** Is it canon that Pettigrew was marked? Seems like fanon. It also seems especially stupid even for Voldermort to mark his spy.

No matter how much Snape heard of Lupin and Black's conversation, he could have just dismissed it all as lies because he hates them.

***** Voldemort used Pettigrew's mark to call his followers to the Graveyard. Remember the "your other arm" scene?

****** That was later, when Pettigrew was useless as a spy (in his human form, anyway.) He may not have been marked yet in the first war.

******** Good question. It's just so stupid to mark a spy, and stupid for the Order not to notice, I'd like to believe it wasn't done until later. Since we don't see the actual marking process we could imagine it as as easy or difficult as we like, so either way.

********* One thing to remember is that the mark only grew stronger during GoF. It is quite possible that Pettigrew had it but it was too faint to be immediately visible during that encounter.

**** No, there is no way that he would have known Pettigrew was the traitor. He was knocked out long before that was revealed. The only thing he would have overheard would be about how the Marauders became Animagi and how Lupin had been concealing this for a year. No wonder that he reacted like he did.

As for earlier, not all Death Eaters knew each other (see Karkarof's trial) and considering that both Snape and Pettigrew were spies, it makes sense that Snape would not know about Pettigrew.

** It's just a one-shot, but this actually argues that he did that in canon and has a pretty good canon backing to make it sound true.

*** It was certainly suspicious that he didn't take the potion with him. And thanks for the link, but that's not quite what I was looking for. After all, nobody died and there was no juicy aftermath.

**** I personally think the 'he followed two minutes after they did and snuck in the shack when the door creaked' was far more suspicious. After all, told like that, there's no way he didn't see everything said the entire time, and almost all his dialogue there is stripped directly from the books. Pretty vitriolic stuff.

Cool. I'll poke around, see if I find anything else.
