I'm picturing a relationship similar to Harry Dresden and Lasciel. The Scar is still Tom Riddle, but a copy of Tom that works with Harry. And Harry neither likes nor trusts the Scar, but knows he needs every edge he can get.

Has it been done? Or perhaps I should ask, has it been done well?

Stories where the Scar acts briefly and then merges with Harry or with the rest of Voldemort don't count.

  The Horcrux in Harry's head wakes up and begins talking to Harry long before he's ever heard the name Voldemort. Philosopher's Stone AU. Warnings for some instances of child abuse. No pairings. COMPLETE.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] sort of falls under that category. It's a fem Harry story with a conscious Horcrux that talks to her. It gets progressively crazier, but it's very entertaining. linkffn(9911469)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** A few. I haven't read any save one where the Scar helps trick Voldemort into merging back together and the scarcrux basically takes over due to having Harry's influence of a more normal emotional range.

  AU one-shot set after sixth year. Harry confronts Voldemort with an alternate reason for some of the Dark's Lord's failures, and offers to help him out, for a price.

** Once read a story where due to the killing curse, another soul lived in Harry's body. And he felt sorry for the soul because he thought it's unfair the soul not to have a body. It's abandoned & probably its name was The Soul Within.
