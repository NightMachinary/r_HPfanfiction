The story is written from Tom's POV, from the moment a stranger comes and takes him from the orphanage. If anyone is interested and would care to give me some feedback, I would greatly appreciate it! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011/chapters/59074657][Ouroboros]]


** This is amazing! I found your fic when someone else posted it on here, a few weeks ago and I am hooked!

The concept is unique but that aside I love that Voldemort is kept very much in character, same as with Tom.

  Salazar Slytherin woke up in the body of a three year old boy with the most ridiculous head of black hair and a runic scar craved into his forehead. The last thing he recalled was dying. Now it is over 900 years in the future. What is a wizard to do?

  A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.

To murder tom riddle snr

only for young tom to ask why Tom riddle snr loved merope and then left her tom riddle snr would then explain the whole thing and young tom would be like fuck that sounds like a love potion and then refuse to kill his father

** I really love your story so far, especially the way you wrote Tom's mentality, how it develops, and the Toms' current relationship... but Im not looking forward to seeing it become a ship. Love is love even if it's not romance so... is that development necessary? Oh well, you can write it any way you want of course but it does put me on edge while reading lol. I'm sure you'll tackle it in the best way possible.
