In a lot of fics I've read with Fleur in it, other characters often talk about how Veela ensnare men and are evil yada yada. Is there any fics that actually do this well and in a believable way? I just think it would make an interesting story. Thanks!


** - linkffn(13170637) has Veelas almost killing Ron (who is the main character of the very AU fic)
- [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=9931566][Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel]] has the Death Eater Veela cooperating with Lucius Malfoy and killing somebody (no more spoilers than that)

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
