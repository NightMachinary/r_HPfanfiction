There's this one specific fanfic called "The 8th Year: Future". I'll leave the last link of it below however, when I click on the link an empty fanfiction page shows up. Not sure if the author deleted but does anyone know where else I can find it. It was a Harry Daphne fanfic, around 400k words and very well written.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to return to Hogwarts after the war to finish their schooling, they are expecting an easy year. Nobody expected McGonagall to push for inter-house unity and nobody expected the unlikely friendships and relationships that would result. Tells the tale of the trios final year at school, then goes beyond that.ORIGINALLY POSTED ON FANFICTION.NET UNDER NAME OF HOLZ9364. However, I am in the process of deleting that account.
