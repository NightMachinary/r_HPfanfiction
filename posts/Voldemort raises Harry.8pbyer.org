Any somewhat recent fics about Voldemort taking Harry the night he killed Lily and James? I know there are a couple of fics where he takes Harry from the dursley's or an orphanage (Like linkffn(12021325) ). Really anything with Voldemort and Harry in a father/son relationship is what I'd like.

I've seen a few of these fics around over the years. Most of them are old and abandoned. I searched the reddit to see if anyone else asked this question recently and came up with nothing related to what I'm looking for.

Please and thank you!

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  After Lily's death, her elder son was sent to live with the Dursleys. Abused for six years, Harry was rescued and adopted by Voldemort. He grows into his powers as the Dark Lord's heir at Durmstrang and, eventually, Hogwarts. Before the end, Harry has to face his biological family once more as the heir to the Dark Lord. Dark!Harry (adopted)Father!Voldemort

*** Is it any good? The summary isn't terribly compelling.

**** Pretty good considering how terrible this trope tends to be. No bashing, no OP genius Harry, Voldemort is not terribly OOC, a lot of the plot is original. Harry goes to Durmstrang, and it is similar to HP and the Boy Who Lived, but of course not as good

I also remembered another one, linkffn(12898342). It is by BrilliantLady and just as darkly adorable as Hermione Granger, Demonologist

  The first time Harry became a snake slithering through a forest, he thought he was dreaming. But he soon realised that in fact he was switching bodies with a magic snake. A very special snake who swiftly became his childhood friend -- for when he came back to Privet Drive after body-swapping things were always better for him. Harry & Voldemort friendship, pre-Hogwarts, Dark!Harry.
