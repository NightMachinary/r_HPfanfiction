Idk exactly what it would entail but imagine the gaang using wands or the golden trio bending. Or them meeting up lol. I feeling the stories r SUPER similar with the whole chosen one, 2 guys and a girl trio (until toph), the super bad guy tryna take over (ozai/voldy) and it would be funny to see words collide


** Yesssss also would be tickled to see more elemental magic in HP. Not necessarily "bending" per se, but something of the mysterious "old ways" pre-Hogwarts magic. I've been kicking around a little crossover idea where the Last Airbender meets the Last Air Priestess, but I haven't even quite decided which one lands in the other's world. Still in that stage where it's a hodgepodge of ideas and no plot, and I have plenty of other fics to finish first.
