Hey there !

I usually read Hermione centric fics, AU, paired with DE, older guys, etc. I've never read a OP Harry fic, I've never read any of the usual tropes, I'm curious about BBWL... You get the idea. Hit me with your favorites ! Hopefully the ones that do the tropes well enough, and without too much smut (a bit is enough, I can just skip forward if I want, but if it's what the whole story is about I won't like it). Or even ones that are completely AU, very different ! Also, fics where the MC reads the books make me curious.

Thank you, and stay home, stay safe !

EDIT : Aaaaand I messed up the title. your* favorites ;)


** Exile by Bennybear on ffnet

Draco Malfoy after the war. He is put on probation and banned from using magic for 5 years. This leads to a series of events where he must struggle to survive and blend into the muggle world while battling depression and PTSD.

There is not much of a plot, but it is a great character study of Draco and blends seamlessly into canon.

Since you read Hermione/older DE, I assume you ship WIKTT? How about some Snape centric stuff? I like Blood Magic by Gateway Girl and Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd (both on ao3). These are Snape-is-Harry's biological father fics and Snape and Harry must figure out how to deal with that.

*** I love Hermione/Snape, but now I almost exclusively read stories where she's an adult when they meet again after the war and romance develops from there, I don't like it when she's barely 18 etc. I've never read any of the fics you listed but they sound very interesting, thanks a lot !!

**** Could you rec me some of your favs?

WIKTT is something I've been telling myself to get into, but the last time I ventured into this pairing most of the stuff I found was best forgotten, to put it mildly.
