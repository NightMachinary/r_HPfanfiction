Every female child of an Evans has a flower name and it kinds of annoys me to see so many Harriets or so. What about you?


** By every you are talking about the two named in the series? A couple naming their kids after a theme doesn't make it some sort of ling running tradition.

Plus the whole 'boys named after father girls after mother's thing isn't really that realistic. Honestly, I'd say it is more likely naming/heritage is more important to one side of the couple than the other, rather than split by gender.

*** I atleast take it as a headcanon, like come on, all the Blacks I know of are named after stars

Orion, Sirius, Bellatrix, Narcissa, Cassiopeia, Arcturus, Regulus. I think all of those are stars or star constellations

So why not have some other families do the same

**** Because the naming theme in the wizarding families is clearly a thing and seems to tie into the whole 'different culture' thing?

And Lily was a muggleborn, soooo?

***** And many mundane families have naming conventions as well so it is quite feasible. IRL as well. My middle name is my father's, his middle name is his father's etc.

***** Lily being muggleborn does not matter at all, even my name is similar, every male born in my family has the same middle name, and my name is the same as one of my ancestors, I don't see why a theme can't be on the first names.

** 1. There's no indication that there's an inter-generational Evans family tradition of flower names, as opposed to Lily and Petunia's parents having that specific preference (and keep in mind that children often deliberately depart from their parents' naming preferences due to changes in naming fashion between generations).

2. Even if there was an Evans naming tradition, the child of James and Lily is a Potter, not an Evans. So you wouldn't necessarily expect the Evans tradition to be continued.

3. For me, the best evidence of James and Lily's naming preferences is Harry himself, the only canonical example we have of the kind of names they like. So I believe that the name of a female Harry should reflect the same naming preferences as are exhibited in Harry's name.

- Violet - another common floral name, with added bonus irony of it also being a type of /petunia/.

** It could make sense to do so. For instance I remember reading several fics that had the granger family use the middle name Jean for the first born girls in tribute to some long ago matriarch of the family. I've seen other fics where the middle names for the first born son is his father's and the second born is the grandfather (hence Sirius Orion and Regulus Arcturus).

Which could be another reason why so many people believed that James was Dorea and Charlus' son prior to JKR putting out on Pottermore the Fleamont and Euphemia names. Where Fleamont's father is named Henry (which Harry is considered a nickname for).

Also IRL, I know lots of couples where the father has the ultimate veto power for the son's name, and the wife has the ultimate veto power for the daughter's name. So even though Lily is a muggleborn it is quite possible that there is a naming convention for girls in her family. Which would then make sense that she names the fem!harry with a flower name.

And even though James is a pureblood I could see him letting lily name any girls simply due to how hard he chased after her. Eg he's so besotted he'd do anything to make her happy. Plus I believe there would be a bigger likelihood of a naming convention for males in James family.

Well you could go with any bright flower so Iris, Tulip, Rose etc

** I've seen many flower themed choices in fics (Rose one of the most favored) but personally I prefer Harriet as I don't have to get used to new name for main character. Harriet is close enough to Harry to be easily interchangeable (tho shortening if to Harrie isn't my favourite).

Flower themed naming of girls don't seem to belong to only one family: we have Narcissa Malfoy (whose family favours mostly astrology themed names), Poppy Pomphrey, Pansy Parkinson, Daphne & Astoria Greengrass, Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, Fleur Delacour, Rose Weasley, Delphini. It almost seems the wizards like to have pretty wall-flowers on their hand so they name their daughters so.

I think James and Lily could name their daughter flower-like for different reasons - Lily for sentimentality sake due to her estranged sister Petunia, James just because it's something that many purebloods do and he is very used to it.

** Heather is popular, as people seem to be stuck on the idea that her name still needs to start with H.

A trans Harry picking her own name might go with Aster, as it would honor his godfather as well (Aster is a flower but means "star").
