Every now and then I remember this fic, search for it, and fail. Hoping I can get some help!

Features Snape / OC character, a 7th year Hogwarts student I believe. She's the daughter of someone important? For some reason she has to go undercover and hide for the summer, and Snape is in charge of escorting her around the country and hiding her from bad guys.

This story was at least 60 chapters long, not completed at the time, and was soooo good. Very well reviewed. Towards the end it kept getting taken down off ff.net for some reason, and finally got taken down for good for reasons I could never figure out. The author never put it back up (on that site, that I know of.)

I know this is vague, I can't remember many details. Just figured I would try and see if it sparked a memory with anyone. It was just one of those stories that hit me right in my formative teen years and I've always wondered how it was supposed to end!


** I remember reading a story like this. If I see it again, I'll send you a link.

** This should help narrow down your search somewhat.
