Wondering whether there's a story where James Potter takes down Voldemort on that Halloween?


** Maybe a story where James Potter didn't take down Voldemort on that Halloween because, as the author revealed in the review section, Voldemort never came to Godric's Hollow on that Halloween night. It's WIP with weekly updates.

Summary: London 2002. They have no past, only dreams. They are students (Ginny Smith & Mione Granger) and musicians (Lee & Harry Jordan) finding their way in a gritty GenX world. When a voice rises from a dark Camden Town stage, a quest begins for what has been lost, and what may yet be found.
