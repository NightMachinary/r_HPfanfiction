I'm interested in fics where Hermione ends up in a time when the marauders are already out of Hogwarts (like 1980) or where Tom Riddle has already graduated and she still meets them. I'm kind of sick of the time travel fics where the setting is Hogwarts.


** Have you read "One Hundred and Sixty Nine" already?

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** My favorite fic. Very refreshing to read a story where all the characters are adults.

**** Having only adult characters also avoids the pitfalls inherent in trying to redo Hogwarts without following the stations of canon, and trying to have the kids have adventures without making the adults useless for letting the kids endanger themselves.
