I'm a dunce and I feel as if I've read every single good war fic.

Preferably within the second war, and with a squeeze more of desperation and a dash of barbarism, but anything works really.

Thanks in advance lads and ladies.

It's a Harry-fights-in-1st-war fic, but you asked for epic battles and imo this one takes the cake. The Voldemort vs Harry ones are absolutely spectacular.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

I think I have some decent ones, if you think they could be better let me know how. If you want to spoil the plot, there's a battle in chapter 10, and another post-training montage in the second half of chapter 24.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.
