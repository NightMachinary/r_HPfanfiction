:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Was reading some stuff today and had a memory flash of a fic where Harry is hidden away in a brothel and made to experiment with the ladies there until the madam was satisfied with his performance. I think its to keep him safe from Voldermort or Dumbledore or both.


** Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Harem: The Rewrite

It's to keep him safe from Voldemort and condition him to be Dumbledore's heir.

I'm not linking it.

*** Voldemort's negative emotions hurt Harry, and Harry's positive emotions hurt Voldemort? I don't think it's common in fics, but I've seen it a few times.

** There's a short called Winter Solace by jon3776 that has the Golden trio take refuge in a Parisienne brothel. That's the only story that I have read that even comes close to the OP's request.
