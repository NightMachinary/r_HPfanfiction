** I've tried writing a zombie story before in the HP universe and found one problem with it. Zombies are absolutely fucking useless against magic. Zombies work when people have limited ressources like bullets, water and food. None of this is limited for wizards. Wizards could shoot zombies day in and out and even if its just one, a nicely placed fiendfyre does the job.

Also, Harry could just bait the walkers and lure them into traps as a day-job.

As much as I like the general idea, I think it won't work without brute forcing the story to do what you want it to do.

*** I remember reading a (now abandoned) Last of Us crossover where Harry, in his escape from a ravaged London, lost his wand. The story picks up some months after that; a starving, emaciated Harry foraging for food in a shopping mall, unable to use magic to any real extent and forced to use muggle methods to survive.

Also, he's fourteen in this fic, so he'd only had 3 years of hogwarts training.

Gimme a sec, I'll find the fic

I think this fic fixes the problems you brought up.

** If you want Walking Dead style zombies, and magic, you can't use the Harry Potter style magic. A zombie apocalypse is just a nuisance if you have infinite access to magical offensive spell that dwarfs most muggle firepower, and you can teleport, multiply amount of food, conjure water, repair walls or barricades with a flick of your wrist.. You either need to up the zombies to such a level they aren't zombies, because you can't counter magic without intelligence, or you need to take away the magic. And if you do, why have wizards at all?

It's a complex situation that's very hard to solve.

** Perhaps it would ramp up the issue if Harry has no idea of any powers he has over the dead, and he's stuck in Walking Deadland without a wand, broom or any other magic items he normally would use to handle the situation. /Maybe/ he has some notion of the wandless tricks he might attempt, but the real problem is that he keeps running and they keep following and he has to sleep sometime.

It would only be after a few story arcs worth of tension between him and other survivors that the situation would come to a head. Harry, trapped and desperate, stands forth and commands them to stop with all the faith he has in himself as a wizard.

That's when they all stop and kneel before him. Everyone else turns to gawk at him, wondering how many need not have died if Harry had simply realized this sooner.

Of course, the real challenge is to decide 'what happens next?'
