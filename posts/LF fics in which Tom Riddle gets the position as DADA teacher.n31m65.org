I was wondering, if there are any fics with Tom Riddle as a teacher. Could be any Era but preferably with a Tom x Bellatrix pairing and no slash.

Thanks in advance!

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)
