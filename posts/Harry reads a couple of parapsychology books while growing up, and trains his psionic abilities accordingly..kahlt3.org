Telekinesis? Check. Telepathy and empathy? Check. Minor precognitive ability (explains his Quidditch skills)? Check. Harry tries the various exercises and "experiments" recorded in the book and passes all of them. Having proved to himself that he possesses these abilities, he manages to write letters to a few noted parapsychologists, asking for hypothetical exercises that a person proved to have these abilities could train their abilities with.
