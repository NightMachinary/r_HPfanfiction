Saw a comment in the television subreddit about favourite episode titles for TV shows and was wondering what was everyone's favourite chapter titles for Harry Potter fanfics, or what your preferences are for them. Do you just use "Chapter 1" etc, a different numbering system like Roman Numerals or are you more inventive? Shameless plug for my fic linkffn(12348853) where I use a mixture of plot related titles like "Down in the Dark Where the Dead Men" being the title of Chapter 5, movie titles that have thematic links to the plot, like "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", but more recently as the story progresses I've found myself using the titles of classic rock songs, with Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?" being the title of my fic and including song names that range The Zombies' "Remember You" to the Rolling Stones' "She's A Rainbow". It helps that it's a massively AU so I can put that stuff in there with it actually making sense in regards to the plot, but I've actually tried to put effort in in making sure that I don't reference anything that takes place after 1994-1995 where my fic is set.

Feel free to share your own as well as recommending others.


** I just use numbers since I don't feel like I'm creative enough to create a chapter title that isn't a spoiler for the chapter.

** In Like a Red Headed Stepchild each chapter title contains a pun or joke that ties in with the rest of the chapter. The best one in my opinion is Chapter 4, which is titled Chapter 3: Maths are Hard. The joke is that Mrs. Weasley cannot count all of her children accurately and keeps thinking Harry is one of them.

In the rest of my stories I usually pick a title that reflects the theme that ties the chapter together or just a nice quote.

** I don't write fics, but I don't generally really read or notice chapter titles so it doesn't matter to me how they are titled.

** In darkness ascendant, each title is a 3/4 letter acronym(though i make no mention in story of this) that is relevant to the chapter and makes a sentence of the chapter titles. In trek to the stars, the chapter's are numbered. In most stories I do, chapters are titled relevantly to their subplot.

** Mine are mostly random. I am so bad at naming chapters, that occasionally I'll just put "No Title", and it annoys me every time.

One of my most common styles of naming chapters is always "something AND something", or "this AND that". For example... "Discussions and Theories".

But yeah, aside from using AND, they're mostly just random, and have never been thematic, like yours OP. It is one of my worst peeves in my own writing, titling chapters...

** I title my chapters with some sort of reference to events in the chapter, but that's more for my own benefit so I can remember what happens in it. I do have one story where all the titles are phrases from 'Paradise Lost'. Trying to be clever, I suppose. I don't think many people noticed. Or perhaps they were too polite to call me out on my pretentiousness.

Favourite title . . . probably 'Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know'. Or maybe that's just my favourite chapter. Dunno really.

** 0-800 Rent a Hero did chapter titles pretty well, they continued the joke in the title whilst still being relevant to the chapters content.

** I'm terrible at coming up with titles in general. Only one of my stories has what I consider to be a cool title. My longest fic has a very generic title (though the sequel's title is better). I grouped chapters by three so I only needed a title once every three chapters. I tried to come up with titles that weren't totally disconnected from the chapter's content, but wouldn't be gigantic spoilers.

On principle, I harbor a hatred for writers who come up with cool titles.

** As a reader I like plot-related chapter titles, obscure enough that it doesn't give anything away before reading the chapter, but related enough that if I wanted to re-read specific parts of that fic it would be easy to find! Bonus points if the title is humorous in some way :)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter may not be The Boy Who Lived, but the world isn't going to save itself, and it sure as hell could use all the help it needs, especially if Voldemort gets his hands on an ancient weapon from the Department of Mysteries that would guarantee his victory if he is allowed to return. Only this time, Harry may need help of his own - from some rather unorthodox allies.

** I like the CCR titles!

In most of my stories I just use the place in which the story begins.

And because I like stories beginng with "Harry Potter and ..." as well as episode titles like "Chuck vs. ..."

** Depends on the story, really. Some lend themselves easily to it or require the added theme/mood given by a chapter title. Others don't.

** Since I work on a bunch of different things at the same time, I use a rather complex naming scheme:

#+begin_example
  [Story Title Acronym][Arc Number].[Chapter Number] - [Specific Title]
#+end_example

For example, the latest chapter I was working on was =SVSL01.07 - Burning Sunshine=. Or, when not condensed: "Stealing Victory at the Speed of Lightning, Arc 1, Chapter 7: Burning Sunshine."

The specific titles I use also tend to follow a pattern. Usually they're one or two word descriptive phrases, but SVSL uses =[Verb ending in -ing] [Weather Phenomenon]= as its titles.
