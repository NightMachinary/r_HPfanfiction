As the title say, they can friends, Rivals, competitors, etc. I'm baffled that Authors can justify a plot where Harry falls in love with Riddle, but rarely write a fiction where there is no romance between them.

Fem!harry, fem!Riddle, Time-travel, etc. I don't really care, just no High School, College or no-Magic AU.

Thank in advance.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

*** I don't know why but I read a lot of fictions of The Carnivorous Muffin, and yeah I read them, they are well written but at the end I'm kinda like "meh".

October, all the ones about Lilly and Wizard Lenin, and it's, I don't know, not interesting? combining God like characters and absurdism I don't really like it, I don't see the point honestly.

  Harry ends up back in time on the steps of Wool's Orphanage. Raised in institutional squalor with Tom Riddle, he has a very different attitude toward magic, Hogwarts, and friendships. dark!harry, brotp!tomarry. On Hiatus. Thinking of abandoning. Just isn't fun to write.

** I can't recall the fic or author, but I remember a series where harry goes back in time and instead of killing a young Riddle like he originally planned, he adopts him.

The last part I remember had Tom being the minister of magic.
