Any fanfics where Harry (preferably fem!harry) rejects the name of Potter? Or goes by the surname ‘Evans' because they realise that James or Nobility is bull? (F/F or gen preferred)


** Why would Harry realise James is dumb???

James literally died to buy time for Lily and Harry.

** Only one I can think of off the top of my head is The Silent World of Cassandra Evans, and in that one she's the bastard child of James and Lily because it's an AU world where they never married.

** Well, no, but the name ‘harry evans' makes me think of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10185908/1/The-Mill]]).

It's not at all what you're looking for, but I thought I'd link it anyways. Enjoy (or don't).

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Harry goes by the name Evans when he goes to school incognito. It's only for a short timespan though but the rest is great too.

The scene where Hermione finds out who he is is one of my favorites. "did you just say muggle?"

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
