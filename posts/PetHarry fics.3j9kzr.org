** oh okay, so he's not an /actual/ pet

I was getting very confused why having harry as an owl would be a slash magnet

EDIT: Btw, is anyone already working in a fic where Harry is an owl, or should I start?

*** There are a few fics like this. Where Harry is an accidental animagus when he's young, and then stays as an animal and becomes someones pet. That is what I thought this post was about.

***** Growing up Kneazle I think. There is also one where he's a snake and is Hermiones pet, its a Hermione story and isn't really about Harry at all. Also there The Accidental Animagus, which is similar, except he isn't a pet, he just lives as a cat for a few weeks.

I'm pretty sure I've read another but I can't think of it.

** I read a one-shot once where Luna met Harry at the zoo pre-Hogwarts and says to Xeno: "Daddy look! A Parselmouth, can I keep him?" or something along those lines.

The one-shot didn't go any further than the zoo scene but I think it would be interesting to see one where Harry is kept imprisoned by the Lovegoods while they considered him their pet Parselmouth.

** The only one I can think of that is close to this is a really old snarry fic where Harry is granted a magical gift of transformation. He ends up a cat, and while exploring Hogwarts, starts spending lots of time in the dungeons and gets to know Snape. It's really old, and I read it so long ago that I can't remember at what point it diverges from canon (GoF or OotP), or if it is complete. I do remember that it is several "books" long. Here's a link to most of it: [[http://www.intertexius.com/abp.htm#0][A Bittersweet Potion by Alchemia Dent & Bugland]]
