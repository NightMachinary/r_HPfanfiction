** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486][the lost generation]] linkao3(1110486) takes a while to get to Remus/Sirius stuff, but it's worth the read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]] has several Remus/Sirius fics; my favorite is probably [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852][They're Hiding Inside Me]] linkao3(12540852).

  The Marauders era at Hogwarts, Voldemort's rise to power and the subsequent war, family loyalties and dishonour, and the struggles of friendship in a difficult time.Ch. 101: The boys try to one-up each other. It doesn't go to plan, but Remus doesn't care.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! COMPLETE!WINNER of two 2018 Marauders Medals Awards:- Best Characterisation of Remus- Best Characterisation of James2017 Marauders Medal Awards:- Best Work in Progress
