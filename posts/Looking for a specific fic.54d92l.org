Someone said something about it in another thread, but they didn't know the name

They said that Harry apparently absorbed the philosophers stone, and it helped him stay alive during the confrontation with the Basilisk.

Anyone know what this is called?


** No, but something similar happens at the climax of linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice by murkybluematter).

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.
