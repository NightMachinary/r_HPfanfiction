This has been driving me insane for days. Forever ago I read a really good harry potter fanfic that I can only remember vague details of at this point. Basically gryffindor house has it's own court system (similar to how many fanfics have the slytherin system set up) and harry is the king of gryffindor. They act all stupid and brave but in reality are crafty and cunning. I think even mcgonagall was in on it. For some reason draco and a few other slytherin find out and that's as much as I can remember. Please help!


** linkffn(Holding Court)

This might be what you're looking for. I don't recall if it had them acting stupid and all because I couldn't make it past the pretentiousness but it has a very clear court system from the start.
