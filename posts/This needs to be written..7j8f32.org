** Which thing? Charlie's campaign for dragon rights, the conversation where Ron goes 'oh, yeah, we did that a while ago', or the one where Ron earns a top-level Ministry position, saves dragons from despair, invents the world's finest prank, discovers a cure for a formerly-unbreakable curse, and somehow marries Harry, all by accident?

Maybe something like this. A curse has been running over the British Isles since thousands of years, that leads to the rise of one Dark Lord after another. Ron just slips on whatever banana peel you'll feel like throwing his way, and somehow casually break the curse.\\
He instantly becomes a legend amongst curse breakers but, since he's only interested in Chess and Quidditch, the curse breaker world is a small world, and Ron doesn't read their publications, he just never learns about his new fame.

** "Accidental awesome brother Ron" sounds like an amazing concept for a crack fic.

Bill - wanted so badly to go on adventures in Hogwarts, but ended up in the middle of a peaceful time where nothing bad ever really happened. Ron goes to school and, in his first year, helps thwart a plot to steal the Philosopher's Stone by doing a goddamn dungeon run.

Charlie - Loves loves loves magical creatures in general, but always wanted to see the creatures in the Forbidden Forest up close. Heard rumours about Acromantulae, but never really got to explore the Forest before Hagrid caught on. Second year rolls around and what does his brother do? He fucking runs into them. /By accident/.

Percy - always wanted to be Gryffindor's keeper, but was never good enough for Ollie Wood's taste. Instilled with a burning desire to pull one over the Slytherins he knows will make his career hell. He just wants to be the winner for once before losing becomes his main occupation. Ron, who's a complete shambles when playing for a crowd, pulls one over the Malfoy scion, makes it to Keeper and somehow continuously seems to come out on top where the Slytherins are concerned.

Fred, George: Getting detention /before/ the end of the Sorting is supposed to be impossible and was thus their secret goal throughout their Hogwarts careers. Or it was until their bumbling little brother managed it whilst trying to fly to Hogwarts in a flying car. He wasn't even trying, which just made them more jealous.

Ginny: When she was little, spending time and going on adventures with Harry Potter. When she's all grown up, going on adventures with Harry Potter that don't end in accidental pregnancy.

**** Even so, they don't deserve to be locked in a vault, and abused like mindless beasts and monsters. We don't abuse cattle, why should wizards dragons? A dragon is a strong, fiery, passionate creature. It makes sense that their flesh and bones are perfect for magical wands, potions, and other artifacts.
