** I read one did long ago that Harry actually completely fried his wand when he drove the dementors away from Sirius and it was basically an inert stick from that point forward. Naturally this was the excuse for sudden mastery of wandless magic and a prelude to dual casting.

***** Yes. Which on it's own isn't all that bad. But it is literally introduced by having Hermiones parents tell Harry that Hermione stole her mothers trashy dime novels to read and that he should be her dominant pirate lover to help her feel like she is repaying her life debt.

******* I just found it again to see just how bad it was. I was planning on commenting some quotes, but there is just too much. In chapter 5, the day after meeting Harry for the first time, Hermiones dad explains in detail that he and his wife roleplay in the bedroom, invving costumes, chains, wax, leather that Hermione has walked in on her mom in a maid's dress bent over a table when she was younger, that hermione stole her moms dime novels at age 8 and asked what throbbing manliness meant, and more. All in the space of about 14 paragraphs.

All of this because apparently the life debt owed by Hermione for Harry saving her life at 11 combined with her guilt in hurting Harry by destroying the Horcrux in his head means that she is magically compelled to "make things up to Harry" and that she needs to be "punished" satisfy magic. Lupin and Tonks figure this out, explain it to the Grangers, and the Grangers approach a fifteen year old boy they hardly know and ask him to dominate their daughter in bed.

  Harry is left with the Dursleys just after his godfather had died. One thing leads to the other and Harry is fed up with being a puppet. He breaks free and finds help. And boy, does he start rocking the boat.
