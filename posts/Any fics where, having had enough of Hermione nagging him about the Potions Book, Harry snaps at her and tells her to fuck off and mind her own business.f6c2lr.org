**** Depends. Words like that are not spoken in a vacuum. For Harry to have said them, something must have been different about Harry, about Hermione, and/or about the history and the dynamic of their relationship.

Since people who write scenes like that tend not to be fans of Hermione^{1}---or at the very least want to see her put her in her place---there is a very high probability that any fic that features such a scene will also bash her before, during, and/or after that particular scene.

I mean, would /you/ want to be in a class with someone doing that sort of shit?

Yes, it works for him, but Harry really shouldn't be encouraged to chop and dice random ingredients according to some sketchy old margin jotnotes when he knows neither the former owner nor enough about potions theory.

edit: It's odd how some people can't accept that Hermione being horribly, annoyingly nosy and Harry being dangerously stupid in his desire to take shortcuts are not, in fact, mutually exclusive. Too close to home?

*** Its also blatantly obvious that Hermione only wants Harry to get rid of it becaues it makes potions turn out better than the regular text books. Harry can barely function as a normal human being in the best of times, he's not exactly known for being smart and rational about things like that text book. Hermione should've told him to have a teacher go through it, or help Harry test some things in it. Instead, she tells him to get rid of it entirely.

**** Yes, because it's also basically a cheatsheet, and no actual hard-working student wants to see someone else surpass them because they are, effectively, cheating. What would an honest student do with a cheatsheet? Destroy it. Do you support academic dishonesty?

Plus, once again, it's not like Harry actually understands any of the concepts; while everyone else is figuring things out, he's out there scoring at the top when he really doesn't deserve it. He doesn't bother trying, either, and is happy to just muddle on through until it either blows up or he gets to his exams and realises he doesn't know a thing without the special modded text.

Sure, Hermione went about it in a bad way and was awfully jealous. But to act like Harry's in the right for 1) using someone's scribbled margin notes that could endanger everyone in a subject that's very dangerous when screwed up just because he's lazy, and then 2) continuing to use it even though it's a cheatsheet and dishonest, is really something.

I love Hermione, but the whole potions book thing drove me crazy. Part of it was because she was worried that the book wasn't that good in potions, but when it turned out it was, she wanted to get rid of it because she hated that Harry was better at a class other than Defence.

In this case, there's none of the theory behind it - it's just a bunch of scribbled notes/instructions that say *what* to do, but not *why*. But it is in potions, where we don't see them do that in canon at all - however, if we assume that they did get some understanding of the theoretical parts of potions during their classes/years at Hogwarts, the Prince's book is certainly less explained.

I think the more important note/clarification towards your last point is Harry being better than her at Potions /without earning it/. She's (at least IIRC) not mad about him being better than her at Defence, because he's worked hard at it. But something like the Prince's book /is/ cheating, IMO.

Harry doesn't bother to even consider thinking about the showing, really; he just does what it says and succeeds, and doesn't think about any of the theory behind it. That's as much of a cheat sheet as you can possibly get for a practical class.

I actually like Harry better than Hermione, but I think there are rational explanations for Hermione's behaviour. Yes, she was being overly nosy and unpleasant about it all. However, Harry is cheating his way to success here, so her being unable to stand him showing her up due to cheating seems perfectly logical.

Everything Ginny and Ron own is second hand and I would imagine have student notes in there somewhere. Hermione's not complaining about those, she's whining because Harry's taking what she considers shortcuts and it's working.

Harry has a used textbook and he's trusting the previous owner knew what they were talking about. And really, after the first potion it readily apparent they did. And with hindsight, it's literally a teacher's edition. Which, I guess is cheating. Hermione was right. All Hail the Great Bushy One!

**** As far as I'm aware, she doesn't (?), but I haven't read that book in quite a while, so I'm not a good source, lmao. However, I was also kind of addressing the issue from a reader's perspective, because so many people seem to look at the situation and go, "wow, Hermione's being such a bitch, Harry should've just told her to fuck off!" without really giving it any thought. From an outside perspective, it should be possible to see that Harry just leaps into it and trusts this random old book -- even though it's got instructions that aren't just slightly different, but /really/ different -- for no good reason, then acts like there's no problem at all.

As for the Weasleys -- yes, I suppose that would probably be true? However, I don't think it'd be nearly the same thing as Snape's book. I think it'd be reasonable to assume that the Weasley notes would be more along the lines of things to look out for/be careful about, and not completely modded potion recipes and instructions that simplify hard potions (Draught of Living Death, which Hermione couldn't make, despite making Polyjuice in 2nd year) to the point where even Harry (a mediocre potioneer) can make them. Not everyone has Snape's talent at & interest in potions.

  Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.

  ‘Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?' she asked.

  [...]

  ‘So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?'

  ‘Why does it matter if it's handwritten?' said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the question.

  ‘Because it's probably not Ministry of Magic-approved,' said Hermione. ‘And also,' she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, ‘because I'm starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.'

  [...]

  ‘That was different,' he said robustly. ‘They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don't like the Prince, Hermione,' he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, ‘because he's better than you at Potions --'

  ‘It's got nothing to do with that!' said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. ‘I just think it's very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don't even know what they're for, and stop talking about “the Prince” as if it's his title, I bet it's just a stupid nickname and it doesn't seem as though he was a very nice person to me!'

By having her doing the research of Knowledge for him, Harry didn't need to do it himself because he expects her to have the answer for him in a platter. Not something I would have liked to see in the hero of the story.

How is it leaking knowledge if the teachers are literally picking on her to answer? There are multiple scenes in canon where she's waving her arm about and a teacher actually ignores her. If anyone else is competent enough, they can raise their arms and try to answer as well. If they're not competent enough, they have only themselves to blame.

You can't just blame Hermione for all the classroom's woes if 1) the teachers choose her to answer, or 2) nobody else bothers to even try.

edit: Also, the point of being /taught/ is literally to have someone else teach things to you. It doesn't necessitate having to learn all of the material yourself; if that was necessary, why would they go to class to have things explained to them? They're in a school. With classrooms. If everyone were an autodidact, then teachers would be out of a job.

It's fascinating that you would operate your class on some sort of reverse-merit system where the capable are to be punished despite all reason, but fortunately, Harry Potter's classroom system and most real-life classrooms don't work in such an inane way.

And if I let one person answer all the question, others would not be punished for their lack of work. I recall that she interrupted Professor Snape when he was asking Harry some question on ingredients and Hogwarts Potion Curriculum in the first potion class.

You may believe that Harry didn't deserve it but he didn't even open the books before coming to school. In my class students are to at least read the books of the year in advance. The teacher role is to explain the notions that are hard to understand not to read the book material that the students should have done. And if a student can't answer one question by lack of knowledge Deduction is still possible.

And the episode of Snape potion book does tell us that she cannot support the books being wrong. She lack the capacity to thinking critically and going behind the Knowledge. Even if Harry was wrong to not search to understand the why .

******* So you're saying you wouldn't encourage merit or excellence unless you literally had no other choice? And people who want to contribute more will have to just...wait in the wings until the teacher arbitrarily deems their participation to be an acceptable last resort?

That's positively ridiculous. Are you actively trying to kill off all desire to learn and participate? I hope you're not really a teacher and all this "my class" content is internet posturing.

Let's say that your assumption that all schools require students to read the full textbook before their classes is true (even though it isn't true in HP, btw; Hermione reading through all of hers is just to emphasize that she's a SWOT). You still don't need to punish students for their lack of work ethic via in-class questions, because, surprise, practical lessons and homework and exams exist in HP...and also in real life! A teacher cannot possibly get a decent margin of most of their students' progress just by asking one or four questions to everyone in class. They wouldn't even be able to ask enough questions for all the students.

And frankly, your argument about punishment for lack of knowledge for questions is asinine. Let me spell it out for you: if you ask the whole class a question, and they know that they'll be punished (with House Point deductions, etc.) if they answer incorrectly, nobody who isn't sure of themselves will bother putting their hands up and answering (if you don't ask them directly, like Snape did). Even if they don't get punished, they'll still look silly, and won't be rewarded with House Points unless they answer /correctly/. All of that is incentive for them to leave the questions to the smarter students, because House Points are serious business in Hogwarts. Unless you think students have somehow all become gluttons for punishment?

So then you either have to ask all your questions individually (i.e. be Snape), or you have to accept that some people will answer far more questions than others if you address the whole class, because some people are more enthusiastic about learning than others. And if they answer more questions because /you literally pick them to answer them/, then what, are you going to punish them for /your/ choices? Friendly reminder, you said this:

#+begin_quote
  She would have received multiple detentions in my class and lost many points.
#+end_quote

But most of Hermione's answers were, once again, because she was picked by the teacher after she raised her hand. Do you give out detentions for your own flawed judgement? How ludicrous.

Yes, an exception is when Hermione interrupted Snape during the first lesson when he was /actively targeting/ Harry in order to /embarrass and mock/ him. Is that supposed to reflect poorly on Hermione, when Snape was being purposefully malicious? Snape wasn't trying to make Harry "learn", and he wasn't punishing Harry for some greater cause. Are you really using Snape as your ideal instructor? Snape, probably the worst non-DADA core teacher in canon? That's fantastically silly.

Do you punish students for all of your mistakes to try and "control their eagerness"? Have you considered reflecting on yourself instead?

Maybe, just maybe, if teachers didn't want Hermione to answer, they wouldn't pick her!

#+begin_quote
  I doubt that I would have the patience to support her eagerness for very long.
#+end_quote

By...gradually punishing her more and more and then eventually giving her detentions because she...wants to learn and is answering questions when /teachers/ choose her? You're crazy, absolutely crazy.

Harry Potter and Tom Riddle are two entirely different people. Different people react to events differently. Why does Harry have to try to "win" over these things because /you/ would do it if you were Harry? You're /not/ Harry, books aren't real, and you can't just say "because /I/ would do something, Harry would too!" Why does Harry have to make an effort in a Potions class to show up Snape just because /you/ would? Good for you, but once again: you are not Harry Potter.

Also...you're using Tom Riddle (canonically a sociopath/psychopath that becomes a crazed mass murderer) and Snape (canonically a bitter, vengeful man that's nearly 40 targeting and bullying 11-year-olds because he hated their parents) as "good" examples. Riddle and Snape are blatantly neurotic in canon, and yet they're your "ideals for normal behaviour Harry should aspire to"? Absolutely insane of you.

************ And yet Tom Riddle was the best very top student Hogwarts has seen. His equal should strive to be the same, because let's say it Harry being Tom equal is so laughable that we could die of it. Snape has redeeming qualities even as teacher (Longbottom case excluded).

************* Why should he?

Harry doesn't know that he's meant to be Tom's equal until he hears the prophecy in his fifth year. Not everyone has lofty goals to be the best and brightest. And if you want someone to be the best and brightest, well, isn't there Hermione?

Oh wait, you hate her so she's not acceptable, lol. It's fine if Harry tries to be the best because of some prophecy, but if Hermione does it, she should get detentions for being too eager? Are you listening to yourself?

Because, yknow, if Harry was the best student, he would /also/ be answering all the questions, because that's how you get the image of being the best student.

I'm sorry you actually approve of a teacher that blatantly bullies an 11-year-old-child that was habitually abused at home and lived in a cupboard when he's at the tender age of nearly 40, but that's an issue with your own moral compass, not mine.

*************** Do you really think Tom Riddle, who wanted to be the best and unsurpassed, never answered questions in class?

That's a flimsy excuse for Snape. You can also argue that because he was pretending to be a good guy, he would need to treat all the students decently to really pretend to be "reformed". He was an arse to Harry because he wanted to be, not for some great plot or other.

**************** Severus Snape is a very ambiguous and complex character that has very human flaws. It is not an surprise that J K Rowling needed to tell Alan Rickman the secret behind the always for him to play him so well. Rowling agrees that Snape will always be too ‘grey' to truly like, saying in one tweet, ‘You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world.'

******* I didn't see your edit, so I'll address it here. Snape's potion book is the regular equivalent of some guy writing down random chemistry reagent substitutions and other junk in an old chemistry lab manual. Would anyone rational trust that? No. Even if it's right once or twice, it's still potentially dangerous, especially if you're like Harry and you don't bother looking up the reactions behind it all.

Potions is a subject where mistakes can create noxious gas, land kids in the hospital wing, and melt through floors. The potions themselves can also have dangerous qualities. Sure, Hermione's a nag and annoying and probably jealous about it all, but Harry is a kid with minimal knowledge of the theory following random modded instructions...and you think he's right?

***** For answering the question asked? If she spoke out of turn I'd agree with you, however she waited till she was asked upon, which probably means nobody else wanted to answer, a student shouldn't have to hold back so the others feel better about themselves, a student is responsible for participating in class, she should not have to hold back.

****** Of corse not my point wasn't as extreme as the two of you made it. If no one knows the answers then if she is putting her hand up I would most certainly accept her participation but only if no one else know the answer.

And if I let one person answer all the question, others would not be punished for their lack of work. I recall that she interrupted Professor Snape when he was asking Harry some question on ingredients and Hogwarts Potion Curriculum in the first potion class.

You may believe that Harry didn't deserve it but he didn't even open the books before coming to school. In my class students are to at least read the books of the year in advance. The teacher role is to explain the notions that are hard to understand not to read the book material that the students should have done. And if a student can't answer one question by lack of knowledge Deduction is still possible.

And the episode of Snape potion book does tell us that she cannot support the books being wrong. She lack the capacity to thinking critically and going behind the Knowledge. Even if Harry was wrong to not search to understand the why.
