** The only Next Gen fic that I know that follows all the years is a Lily/Scorpius fic if you wanted to try that, I know it's not what you asked for :/. I actually used to be a big Rose/Scorpius fan until I read this one, now I'm forever Lily/Scorpius. Slytherins Potter by animeaddict56 on Fanfiction.net
