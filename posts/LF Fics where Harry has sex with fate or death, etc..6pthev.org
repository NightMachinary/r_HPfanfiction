  It had started as a normal enough day. Before he managed to Potter it up worse than anything else he had done before. (Yes, that is an actual term. Dear sweet Hermione had a laugh about that one and Harry learned that his bookworm best friend had a bigger pranking bone in her body than the Weasley twins, his father, and his Dogfather all put together.)

  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.
