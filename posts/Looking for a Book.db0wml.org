I don't remember the title but I remember a specific(ish) part of it. I think part of it was about Harry (dont remeber if this Harry was male or female, though I'm leaning towards female) was chucked back in time and managed to befriend the Black Sisters and a few other girls (Lily included, I think) and before Harry is returned to their original time they give Bellatrix a Bracelet. Bellatrix only became as she was in canon because of a slave-marriage contract to one of the Lestranges (don't remeber which). She's later cleared of the charges. (I think the slave-marriage contract later took away her fertility)
