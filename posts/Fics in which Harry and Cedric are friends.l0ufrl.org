I don't mind romance between the two, though I'd prefer a platonic relationship. linkao3(In a country churchyard by Franzbibliothek) is pretty great, for those who haven't read it yet! Something with a little more action would be amazing though. Just please no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing I beg you

  They passed through the barrier and found themselves in Kings Crossing proper, everywhere thronged by children also back for the summer holiday. Any one of the smiling adults could be Harry's relations, so Cedric kept his eyes sharp for lanky builds or unruly dark hair or bright green eyes, amid all the joyful reunions going on around them. It was hard not to be infected by the celebratory mood.Maybe a summer holiday in the peaceful, uncomplicated muggle world was exactly what Cedric needed.

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
