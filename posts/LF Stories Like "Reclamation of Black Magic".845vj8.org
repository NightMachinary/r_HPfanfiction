It took me ages to get around to reading this story after I tossed it into my favorites list, but I was glad that I got around to reading it in February.

Even though, so far, the Hogwarts part of the story has been really disappointing, watching the coven come together and flex its muscle was just fun, especially Dorea and Cassie. Are there any similar stories where Harry is raised by a coven of witches who are related to him (if somewhat distantly)? I doubt they'll be written as well as this one, but figured I'd ask~

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
