  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** oh yeah, that's the one where Voldemort starts a sexual relationship with 14 year old Harry, right? And where thirteen year olds torture and murder because it's so much fun... And Sirius and Remus aren't too bothered by all of it. So much believable characterization going on in that fic.

*** This is a sub for fan fiction, not people going up for the Pulitzer prize. If you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all.

**** So we're not allowed to criticize fics here? I thought this was also a page to discuss fanfics and express your opinion on them. Also, it's not like I said anything that wasn't true. I like you quoting Thumper to me, though :D

***** I often offer constructive criticism in this sub ([[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/39l5pl/book_club_secret_steps/csbau9l][example A]], [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/33w0zx/lf_slytherinmain_character/cqqugmp][example B]]). There's a difference between polite criticism and being condescendingly sarcastic.
