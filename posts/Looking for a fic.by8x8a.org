:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't recall much about this fic but I'm desperate to find it again. From what I remember, it's either a fem!harry or a twin sister of Harry and she's a slytherin. One very specific scene is that there's a party in slytherin and there's an accident and Millicent Bulstrode is killed from this accident. Prior to this accident I believe Millicent was given a makeover? The fem!harry or twin sister was also romantically involved with either Draco or Tom Riddle, I believe, but I'm leaning towards Draco.
