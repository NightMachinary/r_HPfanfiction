:END:
It's a sirius / hermione friendship, maybe romance?

Hermione goes back in time, uses the time turner too much and makes a horcrux, she befriends sirius earlier than the original timeline and hides him in the room of requirement. I just remember it being really dark and about sirius watching Hermione unravel / fade away maybe?

Any help is appreciated sorry if I didnt describe this well :)
