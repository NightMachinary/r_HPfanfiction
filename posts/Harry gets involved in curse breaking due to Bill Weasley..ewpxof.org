Be it due to a chance circumstance (I once read a fanfic where Harry goes to the Weasley house looking for Ron and such but only Bill is there and Bill takes him curse breaking which was really good but alas I have forgotten the name of) or because Harry is in the same year as him etc.

75k+ words please


** Well, Bill is part of the reason Harry becomes a Curse-Breaker in two stories of mine. Bill was Petunia's partner at the Curse-Breaker camp, and so Harry picked up a lot of the man's attitude.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
