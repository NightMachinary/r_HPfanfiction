So I was recently re-reading linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe]]) and though to ask here - what are your favourite dimension travel fanfictions?

Personally I am looking for Harry traveling to an alternate HP universe. Something like the aforementioned Across the Universe, however discussion is welcome.

  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger. (Canon, EWE, dimension travel, AU)

** Stages of Hope is brilliant. One of my favorite fics and IMO the best of this genre: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

How Like Home is a pretty good WIP: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22810651/chapters/54512623]]

I really enjoyed A Step to the Right, but it's first in a series and I don't know if the author is ever going back to it: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14949759/chapters/34641246]]

There's a great one, unfinished, and I can't remember the name. Death Eaters kidnap and drag Harry to another dimension where his parents are alive and his counterpart is older. He has a sister. The new Sirius hates him and doesn't trust him. Anybody remember this one?

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** The Professor's Journey (Hiruzen and Orochimaru both end up in Wizarding England) Sadly abandoned but cool to see what's already there.

Echoes by Kagaseo Naruto fanfic, finished.

Sage Among Wizards by Kythorian Another actually good HP/Naruto crossover. Similar to previous.

Reborn at Hogwarts Same crossover.
