There was a post like this a few days ago with everything people hate, and I thought it was a super fun discussion!

Now, let's look at the other side of the coin. Tell me everything that you love to see in the fics you read. What makes you go "Yes!" when you see it in the tags?

Here's a very short list of my favorite things to see in fics:

- Harry having adults who watch out for him (usually Sirius, but I'm flexible)
- Weasley appreciation :)
- MAGIC being MAGICAL (basically, I like Magical Theory)
- Nuanced explorations of the Marauders v. Snape debate (no bashing)
- Redemption arcs that don't brush issues under the rug
- Slytherins are people too (but they aren't persecuted)
- Hermione and Ron are BOTH good friends
- Acknowledging that the whole "I lived in a cupboard for 10 years" thing is not okay.
- Every author who takes the time to write because goodness knows it isn't always easy. Appreciation for all of your ideas, even if I wouldn't read them :)

** ° Weasley and Dumbledore appreciation.

° Malfoy getting his just desserts.

° Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs getting attention.

° Fun fluffy friendship moments.

° Nuanced takes on Slytherins. (Acknowledging how they aren't all evil but aren't guiltless victims either)

° Linny is always nice.

° Cho has a happy time (like, give a bitch a break)

** - Exploration of magic beyond the written, and spoken word. On how more conceptual elements can be magical all on their own, where memories, feelings and actions can carry meaning beyond their immediate appearance. Kind of what Dumbledore was speaking of when he was looking for the cave entrance in the HBP, and his plan for Harry's survival in DH.
- Albus being dedicated to Harry's happiness, and where their relationship grows to that of grandchild and grandfather.
- Sirius taken seriously, where he isn't reduced to a caricature of a manwhore for cheap laughs. Show his trauma and the love he carries fro his friends, give me his spite and the consequences of his actions, and on't shy away from neither his callousness, nor his intelligence.
- Give me a Harry that keeps on being the snarky little shit from the first few books. A Harry that sneaks, and plans, and lies. A Harry that makes friends, a Harry that loves, and a Harry whose love for his friends is only matched by his resilience and resourcefulness.
- Public school shenanigans. Don't reduce it to a prank war, instead, show how bored teenagers gets into tiffs, goes gallivanting off on midnight kitchen raids, and weird hijinks egged on by equally curious and bored teachers.

- on that note young Grindelwald knowingly or unknowingly manipulates young Dumbledore

** A wider view of the wizarding world, fics that are set in other countries (must not be the whole fic) or introduce other groups/societies of wizarding people

Cedric/Sirius/Hedwig/Dobby/Fred/Remus/Tonks/Snape or at least some of them are alive

If romance in long fics then slow burn with an actual plot. If it's only romance, a good one shot will do

When it's a dark or angsty fic, it should have a happy ending otherwise I won't like it. A little bit of suffering is ok but let them be happy at the end.

Long fics about strong friendships, or enemys to friends.

** Since I like to read ennemies to lover stories, most of it ships Hermione with Snape, Lucius, or Voldemort/Tom Riddle Jr. I absolutely hate student-teachers relationships though. I liked them when I was younger and thought a mature and intelligent seventeen y.o girl could absolutely be in an equal relationship with a guy twice her age... I was wrong lol. So what I love most when I find new stories, is authors who take the time to find reasons for Hermione to be older and more established, so these relationship work better. She could use a time turner extensively to prepare for the war like in Sin & Vice, or just start the story years after the war when everybody is old, or some time travel... anything, I just don't want to read student-teacher relationships anymore haha. It's especially important in Volmione stories, the dude could be her grandad, no matter how smart she is I won't believe in a romance if she's 17. Oh and also, no Stockholm syndrome please. There's nothing romantic about abuse. So yeah, it's not easy to write a good story with these pairings, and I really admire authors who manage to overcome those difficulties.

Other than that, I love a strong female friendship, Hermione/Ginny, or with Luna, etc.

** Fics where Harry is proactive, and has actual goals.

Fics that actually portray Snape as what he really is; a loathsome, arrogant, hateful, vindictive, cruel piece of shit. He may not be evil, per se, but the man is truly without a shred of decency.

Fics where Dumbledore isn't some manipulative mastermind (even though he was) and truly agonizes over the fact that he has not found a way to save Harry, and that the boy will most likely have to die, so that Riddle can be defeated.

Fics that pair Harry with Hermione, Fleur, or Tonks.

Fics that have little or no smut. Porn adds nothing to the story. Seriously, there's no reason to go into explicit detail.

** I adore when people make an effort to show that the “other side” of the war also has some points. Also, when Voldemort is portrayed like who he was -- a genius with questionable morals who later went completely crazy (namely as Harry&the rest destroyed horcruxes), not a random lazy idiot. And ofc I love worldbuilding in fanfics & paying attention to mental health. Because as much as I love Harry Potter books -- the kid burned his teacher alive with his bare hands and just moved on like nothing had happened? I mean he could just repress the memories or something, but it's still nice if the author shows that he has to deal with his own trauma.

EDIT: AND WHEN DUMBLEDORE ISNT A SAINT NOR A DEVIL. When he is portrayed like who he was: an old man, tired with life, but trying to do what's right, no matter how many lives he has to sacrifice. I hate when people either choose to write him as an angel who never did anything wrong (or simply like Harry sees him in canon) or a devil in human disguise. If you want your Harry to despise him, you don't have to add “Dumbledore killed my parents!!!” or “he was stealing from my bank account!!!” tropes, because what we already have in books is enough to genuinely dislike him. And teenage angst will do the rest.

** 1. Harry pov, I don't like when Harry Potter fics don't include Harry Potter or treat him as a secondary character.
2. Non-standard magic use/unique powers. I enjoy things where Harry uses magic that isn't charms, transfiguration, dark arts/defense of dark arts, etc but instead does his own thing like Necromancy, Blood Magic, Pyromancer, Druidism, Light Magic, Shadow Magic, etc. Similarly I enjoy fics where he gets unique attributes so superhero fics, creature heritage, god/demigod fics, etc.
3. I enjoy stories where the villains aren't comically evil when it's supposed to be a somewhat realistic fic, for example I dislike when a bunch of 12 year old boys try to violently gangr*pe a 12 year old girl, firstly because I dislike such casual use of rape in the first place and secondly 12 year olds normally don't really think about doing sex stuff so it's double unrealistic. On the other hand when the worst that the second year students do is use prank spells and call people names the story is much easier to read as a realistic tale about a magical school.
4. I like about 10% of the story to be romance and I do want Harry to get the girl.
5. I enjoy Draco, and all the other bigots to be miserable.
6. I enjoy Snape being miserable.
