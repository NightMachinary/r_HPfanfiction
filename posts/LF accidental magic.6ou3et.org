I am looking for stories that have Harry using accidental magic that does something helpful like teleporting him or making the wards around his house protect him


** Accidental Animagus has, as you'd presume Harry accidentally unlocking his animagus transformation to escape the Dursleys. linkffn(9863146)

3 Slytherin Marauders has accidental magic doing something helpful in a couple of scenes somewhere in the middle, what exactly I won't spoil. linkffn(4923158)

Crack One-Shot, but Escapologist Harry has Harry using accidental magic to repeatedly escape the Dursleys. linkffn(9469775)
