I'm looking for fics that involve Harry or Hermione doing impressive things with magic. Researching powerful knowledge about magic, learning a truth that most wizards don't know, building things that go down in history like the Deathly Hallows, etc.

Pertinent examples:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]]

In particular, infrastructure projects like the portal mirrors and the Palantir-knockoff in For Love of Magic are just perfect examples. Creation of magical objects or wards or legacies on the same scale as the Mirror Erised or Philosopher's Stone.

Lady Archimedes is getting there slowly.


** Linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes) When magic is dictated by math, and Hermione is a prodigy, get ready for awesomeness. (Like the shield-subverting Heart-Stopping Curse, which uses /quantum tunneling/ to bypass her opponents shields, or turning an army of Inferi into mince-meat with razor wire. Put simply, Hermione is a BAMF)

*** White Squirrel is among the best active writers in the fandom. I think the only thing holding them back is the determination to follow the stations of canon.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

*** So I just finished this, it was actually a neat read, even if the plot was a bit obvious and Harry a bit of a Mary Sue, but hey - it's fun from time to time.

There were cool new elements, even if the portrayal auf the AU potters was nothing new. I wish Iris would have been more fleshed out as a character, but there are worse things.

So all in all: Above average, enjoyable read, but nothing I can say I /loved/.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

** linkffn(RuneMaster) has Harry end up creating and wielding a Gryffindor-Sword-level weapon, the exact nature of which I can't spoil. It's quite good, though I wouldn't say it's White Squirrel quality.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
