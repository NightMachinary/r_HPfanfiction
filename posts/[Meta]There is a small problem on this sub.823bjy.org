Why is it that every one of [[/u/AlmaLamaEmperorKusko]]'s comments I see on this sub usually gets downvoted to shit. He/She actually has a mental problem. Idk what you people have against the energetic type rambling comments they post. And it isn't that His/Her comments don't contribute to the topic. A lot of the times they do, and even still they get downvoted. A lot of times even if He/She complements someone there is a downvote train. So my question is, why is this happening? and can you stop?

P.S I probably could have phrased this better and made better points, but I'm just curious as to why this is happening.

That user needs a flair that points out their sincerity and good nature is real for casual users that don't know them and think â€˜reddit? must be sarcasm'.

** Based on the context I've gathered from conversations with Alma, I believe they are a "she". Admittedly, when you're an anonymous person online, you can be whatever you want and nobody will know the difference, but in Alma's case, I think she's pretty genuine about who she is.

I, for one, find her inquisitiveness and charming demeanor very pleasant. It's a nice switch from the sarcasm and cynicism that seems to pop up most frequently on this sub. Alas, alas, she's a Mr. Peanutbutter in a Bojack world...

**** The last sentence is a reference to a Netflix show called /BoJack Horseman/. It's a cartoon for adults set in a world where humans and human-like animals live together. Bojack, the title character, is a rather bad-tempered horse who used to be a really famous actor but is now washed-up, and Mr. Peanutbutter is his more optimistic friend who's a dog. I was implying that most people on this sub act mean and snarky like Bojack, whereas you are more like Mr. Peanutbutter. Which is a good thing.

(Actually, I think the majority of people on this sub are very nice. It just seems like there's more meanies and grouches in the world because those people tend to bring people around them down and cause the bad mood to spread. That's why we need more people like you.)

** I mean she got a "what" from me. Mostly because I got whiplash going from fanfics to tacos. Probably people see these comments that THEY see as having no relation to the discussion and down vote.

** I make an effort to counter that when I see it. I think the way they type simply rubs people the wrong way. People who haven't seen it before take it to mean sarcasm, or fake. "It's a bot" was common enough that Alma had to make a post about it when they first got on here. It's simply not true, Alma is a real and very sincere person.

Likely it's one or two people with a petty grudge, and then the rest just jump on the bandwagon. Curiously, downvotes have an unfortunate tendency to cascade.

Keep your spirits up, Alma! Downvotes are simply other people's opinions, and we all know of the relationship between opinions and assholes. (everyone has one of both)

** Because half of their posts are actually perfectly valid to downvote. Downvotes are meant for posts not contributing to a discussion, and if you point out someone's hole in their logic and they reply with "Thank you, you are obviously very smart", then this

1. Doesn't contribute to the discussion

2. Comes across as if the person is mocking you.

After a few of these posts, I simply blocked Alma and was done with them.

*** Hellstrike, I don't undersand how you get an entirely different meaning out of it than what the words mean? When someone tells me about a problem or a hole in a logic, and I respond with: "Thank you for pointing that out to me, you're smarter than me for realizing that." That's me saying "Thank you for pointing out a hole in my logic." That's all, simple, exactly what those words mean. Nothing else. How COULD THEY mean anything else anyway? That's like if I say "I like fish." and you think it means that I mean "I like the color blue." So yes, when I'm being thankful and grateful to someone else for pointing out a flaw or a mistake I made, I'm being thankful and grateful for them pointing out a flaw or mistake I made.
