  Ernie likes to pretend he's not a nervous wreck before job interviews. Justin likes to pretend he's a Hufflepuff at heart.

** I still think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has done the best job so far in (re)building the postwar world. But I feel he put too much emphasis on Harry and Ginny, while neglecting Hermione's importance.

** linkffn(282139) is a version of events following the war post GOF and while it is AU, it is remarkably written and one of my favorites.

She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building.

*** The amount of reviews this has is incredible. Though the follows and favorites suggest that its not /hugely/ popular, and instead has a regularly reviewing loyal audience. I might be wrong, since I never read it, but the numbers give that impression.
