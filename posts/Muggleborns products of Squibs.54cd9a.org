I was writing one of my stories ages ago when the thought came to me. What if the so called Muggleborns aren't actually Muggleborns, but products of several generations of Squibs.

An example of which is, in my headcanon, Petunia is a 2nd generation Squib, as her mother was a Squib, but her father was a Muggle. Lily, in my headcanon however, is only technically a Muggleborn because of laws made by the Purebloods.

Hermione, in my headcanon, is the product of two Squibs, both somewhere related from one common ancestor, Hector D-G. Again, she is only a Muggleborn because of laws made by the Purebloods.

What is your opinion on the Muggleborn situation?


** It most definitely /is/ canon. Here's the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828113728/http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/default.aspx?sec=3][source:]]

*Q:* How exactly do muggleborns receive magical ability?

*A:* Muggleborns will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back. The gene re-surfaces in some unexpected places.

** I personally always subscribed to the theory that it's both. I like to think that magic is just a tiny bit alive, which is what keeps it from being called science, and will occasionally pick people to bestow the gift of magic on. And it also of course will reignite on a bloodline it's faded from for whatever reason.

** JK Rowling's answer seems very modern. As in that is how muggleborns are created TODAY.

Its my headcanon that the first wizards HAVE to be muggleborn. As in truly muggleborn

*** I thought about it, and my theory that magical people have something different from the start. Like, having different DNA or some special genetic code. They might be evolutionary other species but so close to humans it's wasn't seen at all.

*** Why would they have to be muggleborn? We know that people can cross-breed with at least some of the magical creatures. That's may be where the first wizards came from.

**** Its my head canon that all magical creatures that arent human were created at one point by wizards. If they are humanish they are crossbreeds by a wizard and an animal. Or an attempt by Wizards to create human life.

** It's never explained by JKR herself.

My interpretation is that some Muggleborns have magical ancestors, while others are TRUE first generation magicals.

So when reading fanfics, I'm perfectly fine with both theories.

She answered it in [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828113728/http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/default.aspx?sec=3][an interview]].

** I see it often as a theory/revelation in fics that supposed to make prejudiced wizards accept muggleborns. Enough that it'd be more of a breath of fresh air to see fics explore that magic can come from no where and how that works/who gets chosen to have magic.

** Muggleborns are not necessarily the product of one or both parents being squibs, but if we go by JK's assertion that magic is based on genes (which has been stated several times), then a family has the potential (just like in the real world) to carry a gene that only pops up now and then. In the case of the world of HP, a gene that gives access to magic in some way.

Hence, a magical can surface from 2 muggles, because at some point the family tree had the gene introduced into it via witch or wizard.

** They aren't squbs, they are simply muggles with some wizard ancestors. They can't see Dementors or things protected by anti-muggle spells.

** I reject any theory of magic being caused by true genetics. Magicals and muggles have lived alongside each other forever, every muggle has magic blood somewhere in their line. It is a coincidence that muggleborns have magical ancestors. I don't have a definitive theory on HP magic, but I like the idea that magic is a somewhat sapient. Muggleborns and squibs being an attempt to make wizards appreciate magic.

*** There's actually a pretty great paper about the potential genetic cause of magic. The original site appears to have disappeared into the ether, so [[http://dictacontrion.tumblr.com/post/120087676441/i-sent-this-paper-to-jk-rowling-explaining-how-the][here's]] a copy I found. As a genetics student and a potter fan, it delights me :)

*** I'm not so sure.

Magic provides a strong survivability advantage, ceteris paribus. We'll even ignore Muggles killing mages. But evolution doesn't concern itself with survival so much as reproduction -- it doesn't matter that your life expectancy has grown to 150 years if you had to neuter yourself before puberty to get there. So what are the reproductive effects of being capable of magic?

Since the Statute of Secrecy (and possibly earlier; you probably don't go from fully integrated to fully separate in a year), for a Muggle to be capable of magic means that they are immediately removed from the Muggle breeding population. This takes place before any reproduction can occur. As far as the Muggle population is concerned, being capable of performing magic is a fitness /dis/advantage.

And for humanity at large, there is an inverse correlation between education/health care and number of children. Magic provides improved health care, and Hogwarts provided a much better education than available to most people until the late 1800s. The series bears this out -- there are many pureblood families with only one child, and we only see two that I recall with more than two children. They're not making replacement rate.

Evolutionarily, magic is a fitness disadvantage, and we would expect it to be marginal or absent in the population.
