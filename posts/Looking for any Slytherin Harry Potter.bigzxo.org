So I've been really interested in alternatively-sorted-Harry fanfics lately, I don't really mind whether he ends up light/dark, I really enjoy both. I'd really appreciate any recommendations but would prefer them to be either completed or have a high word count.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] linkffn(4745329) is, imo, the best Slytherin!Harry fic out there, even though it's abandoned. Angsty in parts, some violence, mostly gen.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/331576][Serpensortia]] triology, starting with linkao3(4913998), is the only other Slytherin!Harry fic I've truly enjoyed. It also takes a fairly realistic approach to Harry being put in Slytherin, though it's less of a downer than the fic above. Gen.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18572623/chapters/44025565][Iron]]- Slytherin Trio, Hufflepuff Neville, Seer Luna, gay Draco, trans Harry, nice Petunia Dursley, Dumbledore in a cursed limbo. Vernon Dursley is dead.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][the boy with a scar series]]- in which Harry stands up for another student getting bullied

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1039565][the Through The Quiet Emerald series]]- Slytherin Trio, Deaf Harry, tons of representation, creature magic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][The Prince of Slytherin series]]- featuring the Wrong BWL Trope, the Twin trope, and politics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]]- same as above, but slightly less political and slightly more crack-y

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/528913][The Many Faces of Harry Potter series]]- multiple versions of Harry have an interdimensional meetup, sharing advice and seeing how differently each of them turn out. narrated at first by the Gryffindor Harry we meet in canon.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1182551][The Shadow Magic series]]- Harry's secret power is the ability to use shadows. he becomes... well, not a Dark Lord, but a Grey Lord, which is way cooler.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/970896][huddled masses yearning to breathe free]]- racism, politics, and general horror. Harry is brown and Hermione is black.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/675791][the Trinkets series]]- magical genetics are complicated, and power is more than just family.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/272675/chapters/431089][Rebirth]]- the Reincarnation Trope, but better.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209494/chapters/313282][Xerosis]]- this is a Ravenclaw!Harry fic, plus the Reincarnation Trope and a semi-evil Harry who has bad taste in alias names.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865/chapters/749908][Again and Again]]- a time travel fic. politics and rumors.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504][Full Circle]]- Reincarnation Trope, semi-soulmate Tom Riddle, and endless humor. this is one of my personal favorites.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8132578/chapters/18642415][The Anti-Heroine]]- another personal favorite, one i've reread several times. largely Hermione-centric at the beginning.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1042235][The Emerald Glass series]]- school dynamics and the teachers' decisions, oh my!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/270848/chapters/427550][Session Transcripts]]- the Killing Curse gave Harry brain damage and wild magic. Hermione is transmasculine. sibling rivalries abound. the teachers care about their students.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220][the Very Slytherin Harry series]]- what if Harry discovered his Parseltongue earlier?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6109822][Harriet Potter Is]]- short. bit of a character study. genderbent, in which Harry is a cis girl.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15929582/chapters/37140779][Red Hair and Hand Me Downs]]- Harry has red hair and hazel eyes. his first meeting with Draco goes a little differently, and the butterfly effect abounds.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198][the Like None Other series]]- the Slytherin!Harry doesn't come in until the second part of the series, but it's so complicated and good that you might enjoy it all so i'm including it here anyway.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12688777/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Path-Not-Chosen][Harry Potter and the Path Not Chosen]] on FF- in which he befriends Draco

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7390178/1/Multiverse][Multiverse]] on FF- Ravenclaw!Harry. an older, omniscient Luna and Harry watch over his younger self.

Not even remotely a crack fic, so I'm not sure why you describe it that way.

**** it's got crack moments and way more humor. political intrigue and all that is important to the story, yeah, but the friendshippy bits and character development take up a lot more. it's more self-aware of its tropes, especially in later parts and how the James-bashing is written.

you're right in that i shouldn't have described it that way; i should've just said that it's more humorous than the other. thank you for catching that error.

Really? I've only read up to the end of book 3, but it seemed super unaware of it's tropes to me. Like it seemed to think the tropes were all super great ideas so played them up as much as possible with no irony.
