A goverment so competent that there is no dark lords. They are assassinated as soon as they first go to public. Also a minister that bitch slaps dumbledore for trying to interfere goverment and doesn't take shit from him and his vigilante group. Bonus points for blocking dumbledore from taking on other positions besides from being a headmaster of a school.


** Placing a Taboo on the word 'Imperio', perhaps? Or perhaps just modifying however the Trace functions to catch Unforgivable Curses as well? That would help to nullify a dark lord's most useful weapon in such a scenario, which would be using imperius'd expendable proxies to commit their crimes for them.

Using time-turners for rapid-response teams to crimes? Also possible, they can't prevent the crime from being initiated (without breaking the timeline anyway) but they can apprehend the criminal on-site before they escape to do more damage...wait, that's too dangerous; a serious dark wizard could lay down traps for the expected response team and steal their time turners to do even more damage than he/she could otherwise.

I believe one of Starfox5's works, Divided & Entwined, had it mentioned at one point that while the rest of the Ministry wasn't necessarily competent, the Unspeakables were; under direct command of the International Confederation of Wizards, they had several prophecy makers on staff to predict and intercept breaches of the Statute of Secrecy before they happen. They weren't a serious focus of the story, though.

Still, against a Ministry that uses divination, traces and taboos effectively, I can see Dark Lords taking a very different approach. Places with very strong protections like Hogwarts effectively block taboos as seen in canon, they probably would block the Trace too, so a potential dark lord might set up a heavily warded fortress (or at least a basement) then woo victims into their grasp using love potions and lesser compulsions before laying the Imperius and keeping their new slave as a sleeper agent until needed.

--------------

Now I'm wondering about an idea. A high-achieving student just out of Hogwarts is targeted by an assassin, but survives (potentially apprehending the assassin as well); when it comes out that the assassin was sent by his own Ministry of Magic to try and pre-emptively kill a potential dark lord (divination said so), and that future assassins will likely follow, the student is left with no choice but to build a force of his friends and rivals to stop the Ministry, inadvertently becoming the dark lord they feared in the first place.

...I did see a bit of a fic once where a time-and-space-travelling Harry tries his very best to kill a Tom Riddle that, unbeknownst to him, is actually innocent. I wonder which one that was? I don't think it was on Fanfiction.net.

Not the Unspeakables, the Obliviators. I had to find a way that explained how the Obliviators could react to threats to the SoS without giving the entire government the ability to react immediately to any magic being used. So I decided that the Obliviators used Seers to deal with any actual threat - two wizards duelling in a forest, for example, wouldn't get a visit, if there were no witnesses and people would dismiss the aftermath as a forest fire.

** If the government was competent and took out dark lords there wouldn't be an Order of the Phoenix to “bitch slap” though

** I just wrote an one-shot in which Harry gave an interview 20 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. It's implied that the new Ministry run by him and Hermione is actually kind scary: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628).

Another one shot with an effective and scary Ministry and Order is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]], linkffn(4269983).

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** Maybe some sort of Brave New World or 1984/HP x-over would work well. Or even a Brave New World/1984/HP x-over.\\
Or a fic where Dark Lords work solely through loopholes in the law, and employ armies of lawyers as followers as a response against the ministry's brutal efficiency.\\
Or Xeno Lovegood is a Dark Lord, and wages media war against the ministry.

** Many of the Umbridge succeeded fics have this aspect, She doesn't allow any Dark Lords to raise, anyone having more power than the Ministry. Many of us fail to realize in real life we might like that kind of no nonsense officers, except when we become victim of them.
