Is linkffn(Core Threads) abandoned? Did the author say anything? 'Cause I just started re-reading the fic, and I want to see Harry heal Neville's parents and see more of Harry's....country? island? (sorry, forgot the name)

Also, if anyone has more fics like this one - with an OP/Genius Harry, good Dursleys, etc., please rec! NO HP/GW, HP/HG, HP/Multi, SS/HG, HP/Harem pls. Slash pairings are okay.


** OK so I want to read core threads but in Harry's first year he offers to tie people to their wands allowing them to have perfect connections to them he does this with a group of girls but When he offers it's to a guy nearby he declined his offer even though he's his friend. does harry ever do this on any male characters or is this some weird thing that Harry never uses on any male characters to prove that he's a macho man or that it's some sort of thing to prove his straightness.

*** He first offers it to Terry Boot, who declines, and Harry feels weird tying boys' wands to them or something. At least, that's what he says. It's not really to prove he's straight or whatever..........I think. I'm not very sure, tbh.

**** I was reading Core Threads yesterday and actually stopped because of this issue. He doesn't want to do Terry's wand because Harry is heterosexual. In the story this is an extremely pleasurable experience and later when he is synching two more girls wands they feel as though Harry is kissing and licking them. As these are 11 year olds and the story constantly refers to the incident I found it extremely disturbing and stopped reading.

*** That was so weird and icky. (Also made me feel the author is a tad homophobic.)

There was another weird scene when Neville needed to reconnect with his wand and Harry used Susan as a sort of buffer/conduit. The next people he /helped/ this way were girls, and the whole process is getting more sexual each time.

So, this whole thing is really getting worse and worse.

And then I dropped it. Too many strikes.

*** IT ended up that Harry was basically manipulating each persons Soul, and ended up making Soul Bonds to each of these girls. So I guess the author didn't want him "soul married" to boys to or something.

So yeah it's almost definitely a homophobic thing.
