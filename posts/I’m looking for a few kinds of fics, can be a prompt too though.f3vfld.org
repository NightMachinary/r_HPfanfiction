1. When James yells at Lily to run she runs and goes somewhere secret and lives with Harry

2.any fics where old ships are used in for example the battle of Hogwarts or overall during the war, I remember one fic had it so that Durmstrang had a secret war fleet, I'd like to see more of that kind of stuff

3.Ravenclaw or Slytherin Harry

1. Powerful harry, like merlin powerful

5.now with a nice bridge to having the founders and/or merlin alive in Harry's time and they help in the battle. Could also be so that Harry goes back in time to the founder's era and helps with the troubles of the time.

1. Xover with LotR, Rowena Ravenclaw or Helena Ravenclaw is Galadriel. I know the hair colour kinda goes to shite but still.

If you have a fic with a mix of any of those then please do link it or atleast tell the name

Thank you in advance!
