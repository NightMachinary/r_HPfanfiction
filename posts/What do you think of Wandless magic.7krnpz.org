I'm writing a fan fiction that has Wandless magic (also known as Hand magic or Body magic) as a big part of the story and I want to know what the fanbase thinks of that. Do you like stories about wandless magic? Is it inconsequential to your interest or does it make you like the story more? How would you see wandless magic as useful but not overpowered? What are some good fics that have wandless magic as a focal point? Any feedback is good Thanks!


** My preferred interpretation was always that there was plenty of wandless magic but that it was not the same thing as casting wand spells without a wand. Rather they were separate disciplines that did not involve a wand, like potions. These other disciplines would use other processes and instruments, like potions uses ingredients and preparation method as equivalents to wand and incantation.

However this is no longer canon compatible. Still, it remains my preference that not every spell can be cast wandlessly, and that spells will always be more powerful when cast with a wand.

*** I always imagined that spells that require careful aiming or impact a very precise part of something can't be cast wandlessly. Like Stunners.

*** That makes sense and I thought similarly at one point. Canon was always vague about wandless magic, with the movies having regular wizards doing wandless magic all the time and the Voldemort vs Dumbledore fight being almost completely wandless spells. In the books Harry does a lumos with his wand a few feet from his hand in the fifth book but I can't think of anymore instances where it as used so obviously at the moment

**** Yeah, and that one is because it's a phoenix feather wand, they can do minor spells while near you but not in your hands. How that works, I haven't the foggiest, but I can accept it as being something coming from a wand.

As for the movie casting, welp ... there was a lot of DBZing (i.e. two people have beams of power, they connect, then there's 20 episodess' worth of time of each trying to overpower the other) going on in the movies, so I throw any notion that they may be canon in any aspect out of the window.

** In my stories, I treat wandless magic as something that's at most, situationally useful since a wandless spell will always be much weaker than a spell cast by the same wizard with a wand. So, good to recover your wand, or at least work some magic without it, but anyone using it instead of a wand in a fight is crippling himself. (That also explains how the European wizards conquered so much of the known world - they had wands, the others had no wands).

And in the same vein, anyone spending a lot of time on learning wandless magic to protect himself would be better advised to spend that time on wanded magic, and buy a second wand as a spare or so.

** I think wandless magic is interesting. I also think it's a lot more work than magic performed with a wand as a magical focus and so most witches and wizards don't bother. To me, since Harry's parents were caught flat-footed without their wands and were completely defenseless against Voldemort (though how much defense can you muster against the Killing Curse, anyway?), it would make sense that Harry would put in the work to become reasonably adept at wandless magic, even if only to give him enough time to get to his wand or another weapon. And then there was all that time spent with borrowed wands or wandless when his own was broken during Deathly Hallows.

In my story, California Dreamin', I do have some wandless magic that has to occur to further the plot and it doesn't come easy to Harry. My theory is that it's relatively easy to affect parts of your own body wandlessly--warming your hands, drying your hair--than it is to affect things outside of yourself, unless you /really really/ desire the outcome. The makeup of the thing matters as well. In California Dreamin', the item Harry has to manipulate is made of gold, a very stable element that likes being exactly the way it is, thank you very much. Something less stable, or maybe even an alloy made of different elements, might be easier to "bully" wandlessly.

How are you planning on utilizing wandless magic in your story?

*** Thank you so much for the reply! I'm planning on making wandless magic a bit more available to Harry due to 1. It's second year AU fic and he hasn't had that much experience with a wand so it's easier to pick up and 2. Wandless magic is more assessable in general but most wizards don't use it much because of the odd rules and how easy wand magic is. Wandless magic will come easy to Harry in my fic, and other characters will have talent with it as well. The rules will be that there is a sentence called a mantra and a body movement that coincides with it to create a personalized ‘spell'. Everyone has a different way of doing wandless magic even if it's the same spell. The mantra has to be in the present tense such as ‘the block is floating' and the movement has to be the same every time in order for it to work. Also, once the mantra and movement is successful, it's very difficult to change it. See how that can be tricky? I plan on writing several interesting instances where Harry and Co. have mishaps with wandless magic that make it a bit more challenging for them to master rather than having it down after one training session.

** Wandless magic is not harder than wanded, and mostly seen under the form of accidental magic.\\
BUT! there is a huge downside to mastering wandless magic : the tell you use to cast becomes a sort of automatism. If you always use the same gesture while thinking of fire to lit a fire, then you'll start to systematically lit fires when doing said gesture and thinking to fire (or worse, should it become automatic enough, you won't even need to think of fire).\\
That's why there are so few wandless practitioners in Europe (where the wand is king): in addition to being a tool, the wand is a safety; learning a few tricks is all good and well (producing light, calling your wand, wouldn't astonish me if Molly was able to cast a cushioning charm wandlessly), but learning wandless magic safely is not a power boost.

** Wandless magic is like finger painting, whereas a wand is like every paintbrush, palette knife, airbrush, and pencil/crayon/pastel you could want. Sure you can produce great art with only your hands, but the skill floor of wanted magic is so much lower than wandless, and the ceiling is so much higher

** I like to think of wandless magic as its used by regular characters to be a expansion of nonverbal spell casting. So they not only have to think of the incantations but also imagine the wand movement. We know a wand enhances the strength of different kinds of magic by varying degrees, so i think wandless magic would be automatically weaker for all form and harder spells and curses would be weakened so much that they cant be used. So it would theoretically be possible to cast a wandless unforgivable or patronus, but it would be practically impossible for anyone to get proficient enough at magic to do so. I also think wandless magic shouldn't produce any lights and instead work instantaneously on the target.

But I also think that there should be an entire magic system for wandless magic in places where wands are relatively new like america of africa and there people should use things like certain hand gestures or something else to cast their spells

** I'd only be interested in wandless magic if it's available to more than just the main character in the story. Sure unique powers are fun to have in a story, but something like wandless casting when everyone else thinks its impossible just gives easy solutions to problems that can't really be countered.

I don't see many fics that use wandless magic other than another way to make the MC super special. Spread the wealth of magic and I'd definitely be interested in the story.

** In my opinion and from what I see in cannon, wandless magic is no different than accidental magic. It is just harder to learn so when wands (or other focuses) were invented people started going the easy route and over the years everyone thought wandess was only for the very powerful and too hard.

** Wandless magic is for manipulating raw and powerful magic IMO. The body being the conduit for what ever spell the wizard is casting. On the other hand, pun intended, wand magic is for finesse: Transfiguration, Charms, enchanting, etc.

Blasting someone out of the sky using force, fire, wind, where one shot equates to one kill/a nuke? Wandless. Transfiguring the battlefield for your advantage, healing, charming objects to your advantage, enchanting, go with wands.

** I tend to think that wandless magic is just as powerful as wanded magic, but it manifests differently, and a spell that is cast with a wand wouldn't be able to be cast without it. The same effects could be achieved without a wand, but you would have to use a different spell, hand movements, or incantation to do it.

I think that the intent of the magic user is slightly different as well. In cannon we only really see wand users, and there isn't really an emphasis placed on how much intent the caster puts behind most spells, the unforgivables and the patronus are the only ones that really seem to need a certain emotion or intent to work properly. I think that intent and emotion would govern how well wandless spells work, and only when the spell is mastered by it's caster is when that emphasis on intent and emotion can factor into the background.

A normally wanded wizard might be able to wave a hand over a candle and light it without a wand, if he wanted it bad enough, but he wouldn't be able to light a bonfire so that it's at it's full blazing glory within seconds. Someone who had been casting spells without a wand their whole life would be able to do it easily. A normally wanded wizard would be on his hands and knees coaxing the tiny spark that he's been able to produce, after an hour of trying, to catch on the kindling. Like a muggle trying to light a fire without a lighter for the first time.

In a way I also see casting spells with or without a wand as speaking a language. Once you know one language and have used it all your life, amungst people speaking the same language, it's harder to learn another unless you immerse yourself in the new language. Yeah, you might know a few words in the other language and be able to use them in the right context, but full mastery takes time and practice. The cannon wizards we see have to work for seven years to perfect their wand language skills. I don't see it as much different to the wandless language skills in another place, time, and culture.
