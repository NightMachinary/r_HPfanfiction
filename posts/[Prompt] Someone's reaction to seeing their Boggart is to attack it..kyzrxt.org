So there's this thing in nature: "Fight +of+ *or* Flight". Most fics, and canon too for that matter, have the reaction to seeing a Boggart be "Flight", IE: they try to get away, or they freeze, or what have you.

But what if someone's reaction to seeing "their worst fear" was to "Fight"? Like, their reaction to a Boggart was to /attack it?/

Punching it? Hexxing it? Blasting curse?

I don't much care, I just had the thought of someone trying to attack the boggart and wanted to share.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

****** As of the latest chapter, no. They're... /something/, but no.

Ginny knows he's come back from the future, and that they dated in the original timeline. Charlie also knows, and has made it clear that if Harry hurts her, he'll transfigure Harry into beefsteak and feed him to a dragon. Harry fully accepts that, and would take a bullet for Ginny, no questions asked, but agrees that the maturity gap makes any relationship highly questionable, so they're not actually dating. He does increasingly feel like a teenager with some extra memories and skills, though, rather than feeling like an adult in a teenage body. And Ginny thinks that both Charlie and Harry need to trust her to make her own decisions; if she doesn't have a problem with Harry being older from a certain point of view, she doesn't think they should either.

Regarding creepiness, Harry's first motivation in getting to know her better was to stave off the possibility of the Diary latching onto her isolation and insecurities. And since he was thinking in terms of reliving his life except better, it seemed natural to him to get to know his friends again except earlier and using what he knows about them to help them. Possibly manipulative? He agonises quite a bit over that, but with their lives potentially on the line he'll do it anyway. In fairness to him, the way he's treated Ginny is not much like what you'd expect of a predator; he hasn't done anything like trying to make her isolated and dependent on him, rather he's tried to build up her confidence and her skills until she's more independent than ever, and connected her with his whole circle of friends who are willing to call him out on any mistakes he makes.

Chapter 44, when it arrives, is likely to include the Yule Ball, which will probably be relevant.

******* Thanks for the comment. Honestly I see what the author's doing, I actually think I read this ages ago the more I read now.

This kind of hand-waving ‘but he's got a teenage body' thing is kinda crappy justification for me tbh. Ultimately an additional 15 years is life experience and learning. However it's not enough to put me off the fic, but I don't know if it's worth me continuing with because I'm finding future Harry's behaviour erratic and a bit frustrating. A personal peeve, not the authors fault. I can tell it's a very good fic!

******** To each his own. I don't think him having a teenage body is the primary reasoning, though. My main point is: he hasn't crossed a line, because they're not dating, and he isn't really guilty of grooming, because the way he treats Ginny is the opposite of what you'd expect if he were trying to control her.

In other circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect that someone with his mental age just wouldn't hang around with teenagers at all, but that's obviously not feasible for him; he's legally a minor and /couldn't/ live alone. If he could have done that, he would have travelled around and wiped out the Horcruxes within the first month, but he couldn't. With that in mind, he's sincerely being the best friend he knows how to be.

But anyway, if you don't enjoy it, that's ok.

So, me being a small idiot, decided to go into it one day to get out of the rain for a few minutes.

Fucker was /on the door handle/. And I didn't see it until I was already inside. Yeah, I have a phobia, and it's because a gigantic spider kept me prisoner in a storage closet for ten minutes.

As you get older magic becomes more of a second nature thing, so I can easily believe that someone would try and attack a Boggart because their response to whatever it turned into is fear by way of offence.

  Harry Potter is a dragon.

Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

**** The beginning involves a ritual being used as a hail mary to summon something that can take on Voldemort near the end of the 1st war, which plucks Abathur out of SCverse just as he's about to die, his consciousness landing inside a participant's womb as a baby while losing like >99% of his Zerg DNA; he winds up in a muggle orphanage after her death until he's invited to Hogwarts because they think he's just a wizard, and he winds up in Harry's year. Suffice to say, shenanigans ensue.

***** ...well, that's got to end poorly. Abathur has no morals. Literally, I think he is genetically incapable of having morals.

Sounds interesting, if only because I've not seen a lot of SC crosses, but that has to end poorly.

******** Regarding Luna: her infestation process got interrupted so her mind was still her own, albeit still connected to the Hivemind and so able to control Zerg units (which she loved and thought were cute, natch). She was basically tricked into thinking the Zerg are a lot more lovey-dovey than they actually are; I haven't read the last few chapters or so (not sure which was my last before I got distracted before it was finished) but she was on the verge of rebellion last I'd read and I got the impression she would've at least had a strong chance of (with an assist from Dumbles and co) beating Abathur.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

*** Possible. But, ignoring that, I just think it's a funny/interesting scene idea of someone's reaction to their "greatest fear" or whatever being to attack it, not to cower in fear.

But yeah, that's a distinct possibility.
