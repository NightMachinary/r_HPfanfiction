Begin with any book other than DH but doesn't get them together before early GOF... And not too much 'teasing'? As in almost getting together but not quite... Does this exist...

Eg: shamelessly flirting with madam rosmerta, going headlong into studies, DA, quidditch but not at all skipping social time...

Also, preferably no dumbles or Weasley or Granger bashing although I can read any really

Thanks!


** Honestly one of the best Harry/Ginny fanfic I've read (and it somewhat matches all your parameters) is Taking Control Linkffn(2954601)

Sadly the sequel never took off, but Taking Control is a complete story from the perspective of a AU 6th year

***** I know! It was gearing up for some really interesting plot points. Harry's hidden power, the formation of his own faction, and what the fallout would be from his summer actions.

Sadly it's been so long I have no hope of the author returning.
