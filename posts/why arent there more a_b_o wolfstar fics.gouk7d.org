like in almost every big fandom you can't save yourself from them and this pairing is practically begging for it. I just need more of them.


** Because a/b/I is a ridiculous concept and wolfstar is actually super cite. It doesn't need to be sullied.

** Probably because there's already very similar dynamics in a lot of creature fics (including werewolf fics) in the fandom. It's basically the same dom/sub kink but just different worldbuilding.
