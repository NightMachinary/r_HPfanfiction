This is a completely off-the-wall thought I had today:

You know how Caligula, the roman emperor, was supposed to be completely insane? Putting his horse in the senate and all?

What happens if you introduce Harry Potter style magic, and magical creatures, and most importantly the Statute of Secrecy, into the mix?

It probably doesn't exist in any fanfiction except perhaps as a tidbit in History of Magic, but I had a silly idea that perhaps Caligula, living in a time predating muggle-magical separation, was reform-minded and sought to integrate intelligent magical creatures into the human community.

Making friends with centaurs and merfolk (they're of Greek mythological origin, right?), he may have pushed to give them equal rights as Roman citizens, and tried to make his best friend, a centaur named Incitatus, a member of the Senate, before his assassination by human supremacists.

Afterwards, his name would have been tarnished by anti-integration-leaning historians, portraying him as insane and cruel; later, when the Statute of Secrecy came into force, published information relating to Incitatus was altered by wizards to recast him as a horse rather than a centaur.

I dunno, just an odd thought that came to me. What does everyone think?


** Well this is canon as far as I'm concerned.

** The story of Incitatus is reported by Suetonius and Cassius Dio; neither of them are known for their objective and accurate historical reporting. So it's not entirely certain that Caligula ever did attempt to give his horse honours (I believe that Suetonius has him attempting to give Incitatus a consulship, not merely a seat in the senate!) If he did, though, some revisionist historians have suggested that this was a deliberate dig at the Roman elites by Caligula, not a simply an expression of his insanity.

So not only would centaur!Incitatus fit neatly into the Harry Potter universe, it would also be historically plausible.

*** Is it possible they're not known for objectivity and accuracy because their accounts have been changed by wizards?

**** You can certainly consider that some of their more bizarre stories don't appear to make much sense because wizards (either muggles not understanding magical events, or because wizards have changed their accounts to hide the magical events) but it's overkill to imagine it for all of the problems with their accounts. We have many perfectly good mundane reasons for the lack of objectivity and accuracy in ancient historians' writings (not limited to these authors; pretty much every ancient history is massively problematic). Just two major and fairly universal ones are:

1. All historical (and indeed other) writing is biased by the perspectives of the writer; Rankean positivism aside, this is a universal problem not merely limited to ancient historians. However ancient historians, not having been exposed to Rankean historiography and the idea that the historian's job is to write "what actually happened", and in at least some cases writing under rulers who would be... displeased... if they did not toe the party line, were possibly even more strongly influenced by their own biases than historians are today.
2. Our closest ancient historians to an event are frequently writing a long time after the events they describe, and did not actually witness it themselves; we often have little idea what their sources said other than what can be derived from their accounts (Suetonius probably was born more than 25 years after Caligula died).

** From what i remember he also like, declared war on the sea or something? So im pretty sure he was just a bit messed up in the head. Really interesting idea though, maybe with the senate being made up of wizards only or something.

**** I suspect OP is thinking of Caligula's British campaign, where Suetonius says that he drew up his troops for battle facing the sea before ordering them to collect seashells as booty. This is as confusing to classicists as it is to everyone else. Mermaids is probably the best explanation here, actually...

*** You could probably explain that away somehow. Either it's was just added to make the horse thing more believable or it could have been a bored Ministry worker that just wanted to spice things up a little.

I mean it must have been so much work to go through literally every book in the world and edit all legitimate mentions of magic out of them; i think i would have been bored too and adding something like that is exactly the kind of thing i would do to make my job more interesting.

** Oh, I just had another thought to add to myself!

Wasn't there that one legend about a prophecy by an astrologer who claimed that Caligula was as likely to become king as he was to ride his horse across the Gulf of Baiae?

And after Caligula did become king, he had a floating bridge made up of all the boats in the Gulf, and rode across them, just to thumb his nose at the seer?

What happens if you add magic to the mix? Was there a true prophecy involved? Did Caligula get a friendly wizard to cast a water walking charm on him instead of getting all those boats?
