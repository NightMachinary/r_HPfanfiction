**** The problem is how Harry's attraction towards Ginny is depicted. Rowling forgot to set up the romance between the two, so Harry suddenly has a "monster inside his chest", and it's meant to be like, oh look at that, teenage hormones, but Harry, an emotionally abused teen, has no idea what the fuck he is supposed to do with them. Until he finally gives in and kisses Ginny or whatever, it's been a while since I've read the sixth book.

But... That's very similar to how the fucking Imperius is depicted. A foreign voice in your body telling you to do things/how to feel until you give in? I'm honestly not surprised by how many fics go with that explanation instead.

***** There is a growing relationship since book 5: Ginny chanting "he got free" with the twins, getting Harry out of his mood when he thought he was getting possessed, fighting in the department of mysteries. And through book 6 they bond through their joint love of Quidditch.

It could have worked a lot better, specially if the series could have dealt with teenagers as if they were teenagers (ie, Harry and Neville discussing Ginny's growing breasts), but there is something there.

The movies cut everything and just have Ginny cheating on Dean with Harry for about 5 seconds.

***** there's [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=gringotts&st=hglovered][this old essay]] by Red Monster that goes deeper into how it is depicted.

i mean, i agree - there really could have been more setup (and the movies...lol) but the romance isn't /entirely/ out of left field. we generally see what harry sees, and he consistently notices her, through all of the books, even when her presence has no relevance to what's going on. he just mostly...has no idea what to do about it/is hung up on cho. judging by my own teenage years, this obliviousness and sudden impulsiveness is embarrassingly plausible.

There's a moment in HBP when they're getting on the Express where Ginny leaves Harry to go find her friends, and Harry feels annoyed and confused, because he understands that normally they don't really hang out at school but they have been hanging out all summer. From there pretty much every interaction between them has Harry paying more and more attention to her until the “catching her kissing Dean monster in the chest” moment.

But I also know that these actions usually ended with at least one person throwing up. And if you throw up in the middle of a school dance, you would probably be forced into the Hospital (wing).

The crackfic sounds like a fun idea. Or imagine in PS, the detention group is wandering through the forbidden, scared and looking for the thing which kills unicorns only to come across a bunch of 4th/5th years getting drunk around a bonfire, completely wasted and oblivious to the danger nearby. And then Hagrid gets offered a row of Jägerbombs, which he slams back to the cheering of the teenagers.
