*** Or alternatively Harry had taken his standard sized dose 1 minute before making Voldemort believe that his body is immune to the potions toxicity when it is actually even more fragile to it and so Voldemort just drops dead from OD right after firing the Killing Curse that took away the Horcrux just in time for Harry to come back to life.

** Seriously, why would anyone who is remotely competent at potion-making or rich/well-connected enough to buy it ever /not/ go into battle with Felix?

So now I'm imagining a battle where thousands of spells are cast but nobody ever hits- at least until the Felix Felicis runs out, at which point whichever side runs out first immediately retreats, knowing further combat is pointless.

Because of the non-zero chance that they would go as far away as humanly possible from said battle while under the influence?

**** "/Luck can only get you so far, Harry... Luck is not powerful enough to get through a powerful incantation./" - Hermione in Half Blood Prince

Obviously it can boost your chances in a battle but it won't guarantee a win. In combination with the fact that it takes half a year to brew, needs a master of the art to brew it and has very expensive incredients - not to mention that an overuse has negative side effects - not addiction but as it is very toxic in large quantity, and over-reliance on it may lead to dangerous overconfidence, giddiness, and recklessness it isn't really the thing you want to rely on in a battle about live and death.

*** 1. Felix Felicis is insanely hard to make, and insanely expensive - "remotely good" doesn't cover it, you need to be a master to brew it correctly and it costs a small fortune to make.

2. It's the equivalent of taking hard drugs. And likely as prohibited as them too.

**** Is there any evidence at all for the latter, ie for it being physically addictive or having negative side-effects, or is this just another case of "fanon" being repeated until people assume its canon?

***** Canon is somewhat vague, but:

#+begin_quote
  "Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?" said Terry Boot eagerly.

  "Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence," said Slughorn. "Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . ."
#+end_quote

This leaves a lot of room for interpretation, so it's mostly up to a given fic to decide exactly how bad the effects are. It's pretty clear in canon that taking it once is perfectly fine, so I would say "hard drugs" is a bit of an exaggeration.

So that should really set the stage.

******* Indeed! But it's baffling how many fics tackle the question "why doesn't everyone in the world have a tall glass of Felix Felicis every morning?" with the answer "because they're all COMPLETE MORONS (except for Indy!Harry, who has it all figured out)".

******** I read a fic once where Harry was super messed up from how much Felix felicis he'd drank. I can't remember much of the plot but Harry was basically useless unless he was on FF.

****** I think everyone who is familiar with the clubbing scene has tried at least once coke. It's fun and all and many are not addicted to it. But taken too often will make one addicted and can damage your organs. So hard drugs is a fair comparison.

But if there was a hard drug that makes you much more likely to succeed at whatever you do, then yeah. A suped up performance enhancer.

**** None of those things are supported by canon, but they're good points to make for fanfiction.

The sad reality is it's just another dumb plothole JKR put in to solve a plot point for one book and then totally forgot about.
