** Why does AO3 have so many frickin tags, makes looking for relevant things a tad difficult.

Authors seem to include some tags just for the hell of it, even if it isn't even in the story.

Hope someone with more patience than me is able to troll through and find the diamonds that probably exist.

*** I LOVE AO3. I read FF for years and I will never go back there. I find it impossible to find pairings on FF and I can't stand that comments aren't divided by chapter. I've seen spoilers by accidentally clicking on comments. It's also easier to see if a work is completed on AO3. In general, AO3 is much more user friendly, in my opinion. I don't tend to search by tags on AO3. I search by author or pairing and then filter by kudos so I can start with the best ones.

There are tons of amazing stories there. Warning- I read almost exclusively slash, but if you don't mind that or are looking for slash, I'd be happy to recommend.

**** It sounds like you primarily have issues with the UI and backend setup of FF. I had that same issue but I ended up downloading FF's app which fixed pretty much every issue you list here. Sure reading on a phone screen is not as enjoyable but I think it's a small price to pay. I can appreciate that it might be difficult for you to give FF another shot but I figured I would just throw this out there.

** while sorting by kudos and bookmarks is helpful you're going to get a lot drarry. you can also sort for Gen stories and more specific tags/pairings etc.. the number of tags may seem daunting to look at, but it can be incredibly helpful if you're looking for specific tropes, as many authors tag those as well as warnings beyond just the 'archive warnings' (underage, rape/non-con, major character death, graphic depictions of violence, creator chose not to use archive warnings, and no archive warnings apply) additional warnings an author might add are for eg. 'underage smoking' or 'drug use'. Searching 'parseltongue' will bring up stories where Harry is likely to be using it a lot, or searching 'hp:ewe' will bring up stories that diverge after canons events but before the 19 years later. Pretty much type in whatever you can think of and you'll be able to find a fic that contains it. (it's certainly helpful beyond only knowing if something is action/adventure)

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

** not all of it is complete but LullabyKnell has some really good hp fics that I definitely recommend checking out, as well as the stuff by dirgewithoutmusic, those two are probably my two favourite hp authors over on ao3. the main issue with ao3 that I find as someone who prefers to read gen hp fic is that the majority of the popular stuff on there is very ship heavy so I'd keep that in mind when searching for stuff by kudos or bookmarks.
