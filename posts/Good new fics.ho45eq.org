I'm returning to reading fics after about a year and a half to two years so I'm essentially looking for fics started or updated lots in that timeframe that are good, somewhat long ones.


** linkffn(The Imposter Complex) is a fantastic read and updating.

linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) is dormant but excellent.

If you ever read Alexandra Quick, the fifth book in that series was posted last year after a seven-year hiatus. Highly recommend both it and the series at large.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) was definitely a thing when you were last around but has really taken off and become incredibly popular in the last year.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

** *That Universe Over There* - linkao3(23702959)\\
Harry touched something in the DoM he wasn't supposed to and finds himself on top of a certain school. He notices a little girl there with him. Yoink. Spoilers: That girl is that universe's analogue of him.

Harry is the MoD, forced to take up the Peverell Lordship, has a vault filled with money, and the Goblins /want/ to help him. But does he use this? Hell no, he's anti-social, and the Goblins grin all the time which frankly scares him.

Ivy (Fem!Harry) is an experience of itself. She's like Fred&George, the Marauders, Hagrid, Charlie, Bill, and Hufflepuff rendered down into one person. And dosed with cocaine. She turns Hogwarts on its head. And may or may not have a Hufflepuff Army.

*Reading the Books* ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118][series link]])\\
*Reading the books - Sorcerer's Stone* (first entry) - linkao3(24609685)\\
Stereotypical "the cast reads the books" series. Except this one is currently in Year4 and updates fairly regularly. The reactions are both realistic and hilarious. Things are happening because of the book reading. Fudge is starting to find his brain. Sirius was exonerated. And Harry has a new girlfriend.

** linkffn(Protection: The Sword and the Shield) is a really good use of both tropes and the author's imagination. Lots of lemons and basically a harem protag Harry Potter.

linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) has a bit of an abrupt start but is utterly amazing incorporating so much magic and mythology and character/world building in a way that is such a page turner.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Potter Grimoire) is a story where Harry gets the Potter Grimoire from Sirius. Unique and interesting family magic is a large part of this story.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
