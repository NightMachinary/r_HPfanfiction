I'm looking for fics where Harry travels back in time and, while nudging things along a bit, doesn't integrate himself into the world like a normal person. He stays out of the public and private eye, doesn't make friends, doesn't join hogwarts or the Order or whatever, but instead is a stranger who interferes only when necessary and does his very best to keep his entire existence a secret.

I'm also looking for fics where Harry travels back in time from other people's perspective. Doesn't matter what era or who it is, just as long as the PoV isn't Harry himself.

Any help is appreciated, thank you.


** Try the linkffn(lone traveller by dunuelos) series

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

** Not quite the same, but you might like reading linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff), which has someone with foreknowledge who just goes and does her own thing.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
