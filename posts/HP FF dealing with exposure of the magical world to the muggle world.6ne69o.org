This is a loose request based upon curiosity. I was recently reading a fic where the wards around the British wizarding world were failing due to issues relating to the after effects of the war with Voldemort. Wards fell around a wizarding location in London and due to the chaos in the post war world, it wasnt able to be covered up. The muggles were exposed to a magical location and the remains from a magical disaster. While the story doesn't expand, it got me curious as to the results of such an exposure, especially if it was a strange one such as the one described.

So I am looking for Fan Fiction dealing with the muggle world becoming aware of the magical world. Perhaps not all at once as thats less interesting but maybe looking at it from a muggle scientific point of view where the muggles try and figure out what the hell is going on as they discover something like the story above described. Perhaps the magical world is in pieces and cant prevent it or fix it.

I am open to all sorts of suggestions provided they exist. Of note.... I am aware of some fan fictions dealing with the magical and muggle world already being aware of each other or working together in war. I am looking for something a bit different.... more the actual discovery or exposure process. Any thoughts or suggestions?


** Mm, I'm actually sitting on an idea at the moment; one where, after a divergence where Diary!Riddle and the basilisk escapes the Chamber and petrify Ron along the way, he's un-petrified in the far future after his body is discovered and excavated by muggles interested in why he hasn't decomposed.

After waking up, Ron learns that...well, I haven't figured this part out yet. Something something magic disappeared/suppressed, formerly-magical-creatures exposed, Ron's the only one who was 'alive' in the time magic vanished, so he goes with an archeological expedition to the ancient ruins of the Ministry of Magic to try and reconstruct how they made time travel work and go back in time to before he was petrified to try and set things right and stuff.

**** Because I'm bored of Ron being sidelined and/or bashed in all the fics I read, mostly. And his being born and raised in the magical world means he can have more interesting talks with muggles. And, given the Chamber of Secrets is difficult to access, he, Gilderoy Lockhart, or Harry are the best bets for a) not being discovered and unpetrified and b) surviving long enough to be excavated a few centuries in the future.

It's a series following Albus's years at Hogwarts. I've finished the first book and I'm midway through the second book so I don't really know how much it focuses on the muggles discovering the Wizarding World.

I don't think it meets all of your requirements, sorry.

A fic written in essay format. Perhaps not exactly the fic you are looking for because even though Muggles gets exposed to magic, it's not uncontrolled. Harry Potter deliberately, in a controlled manner, brings the magical and muggle world together and then exposes magic. After everything happens, Hermione Granger writes an essay about it named 'Disillusion'. This fic is actually this essay.

**** It's not a perfect story by any means, but I still think it's one hell of a ride. The reason it's not recommended as much is probably because it's pretty old. But in my opinion, this story has one of the best Voldemorts of any other fic I've read. He's truly scary here, and I think that's what makes it so memorable to me. I also thought the integration of the muggle world was done very well. Muggles were neither shown as superior in their technology, nor idiots that need saving. It's a good balance, and they work side by side quite well from what I remember.
