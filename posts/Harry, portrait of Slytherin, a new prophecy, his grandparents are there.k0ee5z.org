:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Oh god, I can't for the life of my remember much about this fic. All I can really remember is that Harry's grandparents and parents are alive bc he's in an alternative dimension or time. There is a portrait of Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin and they're somewhat heavily involved bc apperantly Harry is, AGAIN, the child of a prophecy. Then there is a rumor about Harry being the bastard son of his grandfather and they have to tell the truth to his grandmother bc for a while they were pretending he had some other relation or whatever.

I know this is basically nothing to go off on, it's barely snippets of the fic but if if it rings a bell to anybody please please help me!


** That sounds like Passageways to me, where Harry meets Bellatrix in the RoR [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways]]
