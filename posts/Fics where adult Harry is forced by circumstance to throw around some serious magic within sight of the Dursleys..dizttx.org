I'm not sure that I've ever seen this done. I've seen fics where adult Harry invites the Dursleys into his own home and goes far out of his way to accommodate them by hiding everything magical and making sure nobody uses spells while they're there... but none where Harry uses a lot of magic in front of them for whatever reason. That seems odd to me.

Maybe he has reason to pay them a visit then gets ambushed as he's leaving, or something.

Any recommendations?


** Well, something akin to this happens in linkffn(11994595), where we see all of this through adult Dudley's eyes. Its a heartwarming fic honestly, and I'm generally pretty cold about such things.

** There are a few fics where a lot of magic is cast within sight of the Dursleys, but none explore the impact it has on them (usually Vernon and Dudley get trashed for attacking Harry or you have a magical makeover for Harry's room). "Summer of Change" has elements of that, but it hasn't aged well over the past decade.
