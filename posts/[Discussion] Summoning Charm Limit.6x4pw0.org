In book 7, we saw Hermione use the Summoning Charm to get Dumbledore's Horcrux books. So here's my question, how far can this be taken?

If I'm in a library and I "accio book on horcrux", it should work. What if I "accio book on immortality"? My intent is clear, but would the spell recognize it? Another example: "accio book with cure to curse on Dumbledore's hand". Would that work? If such a book did exist, would it be summoned? What about "accio book with answer to my homework question"?

Imagine if I print out all possible Powerball numbers and cut them up into strips. Would "accio 2019 winning powerball number" work? I don't think so, since that knowledge does not yet exist. However, what if I say "accio 2010 winning powerball number"? That knowledge already does exist. Would the magic know?


** I'm in Hogwarts library and I cast "Accio book on horcrux", there is no reaction from Hogwarts library. Meanwhile, in a certain library at Durmstrang...

Okay. Let's see on harry's Fourth day. He casted "Accio Firebolt", without indication of it being his. Though, in his training for summoning and the event itself, if I don't mess it up with fanfic, there is a need for him to picture the concept of the object coming to him, the specific object.

Wiki says this, too.

#+begin_quote
  The Summoning Charm could not be used on buildings.[3] In addition, it will not work on living things, although they may be moved by summoning an object they are wearing or holding. It is risky to summon them that way, because they travel at close to the speed of light and may be injured in the process.[4],[5] The only known exception to the rule are Flobberworms, which were generally not considered worth Summoning.[3]

  The farther the desired object was from the caster, the harder it was to Summon. However, there was apparently some controversy over this claim, as Hermione Granger stated that it did not matter how far away the object was --- so long as the caster had it clearly in mind, they should be able to Summon it with ease.[6]

So, can you even picture the winning number? You have no knowledge of the winning number, unless there's an information from the future.

*** I'm sorry, this isn't relevant to the discussion outside of what should be considered canon, but this really bothered me:

#+begin_quote
  they travel at close to the speed of light

This is why I can't take JKR afterthoughts seriously. Disregarding the fact that this isn't even close to the described behavior of summoned objects in the books (demonstrated by Harry having to wait a perceptible amount of time for his summoned Firebolt). Why would anyone need any sort of destructive curse when you could generate cataclysmic levels of energy by summoning (or banishing, presumably) any mundane object.

Let's assume you summon a chocolate frog that weighs 50 grams, and that "near light speed" is a conservative 0.5c. If we ignore the effects of something [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][moving at relativistic speeds in atmosphere]], your chocolate frog would, when it stops abruptly in your hand, release energy on the order of [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=kinetic+energy+of+a+.05kg+mass+moving+at+.5c][166 /kilotons of TNT/]], about 10x the energy of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

This rant may have gotten out of hand.

**** I disagree with the "afterthought" as well, for, like you said, the fact that Harry had to wait for his Firebolt.

However, I think you're overanalyzing the last bit (though it's a beautiful thought).

This is a world where wizards and witches can travel from place to place instantaneously, or a triple-decker bus can go across the country in a few minutes. I know "magic" is hardly an acceptable answer, but... If you're going to complain about after-canon reasoning by the author, there's quite a few during-canon story concepts that are begging you to bend over.

**** That's funny. I'd read a fic where summoning charm and banishing charm can just casually obliterate the user and enemies.

**** It was a banishing charm, which has no such apparent limit. And, of course, to quote Snape: "Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells."

** I think you miss the simplest explanation. It's the caster who have to know. Spellcasting seems to be closely linked to the caster's mind. Hermione knew what horcruxes are, that's why her spell could summon books about them.

** linkffn(Core Threads) explores this at one point. Of course, the magic system in it is massively AU, but its explanation is that the Summoning Spell needs precise instructions and mental image for a weak wizard, but that the more magic you push into it, the more independant it will become.
