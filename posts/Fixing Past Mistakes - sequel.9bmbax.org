  Sequel to Fixing Past Mistakes. Now that the past mistakes had been fixed what of the future? Will Harry be able to secure a growing legacy as he ages? Will Dumbledore find out who they are and make life uncomfortable or will he only realize who they were when they are gone never to be seen again...what about Voldemort? Has he already returned working in the shadows or not?
