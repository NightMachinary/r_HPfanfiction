(Doesn't have to be Harry who is sick or injured, though it can be).

Anyone can be the main character/can be on any site/can be any length/can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc.

No Ron abusing Hermione, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.


** Linkffn(alternative medicine) harry gets cursed after killing voldy and Hermione padma and parvati smuggle him to India to treat him. I forget why they had to basically kidnap him though. It's a bit mature butba fun read even if it's not finished

  Harry is struck down by a nasty curse that requires some non-traditional medical care in South India. Hermione, Padma, and Parvati volunteer to assist in his care, and a menage-a-foursome is born. Harry/multi.

** The Refiner's Fire: [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=8104&textsize=0&chapter=1]] (not sure whether the bot does SIYE links).

In the first quarter of this fic, Harry catches the titular disease. Ron, Hermione and Ginny are the ones to predominantly nurse him back to health.

There's no bashing whatsoever, it's Harry/Ginny* and Ron/Hermione, and it's a completed fic written pre-Deathly-Hallows - might even have been pre-Halfblood Prince.

*The first part of the fic has Harry paired with an OC Muggle girl, but it's on SIYE for a reason.

EDIT: Let's try whether SIYE links work. linksiye(8104)\\
EDIT2: They totally do. Good to know.

  In the summer before his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns to come to terms with the death of Sirius. As he heals and grows emotionally, he learns how to enjoy life again. But there's a war on, and Voldemort's primary objective is to kill Harry Potter, by any means necessary. As a result, Harry and his friends have a very adventurous sixth year at Hogwarts. Canon-based with some OC. HG, RHr, RT.

  Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG
