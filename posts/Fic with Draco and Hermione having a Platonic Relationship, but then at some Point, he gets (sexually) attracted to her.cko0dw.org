The title says anything. Both are "good" friends, without any romantic or sexual feelings between. But at some Point Draco begins to get sexually attracted to her.

​

The following passage, is what i imagine and doesnt have to happen at all:

​

/Both of them are alone and maybe sitting on a Couch. Draco decided to confess what he feels to her./

"/Hermione", the addressed Person was looking into his direction, signaling, that she has his attention. "I think...im attracted to you...well, not romantical i mean, i mean...physicaly."/

/Hermione blinked, then she said "you mean, you are somehow...attracted to me....in a sexual way?" Draco felt his Face heating up, Hermione continued "you mean, you are getting turned on, when you are next to me?" She said this in her typical analytic Behavior and Draco was afraid, that because she didnt show any emotions, that her next move was to slap his Face and leave./

/"I....yeah...i think so. I-Im sor-" he was about to apologize, when she suddenly moved, not in a fast manner, but actually normal...or sensual. She was looking at him from the Corner of her eye and put on a seductive smile. Even her Voice turned into a seductive one: "do you want to sleep with me?"/

/Totally suprised by her response, he wasnt able to answer. She moved on and came closer to him, still with this seductive smile on her Face, she put her hand on his Leg for support, when she was lending over to him and kissed him. Draco hesitated at first, but her further movement and the slight traveling of her Hand (although it wasnt actually leaving its place) what was get him back to reality and he kissed her Back./

thats what came into my mind. I dont know if this seductive or suggestive Behavior would be "typical" or OoC for her, but i wouldnt mind. They would continue to have fun, but only have fun, as both agree that there is only the physics, that catch the other ones attraction.
