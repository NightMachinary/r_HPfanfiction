Does anybody know any Harry Potter fanfics that are political or Wizengamot based. I'd prefer if it's Nuetral or Dark sided because I'd be happy with seeing Dumbledore on trial. By politics I also don't mind the ones that are traditional (follow the Most Ancient and Most Noble Lord stuff). I've read many different fanfics that are based like this (Black Fortunes, The Guile and Devotion of a Black Heir, A Marauder's Plan, etc). If there's slash I don't want Harry/Fleur or Harry/Severus (especially!). Thanks!


** Well, it's not exactly dark, but I've written "Democracy"; which follows Neville as he takes his seat in the Wizengamot and faces a reform movement that would destroy his family's heritage, as he sees it.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
