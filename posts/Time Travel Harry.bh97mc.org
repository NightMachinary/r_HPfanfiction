I am looking for some well written Time Travel stories where Harry travels back to the 1940s and attends school with Tom Riddle. Gen or Slash is preferable but well written Het will also be accepted. Bashing is fine with me as is MOD!Harry and LordOfEverything!Harry. I have read Lord of Time, Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat, and Past's Player by the Fictionist.

  Harry Potter is the Master of Death and Lord of Time through his joining of the three Hallows together. During a duel that wasn't going well, he jumps to the 1940's and has a talk with the true Master of Death. Can harry prevent the destruction that will occur? Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP?

  “This is Mr Riddle, one of our Slytherin prefects. I'm sure he'll make you feel right at home. Mr Riddle, this is Harrison Peters. He's just been sorted into Slytherin and will be joining you in sixth year,” Dumbledore announced jovially, though Tom could see that sliver of constant suspicion in his gaze that had never quite faded.“Harry,” the boy hurried to correct. “Just Harry.”And then he stuck his hand out. How... plebeian, Tom noticed with delight. Walburga would probably faint.

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]] - (DEAD) The author did a great job portraying Harry's moral dilemma in this fic. It's unfinished, but I recomend it anyway because the part that exists is substantial and high quality.

The Carnivorous Muffin has several great fics with this trope. I love the way she writes Tom Riddle.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] - (Complete) Probably the most unique version of this trope that I have seen.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12793151/1/When-Harry-Met-Tom][When Harry Met Tom]] - (Updates frequently) Fem!Harry is the time traveler, but she's not a damsel or a romantic like in most versions of this trope.

  In his fifth year Tom Riddle discovers his destiny and meets the cold, alarming, and bizarre transfer student Harry Evans. But sometimes things unravel in ways we do not expect. Time Travel.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  Harry is accidently transported fifty years back in time through a fluke with the mauraders map. Here he runs into and befriends Tom Riddle, hoping to find his only weakness. No Slash.
