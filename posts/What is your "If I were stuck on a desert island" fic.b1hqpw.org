  Harry put us to catching the seabirds because I guess we were good at it. Just Accio a bird out of the sky, or stun it or something. It's not hard. Some others, guys and gals who knew the bubble head charm and how to cast spells underwater, he set to fishing. And you know, we actually managed to catch something.

** I can't pick one fic for the rest of my life, because my favourites change over and over again. But for a desert island at this moment it would be Chemistry and Timing by TheBookBully.

** linkffn(7860277)

Chemistry and Timing. It's a Hermione/Remus fic where Hermione is an Unspeakable and ends up traveling back in time to the beginning of her third year at Hogwarts. She runs into Remus at the Ministry, she ends up going to Albus, who hides her at Hogwarts in Remus's suite of rooms while she researches how to go back.

The relationship between the two is great but what really got me was the combo of not only how Hermione knows everything that is notable that happens that year, but also how it's not a teenager Hermione / a teenager Remus. Hermione is in her early 20's and Remus is 34. It's a refreshing take on the time travel trope with some world building around time turners thrown in for good measure. I could reread the time with Hermione in the past joyfully fifty times over and never be bored.

*** I think the most amazing thing about the fic is how Hermione and Remus switch places in terms of who knows what is coming up (kind of) after she leaves the past, and how the relative-past gets replayed throughout the story and it means something different every time. It shows you Remus' journey through time the slow way, something completely neglected in most time-travel stories where Hermione returns to the present, and his changing perceptions of Hermione throughout time. And yes, it's an extremely refreshing take on the time travel trope, has some nice time turner world-building, and it's nice that they fall in love as adults.

​

Time for a re-read!

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!

That's still quite the age gap, and depending on just how early into her 20's she is, it still violates the half-age-plus-seven relationship rule.
