So a long time ago I read this fanfic on fanfiction.net where Harry worked in a tile store, was artistic, had a muggle girlfriend on Privet Drive whose family was attacked and killed by deatheaters. I want to read it again but don't remember what it was called


** Abraxan's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiner's Fire]] (colloquially known as "1001 variations on hospital scenes"). She wrote over a million words in the series, including sequels and side-stories; what you describe is the first 50k or so.
