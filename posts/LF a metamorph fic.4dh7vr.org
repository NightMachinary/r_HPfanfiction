Harry is a metamorph during third year. Hermione and Harry use a timeturner (or they both have timeturners?) but Harry starts repeating whole days, each day pretending to be a different person, and eventually acts as if each of the personalities are separate people.

He eventually is turning up to classes in multiple years, and even has arguments with him/her self.

Anyone remember what it was called?


** Sounds like this chapter:
