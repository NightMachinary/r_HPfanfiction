A lot of AUs of Harry getting raised by someone else typically has Harry turn out fine regardless. Seems like a waste. Harry's got some legit enemies as an infant and near no protection worth a damn, could make for a thrilling and depressing story watching a series of caretakers and bodyguards try to protect the Boy Who Lived and die in the process. And what would that do to Harry mentally? Growing up watching guardians and friends disappear for no reason, only to find out they died for you later? How would that affect him? Anything like this exist? Cause I doubt I could give the idea any justice I think it deserves.

** Harry Potter lost his first set of parents on Halloween Night, 1997. He was quickly taken to his Aunt and Uncle, and only surviving biological family, who rejected him "WE ARE NOT TAKING IN A FREAK!" Aunt Petunia shrieked, and slammed the door, leaving the tiny child next to the milk.

The next parent to go was Remus Lupin, who died defending him against Bellatrix Lestrange. Bellatrix shared a wall with her cousin in Askaban, and Sirius Black was never the same.

Then it was Andromeda and Theodore Tonks, who were attacked in Diagon Alley by a band of the remaining Death Eaters. (Andromeda managed to apparate her daughter, Nymphadora, with a 3 year old Harry, but she splinched herself too badly for the healers at St. Mungo's to save her. Nymphadora was sent to live with her muggle grandparents, but they refused to take in Harry.)

After that it was the Longbottoms, Alice, Frank, and their child Neville, who were driven insane and then killed by Rabastan and Rodolphus Lestrange. A 5 year old Harry hid in his closet and wished not to die with all his heart, and his magic complied.

Then it was Minerva McGonnagall, who took down all 14 foreign Witches and Wizards who wanted The Boy-Who-Lived for their own. Once the dust settled, a 8 year old Harry Potter woke to an empty kitchen and a blood-stained garden.

After that it was a 3 year bloodbath of muggle parents with modified memories who lasted long enough for the next family to be arranged, and for assassins to catch up with the battle scarred 11 year old named Harry Potter. He never lasted long in the muggle houses, but he remembered all of their names for years after.

He had a brief respite in Hogwarts, but the Weasley's were kind and welcomed him with open arms, so they died for that. All except a 14 year old Ron, who Harry & Hermione dragged behind them. Harry was battle-scarred and Hermione was brilliant, but Weasleys were kind, so they died anyway.

Then it was Dumbledore, who died of his own choice, but died all the same. Hermione brought Harry to her house and sent her parents to Australia 2 years early. They died anyway, intercepted at an airport by a very much insane Bellatrix, but Hermione wouldn't know that for almost 3 years. (After the war she would try to find them, and fail, and check obituaries, and find two unclaimed and un-identified people buried in blank graves by a kind stranger. +She would die before she could claim the bodies+)

They won the war, but only barely, and only because Draco Malfoy was friends with Harry Potter in this world. (he was always a traumatized child, and Harry Potter hadn't been a child since he watched Andromeda Tonks die in front of him at 3. He was kinder in this world, and he took Draco Malfoy's hand this time.)

(Who would've guessed that killing Voldemort was as easy as poison in his supper and basilisk fangs in all his soul fragments?)

There was a fight, of course; Voldemort had an army still, but less people died this time, mostly because there was less people who would die for Harry Potter, who hadn't already.

Nymphadora Tonks, Luna Lovegood, Severus Snape, Lee Jordan, Lavender Brown, Draco Malfoy, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, countless other children whose names were never written on the page, all died.

By the end, Harry Potter was the only one still standing.

But that wasn't new, was it?

  Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

***** It says that in an A/N, yeah. I'd guessed before then, since I'm from there - but live in Scotland now, so the lingo felt weirdly homing. Probably because it also reminds me of being an angry teenager, tbh.

I'm loving the writing so far too - there's so much swearing but it just works. I'm not that far in yet - Harry and Sirius haven't spoken but I can already see they're going to "get along" (in very relative terms).

** I think it's a good toss up whether the kid will have issues or not. Harry could be in a loving family and still struggle with his past (if told about it) and the present, which won't leave him alone. I'd like to see more about him realistically dealing with survivor guilt in a manner that coincides with his savior complex. Normalize having mental health issues even in loving families because I sure as heck know a lot of people with issues that grew up in otherwise normal households.
