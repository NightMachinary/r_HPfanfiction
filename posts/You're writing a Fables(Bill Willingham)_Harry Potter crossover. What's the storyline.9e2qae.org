At first I thought Harry et al would learn about the Fables being a hidden society on Earth then decided that was lame. Instead, our earth is just another world in the fableverse and is invaded by the Adversary in about 2020. A half a million or so magicals mostly muggleborns and their muggle families are able to escape to the fable!earth and are shocked to find themselves in the past for them though not decidedly too far back obviously. They're able to bring Hogwarts, a Russian Goblin bank, a few other things, and a crap load of artifacts. Harry's a more militant bastard having lost Ginny in the invasion and his whole family and he and Hermione lead the research team to figure out how bring the war to the Adversary earlier than in the Fable timeline.

Thoughts? Or how'd you do it.


** Another variant would be harry's much older and immortal when they arrive. Harry's a widower thrice over after outliving them into old age and comes to a realization that fables are immortal after another fable survives a headshot. He is bigby's deputy when the wolf decides it's time to go on walkabout and harry becomes the new sheriff. A slowburn romance begins between him and a fable as bigby leads a group of wizards, goblins, and house-elves to find them a secluded spot to build fabletown!wherever in seclusion from the mundys/muggles and harry influences the timeline somewhat differently due to his magic instead of bigby's abilities.

** I like the idea, but not the time travel aspect. Keep Fable-Earth and HP-Earth on the same timescale, and have the Adversary move in before Voldemort has a chance to become a threat. By the time Voldemort was defeated in canon, instead the wizards are on the run and end up in Fabletown just in time for Fables canon to begin (roughly, the Fables timeline is kind of a mess).
