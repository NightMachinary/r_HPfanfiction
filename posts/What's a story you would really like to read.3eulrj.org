Overused challenges taken a different direction, a twist you've thought of but never seen written, an interesting magical theory that could be fleshed out into a story - what idea would you like to see turned into a story?


** I've posted this plot bunny before, but, somewhat inspired by /The Arithmancer/, an AU where Hermione is an agriculture and life sciences whiz who wants to be just like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug][Norman Borlaug]] when she grows up. Because Hermione tends to get very single-minded about things, she ends up running where Hagrid fears to tread. Some possible snippets:

--------------

"A question?" McGonagall nodded at the bushy-haired Ravenclaw ("Hermione Granger, first-year, Ravenclaw, Muggleborn", class management magic told her) in the front row.

"Professor, is this pig fertile?"

"Pardon me?"

"I mean, if this Transfigured..." the girl leaned forward to see over the edge of her desk, "hog mates with a sow, could it sire an offspring? What if it mates with a Transfigured sow?"

Several students snickered, and McGonagall gave the class her patented glare until the snickering stopped. This girl would not be the first Ravenclaw to try to disrupt the class with puerile questions that they thought were clever. And yet, the girl was not snickering with others, but looking eagerly, waiting for an answer. Perhaps it was honest curiosity combined with childish innocence? She decided to give her the benefit of the doubt; this time.

"That's a very interesting question, Miss Granger." The girl beamed at the praise. "As you will learn, there are five principal categories of things that cannot be created by Transfiguration, and the first one is that which creates or nurtures untransfigured life. Usually, that refers to food, but the seed of a Transfigured plant --- or a Transfigured hog --- is sterile." She was surprised to see the girl's face fall in disappointment.

"Any other questions?"

The girl her raised her hand again.

"Miss Granger?"

"Professor, when you are transformed into a cat, are you cross-fertile with cats or with humans?"​

--------------

"It's probably a myth. I spent two weeks keeping Neville's toad on top of an egg, and all I got for my trouble was a morbidly obese toad and a rotten egg."

--------------

"On the one hand, Draco should not have provoked the hippogryph. On the other hand, it's a dangerous animal that attacks humans and should, therefore, be put down. Also, I GET TO DISSECT A HIPPOGRYPH! I can finally figure out just how its wings are anchored to its skeleton!"

~~~

"Mister Macnair, sir, could I trouble you to use the Killing Curse rather than an axe to destroy the hippogryph? There's less organ damage that way."

"Cast your own magic, little mudblood."

"If you insist... /AVADA KEDAVRA/!"

"..."

"What? When an experimental animal has to be sacrificed, it should be done in the quickest, least painful manner that preserves its scientific value. The Killing Curse is ideal for this. Now, --- /WINGARDUM LEVIOSA/ --- does anyone want to join me for the necropsy of this specimen? It should be fascinating. Why're you all staring at me?"

~~~

"Crookshanks may have wings now, but cats are allowed and birds are allowed, so of course he's allowed! ... Fine, yes, those are bat wings. Crookshanks is an indoor cat, and bat wings provide more maneuverability. If he ever decides to start flying outside, I'll replace them with bird wings."

--------------

"And after trying it, I discovered that the Imperius is perfect for restraining experimental subjects when I need them conscious. All the other methods cause pain or discomfort, or use dangerous drugs, but they love the Imperius!"

"Killing Curse, and now Imperius?! Gonna learn the bloody Cruciatus next, Granger?!"

"Of course not, Ronald! What sort of a horrible person do you think I am?!"​

--------------

"You didn't know that Hagrid and Madame Maxine were half-giants? Just look at their teeth!"

--------------

"So I thought, 'Why not cross-breed Devil's Snare and wheat? I could solve world hunger!'"

--------------

"And then, I spent a week and a half volunteering at St. Mungo's. I quit after I saw an elderly witch succumb to Dragon Pox."

"That's so sad." Hermione's interlocutor offered a hug.

"Oh, no, it's OK. It's why I volunteered in the first place: I can now study thestrials properly, and nobody had to die who wouldn't have died anyway."​

--------------

Anyway, I don't have an overarching plot, and I have no idea how it would interact with the Voldemort vs. Harry thread, but here's vaguely how I see Hermione's relationships developing:

- Hermione, under the Sorting Hat, wants to be a Gryffindor, because she wants to go out and Change the World like Norman Borlaug. The Hat points out that wizarding world doesn't really need to be changed this way due to lack of food scarcity, and recommends she go to Ravenclaw to learn what wizards know about life sciences and see how she might advance and apply that. Hermione agrees and goes to RAVENCLAW.
- She has no close friends in Ravenclaw, bot no enemies either. Although she is, like Luna, considered highly eccentric, she is also the best student of the year in every subject, so her yearmates make for eager study partners, and sometimes get dragged along on her experiments.
- In the first year or so, what interaction Hermione has with Harry, she has through common acquaintance with Hagrid. She may or may not get involved in the Dragon smuggling plot as a result; nor am I sure whether she'll be involved in the PS plot.
- She might short-circuit the CoS plot, because her interest in Magical Creatures would lead her to figure out that it's a Basilisk soon after the first Petrification and the roosters, though what happens with Tom Riddle's Diary is an Author Degree of Freedom.
- She is aware of the Ban on Experimental Breeding, but, following Hagrid's example, does some on the down-low, though, of course, she doesn't have as much space to work as Hagrid does. Her interests are therefore channeled into use of magic to alter living creatures.
- Her relationship with Hagrid cools off over time, because, while Hagrid's relationship with animals is that of a Friend to All (and I mean All) Living Things, Hermione, while her notion of what is "cute" and "harmless" is as messed up as Hagrid's, views them as Natural Resources. Though Hagrid's belated exoneration due to her discovery of the Basilisk rekindles their friendship briefly, when Hermione "makes the best of a bad situation" by getting permission to dissect Buckbeak after execution, it's broken for good, especially when it turns out that she's learned the Killing Curse for the purpose.
- The incident with the Killing Curse, though lawful, gives her a bit of infamy; broadly speaking, Slytherins are interested in her, her fellow Ravenclaws are generally OK with it, Hufflepuffs are scared, and Gryffindors are disapproving.
- From dissecting Buckbeak, she figures out how to give Crookshanks wings (and yes, it can fly, because magic).

Not sure where it goes from here; I guess she might get into some sort of a "transwizardism" later: if a cat can fly with grafted-on wings, why not a human? (Though, we know Krum partially Transfigured himself into a shark, so who knows how much of that already goes on?)

I do remember a fic where the killing curse was originally a healing spell to perform euthanasia, which was why the spell can't be blocked, which seems to go well with your Hermione's views on the curse.

**** Yeah, like I replied to the other posts, I like generous interpretations of Hermione's talents and abilities, but this is pushing it. Other than Rule of Funny, one plausible headcanon that I could invoke is that the cognitive requisite for casting it at someone is the /capacity/ to kill them without duress, in cold blood, and without regard for whether they deserve it (though the actual casting does not have to be in cold blood and can be against someone who deserves it). This way, a sociopath like Voldemort could cast it without trouble at anyone, but so could a hardened veteran Auror or a Death Eater; but vast majority of people could not, and fake!Moody's class, in particular, could not.

Borlaug!Hermione would then be unable to cast it at humans and other sophonts, since is not a sociopath and does care about justice, but she has done enough dissections and is sufficiently reconciled to the ethics of animal experimentation that she can cast it at non-sophonts.

**** This was probably a rhetorical question, but I can give you a number of reasons:

- Actual fic would have to go beyond a very selective list of snippets, but would require actual and specific worldbuilding, plot, and characterization, not to mention hard choices of when to derail canon and when not to.

- Most of the fic would not be funny snippets, and therefore less fun to write.

- Me writing actual dialogue with speech patterns and all (as opposed to funny lines by a socially clueless teenage mad scientist) is like squeezing water out of a proverbial stone which has both hydrogen and oxygen in its chemical composition: theoretically possible, but very slow and difficult.

- I have no idea what will happen in the second half of the fourth year and thereafter.

****** Could be done that way too, I guess. The snippets still need to be integrated into a coherent plot, and actions should have consequences. After the McGonagall snippet, consider what her fellow students would think about her, not to mention McGonagall. /We/ know that she Hermione was just sincerely curious. /They/ don't. And, while Hermione being all cute and innocent, politely, and a little shyly, asking the Ministry's executioner to use the Unforgivable Psychopathic Murder Curse instead of an axe to kill an innocent and very beautiful animal, before casually whipping out said Unforgivable Psychopathic Murder Curse herself, then inviting those around her to join her for the dissection --- I find the tableau hilarious, but those present would most certainly not.

It's especially fraught since Hermione /is/ getting a powerup over canon, effectively (even before she makes the winged monkeys with freaking laser beams attached to their heads). She has academically ambitious Ravenclaws rather than the reluctant Harry and Ron as her study partners, has the motivation to master advanced spells and potions that she needs in her research as soon as possible (including, but not limited to, the Unforgivables-when-used-on-humans-but-ethically-imperative-when-used-on-lab-animals), and focusing her reading on things that have applications, rather than what Harry's Latest Mystery needs. Also, she kinda sorta steals at least one of Harry's adventures, what with figuring out the Basilisk early (and probably blurting it out in the middle of the Great Hall, prompting an evacuation).

Also, for extra crack, the following line from canon shall be used verbatim: "I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them.", except that it would be the truth.

**** I think that canon Hermione would resent being called a "sidekick", to say nothing of this AU. For that matter, unless she decides that she wants to study the Killing Curse (and resistance to it) or Parselmouths/Parseltongue, Harry would probably be of little interest to her. For that matter, depending on how quickly Hermione derails CoS, Harry might never get outed as one.

I am imagining a reaction on the scale of linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) happening once she blurts out that it's a Basilisk. It's one thing for Hogwarts administration to discover that there /was/ a Basilisk in Hogwarts and someone /was/ letting it out, but that both threats are gone, especially since both Dumbledore and Lucius would rather sweep the matter under therug. It's another to discover that there still /is/ one, in an inaccessible Chamber of Secrets whose location is unknown, with /someone/, also unknown, letting it out. Evacuating Hogwarts until the creature is found probably is, in fact, the only reasonable option.

I was a fan of it until you mentioned the killing curse. Because if you really wanted to stick with canon then, as a Ministry employee, Macnair would have to report her for it. We also mustn't forget that there would be other witnesses than just him to her using the killing curse. Hagrid to name one. Because to quote the wiki:

"Using any of these three curses on another human being, Muggle or wizard, will result in a life sentence to Azkaban, unless there is sufficient evidence that the caster did so under the influence of the Imperius Curse."

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses][Wiki here for source]]

Canon:

"The use of any one of them will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban."

So because of that she'd end up in Azkaban. :/

** 1. A story about Scorpius Malfoy that /isn't/ centered on romance! The idea of a son being blamed for the crimes of his father (I'd imagine the wizarding world became very anti-Death Eater after the war) would be really interesting. How does he rise above it? Does he? Would be cool to see how Scorpius becomes his own man, despite the legacy of his family.

2. Dumbledore & Grindelwald's story, from the time they met leading up to their legendary duel. SUCH an interesting, heart-wrenching tale. Extra points if the author ties Grindelwald's rise to the rise of Hitler- I'm convinced that wasn't a coincidence. Was Hitler Gindelwald's puppet? Did they strike a deal? Was Hitler secretly a wizard?

Magical Relations is really good and pretty funny too if you want to check it out! I really liked all the friendships that formed in that one. And the dynamics between Snape and Harry were pretty entertaining.

** I'd love to see Reptilia28's massively overused "Don't fear the reaper..." challenge given a new twist.

So Harry dies blah blah blah and death sends him back saying his soulmate is "some Granger girl..."

So as we know Harry only think of Hermione as a sister... so that leads to the obvious conclusion that her mum is his soulmate!

I just think it would be pretty hilarious to see Harry chasing after Mrs. Granger (maybe she's divorced or widowed). Would probably be pretty cracky but I've seen that bloody challenge so many times now... it needs a breath of fresh air.

Harry says to death just before he is sent back "You know, I always did think Mrs. Granger was pretty hot"

And death responds too late "What! No! I meant Hermione you idiot!"

We really don't know. But I'm also going to say yes. Lily's sacrifice was just as genuine as in canon. So the protective magic would still work.

#+begin_quote
  If the child survives, would Petunia and Vernon notice it wasn't magical and maybe stop hating it?
#+end_quote

No and no. Their hatred was always irrational and "Muggle!Harry" would have been blamed for things that were entirely out of his control anyway.

#+begin_quote
  What happens with the real Harry? How does his family handle it when he displays accidental magic?
#+end_quote

Real!Harry would grow up the way normal muggleborns do. He would have some weird unexplained events now and then but they would be largely ignored as coincidences until he gets his Hogwarts Letter. Even then he would still be treated as a regular muggleborn.

Statistically speaking the answer is yes. The large majority of people born in British hospitals will end up living in Britain later.

** I'd like to see a (crack) fic that intentionally invokes ALL of the overused HPfanfiction tropes, and then averts every one.

Dumbledore seems to be manipulative and possibly downright evil, but is revealed to be genuinely doing the morally right thing.

A character is confused about why Dumbledore isn't offering him a Lemon Drop (because that's not something he actually does all the time.)

Ron starts with seemingly exaggerated negative characterstics (including obsession with food), but shows significant positive character development.

Hints at developing romantic Dramione, Snarry and other common pairings which get absolutely shut down in favour of more conventional pairings or no specific pairings. Sirius and Remus make out drunkedly, and regret it afterwards (they're both straight.)

The word "ward" for protective enchantments (not mentioned in canon but a staple of fanfiction) is mentioned in passing, but it's made clear that it's not a common term in the British magical world (perhaps it's an Americanism that is slowly gaining traction in the UK.)

Fred and George try, and fail, at completing each other's sentences (As a twin, I fucking hate this trope.)

Volermort almost gets made to look exceptionally stupid, inept, and manically insane- and then retaliates showing his nous, power and ruthlessness.

etc, etc.

It wouldn't fit seamlessly - an Ars Magica crossover (both are White Wolf games) is probably more feasible, but the open-ended-yet-stratified nature of nWoD's Mage, Werewolf and Vampire lines is far too appealing to ignore.

I wrote a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=832137&postcount=300][one-shot]] recently (which doesn't make much sense if you're not familiar with the nWoD games), exploring Harry's Awakening to becoming a Mage, and what might happen if the Supernal Realms (i.e. where magic/Platonic forms and such come from) were to slowly but surely fall apart. I'm practically begging someone who knows nWoD better to take it.

To be honest, I'm surprised that hardly anyone has done it before. There are literally three fics of its kind on ff.net, and none of them got off the ground as far as I can tell.

There are lots of moving parts connected to Dursleys adopting anyone but Harry, too. Unless Hermione is known-magical Girl-Who-Lived niece of one of the Dursleys, whose mother was resented by them for having magic, there is no reason for them to fear or mistreat her. Far more likely is a perfectly ordinary middle-class upbringing.

For example, Hermione was probably read to as a child and grew up listening to her parents speak about dentistry which gave her cause to always be looking for information, be inclined to read etc.

Harry likely did not have those same experiences. What I'm saying is that Hermione is associated with smartness but is she really just born smarter? I would be very interested to read your story, especially if they have some kind of awareness of their past selves in some way, like a shadow personality with memories that feel like deja vu or dreams.

I think one important thing to realize is that Harry's mind is effectively being dominated by a Fallen Angel for the first chapter or so (the winged monster is the Angel's form), which actually makes way more sense if you've read DF (its not necessary, though, I read through TDR trilogy without reading DF and it actually felt quite original). Anyways, Fallen have the goal of enslaving their human vessels so they can have a physical presence in the real world. Is Meciel different?

There is quite a bit of the Harry we know and love for the first few chapters. I think they actually capture his childish personality and reasoning quite well. He changes, though, under the guidance of a fallen angel.

"Beloved" is an issue, but I think that is simply what all Fallen call their hosts.

That said, if the general feel of the story irks you, it might not be for you. I'd recommend it because it is one of the best and most refreshing AU experiences to be had, and the quality of action is the best out there in the fandom - up there with Joe's trilogies.

** I've always wanted a multi-fandom crossover where Harry as the MoD cannot die in the sense that his soul gets reincarnated instead of going "to the other side", but he retains his memories and powers. It's been done before to an extent, but what if he accumulated more powers?

Born as a Firebender from Avatar? Trained in The Force by a Jedi/Sith? Ninjitsu from Naruto? A brief stint as a Hollow from Bleach when a resurrection goes wrong?

But the catch is that his memories and powers are 'locked' until his current body dies, but only through violent means, not natural, so getting stabbed would trigger them but dying in bed wouldn't.

But he could also be reborn in our normal world, either in the present or in the past. Doesn't have to be the same gender either.

It would have to be pretty epic in length, or split up his 'lives' into different stories!

Been a dream of mine for a while.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This will never necessarily be "Complete." Now with Xovers and rated T for certain references.

** I would love to read a good female spawn of Voldemort and Bellatrix story.

Most create annoying Mary-sue, super powered, evil but loved, 'super smart' because someone says so (not because they actually act it) characters. They are usually raised by Sirius, or somehow by Voldemort himself, wear cute Slytherin clothes before even going to Hogwarts, are betrothed to Draco and are the one person, other than Lily, adored by Snape.

I *do not* like these stories but I still feel like the idea has some potential. Voldemort could win Bellatrix's loyalty by sexually dominating her because she really really wants him to (that doesn't feel out of character to me?). But she is fairly practiced in Occlumency and hides the pregnancy because she knows he will be displeased. Or she pretends it belongs to Lestrange/ or thinks it actually is his. Anyway, the child can then be raised in many ways being that most of her family will be in prison. She will have to deal with hate/distrust from eventual classmates because of the whole /sins of the father/ thing.

If I were to personally write this story,

- Bellatrix would know it was Voldemort's child and keep him from knowing. She would give birth around/ possibly during his attack on the Potters. Later leaving the baby in the care of Narcissa (who will know that is is actually Voldemort's) when she goes after the Longbottoms.

- Narcissa would send the baby away sometime between Bellatrix's arrest and trial out of panic for her direct family. The child's magic would be bound (important) and she would be placed with a squib family (or something).

- Eventually I want her to end up in the American foster care system (just because - also would excuse my fumbles with speech habits), being moved around for ages. Her bound magic does not really prevent accidental magic but it does block her location for the most part. Dumbledore does not find her until the summer before Harry's 5th year after a magical accident of some kind that gets the attention of American Wizards.

- She is brought to Europe and spends the summer playing catch up. She is to be in Ginny and Luna's year at Hogwarts. Stuff happens.

Eventual plot points

- She is a seer

It would be my goal to create a lot of tension between her and Harry (not sexual!), because they will have similar backgrounds in many ways but to her Harry seems to 'have it all' and to Harry she represents a large portion of what was taken from him.

Her tragic flaws (+)- Envy and jealousy. Need for social approval, preference for independence, blunt, narcissistic, not so talented in transfiguration.

Possible problems:

- Who gets to know of her parentage? Will Dumbledore be aware or just suspect? Will she be aware? How will the Malfoys handle knowing she is in Britain? Will people be able to tell who her parents are? When people find out will they change their attitude about her ie. Neville

- Obviously Bellatrix needs to be unaware of Voldemort's muggle heritage because she hero worships him and I think that would ruin her sexual attraction. But is that reasonable?

- Then the process of transferring to Hogwarts, can she conceivably catch up to fourth year in such short time - even with her impressive parentage/natural talent and possible self teaching?

- If Voldemort finds out about her what will be his response?

- Money, housing, supervision, relationships.

- Big question: Which house? Part of me wants to put her in Gryffindor, the other thinks its only right for an heir of Slytherin to be in Slytherin.

- How does her story diverge from Harry's

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

**** This is because of the Rachel girl in it right? Interesting story concept but I can barely get through it because of the high cheese factor. Thank you for the suggestion though! I suppose I will just have to eventually sit down and write my story concept if I want to read it.
