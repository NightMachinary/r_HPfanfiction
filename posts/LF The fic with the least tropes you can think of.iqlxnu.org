I want those rare fics where you just /can't/ find a trope.


** Old Blood by Oil on Canvas

It's unique and excellent. One of the best fics I've read in recent times. The characterisation and tone is perfect and reminiscent of canon, while the AU is one of the most fresh ones I've read.

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

** In terms of avoiding fanon tropes, Alexandra Quick obviously comes to mind. But that's cheating a bit.

Since it came out 20 years ago, The Phoenix and the Serpent spawned a lot of the AU tropes that have become the bread and butter of some of the popular FFN fare these days, but those ideas were original back when it was written.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

**** No, that's the Draco Trilogy. Alexandra Quick was written later (2007-present) and takes place entirely in America, with three mentions of Voldemort being its only connection to canon events so far.
