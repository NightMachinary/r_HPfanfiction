Couldn't see a discussion for it here but I think it gives a great perspective on Peters courage.

Jokes aside, though, I'd say there are at least three different problems with this interpretation:

1. If he “knew exactly [that] his brand of courage is of someone who is constantly, always afraid, and goes ahead and does it anyways”, then his best choice would've been stepping away from the fighting forces because there was no way for him to be keeping up with them.
2. “Because Voldemort brainwashed him” is a lazy explanation to his character and motives. There is already the overpowered Imperius --- among many other OPed tools that JKR left there without bothering to analyse deeply enough how they will fuck up the flow of the war, both tactically and strategically. Adding yet another one doesn't help reader's suspension of disbelief.
3. It's unbelievable that friends of his whole life (essentially) wouldn't notice that something's askew if the changes in his character leading to his betrayal weren't a gradual thing but happened in some 12 hours,\\
4. I don't think Snape was the only spy Dumbledore had among DEs, and likewise Voldemort would at least suspect their existence. Thus, he wouldn't interrogate Peter surrounded by “quite a crowd of [..] Death Eaters” --- other than trying to make the scene more intimidating for the readers it doesn't serve much purpose.

*** 1) Yeah I think a lot of Peters courage came from other people. It could be argued that being a spy takes a lot of courage but I've seen the arguement before that he was basically safe from both sides.

2) I don't think it's the imperius curse I think its Voldermort using his natural Legilimency against Peter. Again this is using it in a heavy way but Voldermorts powers with it haven't gone into too much detail beside the Black being tortured memory implant so I'll let it slide.

3) Can't argue against this one.

4) Who would you think Dumbledore would have spy?
