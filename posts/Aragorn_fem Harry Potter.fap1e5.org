Hey, I have been reading a lot of lotr/hp fanfics and I have been wondering if there are any good Aragorn/fem Harry fics. All the stories that I seem to pick happens to pair fem Harry with legolas. While I have nothing against the Prince of Mirkwood, I am a pretty big fan of Aragorn and want to read fiction that pairs off Aragorn and fem Harry. They are both badasses and will make a power couple. So,,,,?


** At first I read that as Aragog.
