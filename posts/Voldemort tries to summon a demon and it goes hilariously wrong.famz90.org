Voldemort creates a ritual circle to summon demons from the depths of hell and succeeds in creating the ritual. But, when he actually does the ritual instead of summoning a demon he summons the Devil himself. Enter Lucifer Morningstar. I imagine this to be a crack fic crossover between Harry Potter and Lucifer

*** I didn't know I needed this either and now I cant stop imagining Lucifer just tutting at Voldemort while hes creating his master plans

"I'll just trick a younger student to open the Chamber using a diary that has my horcrux in it, completely capable of communication and manipulation of such a weak mind and release the basilisk on all the muggle-born students! Yes, yes that will work" Voldemort spoke out loud.

"Yes, phenomenal plan there Tom," Lucifer rolled his eyes. "That's until that child throws your diary away into the lake because its talking back to them." He sighed making a motion with his had in dismissal "Try again." looking around in slight curiosity, "Where did you say you had that house elf wine, I've been dying to try some."

**** To be fair, it was implied that Lucius did that whole giving Ginny the diary thing on his own, and that Voldemort just expected Lucius to keep it safe. Or at least Dumbledore speculated that he did.

I nonetheless love this.

**** "Ah yes, Tom, what a brilliant plan. There are only two things that can destroy a Horcrux, and only one of them requires casting Dark Magic. You might as well walk through the veil yourself while you're at it. Idiot."

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

***** Yeah! I'd been reading the other one shots by the author and they were mostly crackfics. I didn't read the category descriptions, and kept waiting for it to get funny.
