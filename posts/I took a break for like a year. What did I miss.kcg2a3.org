  Summary: The end was only the beginning for Severus Snape. After that, there is a clarity to be found and one can see things as they really are, not how one imagined them to be. This story picks up during the Deathly Hallows at the scene where Snape has just been bitten by Nagini and has been left for dead by Voldemort. This will be more of a character study of Snape.

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift) started in October 2019, so you might not have seen that. It's a Harry/Hermione that really respects all the characters, including both Ron and Ginny, definitely no bashing here (except arguably Cormac McLaggen, but that's canon). It even lets Lavender contribute more and gives Ron/Lavender a real go.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]] has written a few more one-shots this year and and a slightly longer fic that has Matilda Honey at Hogwarts (but her presence doesn't significantly alter canon, which I was disappointed by).

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.
