** It was the greatest trick since Loki himself had spoiled the feast. The reserved and for the cause son of the most accident house, moonlighting as a common singer of questionable blood.

The man himself was resting as dragon pox slowly sapped away his will. He had had a long life, two in fact and while he was not always proud of his actions he was proud of who he had become. An entertainer, a man who could bring families together, tug on heartstrings with a magical melody that took you back to first loves and dandelions in the sun. He might have made mistakes in the past but stubby had found peace in music.

As he took his last breath the healer could swear she heard a whisper ‘See Siri, first rule of pranking. Don't get caught.'

** “Re-Regulus? What are you- How-“ Sirius Black stuttered in astonishment, frozen in his seat, eyes darting between a confused Stubby Boardman and Xeno Lovegood.

“I was out with my Luna earlier today, chasing after stray nargles- they really should stay where they need to be, you know- and bumped into Mr Stubby Boardman right here.” Xenoph-something Lovegood stared into the distance as if in deep thought, the whole time, Stubby Boardman sat in the seat opposite to Sirius and glanced around confusingly.

“So, erm, could anyone care to explain?”

** Kreacher popped away from the cave to fulfill Regulus's dying request to destroy the locket leaving his Master in the cave reliving his worst memories from the Drink of Despair he drank.

His thirst growing, he looked at the lake water longingly, even knowing what lay beneath the surface. After what seemed like an eternity of resistance, he crawled the the edge of the island and put his lips in to drink.

After a few gulps of water a grisly hand broke the surface of the water grabbed his mane of black hair pulling him below the surface. Panicking, he broke the iron clad grip of the inferius and swam back to the surface. As soon as his head broke the surface, he found himself in the middle of the lake and he looked desperately for somewhere to go. On the edge of his vision, he spied the boat to take people to the island.

Putting his head in the water to swim made him panic even more as he saw inferi climbing o top of each other to reach the surface. That they couldn't just float up was the only thing keeping him from being immediately mobbed. When he got to the boat, he flung himself inside breathing a sigh of relief.

That moment of relaxation cost him.

Two inferi broke the surface on either side of the boat grabbing his left arm and right leg and pulling. Not being able to break free in either direction he fell back into panic mode. Grabbing with his free hand to the bottom of the boat he tried to... do... something. He could feel his arm and leg stretching... tearing... With a monumental feat of accidental magic, he apparated.

Regulus had oy recently received his apparition license. Most of his friends had received it when they were 17. When he had his first test, he left behind 3 toes and part of his right bicep. His second test, he went a mile away from his target area. He passed on his 5th try.

So when under the influence of the Drink of Despair, half drowned, and being torn apart by inferi, he was lucky to survive.

The next morning on the edge of a small Wizarding village in Southern Ireland, a man was found missing an arm and leg, clutching the keel of a small boat.

The man didn't speak and had lost a lot of blood. The local healer did the best he could to patch him up, but since he couldn't speak, they were unable to find where he had left his limbs and to make it worse, there were traces of dark magic at the severed spots to make healing more difficult. The healer flooed St Mungos, but being in the middle of a war, they couldn't spare anyone for an unknown accident victim all the way out in Ireland.

So regulus, out of his mind, severely traumatized and out of his mind, lay in the local hospital, for weeks before he said a single word. The first thing he ended up saying ended up being a lullaby he was sung as a child. Not by his mother of course, but by Kreacher who had loved him like one of his own. He sang the lullaby over and over. Eventually he spoke to the healer, but couldn't remember anything except that lullaby that he would sing to himself before sleeping.

One night, a band, traveling through the town had a particularly rowdy show that ended up with the entire band and a few members of the town ending up in the hospital ward for various injuries and alcohol poisoning. As the lead guitarist was falling asleep he heard Regulus's lullaby while it was scratchy, it was also a very good voice.

When he woke up, he asked the healer who he was. The healer responded, "Even he doesn't know. He arrived in town missing two limbs and clutching part of a small boat. We think it was part of a shipwreck, but we haven't heard of any ships sinking."

The guitarist known by Pokey by everyone for his long nose and sexual indiscretion with groupies went over to talk with the man.

"You have an amazing singing voice," said Pokey without any preamble.

Regulus stared for a moment at the first person other than the medical staff to talk to him before looking sad and saying, "it's the only thing that I can remember. I keep hoping that something else might come back, but it's just that one song. Not even my name."

There was silence before Pokey said, "Well, people call me Pokey, no relation to the horse."

Regulus stared blankly.

"I'll tell you about that sometime. My Drummer, Shirley, is going to be here for a few days getting some of his bones regrown, so how about I teach you a few more songs to sing. How about that?"

Regulus gave a small smile said, "That sounds like a good plan."

"Well, if we're going to hang out, you're going to need a name." Pokey thought long and hard, but not that long or that hard. "I'm going to call you Stubby"

--------------

3 days later Regulus left the hospital with Pokey, Shirley, and a bagpiper named Toots.
