"/As she moved forward into the room, Mrs Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder./"

This is how she is described in the text. But it sounds bland. I'm writing a bit and she may enter my story and I also dabble in digital art so I might 'paint' her.

What do you Potheads imagine her as? Bellatrix but kinder with browner hair and wider eyes? Or the trope-ish aristocratic woman who married beneath her? (Which is canon anyway.)

EDIT: I don't mind suggestions and comparisons with similar characters from other novels and films or even descriptions of other older females from HP. I'm open to all.

Thanks,

TheGeneral.


** When I think of Andromeda I don't think of kindness...I'm sure it's there but that is not her defining trait. I think of confidence, defiance, willingness to stand by her principles. Sirius' bravery to standing up to his parents is lauded (as it should be) but Andromeda was an even better example. It's one thing for Sirius to become a Gryffindor and reject the pureblood dogma but Andromeda married a mudblood for goodness sake.

She is just as fierce (maybe more) than Bellatrix...just less insane and less aristocratic because it is clear that she rejected those tropes.

*** Yh, I'm thinking of a harsh kind of traditionalism - she's described as haughty so that would make sense, especially as the daughter of a Pureblood fanatic clan. I can imagine Nymphadora and her husband wearing her down though.

Interesting, I never thought about it like that - and more so because she's a woman, she's the (traditionally) property of the family and is supposed to be 'wedded off'.

As fierce as Bellatrix, brave and less insane seems to sum her up.

** Physically, something like Lena Headey -- I've never been able to imagine Andromeda played by Helena Bonham Carter's twin. I think she's elegant and stubborn, with a lot of warmth for the people she cares about. Very private, overall.

Also, I fundamentally can't get behind the casting for Narcissa

** Sounds great, good luck! I think there are a few things from canon that can be deduced from her.

She gave her daughter a completely ridiculous first name but she did not give her daughter a ridiculous star-name, which would have suited the Black family tradition. With a name like Nymphadora, she must either have quite a wicked sense of humour or be quite stuck up.

I think based on her being the middle child of the family, her date of birth means she was barely out of Hogwarts when she married and had Tonks. Her husband is described as a bit untidy and with a potbelly (I think?), but the books give the impression that she's elegant and well put-together. So an opposites attract situation. She might also be good at either household spells or be very neat in her style of magic, as Tonks says something about her always getting even socks to fold themselves when she magically packs into a suitcase.

Like Bellatrix and Sirius, when she talks she talks 'haughtily' in the books.

*** Yep, the haughty aspect to her tends to be missed in fanfiction depictions of her. It should be subtle but present. We tend to have an idealised version of the people we imagine or like in our heads but they tend to be complex. I can imagine her staring down at muggles. (She married a 'good' one.) Thanks!

** I always think to take Eva Green as Bellatrix and Winona Ryder for Andromeda Black. Naturally I end up with Angelina Jolie for Narcissa.

**** For Eva Green, Penny Dreadful as well as in Franklyn. Angelina because I see Narcissa as very sharp, cold kind of beauty. She is proper, so much that it becomes unsettling.

***** Penny Dreadful looks good, I'll have to take a look. Yes, Eva looks like younger Andromeda/Bellatrix, especially in the black dress - and she says she doesn't want to be known for that lol, it's understandable I suppose.

(Also, she's French!)

What's the Angelina thing? *Oh Angelina Jolie!

Eva in Penny Dreadful reminds me of this: [[https://www.deviantart.com/irenhorrors/art/The-Black-Sisters-464097742]] !!!
