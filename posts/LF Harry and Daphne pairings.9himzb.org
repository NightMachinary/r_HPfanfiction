  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

All of these are Harry/Daphne, a few have Harry-has-child, others are Harry-has-a-"younger"-brother but I haven't read a single Harry/Daph where he either has an older or a younger sister that isn't Harem, and would very much like to read one. (I'm not counting Harry counting Astoria as sister, nor Hermione or Luna, either a blood sister or a way younger kid he "adopted" like in a few fics with McDougal.)
