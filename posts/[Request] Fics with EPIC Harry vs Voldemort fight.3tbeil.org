Any stories with good epic amazing so forth... final one vs one battles. Doesn't necessarily need to be against Voldemort, Grindewald or any other bigbad is enough.

** Well linkffn(3473224) and it's sequels have quite a few amazing battles. Denarian Renegade is also a very good fic, easily among the best.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
