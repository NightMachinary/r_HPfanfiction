Thought it sounded cool.... You can still see the basilisk fine but it can't kill you with its eyes and anyone that looks at you is petrified....


** Why a muggle specifically. Also it seems like seeing it through just about anything works, the issue is more that noone knew it was a basilisk.

There's also the fact that it doesn't actually save you if Riddle actually wants you dead, he wasn't actually trying to kill people in the books (that would close the school down). If he wanted you dead then there's the venom, fangs and massive body to kill you with.

** There is a fic where Harry takes profit while selling mirrors or things like this but I don't remember which; may be a time travel one and or a comedy/parody

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** This is a pretty bad idea for two major reasons:

1. It doesn't matter if the Basilisk sees you. The problem is you seeing the basilisk. You could flip the mirror so that you're only seeing yourself but, really, if you goal is to just blind yourself to your immediate forward-facing path, a one-way mirror seems excessive.

2. Petrification was a good thing, in practice. Say your idea works, and the student notices the giant snake but it can't petrify or “kill with a look” the student to death. What's the basilisks next move? “Aw, shucks, you're so clever! Guess I'll go bother someone else!” No. It'd kill them.

** Idk if that'd work, if you can see the Basilisk's eyes then cursed light is entering your eyeballs..

You could take advantage of the fact that the eyes are yellow and use colored sunglasses that block yellow light but allow you to see blue light.

Happens in linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Although she doesn't make much money from it it does earn her a basilisk skin coat when her invention saves the lives of some curse breakers after she published an article about it.
