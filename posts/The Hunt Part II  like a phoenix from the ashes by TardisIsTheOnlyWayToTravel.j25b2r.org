So, for those that saw my request to find the first part of this series, you will know a kind soul did indeed reply, and through some more work, I found part 3 of this series online somewhere. But not Part 2, which is named as stated in the title. It was exactly 9065 words before it was deleted by the author, along with all their other stories.

With your help, I do think it possible to recomplete this excellent series.

The result so far from part 1 :

** Hey! Thank you for finding the other works, I was trying to read them the other night and was devastated when I saw they were deleted. I don't really use Reddit but I made an account to let you know how freaking grateful I am that you found those links- you're a lifesaver! I was wondering if you had found a link to the second book? I looked through the Wayback site and found the same results as you. I tried looking for other alternatives, but I saw they all cost money and didn't want to try them unless I knew there were no other options. I don't know much about finding deleted sites but if there's anything I can do to help you find a link if you haven't found one already please let me know! :)
