** I am of the belief that he did modify every recipe - maybe not as a student, but after he became a master. If you notice in the books, he never has the class follow the process/ingredients list from the book, he always puts everything on the board.

Edit to add, because reading is hard: I think more than modified recipes for younger years, it's more likely filled with questions. “Why do I need to dice instead of mince?” “What happens if I stir 28 times instead of 30?”

** As someone who defaces my textbooks, there are a few factors in which ones get my brilliant annotations.

1. Intro level texts are less likely, for a lot of reasons, but 2 in particular. First, they rarely need as many revisions. Then, if there's any chance I'm going to sell it for use by a future student, I keep it pristine using sticky notes while I'm studying. In Snape's case, he might have expected to need the money in order to afford the next book.

2. If it's a reference book among my specialties, I'm much more likely to keep it and write in the margins, especially when I disagree with something in the listings or have another source to reference (e.g. "check [other book] for more on this"). This feels more like Snape's /Advanced Potion Making/ book. He might have done something similar with the Charms or Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook, BUT it looks like he put his innovative spells in the /Potions/ book, so maybe not. As for the Year 1-5 text, since it /is/ a lot like a reference with lots of recipes, maybe he /would/ keep it and have some notes, but I would expect dramatically fewer "improvements" than the advanced book. Unsure about the notes unrelated to Potions.

3. Writing in them isn't the only thing you can do to make your books more useful. If the book is absolutely massive, I might just take an exacto knife and /slice out/ each chapter as I need it. I'll either use a binder clip or three-hole punch it or some other way to make it more manageable, and then I can clip/add my essays, assignments, etc to be super organized. This is less common now that so many are /ebooks/ and all my work is digital. But anyway it makes me wonder about the kinds of genius magical study solutions that someone like Snape or Hermione would have come up with.

Good luck with your fic!

** The thing that bugs me about the 'Half-Blood Prince' book is that Snape has come up with all of these subtle alterations and improvements to make potion making easier and more effective, and then failed to teach any of it. Yeah sure, Harry hasn't covered any of the stuff in the book before Snape stopped teaching him potions, but a lot of the stuff seems to be basic principles like how to prepare ingredients and stirring which he could have started teaching from first year, even if it took him until his sixth to work it out for himself. Yet apparently those few notes scrawled in the margin when Snape was seventeen were enough to let Harry completely outshine all of his peers who had been studying under the same person with years more experience for five years.

It would be interesting to see Snape's reaction to seeing what could happen if he wasn't actively sabotaging his teaching.

I see this passed around a lot and I wonder why because the books make a point that Snape puts the instructions on the blackboard. What's to say his written instructions aren't recipes he modified?

​

#+begin_quote
  if he wasn't actively sabotaging his teaching
#+end_quote

In OoTP, Umbridge says his class is advanced and he is teaching them advanced material ("Well, the class seems very advanced for their level, she said briskly to Snape's back. "Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that were removed from the syllabus.") He also expects a high pass rate. There's nothing to suggest that Snape is "actively sabotaging his teaching" as opposed to being a jerk in the classroom because that's his personality.

Harry uses Snape's book/Snape's teenage notes to outperform everyone else who is following a published textbook. Even Hermione who is top of every class except DADA can't do as well as Harry. The point isn't that everyone in the class sucks because Snape didn't teach them well enough; the point is that teenage Snape was a potions genius.

They aren't "a few notes." HBP implies the opposite: "To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions." At this point, you're using the fact that none of the other kids think to deviate from published instructions and make innovative leaps of logic as to what would improve their potions results as proof that Snape taught them badly. It's not the norm to revise your high school textbooks.

**** Sure Snape should not expect all of his students to make the same realisations that he did on their own, but he should at least try to teach it. Also while Snape does seem to have a gift for potions, it is also probable that most of his students are hamstrung in comparison as they associate him with the subject and have all of their enthusiasm drained away. Remember, he is literally Neville's worst fear as shown by his boggart, and nobody is surprised by this or finds a problem with it.

Hermione is convinced Harry is cheating because his isn't following the printed instructions to the letter. Part of that would be Hermione being Hermione, but that implies that Snape has been teaching them to follow the set instructions without question. Even if he had been giving them his modified instructions, this is evidently an objectively wrong way of teaching the subject, as shown by Harry's success. I don't expect Snape to teach everyone to make all of the same improvements that he did by themselves, but he should at least made them familiar with the subject.

Starting in first year he could have taken some common versions of the potions they were making, pointed out his problems with the methods and explained why. Lessons and homeworks on specific preparation methods for common ingredients would help students learn what the differences are and the better ones could then extrapolate this knowledge for whatever they are working with. Then maybe later on he could set essays on ways you could try and improve a particular recipe and what specific affect you thing each change would have. Perhaps after he has checked them to make sure it is nothing dangerous, he could even have a few lessons of the students working from their own modified recipes, to let them get a feel for it.

Maybe if he had done all of this, rather than spending all of his effort in class on terrorising Neville, then Harry wouldn't have been the only one to be even aware of the concept of improving book recipes. Also as an aside, Slughorn is a renowned potions master too, so presumably he is also familiar with adapting his own recipes, and yet he never covers it either.

***** Your post deals with two separate issues with Snape as a teacher: Snape's class curriculum and Snape's treatment of his students. I'll address them separately because they have nothing to do with one another. Snape's failures as a teacher are personality based. He terrifies Neville and makes him anxious. He's petty with Harry. He is mean to Hermione, but that never affects Hermione's class performance. She still gets top marks and does well. Snape's personality is a classroom obstacle. Some kids, like Hermione, can overcome it, although none should have to. The Slytherins don't seem distressed in class. Teaching is its own skill that goes beyond knowing material. Personally, I would say you need empathy and patience to be a good teacher. These are qualities Snape lacks.

About the boggart in particular, you said it yourself, "nobody...finds a problem with it." The entire class laughs when Neville admits he is afraid of Snape, even Neville grins sheepishly. The scene was written as a comedy: Snape is dressed in drag which everyone laughs at. That isn't to say Snape didn't scare Neville, but there's no classroom intervention by Dumbledore or the rest of the staff. Hogwarts is shown as a tough place. If modern teaching standards were applied, there would likely be a number of staff changes. I'd bet Snape, Hagrid, Trelawney, and Binns would be gone, maybe even McGonagall. After all, Neville at age 11 spends an entire night crying when McGonagall took off a huge number of points in PS/SS. She also punishes him for Sirius' break-in to Gryffindor Tower, although Crookshanks was the one who stole the passwords and Sir Cadogan was the one who let Sirius in.

​

I disagree with your interpretation of the curriculum because it's entirely arbitrary.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

But *Harry reverts back to being a bad potions student once he no longer has the textbook*. That means that Harry wasn't able to carry over anything he learned while he had the book to further lessons in spite of the fact that he spent extra time reading it: "Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks..." *This suggests that the tips aren't so simple that you can use them to extrapolate the concepts or theory behind them*.

#+end_quote

How can Harry's success be proof of objectively wrong teaching when Harry and Hermione are doing the exact same thing: they are both following a set of instructions. The difference is that Harry's instructions are better than Hermione's. We also can't call the method "objectively wrong" because Hermione uses it to brew NEWT -level Polyjuice, a potion we are told adults are reluctant to brew, in her second year of school. If NEWTs, which are competence levels set by the Ministry, show advanced proficiency in a subject and advanced proficiency involves correct brewing, then modifying recipes is something beyond NEWT level.

Furthermore, HBP disproves your idea about Hermione only being able to follow potions recipe with no sense of theory. *HBP explicitly proves Hermione does know potions principles.* Slughorn assigns the class an activity where they have to create an antidote for a poison they select from his collection of phials. Hermione tells Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "It's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Harry," she said brightly as she straightened up. "*You have to understand the principles involved this time*. No shortcuts or cheats!"
#+end_quote

​

Your views on the curriculum don't line up with what the books show us:

#+begin_quote
  he could have taken some common versions of the potions they were making, pointed out his problems with the methods and explained why
#+end_quote

This is what I mentioned earlier: there is no indication there are problems with any of the recipes before 6th year. Since the potions turn out well whenever the directions are followed (and there are no second set of directions), we have to assume all the directions before 6th year were perfect. As for pointing out problems and explaining why something went wrong, we see him do something like this in OoTP. He assigns Harry an essay on the correct composition of Strengthening Solution, "indicating how and why [Harry] went wrong" with his potion during class. It's implied Snape will grade the essay.

It's hard to make your claim for what Snape should have taught students when we know so little about what he actually taught students. We know Snape lectures because in CoS Hermione learns about the Polyjuice Potion from him. We know he assigned an essay on the properties of moonstone in 5th year and used a textbook called Magical Herbs and Fungi in 1st year, so your idea that students aren't learning about general properties of potions ingredients isn't supported by the books. We know students have some idea of how to prepare certain ingredients because of that scene in PoA when they are shredding roots. Malfoy, with his injured arm, complains that Ron didn't do a good job of cutting them compared to the way Ron cut his own roots.

In addition, there's nothing suggesting Snape had entirely free reign over his classes. At the very least he is limited to teaching the OWLs rubric. We know there is a Ministry curriculum from OoTP and because of 5th and 7th year examinations, so teachers must need to teach according to the material that will be on the exams. Given that Luna's mother died while experimenting with spells, experimentation might be deemed too dangerous for students.

** The students used the same potions book for years 1-5, and a different book for years 6-7. Snapemight have kept his potions book from school as a reference for his later years, and when he started teaching, that book became his prescribed textbook. We don't know when he started writing in the margins and modifying the instructions. He had many years after his school years to also change them. Many years also as a potions teacher. When you are a student, I am guessing you get to only make a certain potion once as a student. But when you are a teacher, and you teach potions year after year, you have many more chances for iterative improvements after researching the theoretical knowledge about the ingredients, their compositions and how they interact with other ingredients. So I gather Snape compiled his modifications over many years of iterative improvements.

** The two other textbooks that appear as required for the Potions class in the books are: "Magical Drafts and Potions" and "One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi". It's most likely that these two books were used by years 1-5 so I think Snape would have definitely taken notes on them. Not sure if by first year he knew enough about potions to experiment on his own, but probably he did find the Potions class fascinating and wrote down ideas that he heard in class or from Lily (who I believe was also pretty good with Potions) for future reference.

It would be cool though if someone in their first year comes across these two books and awe the entire class with the fact that they are a Potions prodigy.

** I was at Hogwarts during the 1990's.

Typically, Snape would review the textbook, have students make the potion by the book, and then disdainfully explain why we all sucked.

Then if he was in a smirky mood, he'd explain how we had missed the point of the instructions: “The POINT, Futue, is NOT to add chopped skelander. It is to reduce the receptivity of the mixture to astrological influence. Therefore, you want the JUICE of the skelander. If you had sense, you would know this.”

Thanks a heap, Professor. Thanks a LOT.
