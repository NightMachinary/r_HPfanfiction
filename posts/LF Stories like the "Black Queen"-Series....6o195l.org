..by Silently-Watches or "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived" (which is a WBL-Story where Harry transfers to Durmstrang because Hogwarts just isn't to his liking) by The Santi or "A Second Chance at Life" by Miranda Flairgold (all are on fanfiction.net!)

To clarify this:

I'd like well written massive alternate universe stories (at best canon gets trampled for the most part!), that change Harry's personality (I don't care if Harry is genderbent like in the first story/series) and make him more assertive, intelligent and aggressive (not willing to take shit - without just bashing people...real gripes are ok, like disliking Dumbledore for placing him at the Dursleys!), give Harry a different outlook on life (in the first story I mentioned female Harry was a child prostitute and that changed her, but not in many of the ways people might expect! She certainly is not broken and afraid (she's afraid of being small and helpless - her boggart is herself as a little girl and she's crying!), sure her morals are kind of skewed but that's not because of abuse, more because she well worships death and has killed people as a small child!), expand on the magic (in the first story I mention Harry is worshipping death as a deity and gets certain boons for doing so, but it doesn't have to include any deities etc....there's also rituals in the first story, voodoo, sympathetic magic (using a scale model of something to affect the larger world, like errecting wards etc.) and creative use of runes...in "A Second Chance at Life" there's a lot of blood-magic etc. and that's just examples: Go wild!) that is available to people who are willing to take risks and/or aren't squeamish, a rivalry with Hermione would be great (she doesn't like having people compete with her because she's very insecure IMHO), politics would be great, too (in that first fanfic Jennifer Black (that's Harry in that 'verse!) is the heir to Sirius Black (the Potters abandoned her at the Dursleys because Dumbledore tricked them into thinkin she was squib) and she plays the politics in Hogwarts and even outside of it...the great thing is: She makes misstakes, too and isn't constantly beating more experienced politicians without help! That said: She's not stupid either!) and a mentor of some kind (or a teacher who sees Harry as his/her favourite, like McGonagall does Hermione!)...maybe Flamel having some screen time (Note: Stole this last one from another request!)...

Note: NO SLASH and if possible no Hermione worship (she's book smart, I get that, but she's also very narrow minded and she can't think outside the box!)...Oh and no Harry/Ginny either (I have read tons of stories about this pairing when starting out reading fanfiction, but it never resonated with me...hell, when I first saw the memes about "Not even the movies believe it" that's exactly how I feel about this pairing!)

So, there you go: THE STAGE IS YOURS!

greetings LAX

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** No I have not and I don't know if I want to (I've stumbled about that one on this subreddit quite a lot, but I don't know if keeping up the charade would work for long (especially once hormones come into play and once her boobs start to develop...I mean can those be placed under a notice-me-not, glamour or even the fidelius? And if so: Wouldn't a finite-charm disrupt them for long enough so that the secret gets out?)...also: How would any romance work? (I am a sucker for romance in fanfiction, as long as it's not the main plot!))

**** She does have certain problems with holding the charade up and especially romance does become a lot more complicated... The story is abandoned after third year though, so not many problems with hormones and there is no actual romance, just hints at what was supposed to happen later.

***** Hm...kind of worse (that it's abandoned, still: I'll give it a read - so: Thanks for the recommendation!)

ps: Were does the pureblood cousin go? (Is he dead and nobody knows?) Because who would give up his spot so somebody else could go to a prestigious school in their place?
