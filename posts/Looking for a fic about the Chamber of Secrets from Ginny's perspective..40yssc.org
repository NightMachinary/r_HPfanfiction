** Wouldn't a faithful retelling of /CoS/ from Ginny's perspective be a lot of Ginny "waking up" and wondering why she's where she's at, why she's covered in feathers and blood, etc.?

I wonder how much story you can pull of out someone suffering from blackouts and memory loss and not asking anyone for help.

Chapter 1: Ginny Writes in a Diary, Part 1

Chapter 2: Ginny Wonders Where She's Been

Chapter 3: Ginny Writes in a Diary, Part 2

Chapter 4: Ginny Wonders Where She's Been and Why She's Covered in Feathers and Blood

Chapter 5: Ginny Writes in a Diary, Part 3

Chapter 6: Ginny Flushes a Diary

Chapter 7: Ginny Knows She's Been Doing Something Wrong and Instead of Going to Someone for Help, She Steals the Diary Back and Continues Her Wrongdoing.

Chapter 8: Ginny Writes in a Diary, Part 4

Chapter 9: Ginny Nearly Returns Voldemort to Life

Epilogue: Ginny Never Receives Any Help Sorting Through 9 Months of Possession and PTSD.

** *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), goes into Ginny's POV about CoS incident, but it deviates from the canon.

*The Changeling*, linkffn(6919395), is written from Ginny's POV, but that Ginny was sorted into Slytherin and the CoS part is really short.

  CoS according to Ginny: Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year. How did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending. COMPLETE!
