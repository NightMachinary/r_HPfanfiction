  If there's one thing Rita Skeeter is good at, it's sniffing out a story, and when she sees a downtrodden Harry Potter at King's Crossing, by Merlin does she find a story! One that will change the face of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter, and even Rita herself. Harry was always more Slytherin than Gryffindor, really, and with someone to grow those traits...they won't see it coming.
