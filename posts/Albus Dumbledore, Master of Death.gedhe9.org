For all his faults and good intentions, Dumbledore is a complected character. He is both a wise mentor and secretive manipulator for Harry. One of his greatest fixations and regrets in his long and accomplished life was his time with Grindlewald. That time taught him to distrust his own judgment and ambition (a lesson that he only mildly follows) But the fascination and pull of the deathly hallows remained with him strongly enough that it led to his demise.

Albus had the best opportunity to join all the hollows together. Had he kept the cloak he would have had all of them at the same time. What if he did? What would happen? How? Why? Perhaps the temptation was too great, perhaps he wanted to deny Harry's apparent fate by taking on the power.

There are so many ways it could happen, so many effects it could have on the plot. What being the MoD means is not really known. It could be that Albus fails to control that nebulous power. Or maybe his age and experience in fighting against Voldermort gives him special insight about death. In the books he never seemed to fear death, maybe that acceptance of mortality is a requirement like how Harry walked willingly to death.

I think Dumbledore has the strongest argument in cannon of becoming the Master of Death other than Harry.

*** cool read, I had perceptions on Dumbledore but to have it all laid out was nice. I feel like if I was to ever use him as a character I would use that as the basis.
