This story is hilarious. It's Marauders era (mainly Remus x OC, but also Sirius x OC, and some Lily). It's not very canon, it probably could be considered a crackfic. But it's so so funny, and the main character is this super badass Ravenclaw and everything. It's pretty long and also completed, which are both bonuses.

  No one expected pretty little Elsea Holmes to be the mastermind behind the elaborate Hogwarts drug ring. Especially not Remus Lupin.

*** Oh man, I'm halfway through and this fic is my identity. It's so realistic AND it's an OC that I'm genuinely going to be sad about leaving at the end of the story.

** that just sounds stupidly edgy. and stupid. liking sex isn't a bad person thing, it's a healthy normal thing. or magic. magic is just cool. :D

*** It's a play on Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll. Which was edgy, but not stupid.
