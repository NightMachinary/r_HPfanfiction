Looking for fics that involve Harry going to an alternate dimension and he helps his alternate self, whether that is a younger him, a female him, etc.. Or pics where an alternate Harry comes and helps our Harry.

Preferably no pics where Harry and his alternate self are in any kind of romantic relationship, a sibling relationship would be great though!

Any other pairings are fine, ideally no bashing or slash but if it's really good then recommend that shit.

** I guess if you squint at it hard enough, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry%5C_potter%5C_and%5C_the%5C_nightmares%5C_of%5C_futures%5C_past/index][https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry\_potter\_and\_the\_nightmares\_of\_futures\_past/index]] involves an older Harry asking a younger Harry's permission to fuse souls or something. But since they become the one character, it doesn't have any interaction between the two them bar the first time.

I remember another fic where Old!Harry travels back in time just as he's dying to leave a set of timed instructions for his younger self.

** - Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): battle-hardened Harry goes back to June 24th 1995 to "save himself" and defeat Voldemort in the span of 12 hours. Absolute thrill-ride.
- Linkffn(0800-Rent-a-Hero): dimension-hopping Harry tries to help out the dimension's fem!Harry after 5th year and the prophecy gets blabbed about.
- Linkffn(Deepest Reflections): third book in following "The Darkness Within," basically the two Harrys initially trade places before AU Harry joins up to help out canon-Harry in 5th year. Not as much a fan because of the authors history vis-a-vis A Shattered Prophecy.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.
