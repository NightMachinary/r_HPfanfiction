So I've been writing (and re-writing) a fanfiction for many years and I've finally got it on the right track. One of the motivations I've used for Umbridge's lenience and overall bias toward Slytherins is due to the fact that she was one, plus Lucius' influence in the Ministry and her own prejudices about Wizarding society which are held by Purebloods who commonly follow the Slytherin route (not all but some).

A little while back I had review stating that Umbridge was a Hufflepuff. Now I've checked the wiki and everything backs up Slytherin - but I haven't found an article from J.K. specifically saying as such (or I'm blind and missed that too).

My natural fear of being wrong because of a small detail I might've missed is bigger than not caring simply because it's fanfiction. I realise my fanfic is AU in some senses but I do try to stick to canon the majority of the time.

Does anyone know for certain that Umbridge was a Slytherin while at Hogwarts?

Because I do see the argument for her being Hufflepuff (or at least having some deadly loyal qualities) but I think the Slytherin traits of cunning outweigh the Hufflepuff ones.


** In an informal interview JK said she was in [[http://www.hypable.com/umbridge-hogwarts-house/][Slytherin]] which I think is really boring. Pottermore however doesn't make any mention of her house.

Personally I love the idea that she was a Hufflepuff. She isn't especially talented, nor very cunning. Instead she had a completely consuming work ethic and shows profound loyalty to the concept of the Minister/Ministry and the more conservative ideals of magical Britain.

*** I would counter that and argue that she /is/ ambitious, cunning, and resourceful. Despite her apparent lack of magical talent, she was able to become the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and later lead the Muggle-Born Registration Commission.

Talent is not a trait attributed to Slytherin, nor indeed to any House.

**** Ambitious, yes. Resourceful, maybe. I could see her in Hufflepuff.

Cunning? No, I can't see it. A cunning person considers the repercussions of an action and selects the most appropriate. She massively over-reacts to situations while only considering the immediate result she desires with no thought to the consequences.

She ordered a dementer attack on a child merely to discredit them. Massive over reaction with the potential to seriously damage the Ministry, with sod all to gain for that risk.

She sabotaged the DADA course with the intent to prevent Dumbledore from building a private army of students to take on the Ministry. (If a few dozen schoolkids were a real threat to the Ministry, there's probably some other problems that required her attention...) Whatever small benefit was gained by stunting their education, the consequences included an entire generation of kids mistrusting the Ministry, plus a future dearth of qualified applicants for Auror positions.

She hears rumours of a club that is circumventing her attempts to stunt their education - so she bans all clubs.

A joke of a newspaper runs an article detrimental to her goals - she bans the newspaper, which of course guarantees that everyone reads it.

On being appointed Headmistress, she insists on full control - and in response the staff pass everything to her to clean up.

She admits in front of witnesses to crimes that would see her in Azkaban. She is tricked by a schoolgirl who has shown no ability to lie in any of the books.

Despite the bureaucratic power she wields, she is very unsure of that power. She threatened someone with a dementer's kiss for merely protesting her decision in his hearing.

I would debate that she was not talented however. She could cast and maintain a corporeal patronus, which is difficult for most grown wizards to achieve.

***** Cunning: having or showing skill in achieving one's ends by deceit or evasion (Oxford Dictionary of English)

Using this definition, one sees that Umbridge is actually rather cunning. She attempts (and somewhat succeeds) to discredit Harry Potter not by directly making claims about him, but by contriving a situation in which he /is/ guilty of underage magic -- by his own admittance nonetheless -- but his reasons for doing so seem completely outlandish. I mean, the ministry is /obviously/ in control of the dementors, there's no /possible/ way that they attacked this boy. He must be making things up again. Or so it seems to the general wizarding public.

Despite her apparent lack of magical power (we don't really see her in action in the books ever, so I'm not making this assumption), she is able to get a high position in the ministry, and moreover, is able to /retain/ it in spite of all the shenanigans she's pulled. In spite of pretty much admitting to numerous crimes, her political career seems hardly hurt. This, to me, implies that she was able to hold on to her job through some sort of trickery or deceit.

I completely agree with you, but that characteristic also applies to a large number of canon Slytherin characters from the books.

Honestly, Snape is one of the very few Slytherin characters from the books who actually has the qualities and attributes JKR associates Slytherin with. Canon Draco is pretty hot-headed and petty for a lot of the books and what cunning or ambition do Crabbe and Goyle ever exhibit, not to mention most of the Death Eaters? Closet Hufflepuffs, the lot of em.

***** I'd argue she's cunning in the sense that she knows how to leverage her political power and contacts to get what she wants while remaining nearly immune to retribution due to that same political power. (Her ultimate comeuppance in Book 5 is at the hands of the centaurs, who give zero fucks about what any witch or wizard thinks. Despite this she's back in action in Book 7 doing more or less the same thing on a much larger and nastier scale.) She's basically a malicious rules lawyer, if you're familiar with DND nomenclature.

**** To me, cunning is the surgical application of power. Delores wields her power like a mace. The people around her that aren't directly hanging off her coat tails find her contemptible. Then there's the simpering girly voice she puts on that fools no one and is actually quite off putting. Finally she is sent to Hogwarts to discredit both Harry Potter and Dumbledore, with all the backing of the Ministry and most of Slytherin house and *still* fails.

As far as I'm concerned the Muggle-Born Registration Commission was just an extension of Voldemort's plan and either way, she was wearing the locket at the time and was quiet possibly possessed.

** I think the reason for Slytherin is her own background......of which I hope her mother and brother (muggle and apparently squib respectfully) divorced and later remarried, giving her son a happy life where he became everything his sister wasn't. Umbridge, like Riddle, hated her family background and saw that pureblood to be far superior, even when it has been shown not to be so. I think the placement in Slytherin is just lazy and gives credence to only dark wizards & witches go to that house. She has more Hufflepuff tendency, her loyalty to Fudge and the ministry is scary. She tried to kill a child and then tortured said child and others. She scared me more than Riddle, because she was much more realistic and she is many public officials.

I mean seriously, Riddle, though a pyschopath, was powerful and intelligent and yet he was the product of a near squib and a muggle. He goes cuckoo for pureblood bullshit, yet it was very likely that his muggle father is the reason he was as powerful as he was. The whole 'Oh look, new genes to play with, magic returning to dominant gene ah hoy!' The irony that witches and wizards can't grasp. I so wanted someone to scream at Malfoy when on his pureblood rants that pureblood is just a fancy way of saying inbred. Any American would break out with references to Deliverance or banjo playing before stating that a pureblood's main goal in life was fucking their cousins.

*** I do see Dolores as a bad Slytherin myself, and partly why I believe she was even placed there (lazy or not) was her utmost desire to simply be one of them because of her prejudices she was brought up with from her father. Umbridge was probably desperate to seem the most Pureblood she could be while being ashamed of her true heritage. She was determined to rise above her supposedly shameful background and make something better for herself which I can see as something "Slytherin" although the Hufflepuff qualities seem to outshine the more prominently known Slytherin ones (who the hell admits in front of lots of witnesses that they attempted to jump the Boy Who Lived using Dementors?).

I appreciate a far more quietly cunning figure of Slytherin than the blatantly terrible such as the Death Eaters (let's face it, they're in a fucking cult wearing hoods and masks and having special tattoos and leaving their mark behind as they essentially obey one man) but I don't recall seeing any such example in canon - like there has to be a Slytherin who isn't just mean for the sake of being mean. Where is that canon Slytherin? Is it Regulus? I wouldn't know because there wasn't a lick of dialogue from a chill Slytherin who played the game of life and school better instead of just plain being a dick because that's what Slytherins do I guess?

I also literally have no clue how Dolores' parents got it on if one had such ideas and the other was of the subject of what he believed to be beneath him - but then I think Pottermore said Dolores encouraged the seed of utter despise for her mother's muggle status and consequently her brother's squib status within her father to the point where they had to leave. But I suppose there are some characters such as Peter Pettigrew, who was an example of a bad Gryffindor for the more obvious reasons, and Zacharias Smith for being a bad Hufflepuff because he practically ran through first years to escape during the evacuation of Hogwarts while rest of those who were of age in Hufflepuff stayed to fight (loyalty and all that).

I think the least likely or funniest explanation for these utter mix ups would be that the Sorting Hat wanted to shake shit up at Hogwarts because it was tired of seeing the same kind of mindsets going to the same houses and just making shit stay the same (although if we're depicting Slytherins as they were in Harry's perspective then Dolores was right at home simply because of her views).

If J.K. said she's Slytherin I'm sticking with it. I'm also considering having a snippet of a chat with the Sorting and using that as an excuse where he pulled a reason for their odd placements over the years nearly out of thin air in their minds and just went with it, purely for entertainment purposes. The hat's not a demon, it was just bored.

** This is my own interpretation, but I think it fits the message of the Hat's songs;

- Gryffindors value popularity and being justly well-regarded
- Hufflepuffs value usefulness and being inclusive, supportive
- Ravenclaws value knowledge and being right
- Slytherins value influence and getting what they want\\

Everyone has a bit of all of it going on in their heads, but when a decision comes between these values, the one that wins is usually their highest value.

Hermione may have exhibited that Ravenclaw superiority complex, but it wasn't enough for her to be right on her own- she insisted that others agree with her.

Neville just wanted to do his part, but he was influenced by his Gran to seek chances to prove his worth to others rather than find worth within himself. He also demonstrated a need to stand by his principles.

Given these sort of guidelines, I'd think Umbridge is a fair example of a textbook Slytherin.
