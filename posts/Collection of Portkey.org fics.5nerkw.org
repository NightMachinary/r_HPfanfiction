In case you weren't aware, the site died late last year and I finally got around to seperating out the ones I have from the rest of my collection. You can download the zip file [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwfE6l6RtZAseEJMdVhtazdxdEk/view?usp=sharing][here]]. Just click it and then use the arrow button in the top right corner to save. It's 258MB and has just over 6,200 stories.

Torrent kindly provided by [[/u/ScrotumPower]]: [[https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/16767146]]

Almost all of the stories are html files that will open in your browser. A couple had problems with the html files so I converted them and they're zips that contain rtf/pdf/epub/azw3/doc.

There may be a few non-portkey fics. When an author had a lot of stories, I just grabbed everything they did instead of checking each individual fic, so if they used the same username on another site (or someone else did) then those stories would have got picked up too. Also, some may have slipped by me when I was sorting out my folders; I hope you'll forgive me for those. If you do find a lot of non-portkey stories, let me know and I'll remove them and re-upload everything.

I only checked for the website so I didn't pay attention to the actual story text, but I had to delete a few files I had because the story text was missing. It's likely I missed some, so apologies if you open a story and there isn't actually anything there except header information. Similarly, some stories may have formatting errors such as tiny font, coloured text, or strikethroughs. In that case, I'd suggest copy+pasting the story into a word processor and use that to change the font size and colour or remove strikethrough. If for whatever reason you can't do that, let me know the story in question and I'll sort it out.

Let me know if there are any questions or problems.


** I never really visited Portkey when it was up and running, but thank you for all your hard work and for doing this! It's greatly appreciated.

** Could everyone mention some recommendations from Portkey in the response section to this comment?

It will give the new readers somewhere to start as it will probably be hard to make their way through this list and give some of the more seasoned readers some undiscovered gems perhaps.

Some of my favorites include: Like Father Like Son, Forever Knight, The Fifth Element, Angelica

*** I've not actually read a single one of them, but before I got this all sorted I was asked for a few specific stories that I therefore presume are pretty good:

- Life and Times, by Elban Fehl
- Devil's Lesson One, by The Dark Aeon
- everything by madscientist
- Fixing Harry, by Lynney
- Magic Never Dies, by Lynney
- O, by cheering charm
- Envy, by Twitch E. Littleferret
- Forever Knight, by DeliverMeFromEve, which must be amazing because in a month it became my most asked for story.
