we've all see the superharry or godharry or once in a while squib harry but anyone ever seen fanfics where harry's magic is wild? like sometimes he has average magic, other times it's so strong that he is stronger then all the hogwarts staff, merlin and tom riddle combined then other times he struggles to the point where you might think he is a squib.

ever seen a fanfic like that?


** Well, I know there's a fic where Harry is an Elemental Mage; his magic literally has a mind of its own and is very possessive of him. Like, possessive to the point where it steals the air from Fleur's lungs when she flirts with him.

I'm not having any luck finding it though. As you might guess, it's a GoF fic. Pretty sure I read it on FFN...

*** Yeah, I've read this before and while I think the concept is interesting the author didn't execute it properly. I'll try searching for it.

*** Was definitely FF.net. Was a dimensional hop or timetravel story. Harry was in Hufflepuff and lived in a magical orphanage. I don't remember the name of it.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Days later he awakens, magic flaring uncontrollably, his soul seemingly still in one piece. But is it? With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.

** linkffn(Founder's Keepers)

It's a WIP and there's a scene when Salazar punishes Harry that really disturbed me and can't get out of my head, so I don't really like it but Harry's magic is very wild.

  Time Travel. Founder's Era. AU. Dumbledore, believing he was doing the right thing, bound Harry's magic. Because of that betrayal, Harry flees to the Chamber of Secrets where he is unwittingly pulled into the distant past. Harry/Salazar. This is Slash.

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.
