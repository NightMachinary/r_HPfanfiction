Since spells can be shielded and deflected, it means they travel slower then bullet obviously. So it's strange that there aren't any instances of gun transfiguration/conjuration. At least muggle borns. And even if it's forbidden by the ministry as dark magic and misuse of muggle artifacts, surely some dark wizard out there has done it (not all dark wizards are purebloods mind you).

Unless of course, I'll simply break the entire universe so it isn't done. I remember reading a story where a muggle girl shot Voldemort from behind and he died (at least it seemed like it, the story was discontinued).


** Looking from a technical standpoint.. Probably because of the complexity of it. Guns aren't just one piece. I dont think conjuring a gun and expecting it to work in the heat of the moment would be the best. There are different parts and they all have to work together to dispel the bullet. The bullet is an entirely different thing, casing, powder, metal of the actual bullet... etc.

But I dont understand why a muggle born wouldn't at least try using a muggle gun. But then again it's Britain in the 1990s. I'm not British so I have no clue the laws regarding the general public owning firearms during that time. If there are any British people in this thread I'd like to know I this theory could work?

*** Not British, but IIRC British gun laws have been extremely restrictive for ages. Pistols had been heavily restricted for decades and were all but banned in 1997, when Sorcerer's Stone is set. Rifles were heavily restricted in 1988.

Even during the first war, a wizard would need to apply for a license (an issue given most wizards would have spotty documentation), which would be "may issue," and would likely not be issued, particularly if the muggleborn was honest regarding the use, since police were directed "self defense" was not a valid reason for applying for a license.

Just to hammer this point home- you need a certificate for any airguns with much more oomph than a Red Ryder bb gun.

** I would go with that explanation from Terminator 2:

#+begin_quote
  John Connor : Then why doesn't it become a bomb or a machine gun or something to get me?

  The Terminator : The T-1000 can't form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals in them. Moving parts. It doesn't work that way, but it can form solid metal shapes.

  John Connor : Like what?

  The Terminator : Knives and stabbing weapons.

** There are several reason that can used to explain the lack of firearms in the Magical World :

1. While Canon never clearly stated the speed of a spell, it is very fast fast. In several situations, spell are pretty much instantaneous (speed of light), and they are only dodged/blocked because the opponent prepared his defense at the same time than the wizard was casting his spell.\\
   So I would not really say that bullets are faster than spells, and even if it was the case the difference is negligible, especially for powerful wizards.
2. In HP, Magic completely ignore "Science" and follow its own set of rules. Because of it, anything non magical is pretty much useless. We know that the Shield Charm can be used to block physical objects, and once the spell is successfully cast, it doesn't make any difference if the opponent use a hand gun or an assault riffle, both would be completely blocked by the spell.
3. When Transfiguring an item, Wizards need to understand said item. One cannot create a working firearm without first understanding how said firearm works. I guess the information would be easily available for a motivated wizard, but in the current situation most of no idea. The Transfiguration would also takes time, which is a disadvantage in duel. Though I guess the darr wizard could go over it by simply making the transfiguration in advance.

In conclusion, the Wizards do not use firearms because, as all Muggle weapons, they are simply inferior to Magic. In pretty much any situation where a Dark Wizard could shoot someone, he could probably also curse someone, which would be a lot more effective. At best, the Dark Wizard could use the surprise effect of having a firearm to "/maybe/" kill some person, but he would loose this advantage the moment his tactic is known, and firearm can be easily countered by either using a pretty easy spell or buying an enchanted item.

Also, "Guns" are pretty rarely used in HP Fanfics because they go a bit too close to the Mugglewank territory, which is not that popular (though some people seem to really like it). "/Muggle are so cool with their gun and will destroy the stupid wizards/". Maybe a bit too "murican" too? I don't know I just never saw the appeal in guns.

**** Yeah, 'understanding the object' is fanon, usually done for animagus stuff.

One of their first transmutations is turning a button into a beetle. I doubt they have in-depth courses on insect anatomy. I doubt every transfiguration master is the equivalent of a Vet.

Now, there are likely some rules for this sort of thing, as I'm not fond of 'magic has no rules' silliness, but what they are not is 'understanding in depth how an object works/functions'.

*** I would argue bullets would be MUCH faster. We often see wizards parrying spells in duels and I'm pretty sure this happened in canon as well, if the spell moves slow enough to parry, then it is 100% slower than a bullet. I really doubt that the /majority/ of spells travel at 1250 feet per second. For the distance involved in all dueling settings, that WOULD be instantanious, and we just don't see that spell speed in canon and fanon.

**** I think wizards are physically much faster and tougher, they can shrug off crazy amounts of force and damage and react to thinks moving extremely fast

But yeah, I do think they probably would not be able to parry or stop a bullet.

*** The idea that spells are light speed is asinine, for the record. That's the very epitomy of 'Rowling has no freaking clue how science works'.

If they were light speed, there would be no blocking them. You'd have to literally cast the instant the caster did, or you'd be unable to block them.

Not to mention the books mention Harry tracking the path of spells at times, so unless Harry's a superhuman who has superluminal senses, yeah.

**** For the distances involved in most fights, bullets are effectively instantaneous. Yet they can still to some extend be dodged or blocked, because the act of pointing a gun and firing isn't. In the same way, there is a window when someone is making the wand movements and saying the incantation, or even from before that if you see that they are planning to cast something, to react. As long as your defensive spell is quicker to cast that the attack (I assume they would be specifically designed for this), then you are fine.

Magic follows rules. It can be scientifically studied and examined, and in fact must be to have reproducible results.

And you left out the 'with superluminal sight' part. Nice avoiding the statement.

*** Does it ever say how many physical objects that a Shield Charm can block? Or how much force one can withstand?

Let's say a Shield Charm can stop a few rounds from a civilian market handgun (9mm or a similar caliber), that doesn't mean that it can stop half a magazine from a Kalashnikov, an M-4 or a couple of bursts from a .50 cal machine gun.

**** It blocks however much an author wants it to, as there's no comparison to be made from the books and pretty much everything Rowling has said shows little to no understanding of the forces involved.

In a mugglewank work, sniper rounds can easily penetrate. In a Wizards uber alles work, even mortar assaults cannot penetrate or there's a bullshit protective charm to block all non-magical attacks or such.

**** Given the way magic is shown to work in HP, this is the answer:

A Shield Charm is a shield. Shields block things. A fly is a thing and a nuclear bomb is a thing. Therefore Shield Charms block flies and nuclear bombs.

We see this conceptual approach all the time. And this fits with the stated mundane > muggle, so the way to break a magic Shield Charm is not to throw increasingly big things at it, but to use more magic to overcome it.

** Conjuration and transfiguration seem to be the most complex forms of magic. I assume this is because you have to properly understand how the final product functions. Also, as someone else said, spells seem to be almost instantaneous and, bar the unforgivables, most curses seem to work without even knowing what they do (see Sectumsempra). By the time you've conjured a gun, you might have been already cursed several times.

** The problem with conjuring or transfiguring a gun is that you have to conjure or transfigure a /working/ gun.

There's two problems with that. First either you or magic itself must know how to make a gun. Normally when someone transfigures something into another thing, that thing only has to /act/ like that thing. For example if you want to transfigure a rock into a dog, that dog only has to look and act like one. If you were to dissect that dog, it almost certainly would look nothing like the real thing.However if you want a gun (or indeed any machine), it actually has to work, which means that if you took apart the gun (or machine) it would look like the real thing. This then requires you or magic to know how to make a gun. The former is unlikely, particularly in the UK in the early 90's, and the latter is dependent on how omniscient you want magic to be.

The second obvious problem is reliability. I mean even if you did know how to transfigure a gun, how much would you /really/ trust it to not blow up in your hands the first time you used it? This is particularly the case given that in a lot of situations you're likely going to be making that gun during a combat situation.

** Literally nothing. It doesn't matter how many moving components there are, because wizards transfigure stuff into animals and that has a ridiculous number of moving components. I would just say the guns aren't necessary as wizards. Why use a gun when you can banish daggers at high speed? Or spam the explosive curse and hit your opponent with the equivalent of RPGs.
