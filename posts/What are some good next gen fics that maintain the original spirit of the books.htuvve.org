Hello all,

I am trying to identify some good next generation fics that maintain the spirit of the original series. I think it is quite hard to make the Potter/Weasley children heroes considering that they lead rather happy lives until the epilogue of DH (unlike Harry Potter and most significant characters from the series) and considering that Grindelwald was the wizard Hitler and Voldemort not only took it up a notch but decided to become the Dark Arts Messiah, it's quite hard to come up with a villain with a noble cause.

I've read Vekin87's Albus Potter series, NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series and Hogwarts Houses Divided. One glaring issue I've found with all these stories is the fact that the protagonist is not only not treated according to their age but also the fact that he always seems to have a competent grasp of politics in the wizarding world. The other one is the fact that they do not suffer a tragedy and experience relatively loving lives. Vekin87's series (which in my opinion is closest to the spirit of the original series) and Hogwarts Houses Divided give the protagonist way too good of an understanding of politics and the fact that the world is not split into good and evil. Just remember how Harry took an entire series (despite being abused in his childhood) to see good in people such as Dudley or Snape, while finally seeing evil in people such as Dumbledore or his dad. NoahPhantom's series reads more like Sci-Fi spy story.

Therefore I was wondering if you have any good recommendations for next gen fics where people act according to their age and not through the eyes of a 20+ adult's one.


** - linkao3(1623053;8402590) keep the spirit quite well (no surprise, Northumbrian is that good)
- linkao3(373224) is the full blown next gen story, which I think honours the spirit quite well as well.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** I read it a while ago but I remember enjoying the series of James Potter by George Norman Lippert. He wrote the first book immediately after the release of HP and DH, it's a long read of 5 books about James Sirius Potter. You will find on PDF it's not on any website that I know

** I share some of your frustrations. I like Vekin and Noah both but find them both pretty flawed. I couldn't stand HHD, considering how well it was written. I do like Alexandra Quick a lot, but since it starts with an 11-year-old protagonist and is literally the definition of political and grayscale, I'll leave it off.

linkffn(Ignite by Slide) and its two sequels comprise the Stygian Trilogy, which I find better than either of the Albus Potter series. It solves your age problem by starting in sixth year for the first two books, then timeskipping to three years after Hogwarts for the finale. The first book takes place entirely at Hogwarts on a small scale: it's a mystery revolving around a pandemic. It's quite well written; I disliked the main romantic subplot, but was willing to read past it.

The second and third books leave Hogwarts entirely, and they just explode. There's amazing, pictorial writing, a historical understanding to the worldwide escapades the characters take, actually well-written adolescent /and/ mature romance, structure, adventure, magic discovery....it's truly something else. To address your concern about political understanding, there are a lot of scenes where the main characters show a complete lack of understanding about political finesse, which sets off a lot of the moments of the book. It's really well done.

Someone below mentioned the James Potter series: it's fine and entertaining, but the relationship is really badly handled, and it's quite corny at times. The main conflict is political, and it's actually interesting, but it's really badly done. Lippert in general tries to include a couple mature themes that don't work in the setting.

I like linkffn(Fabula Post Bellum: A Potter Fanfiction) and its sequels. They don't try to do too much and stick to the plot and spirit of the original books. Only complaint is that they're a bit slow, but they're pretty well-written.

linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) is a hidden gem. It's a compact story, has a plot and arc, good writing and a healthy dose of British culture. There are two sequels which are similar. linkffn(The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins) is pretty much the opposite: sprawling, angsty, and dramatic, but also has characters that act like kids. It starts out a bit rough but gets very good by the end.

linkffn(The Belmont Legacy by Noralesong) is also good, and despite what it says in the title is actually pretty fast-paced. Low-stakes.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).
