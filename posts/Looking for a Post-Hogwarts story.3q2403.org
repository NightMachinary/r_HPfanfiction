** Have you read [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]]? It's my all-time fav HP story, set in the afterlife, starring characters who have died from all eras but is set around the end of the war. The plot is a bit of a mystery-adventure surrounding their village's annual races, but much of it is about exploring the characters and how their relationships have developed since their death and how they change when the newly dead arrive. Really interesting dynamic, very well-written and satisfying.
