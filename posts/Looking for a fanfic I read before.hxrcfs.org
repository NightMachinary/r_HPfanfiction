:END:
Hi!

It's a long shot, but I'm hoping you guys can help me find one of my fave fanfics haha

It's a Draco/Ginny ff set in a future where Voldemort killed Harry and has taken over Britain's Wizarding World. Ginny, Arthur and George are the only Weasley's left and are in hiding. Arthur, after seeing an ad for mail order bride, suggested it to Ginny. And lo and behold, the one who ordered her is Malfoy, who was hiding somewhere overseas.

​

I know I saved this fanfic on my account of [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] but I can't find it anymore there. The author might have deleted it, and I can't remember the name of the author. It's been years since I read ff, and I just started to read again since I don't have much to do.

​

Anyway, thanks in advance! :)
