Shout-out goes to [[/u/turbinicarpus]] for the two first on this list, posted in another thread. Now do note that, a bit like the real King James' Bible, these "commandments" only reflect the opinion of certain "informed" (or self-describedly so) masses, and are not /supposed/ to be universal. Combined with their obvious playfulness, I think this should hopefullys tave off any flame wars. Alright? Can we have nice things here? Thank you.

Let us begin.

  How is murdering someone that gets in Harry's way pointless?
#+end_quote

Now /this/ is one of the things on the list I agree with (keep in mine everybody, I'm listing common complaints; I don't agree with everything --- for instance, I prefer fanon Arithmancy). The debate often pops up (I'd say it's one of the few classic fanon wars that never really ended but just slipped into passive-agressive mode), and the question is, should Harry keep his canon "no killing" rule, and if not, to what extent? There's those who think he sinks to the Death Eaters' level if he ever tries to kill his opponents at all, those (me among them) who consider he should try not to kill random Death Eaters in battle unless it's the only way out for himself, and those who think trying to win the war without attempting to decimate the Death Eaters is just being weak and soft-hearted.

#+begin_quote
  So you're cool with the Death Eaters going and killing innocents because Harry's too selfish to get his hands dirty? Because Harry has certainly never shown any sorrow towards dead Death Eaters, so the only reason he doesn't kill himself is because he feels uncomfortable with it.
#+end_quote

I darehoped we wouldn't rekindle that old debate here... but here are my two cents.

First, one could argue (and this is certainly Christian J.K. Rowling's opinion, though not necessarily mine) that it's simply /wrong/ to kill someone under any circumstance --- not only because of sorrow felt for the individual in question but because killing is by itself an act of utter evil. "Thou Shalt Not Kill" and all that. That's not really my belief (as I'm an atheist), but going by Rowling's unspoken assumption that her characters are Christians, this may be Harry's, giving him a reason for his "no killing" rule beyond "he's weak" even though he doesn't really empathize with the Death Eaters.

Secondly, barring the first argument, I'd say there's something /wrong/ with Harry if he does /not/ show sympathy for the Death Eaters at his mercy. Unlike Voldemort, who you could argue may actually be a born psychopath (who, additionally, willingly altered himself with Dark Magic to turn himself even more insane), most of the Death Eaters are normal humans, not some sorts of irredeemable demons, as Regulus, Snape and Draco's eventual redemptions proved. To kill them is to deny them the second chance they, as human beings, deserve. I am fundamentlly against the death penalty IRL and this basically the same thing.

And drawing on the above point, unlike (to an extent) in a real-life war, the almost limitless possibilities of magic /do/ provide a competent wizards with ways to lastingly incarcerate an opponent without killing them. Of the many options, at least two off the top of my head even remove the cost and time of feeding and watching them: you can Petrify them/feed them Draught of Living Death, stuff them in a Fidelius-ed closet, and forget about them till the war is over.

So I realize that in full-blown battle it's not always possible to stand by that rule. If Bellatrix is about to AK you and she has raised Anti-Apparition Jinxes, then of course, I won't blame you for sending a Blasting Curse her way. But if you spot Dolohov in the street minding his own business, it's /not/ acceptable to just assassinate him on the spot. If you feel you can, take him in custody. (No need to be "nice" about it, either, mind. You can break both his arms with a well-aimed curse, for instance. He'll have a tough time fighting back that way, and you can regrow the bones later when he's locked up and wandless.) If not, just go away. It's not worth taking a life needlessly.

#+end_quote

Hmmm... canon does not support this commandment, I am afraid.

HBP, Chapter 26:

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it."\\
  "But then-?"\\
  "I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine."
#+end_quote

Clearly there are great power differentials between characters, and clearly that difference is somehow measurable.

*** Because he's sixteen-year-old. You're not the first to point this out (and other similar scenes in the books), but the key point is that every time this happens, it's about an underage wizard versus an adult. This does not /entirely negate/ the idea of cores, of course (but again, this thread lists things that the sub seems to dislike, whether or not that dislike is entirely rational), but most people who dislike magical cores argue that in canon, one's magical power grows naturally with age, moreso as the magic is exercised, but --- and this is the main point of contention --- that nothing differentiates two wizards /at birth/. Harry or anyone else can't have an "unusually large magical core" just because; he'll only get Dumbledore-levels if he trains properly, and anyone, even someone like Neville or Goyle, could technically get to this level if they trained as well.

**** That doesn't negate the fact that there is /something there/, some measure of power. Why shouldn't "core" be as good a word for it as any? I will never understand why this sub abhors the word "core", yet embraces the word "ward" for the magical protections that can be put around people and places. Neither are used in canon, yet the concepts are there for both. I wouldn't advise using the words for either, simply because they're not in canon, but why does the sub hate one and love the other?

***** Because while "magical core" /can/ be used for a more abstract measure of power, it originally came from bad Indy!Harry fics where the core was a /visual/ ball of glowing light or something like that within the person, which Lucifer!Dumbledore usually put "binding enchantments" on. All this being obviously ridiculous by our modern standards. So using the word brings back the memories of these hated additional concepts. By contrast, the only difference between "wards" as they are usually depicted with the "protective enchantments" of canon are the fact that "wards" are often based in runes, and most of the fandom seems to /like/ the idea of chargeable, magical runes even if it's not canon.

Under that same logic, magical-steroids are /possible/.

If nothing diferentiates two mages at birth, could you explain how Voldemort had the skills he had when he was a child? He makes it very clear it's not accidental.

******** Fair enough.

And about the magic = muscles comment? If magic can be "trained", it's safe to say that different magicals may have differents levels of power available to them, since they would have different training regimes. A fully trained 50 year old is more powerful/resourceful/skilled than a magical the same age without training.

Following that idea, someone, somewhere has tried creating "power-enhancing" potions/spells/rituals. At the very least, one person is bound to be successful.

Looks to me like "you can't artifically enhance magical power" may very well be one of the Fundamental Laws of Magic of which we only know one ("meddling with the soul is dangerous"). For instance, maybe a human body can't handle a sudden, artificial increase in magical power and would burn down like an overcharged wand.
