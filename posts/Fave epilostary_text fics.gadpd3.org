I don't know why, but I'm a sucker for any fics involving letters, or texting. What are your favourites? I've mainly focused on Drarrys so other pairings also welcome.


** I occasionally add chapters to an epistolary fic I'm working on! It's more a parody of the kind of overly serious letters you get from any educational institution than having a developed plot, so may or may not be your thing. Thought I'd plug it anyway!

  Anyone who's had anything to do with an educational institution will have received (if not read) plenty of highly official, overly workshopped correspondence about (insert school here), their place in the world, and why Your Donations Are More Important At This Time Than Ever Before. And why should Hogwarts be any different?Eight letters, from throughout Harry's career at Hogwarts and the year after, from senior figures within Hogwarts attempt to portray events there with the best spin possible. Trigger warning for academic bureaucracy.

** Epistolary Drarry fics: The only one I could still find online is [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=4661][Lettered]] by pir8fancier. I know of several others where correspondence is an important part of the plot, but this one is pretty much all letters.

Non-Drarry epistolary fics, all a bit (or a lot) on the crack-y side:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325][Naked Quidditch Match]] (a classic!) by Anya (het overtones but really no pairing)

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=3006][The Owl Chronicles]] by mouse (gen)

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** It's not an epistolary fic but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300]["Dad says"]] involves Scorpius and Harry writing letters to each other at the beginning. Would highly recommended this fic.

Hahahaa it's okay I think a lot of us are suckers for that Draco.

Editing my comment because I only saw your second reply just now. Have you seen the recs in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/gca2h8/lf_drarry_hurtcomfort_draco_on_bottom_of_life/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][this post]]? Lots of fics with such a Draco.
