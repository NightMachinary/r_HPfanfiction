** I'm very interested in a HP/The Mummy crossover, but I don't have anything to add.

** I have to say, that last little bit of Chapter Two, where you have both the bit about the Norwegian Lullaby and the dragon fang earring is probably my two favorite, consecutive sentences I've run across. A great mix of simple Wizarding society, which is fluff, opening up into something moving the plot forward. Brilliant.

I do find myself curious as to what curse-breakers actually do in this world you've created. Most fics, and implied in canon, have cursebreakers go out in search of the location, and bypass/remove the curses (and probably charms) found therein. Here in Act I, Bill explicity states it isn't his job to locate tombs. So is that something that other groups handle, and he then gets called in after it has been found? Not a big deal, just curious, and I definitely like it.

I'm also incredibly intrigued as to what role Fleur is going to play, even though it seems to be that of memories to Bill. Are we going to learn more of how their marriage fell apart? Especially with what I'm assuming is going to be a romance between Bill and Evelyn, due to Bill taking the place of Rick O'Connell.

Right now Evelyn is an incredibly irritating character, but seeing as she was the same in the movies, I salute you. Though I do hope that you have her character development occur at a... quicker pace than in the movies, just so she won't be so damn irritating. And while you've mentioned her being a near-squib hedgewitch, we haven't actually seen her do anything slightly magical other than simply knowing the magical community exists, and it would be a boost if we see her do something magical, although it would probably be herbology or potions related if she is magically weak.

[[/spoiler][Just to make sure I'm not misreading this, in Chapter Three/Act III, the foreign goblins are Medjai? It seems obvious that they are, but from what we know of Goblins, that isn't really a thing they would do, unless this is one of the changes to the HP world you've made for the sake of the crossover.]]

I guess my response to this fic could be found in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5bbu6NPRvU][this video]]. The story is the drink in this case.

** You could always try the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP]] works by author section. The feedback is often much more substantial than the comment section of FF.Net was intended to be.

**** Yea, that's what I get for ignoring DLP for the weekend and then advising someone to check it out.

I'm just going to be over in the corner dreaming of my OTP. . . Harry/Pansy
