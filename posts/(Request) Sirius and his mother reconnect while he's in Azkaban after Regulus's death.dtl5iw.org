** That sounds beautifully twisted. She visits, brings him chocolate, shows him the love she never did when he was growing up, all because she thinks he finally joined the Dark Lord. The dementors don't seem so bad compared to this.

*** eeeh I don't think that's likely, judging by the fact that Sirius would probably tell her to fuck off and deny all involvement in Lily and James death. I picture it being more incredibly tense meetings every month or so, with her slipping him some chocolate once in a while

**** we actually don't know that much about sirius' character before he was in azkaban. He could have been a cunning genius and considering that he comes from a slytherin family it's not even that far-fetched. Twelve years in azkaban are very likely to have changed him though, considering that the only not negative thought he could focus on was that he did not kill his quasi brother and his wife.

***** 12 years in Azkaban does change people, but it usually makes them more ruthless, not less. Plus though Sirius could definitely be cunning, he's not very ruthless (unless you're a rat by the name of pettigrew, but that was a very extreme scenario), and tends to be more hotheaded than cunning and planning. Even though he has a, er, complicated relationship with his mother, I don't see him being ruthless enough to leave her in Azkaban with dementors, and I certainly don't see her willingly taking his place, even if she believes he's voldys right hand man.

**** He may also be so confused by both the Dementor's influence and the idea that /Walburga Black/ is suddenly being /nice/ to him that he just lets it happen, thinking it's a dream.

** This isn't exactly what you want, but linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16186133]]) is a piece on a Walburga who refuses to believe that Sirius could ever be a death eater, and works to free him. Sirius himself has a very dark portrayal, without making him inclined to Voldemort.

  The portrait of Cygnus Black I that hung in the Ministry reported that her firstborn had been sent to Azkaban without any trial whatsoever. It made Walburga furious. Not on His behalf, of course, but because of the utter disrespect shown to a scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. How dare they? If she let them get away with it, then next time those filthy blood traitors might think it was perfectly fine to treat that way a worthy member of the House of Black. After all, it had set a precedent. A bad precedent. It mustn't be allowed. Or, Walburga Black saves Sirius from Azkaban, and it changes everything.

  On Halloween night, 1981, Walburga Black learns just what her oldest son stands accused of. In a moment of blind action, she springs him from jail, his believed loyalty to the Dark Lord the perfect excuse to reinstate him...by force if she has to. And perhaps being stuck with Harry Potter as well isn't so bad as it sounds...

** Hiya :) I know this post is pretty old and dead now but I just came across it and thought I'd suggest a fic I've started writing which centres around Walburga freeing Sirius from Azkaban and the two of them reconnecting. I've linked it in case you'd like to take a look :)
