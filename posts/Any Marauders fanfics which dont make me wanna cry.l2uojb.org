Are there any Marauders fanfictions which arent sad and you recommend? CAN include Wolfstar or Remadora, but would prefer if it isnt romantic focussed. Canon Divergence are allowed too. Don't care if it plays in the Marauders Era or a "Everyone lives AU"


** I recommend digging through HecateA'a stories. There's a lot of Remus/Tonks, but other Marauders and more. Too many to list. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3224972/HecateA]]

One of my faves is Home for Christmas, though.

** All of mine are Marauders era and pretty fluffy. They're not amazing by any means but they might entertain you. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8089342/]]

*** Ok, thank you. Honestly, i dont care if they are not as good as others as long the grammar mistakes and misspellings arent as bad. I find so many Marauders fanfics which sound nice but than the tag "Major Character Death and "Canonical Character Death" change my mind because i read to give me new ideas and not to make myself cry

**** I like writing fun happy fluff because I like imagining getting to do fun things in what little time they had together before all the sad stuff happens. So I'm right there with you.

** Unfortunately canonical Marauders era stories are per definition tragic, because they end with the death of James and Lily.

To save them you have to go to AU:

- “A Better Man by Valandar” linkffn(2531438)
- “There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel” linkffn(13137899)

And we'll see how “Flowers by the Wayside by TalaRae” linkao3(23090008) ends.

** I was reading All the Young Dudes and needed a break from all the death foreshadowing and despair...the same author who wrote that has another fic that I just started it's only 19 chapters it's a modern non magic AU which is not normally my thing but I love love love this so far. I'm 4 chapters in and I was told this is a happy ending. It's from Sirius POV. Sirius is a hairstylist and Remus is a bass player.

Linkao3(Dress up in You)

Also on tik tok ppl were recommending this fic to read if ATYD has just destroyed you. I haven't read it myself yet tho. Linkao3(Let Nothing You Dismay)

  AU: The story of how James convinced Lily that he wasn't actually the arrogant bullying toe-rag she claimed with help from her new best friend, Sirius Black, who is working to help Lily through difficult times. Can be a standalone, but also works as a prequel to my Beginning Series.
