I like the following characters a lot:

Bellatrix in "Delenda Est", linkffn(5511855): She's still arrogant and power hungry, but it's refreshing to see her vice being used for the good cause.

Daphne in "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw", linkffn(11574569): She deserves the 'Ice Princess of Slytherin' title in this story, her defense of Hermione against bullies in her house impressed me.

Draco in "Animagus at War", linkffn(12088294): His redemption arc is a lot more convincing than in canon. He is actually thinking. Even his pranks against Harry are well played.

Dumbledore in "Patron", linkffn(11080542): He is cool in this story. I especially enjoy his back-and-forth chess moves against Voldemort.

Ginny in "The Changeling", linkffn(6919395): Her growth in this story is phenomenal. I like this version of her better than Canon.

Harry in "Ruthless", linkffn(10493620): He made all the good choices, including sharing his love with best friend.

Harry in "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167): He became increasingly brutal as the story goes on, and he remained fiercely protective of his friends. When he and Hermione were willing to die near the end, he 'ordered' Neville to stay behind.

Harrymort and Ginevra in "Seventh Horcrux", linkffn(10677106): They are such an adorable insane couple.

Hermione in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: She's so adorable and yet so scary. She's so intelligent and yet so mistake prone. She's so strong and yet so sensitive.

Hermione in "Stages of Hope", linkffn(6892925): I have my greatest sympathy and respect for this Hermione, I wish she and Harry could get together in their new world.

Lucius Malfoy in "The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877): Although he failed in the end, I have to respect this version of Lucius who almost outmaneuvered both Dumbledore and Voldemort, two wizards far more powerful than him.

Luna in "Stages of Hope", linkffn(6892925): Her tales are tear jerkers, and she was a bad ass fighter.

Luna in "Doubting Thomas", linkffn(5492188): This is only an one-shot, but this Luna is very memorable.

Ron in "Hermione Granger and Marriage Law Revolution", linkffn(10595005): He kicks ass as the new commander of magical Britain's military, and he is able to put his strategic and tactical skills to good use. At the same time, he remains the funny guy we all know in canon.

Voldemort in "Patron", linkffn(11080542): Despite facing a tough Dumbledore and a capable Ministry, he is able to outmaneuver them. This Voldemort is brilliant, patient, resourceful, and very scary. If it were not for Hermione's genius, he would have won.

--------------

Some OCs also deserve mentioning:

Albert Hughes in "Emperor", linkffn(5904185): A muggle officer who joined Harry very early. He is Harry's right hand man to do his dirty work, even Voldemort is wary of him.

La Pantera in "The Accidental Animagus" and "Animagus at War", linkffn(9863146): It's bloody hilarious to watch this cool dark lady ordering and scolding Voldemort.

Ronnie in "Weasley Girl", linkffn(8202739): This female version of Ron is adorable and fun.

--------------

I'm looking forward to know your favorite characters!

** Hmm ... well, I guess for me the list begins with +Lord Vol---+Harry Potter in “Seventh Horcrux”. Then there is Harry in “The Shadow of Angmar”, next is Milo in “Harry Potter and the Natural 20”, then Harry the Forest Elf in “Fantastic Elves and Where You Can Find Them” and its sequel. Following it is Petunia Dursley in “the family evans”, and Tom +Riddle+Dumbledore in “Last Chance”. Closing the list are Severus Snape in “Digging for the Bones”, Harry in “Hell Eyes”, and Dudley Dursley in “If I Knew You Were Coming, I'd've Baked a Cake”.

Mostly, it's about the fact that, one way or another, the characters are either funny to read about (the very first one on the list) or get relatively much character development (the rest of them). I like character development.

** Sweet Circe, enough fics there?

Anyway, I'm a bit uncomfortable talking about 'best characters' in the context of fanfiction. Because unless the character is an OC (or so different from canon to effectively be one), the character at least in part belongs to JKR.

We might like what the fanfic's done to change the character, but they're still a distortion of canon. In practice, I find that many of the 'improvements' authors make to a character are simply ironing out important flaws.

With that in mind though, I'd nominate:

- Hermione from linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or). She has very little resemblance to canon Hermione and at times comes across as /too/ good at everything. I've also been unconvinced in her character arc over years 2 and 3. But she's hard-arsed and clever and fun to read.

- Master Petri from linkffn(Blood Crest). A very convincing Scary Necromancer most of the time, he's just enough of a Wise Old Mentor to make us unsure what to think of him. One of the most convincing OCs I've encountered in fanfiction. Rosenkol's great too.

- Tom from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). The author did a very good job here of creating a plausible sane Lord Voldemort. Manipulative, yet still likeable. The characterisation at the start (and for HPAH in general) was /very/ heavy-handed though.

EDIT: How could I forget Alexandra from linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle). She's convincingly flawed and her youthfulness shines throughout the fic.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord.

But if they can just be interpretations of canon characters then... Cmon. The answer is obviously Harrymort linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes)

** I recently added a Percy recommendation post in which I mentioned this fic in but, I will post it here as well because it does /not/ ignore any of Percy's many flaws. It built a story around his pros and limitations in a way that felt very natural and, in the end, made me deeply care for Percy as a character in a way that I hadn't through canon. (Which makes sense, of course, since he isn't truly a part of the main story.) Anyways, it's linkffn(3784000) and I recommend it to anyone who is even slightly curious.

** This is probably not quite what you're actually asking for because the character has really only a very short appearance and it's almost more about the part she plays than the character itself but I think it still fits and i've never seen it mentioned before despite being so memorable for me.

Tessa in Wastelands of Time. Now, most people probably don't even remember her, hell even Harry didn't remember her until almost the end of the story and she's really not important to the plot but i thought she was the perfect example of how fucked up Harry's life was.

He just tried to be happy for once and he knew it wouldn't work out, he knew Voldemort would come for him eventually, he knew he had a bigger burden to shoulder but he still fell in love with her and she still managed to make him happy despite everything else.

'Her name was Tessa. She was a muggle and she loved me.' Is still my favorite quote from that fic.
