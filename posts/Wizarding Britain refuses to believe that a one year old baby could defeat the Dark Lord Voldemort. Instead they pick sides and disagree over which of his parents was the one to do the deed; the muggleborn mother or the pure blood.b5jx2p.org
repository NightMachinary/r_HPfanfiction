** On the morning of November 1, newspapers were being delivered to homes all over Britain, announcing the end of Lord Thingummy's reign of terror. In the Minister's London office, however, none of the department heads, junior ministers, and senior advisers had gone home since the previous evening---not after the urgent Floo call from the magical community of Godric's Hollow.

"A baby could not have defeated the Dark Lord," said Bartemius Crouch, head of the DMLE. "Preposterous---it simply is not possible."

Minister Bagnold unfurled a scroll of parchment on her desk. "Dumbledore says---"

"Dumbledore!" said Crouch, scowling. "Dumbledore has been of no help. My Aurors have been putting life and limb on the line fighting the Death Eaters, while Dumbledore sits in his high tower, twiddling his thumbs. For Merlin's sake, Alastor lost his leg last year! What is Dumbledore waiting for? He fought Grindelwald last time, and this time he has been next to useless!"

"Well, what should we tell the /Prophet/?" asked Bagnold. "The baby was the only survivor."

"Tell them it was James Potter," said Crouch. "Excellent NEWTS, applied for and passed the Auror training programme with flying colors. Talented, well-liked. Good family, too. The investigation team said he died right in the front hall, protecting the wife and child."

A spate of muttering broke out around the conference table.

"What about the mother?" Bagnold asked. "She was in the nursery, standing over the crib. We'll get letters from all the mothers in Britain if we try to put it on Mr. Potter---and Howlers too."

"She's only a muggleborn," said Crouch impatiently, tapping his quill on his scribbled page of notes. "She's related to no one important, and would be forgotten by next week if she wasn't attached to 'Potter', a good wizarding name."

"Excuse me," said Cornelius Fudge, head of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. It was his people who had responded to the original Floo call, from a neighbor witnessing an explosion at the other end of the street, and assumed someone had gotten too enthusiastic with their Halloween fireworks. "The baby wasn't the /only/ survivor. We found another."

"What?" said Bagnold, eyes widening in surprise. She turned to glare at Crouch. "Why wasn't I told about this, Bartemius?"

"It wasn't important!"

"What is important is for /me/ to decide," Bagnold snapped. "Who was it then, Cornelius?"

Here was his big chance to resolve the conflict, offer the best solution, and settle a compromise. According to a leadership book he'd read, that was important for good leaders to know. He intended to be a good leader one day; Bagnold was getting on in her years and soon the Minister's office would be looking for a successor.

Cornelius swallowed.

"The Potters' cat."

**** Thanks. I contribute to these prompt threads now and then, but I only like the ones that seem like a semi-realistic premise, and not just an amusing showerthought with no real "meat" to it, like that thread on Tom Riddle's horcrux working in a pub. Writing that in a serious way doesn't compute, as it would only work for a crack fic.

One of my fave prompt threads that I wrote a snippet for was [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aw0csj/draco_thinks_the_trio_are_his_best_friends/]["Draco thinks the Trio are his best friends because after years of watching his father politicking he thinks that is what close friendships are like."]]

And the one where [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/and7a2/prompt_believing_it_to_be_distracting_her_from/][Percy gets the Diary horcrux]].

Humorous, but not crack, is my personal taste in prompts.
