When I try to look at it from a parent point of view, I can't see any reasons why I would allow it instead of taking my whole family out of country as soon as possible. My reasoning:

- her friends a toxic and got her almost killed several times during the school years;
- she was seriously injured during the last "adventure" her friends got her into;
- in the school the students are constantly put into dangerous situations;
- she is spending less and less time with her family even during holidays (is she being brainwashed?);
- magical world doesn't care about her parents at all;
- there's a madman terrorist who likely to target her because of her friends and blood;
- she got her OWLs, so she won't lose her magic in case of leaving;
- she's 16 years old child;

Taking all of these points into account, why did Hermione's parents allow her to return?

[Edit]: in the answers I see that most think about her not telling anything to her parents. Than what do you think about a daughter who for years were looking into the eyes of the most important people for her and lying about life and death situations in her school?


** I think Dean's situation explains it pretty well:

#+begin_quote
  “My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They don't know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I'm not stupid enough to tell them.”
#+end_quote

It's likely the Grangers know very little about Hermione's school life beyond academics. We know she's okay lying to them because she told them she was staying at Hogwarts to study for exams in OoTP when she really went to spend Christmas at Grimmauld Place.

**** 'Really? Does it mean that a boarding school totally replaces family?'

No it means that you see your family for a week or so and then go off and socialise with your friends or your friends come to you. One of the major points of boarding school is to foster a sense of independence. I was at boarding school in England (and loved it by the way!) and when summer came I would spend a week or so with my parents and then go off and stay with friends. Quite normal.

'I think that such points makes her an immature child who can't make any responsible decisions.'

No it makes her an independent young woman shielding her parents from things they cannot (as muggles) understand in her view. She is being responsible because to her mind assisting Harry and her magical life is more important. I mean are you seriously calling the HIGHLY responsible Hermione Granger immature?!

'It some government declares you of age person it doesn't make you such.'

Um yes it does. It means you gain the responsibilities of an adult person in the country within which you live and 17/18 is plenty old enough when you have mainly grown up in a school where independence and self-reliance are very much encouraged.

Again please tell me how 16 year old Hermione is completely reliant on her parents? She could get married or leave home if she wishes to. And most 18 year olds only have experienced school at that age but they are considered adults so why not the responsible, has-been-on-many adventures-and-survived-to-tell-the-tale Hermione Granger at 16.

I went to English boarding schools too. What you describe is /not/ normal except in the last couple of years. I spent the vast majority of my holidays with my family. There was one kid I knew of who didn't do that. One, out of dozens in my year group that I was friendly with. He was a right weirdo.

Well then I hope you didn't go to boarding school then! I did and within my peers and the like it was very normal. I was (and still am) incredibly close to my parents. You still communicate through letters and phone calls and I treasure my family AND my independence highly. I said one to two weeks in the summer holidays, I'd then spend a week with them over Easter and another at Christmas. Different types of families do not negate what a family is - I am upper middle-class English woman, this is quite normal.

Not to run to mummy with every problem, not to cling to parents over the holidays, to manage our own school career and workload. Thus when we leave we are able to deal with University, careers and everything far swifter than people who have attended day school. independent life wasn't such a shock to me at 21 when I graduated university as to those who attended day school

That they can cure and heal pretty much anything? I mean, Harry broke his arm, had his bones removed and the next day he had his arm back to normal.

Broken bones takes months to fully heal, they can do that in two minutes. Parents of magical children are much more freespirited when it comes to injuries and the likes. Downright neglectful and abusive to Muggle's eyes. Just look at how Neville's upbringing was. Security to Wizards is laughable because injuries are rarely serious, or at least to a different extent than what is considered serious for Muggles.

To be honest I'm disappointed in most threads here.

The most upvoted answer is that Hermione lied about life and death situations in Hogwarts to her parents for years. Putting aside the moral, I'm ok with such answer.

But most other talks were more about protecting Hermione from being a 16 year old girl who has caring parents.

Taking into account all downvotes I got even expression of such thought is sacrilege.

  While I understand your point, it's hard for me to see how it correlates with the topic I created.
#+end_quote

The topic under the arguments that were brought is trivially linked to societies. As the artificial societal norms in the Harry Potter movies were behind most of the actions of the protagonists in the serie (yes that includes reckless school management). These constructed, contrived norms were designed by a single human to create and narrate a story and the characters were made to fit that story, Hermione included. The flaw in the argumentation - this discussion - is when you, and others (me included) tried to approach these artificial societies - Muggle / Wizard - through our organic views. That is to say that what seem illogical for us is not applicable in this story. Many points of logic that you will see in Harry Potter, and most other work of fiction, will fail spectacularly once scrutinized, simply because the author was not so much focused in producing the closest thing to an organic society as they were interested in producing a story. As such, instead of doing it the "natural" "logical" way of designing a story around a society, Harry Potter, like most other fictions, saw the societies shoehorned inside the stories and only superficially thought through.

The discussion in this thread grew to this level because you try to apply organic morals to a story that only have constructed ones.

#+begin_quote
  The most upvoted answer is that Hermione lied about life and death situations in Hogwarts to her parents for years. Putting aside the moral, I'm ok with such answer.
#+end_quote

This is the way you approached every single replies in this thread. Moral is irrelevant. The most likely opinion that creates the least cognitive dissonance in our understanding of Hermione's family dynamic (Hermione as caring parents and Hermione's parents lets her come back to school year after year ; ergo they must not be aware of what is occuring at school) is the one that got the most upvotes. We do not know what happens, we do not care, ultimately, because the reasoning is irrelevant to the story. We can try to shove our own logic down the story's throat and, yes, our morals ("Putting aside the moral, I'm ok with such answer."). It is what it is. The story revolves around teenagers hero, and for teenagers to be hero, adults have to be incompetent. It's not a fallacy, it's a rule of the fiction genre. One which would fail in the real world. But this rule is the backbone of the whole Harry Potter saga. Adults are incompetent.

Adults are incompetent.

This includes the school, the government, but also the parents. The teenagers have to be heroes. To be heroes, they have to shine and there would be no way for them to shine if the adults were anywhere close to competent. If Hermione's parents were competent, they would not have let her go back to school, but they couldn't. Because J.K Rowling needed them to be fucking miserable at their parenting. That's really the end of it. There's no morals, there's no values, there's no logic because it's an artificial, constructed story relying on incompetence where there would normally not be in the real world. This is where all discussions questionning the actions of characters will end up, because it is the tragic, needed flaw for the story to work as it did.

As soon as people tried to view this discussion through organic societial rules, with morals and values, it was bound to take this weird, kafkaesque turn.

I think maturity is first of all clear understanding and acceptance when you can take responsibility and when you can't.

Yes it does. It literally makes them more mature, with time. It works just the other way you think it does. First you take your autonomy and then you grow more mature. This is because you need to learn how to be mature, and this is done through finding yourself in situations where you have no other choices than to take your responsabilities.

If your child refuses to take his independence, what you end up with is a 30 or 40 year old child. Not a balanced, experienced and mature adult.

Sending our children to risk death in defense of their nation and values is part of the price we collectively pay for liberty.

** Hermione's birthday is in September. Which means that she'd be 17 nineteen days after 6th year began. Even if her parents would be able to force her to stay at home after her fifth year, she'd be a legal adult after little more than 2 weeks from the beginning of term. After that date there's nothing they can do to stop her. Even assuming her parents knew the whole picture of what was happening at Hogwarts (unlikely), I'm pretty sure Hermione would have pointed out to her parents that forbidding her to continue her education would be quite futile in the end. It would just have delayed her a tiny bit, I'm pretty sure Dumbledore would have graciously allowed her to come back to Hogwarts come September 19th. Assuming he didn't send his Order wands blazing when she didn't show up at the Express (or before that if she was prevented from contacting her friends).

As someone pointed out, the Dursleys were pretty against Harry going to Hogwarts. That didn't seem to stop Harry in the slightest. I seriously doubt that Hermione's parents would have fared any better. You should keep in mind that to most wizards, even the most fairly headed of them like the Weasleys, muggles are curious and funny little creatures, not real people. They might not want to torture and enslave them, but to their eyes they're not equal. They're 'just muggles'.

Ps: also, Hermione used a timeturner in her third year. So she was an adult before the start of term, biologically if not legally. And despite what you might or might not think an being or not being an adult solely depends on reaching the age of majority in your legal system. It has nothing to do with maturity.

In 2nd year she figured it out thats simply true.

In 3rd year tough she had no idea what she was talking about and was just whining for attention.

4th year she learns Harry one spell. While having a ridiculous campaign about elves.

5th year if she was the mastermind her plan basically backfired into epic proportions.

They might not even be that interested in the first place, they might be happy in their muggle world.

No one tells their parents everything, teens don't tell their parent that they're sexually active or that they're drinking at parties or that they smoked some weed. Instead of doing all that, Hermione just busy helping Harry save lives.

They may not be bared from Diagon Alley but they certainly don't have a reason to be there, they're muggles adults with full time jobs and with a daughter that goes to a boarding school and when she comes home all she has to talk about is things they don't understand or have too much of an interest in, to them she may as well be talking quantum physics. As long as she says she's doing well and that she's getting good marks than they have no reason to pry, they also have no reason to see that anything is going wrong, she could tell them that Voldemort is back from the dead and they wouldn't think much of it because they don't know the significances of that, it's just another wacky thing about that would that their daughter is in.

Why?

She is a teenage daughter and they are her caring parents who don't want to see her dead, because the shitty government couldn't handle the mad terrorist.

Let's remember that Hitler and Nazis weren't defeated by native Germans or German Jews. It was a coalition of other countries that did it.

So if Hermione truly wants to fight Riddle and his DEs, it's more reasonable to get out the country, finish education and join the force (army) that can really deal with him.

Of support that force with academic research as Albert Einstein did.

"I want to fight without any plan, training and support, because it's Right and Noble" -- the argument of a really immature child.

******** I agree with your point that running away is a bit extreme.

However, in this case were Hermione to take that step she's gone until she turns 18. And once she hits that magic age she can go back to the muggle world with little concern.

As for schooling and living arrangements, Hogwarts is tuition free. That, and between the Weasleys taking her in (which they would) and Harry would likely loan/gift her a few galleons for her school books so she is set.

Again, I don't think it's the best solution, but it's not nearly as difficult an option as you make it out to be.

** I guess in order,

...Even if her friends would be considered toxic from our book perspective, her parents would only know from Hermione's. So instead of Ron made me cry and only because of that did the troll attack me. It is Harry and Ron saved me from a Troll, with no magical contexts a troll could be those rock things from Frozen. Instead of the roughly 12 foot monster.

...5th year? Why would she tell her parents about that? She broke into a government building, even a no magical kid would be afraid or embarrassed to do so.

...Danger? Again no context, giant basilisk could just be a very large magical python. How much would hermione's discussion go into? Just because she's bright doesn't mean she's a great story teller. Rashomon effect, people go over events in their head and focus on different things. Giant 3 Headed Dog? Nah but there was a cool trapdoor. In this case Ron would be the better story teller.

...Less and less time with parents? That's just growing up. Magic has little to do with it.

...Mad terrorists? Killing Muggles? The only reason we know Harry Potter is specifically targeted is because of magical perspective. Imagine say a friend from another country, say China, telling you about a national movie star. How much would you care is they got Starbucks behind you? Now a movie star from your own country. Same difference, magic terrorists, they probably don't think about it.

..16 so she can leave? ... so? That's a pro for if she does leave, not a reason to leave.

...She can also have sex legally then too so that probably matters more to them realistically. Also she's been in that system since 11, she's gonna drop out before finishing? Stop at high school and not go to the Magical College years? Or Uni after Secondary?

And what if she tells them nothing? That's her business, I can't judge her for sharing or keeping information. I judge actions, and she's done some pretty nuts things. But without context we don't know how amazing the other students adventures are or aren't.

There could be a whole seris of... Patil Twins and the Secret of the Willow, Patil Twins and the Vanishing Hufflepuff, Patil Twins and the Search for Sanctuary. It's only fantastic to the muggle not the wizard. Merlin was a real guy. I'm sure his adventures put Harry to shame.

Kids could get into fights at regular school and never tell their parents, be bullied or be the bully. And their parents never know. It's up to the parent to raise them and hope they actually do it. Not receive reports on it, cause really they could say anything.

The whole truth, lie of omission, or a story that's totally a lie. But they can have only acted one way and generally parents don't get to see how their children act. Just 2nd hand reports.

...

So I suppose my answer to your discussion is that sure magical school is more dangerous. But so is untrained magic, who knows what kinds of accidental magic there was with mini Hermione? Forget the later added on stuff with kids exploding and religious undertones, just imagine your daughter wanting to wear all blue or something, and then turns her whole outfit and entire body blue.

Probably for the best to send her to a school that knows how to, and can handle it.

** Why do you think the Ministry gives any shit about muggles trying to keep their child out of Hogwarts?

Hermione probably feared that her parents would try and stop her from attending Hogwarts, the Ministry would obliviate or charm her parents into either letting her go or forgetting about her. She doesn't want this and thus prefers not to tell her parents.

In general, muggleborns seem to often lose contact with their families since the worlds are so closed to each other. Hermione is in a shit situation with this and took the one that she thought causes least problems for her family.

Source? I don't recall any instance where muggles who are legal guardians under muggle law have any say in whether a magical child goes to Hogwarts. Harry is taken to Hogwarts against the explicit refusal of the Dursleys. Tom Riddle's orphanage was never even told what school he would go to, Mrs Cole was just bewitched by Dumbledore to stop asking questions.

And the Ministry most likely wouldn't take that into account. Between staying in danger with her parents obliviated about her and staying in danger with her parents not knowing about the danger she's in, I can understand why Hermione wouldn't want them to know about everything going on.

** I can smell the ‘Muggleness' of this post and OP's opinion. Hermione is the brightest witch of her era and as Dean pointed out - Muggleborns dont tell shit to their parents. I mean how do you expect people to believe that the biggest bad guy ever is an immortal bald snakeface with no nose? OP also pointed out that Hermione not telling shit to her parents makes her immature lol. If anything, that was the most mature thing to do. By telling her parents shit, she'll only be putting then in danger. Not telling them shit and obliviating them actually saved their lives. And this may sound cruel, but what Hermione did was right. By abandoning her parents and returning to the Magical world, Hermione helped to save thousands from Voldemort's reign. As dear Dumbledork loves to say, “For the greater good.”

** Hermione probably just didn't tell them so they wouldn't have any way of finding out. And even if they did, they probably weren't capable of stopping her. By the time fifth year roles around, the shit is hitting the fan and things are getting serious. Hermione is willing to directly oppose authority to the point of organizing what is essentially a small army. She's not just going to accept it if her parents tell her she can't go back. Further, Dumbledore probably wouldn't have let them pull her out. By that point, she was obviously too important to Harry's ability to function efficiently for Dumbledore to let her go.

** I think, like many posters above, that Hermione likely didn't tell her parents most, if any, of what happened at Hogwarts. Combine that with their lack of access to the Wizarding World during the year, makes it pretty likely that they had very little knowledge.

Also, in the early years especially, Hermione spent quite a lot of time with her parents on holidays. She goes home for Christmas, spends time with them in France, and even goes to Diagon Alley with them. I think something to remember is we see the story through Harry's eyes, not Hermione's. Therefore, for all we know, she could be spending tons of time with them that we don't see.
