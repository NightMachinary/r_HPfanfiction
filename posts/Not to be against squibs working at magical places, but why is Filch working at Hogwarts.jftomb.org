They have House-Elves to cook and clean. Filch actively hates the students, always loving it, when students are in trouble. Makes me wonder, how he ended up working there, and why.


** I assumed it was some pity on Dumbledore's part - it is the only reasonable explanation for why his hatred of the students is tolerated - "he is just so pitiable and a waste of life, just let the poor bastard be."

Also - resentful janitors is a trope, which is probably why JKR included him (meta).

** HP is a very stylized story. It's also a parody in some respects, of the usual british boarding school coming of age boyhood genre. And Filch represents a specific trope from those books. As HP's pitch is wizarding boarding school, it makes perfect sense for Filch to be there on a literary level. It works on a story level quite well. Also there are many things in life and fiction that make very little sense when reflected on. There are many people in life who are quite terrible at their jobs and or don't particularly like them. And yet they spend their whole lives doing them.

As HP is soft magic, it has more freedom to be whimsical and have things exist for metaphorical reasons, or as comic relief, rather than being an ultra realistic, heavily regimented high fantasy that feels like a card game. In that super systemic type world that's logic focused, you couldn't have a character like Filch. Some people like that. Frankly, I find those type of stories quite dull. Different strokes for different folks

** I saw an idea in a couple of fics that had Filch basically being the House Elves' manager. Pureblood Dogma has the 'Head of the Family' being the 'Manager' for Family Elves, and that works if you've got 1-6 of them cleaning a moderate property, but if you've got 100+ elves cleaning a whole castle, then you need a specific person to manage them and Dumbledore wouldn't have the time, so they hire Filch to do that specifically.

I do like horrorshowjack's first explanation though, of him being there to do the specialist stuff.

**** For all we know, he was. Harry was the most oblivious little shit on the planet, so for all we know Filch was actually the person they employed to do all the Hogwarts paintings and they just moonlit on the side as a janitor for personal amusement.

But yeah, in all likelihood, the Rowlz just put him in for the Cliche and didn't think too hard about it beyond that. :D

his list of forbidden articles are stuff that ruins artwork. I can imagine that highly reactive magical pranks could actually interact with magical portraits in a negative way

That would be an interesting character for Harry to take up with too, actually. Like, instead of the usual Aurors or Superheroes or Medi-magicals or whatever, he gets into Art and History and such and Filch is the one who teaches him all of that.

** In addition to what others have said, I wouldn't be surprised if, out of universe, Rowling hadn't completely fleshed out the house-elves when she wrote PS. And while Dobby obviously shows up in CoS, the Hogwarts house-elves aren't mentioned until GoF. So even if house-elves did exist while writing PS, she might not have decided to put them in Hogwarts until later.

** There really isn't a reasonable canon explanation imo.

I've read two fanon ideas that somewhat made sense at least in the story. First, is that he does repairs and maintenance on the paintings and such. Which has to be done manually, and requires a great deal of skill.

Second, in an evil Dumbles iirc, is that he was basically enslaved by Hogwarts due to his family trying to stiff the school on his grandfather's tuition and medical expenses.

** Well, Filch also deals with catching and punishing misbehaving students. And I can definitely see why a House Elf would be poorly suited for such a role: one, given how wizards (especially purebloods) tend to treat House Elves, being given punishment by one would probably be seen as incredibly demeaning and raise a ton of complaints from the Board of Governors; two, it might go against a House Elf's "conditioning" (for a lack of better word) to actually order a witch or a wizard around, even if it's required of him.

** Not remember when i read it or where but there was a story in which Filch was Salazar Slyterin. Other three founders had defeated him but since they cannot kill him due to horcruxes they erased his memory, convinced him he was a squib named argus filch and made him the janitor of Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. Only the Headmaster of the school was told of this so they can keep the ruse up.

** I once read a fic years ago which came up with an explanation that the presence of a squib acted as an insulator or something against all the unstable magic from a larger than normal presence of wizards. Honestly I didn't really understand what they were going for, as it was one if those fics that did try to explain away a lot of magic with science.

*** Never read that fic, but it seems like a squib might work as a grounding wire for the ‘static magic' that hundreds of incompletely trained wizards/witches give off.

Pretty good idea actually. And also gives some semi-justification for the practice of sending squibs out of house and even society.

**** Consider that kids aren't generally all that worldly when they're 11, and after that, he's become a fixture in their minds. So as a simple misdirection, doing the occasional cleaning job in trouble spots allows you to be invisible while also keeping an eye out on the kids. Given that he's been doing the job for years, it also explains why he's so biased against children, as police officers in special units develop similar mindsets due to the fact that they only ever come in contact with the worst of society.

** One theory is that he's another poltergeist. Peeves was brought into existence by all the students who wanted to skip class or play pranks or stay up past curfew. Filch, on the other hand, was brought into existence by the teachers and prefects who wanted order, and for the rules to be followed, and for students to be punished if they broke the rules. That's why Filch hates Peeves with such a passion, and Peeves just provokes him. They can't get rid of Filch, just like they can't get rid Peeves, so they let him work. He can't use magic because he's just a poltergeist.

It did make me wonder who thought it was a good idea to send a squib looking for a wizard who was thought to be a Death Eater and mass murderer. If Sirius had been the villain he was thought to be then Filch wouldn't have stood a chance if he found him.

** There is no in universe explanation, while there are a few things he could do (he's there to manage the house elves, he's there because house elves lack the authority to do much with students, there to handle some specialist task like portrait maintenence, basically the other replies here) and a few reasons for it to be him (pity on the part of Dumbledore, he's one of the few willing to take the job, he's got a relative on the board of goveners who pulled some strings to get him a job in the magical world etc.).\\
The problem is that not only is all of that never seen or mentioned, but he's constantly doing menial labour that a house elf would do better, there's no reason for a man with any of those other jobs to also be scrubbing floors, because there's no reason anyone should be doing that at all.
