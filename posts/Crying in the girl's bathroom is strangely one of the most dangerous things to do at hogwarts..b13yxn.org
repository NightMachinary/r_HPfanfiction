****** He was in the boys' bathroom. HBP, chapter 24: Harry "saw Malfoy's tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys' bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle."

******* Myrtle isn't stuck in the second floor girl's bathroom anyway. She just chooses to spend most of her time there, she goes to Nick's deathday party in the dungeons and she ends up in the prefect's bathroom with Harry in book 4.

** "Okay, so, not only is Voldemort alive and restored to a body, he's cloned himself about 6 times, converted or charmed or Imperiused about 90% of the Ministry, used some tricky time turner shenanigans to obtain an army of basilisks and trolls and dementors, and last I heard Fenrir got some Wolfsbane Potion and is off to infect as many muggles as he can. I like your scheme, but there's no way we can induce them to all charge in to attack you at once!"\\
Harry Potter's eyes glinted dangerously, "Oh, no?"\\
Then he dramatically pointed his finger in the air, "I...will go and cry in the /lady's bathroom!/"

A few minutes later, elsewhere, the seven Voldemorts (and their respective allocated Death Eaters) all simultaneously twitched as a strange sensation came over them.\\
"Our slasher-movie senses are tingling...someone, somewhere is alone and vulnerable."\\
A random Slytherin burst into the room, "My lord! I've just witnessed Harry Potter, /Harry Potter!/, ducking into the third-floor girl's bathroom at Hogwarts in a mess of tears!"\\
There was silence for a moment as various random Death Eaters contemplated the oddity of the male Harry Potter going into a women's bathroom, before the head Voldemort cleared his throat and glared at them all, "What are you waiting for?! *CHARGE!!*"
