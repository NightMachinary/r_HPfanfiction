** "Harry, why is the entire English mainland covered in freezing myst?‚Äù Hermione asked, her glair obvious even through the rippling haze.

"And why," interjected Ron from within a cocoon of heavy blankets, "does the myst make more nose than the great hall on a feast day?"

Harry mumbled something, his head buried in his traveling trunk.

"What was that, Harry?" Hermione demanded, arms now crossed.

"Aha!" Cried Harry as he dug out his invisibility cloak. He draped it around his shoulders and shivered in pleasure. "Turns out a Hallow really wards of ghost chill," said Harry with ill placed good cheer.

"Ghosts?" Said Ron.

"Ghosts!" Said Fred.

*** Wow, I really like that ending. You can just imagine how happy George would be if Fred came back as a ghost.

** "Fun fact Harry, did you know that in 1387 the boys and girls dormitories were switched around in Gryffindor tower?" Hermione asked serenely. "It says so Hogwarts A History."

"I didn't know that Hermione, why are you telling me this?" Harry inquired cautiously, knowing from experience that this tone of voice coming from Hermione tended to lead to pain on his or Ron's parts.

"I only mention it because in 1222 there was a disastrous prank played on the boys in the Gryffindor dorms." Hermione looked at her fingernails in an effort to seem nonchalant. "Now usually pranks are nothing of note historically speaking, what with so many happening each year. This prank however is not mentioned for its cleverness, or its reach, or even for its execution." Hermione paused a moment before uttering that last word. She looked over at Harry, her eyes narrowing, her brow furrowing, and her hands clenching.

Harry felt his stomach drop. A sheen of sweat appeared on his brow. He didn't know where Hermione was going with this, but it couldn't be good.

"You see Harry, some enterprising young wizard, the history books don't mention who, felt it would be a wonderful, daring, and quite hilarious idea to release a cloud of Gillagort powder throughout the whole of Gryffindor tower. Have you heard of Gillagort powder Harry?" Hermione's voice morphed into a tight, barely controlled rage. Harry knew it well, he had made her mad often enough throughout their years of friendship. He made a note to remind her of those years, hopefully that would soften the blow of whatever she was obviously planning to do to him. Hermione could be vicious.

"Um. Uh. No Hermione, I've never heard of Gillagord powder before." He pronounced it wrong on purpose. Correcting him might take a small part of her mind off of her anger.

"Gillagort, Harry. With a T. Enunciate Harry, we're not savages." Harry knew Hermione too well.

Hermione frowned a little, clearly trying to remember where she had left off. Harry suspected she had practiced this routine a few times and hadn't expected to get thrown off topic like that. She shook her head almost imperceptibly. "Well I'm not surprised you've never heard of it Harry, after all it's only on page 177 of 1000 Magical Herbs and Fungi, it's not as though it's something you should know from your five years in Herbology." Sarcasm. This was bad, really bad. Hermione only used sarcasm in a tirade when she was utterly apopleptic. Clearly Harry had fucked up big time. "Gillagort powder has some rather interesting properties. In its dry form it is completely and utterly vile. The smell of the powder is likened to that of a toenail that has been rotting in a shoe for a decade before passing through the digestive system of a troll with dysentery. Of course, you might think, this would make for an excellent prank. Make everything smell like shit. It was the 14th century equivalent of a dung bomb. Just fucking hilarious!"

Hermione was swearing now. This was really REALLY bad. Harry started to go through shield spells in his head, starting with one to protect his more sensitive parts. The Cup Charm is something all guys learn quite quickly at Hogwarts. Testicles make such tempting targets for angry girls and pissed off guys alike. Or just when your friends think it'd be funny to see you writhing on the floor in pain. Hearin The BallSlap Charm makes most men wince on reflex in Magical Britain.

"The interesting thing about Gillagort is what happens when the powder gets wet, specifically when it interacts with steam." Hermione was looking slightly manic at this point, her eyes were wider than Harry had ever seen them and he could see a vein in her forehead throbbing to such an extent that Uncle Vernon would have been impressed. If of course Uncle Vernon was self-aware enough to know about the vein in his forehead, which Harry seriously doubted. "You see Harry, oh Master of Death. Oh Bringer of Ghosts. The Great Ressurector! When Gillagort interacts with steam it becomes a very fast acting, extremely potent poison. Now why would this matter you may ask. 'Did someone die in the shower? Well that's a shame Hermione, but the showers have stalls, you can just use another one, ignore the ghost in that stall and use the others Hermione. It's fine Hermione. Please don't hurt me Hermione.' Well the funny thing is, just before this HILARIOUS prank was unleashed every boy in Gryffindor got involved in a large tussle with every boy in Slytherin. It was a fairly friendly affair all told, nothing like what we have today. No, it was just a couple hundred boys flinging mud at each other for an hour or so, getting completely and utterly covered in filth. If Filch had been alive he would have been livid."

Harry's face slowly took on a look of abject horror. He knew exactly why this incident was in Hogwarts A History now.

A feral grin appeared on Hermione's face, morphing it into something that only barely resembeled a human. "I see you are begining to understand now. You get why I'm so upset." Harry thought upset was a severe understatement. "You see Harry, for the last few weeks, ever since you so wisely and brillantly brought back everyone who had ever died as a ghost, I have been unable to shower. I have been unable to shower because all the showers in the girls dorms are filled with the ghosts of nude boys. Now I'm quite sure some of the girls are delighted at being able to ogle some man meat when they bathe. I however take no pleasure in it. I would like to finish my final year without such distractions. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FUCKING SHOWER WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT SOME DEAD BOYS DRIPPING BALLSACK AND SOGGY ARSE CRACK!" Hermione grabbed harry by the collar, her wand at his throat. "Fix this, or I swear to whatever gods are listening that I will GELD YOU!"

For the first time since Voldemort had been defeated Harry feared for his life. Hermione had gone completely off the deep end here. Her hair was standing on end, like she had been hit with a huge static charge, her breath was ragged and quick, and the tip of her wand glowed ominously. Harry needed to acquiesce quickly or she might actually kill him.

"Ok Hermione, I promise. I'll start right this second. I'll send them all back." As soon as I figure out how, Harry thought. "Just please let me go. We're friends remember? Friends help each other!" He tried to keep his tone light, though the cracking of his voice probably did nothing to sell that to Hermione. He looked for all the world like a rabbit cornered by a hungry fox.

"You have one day, or I'm coming for you!" Hermione released him and stalked off, a miasma of rage and discontentment permeating the air around her as she went. Harry sank down against the wall behind him, shaking slightly from the adrenaline. He idly wondered why Hermione didn't just leave the school and shower somewhere else. It's not like anyone would stop her, and she could apparate anywhere in the country, even to Harry's own custom made 6 headed shower with integrated shampoo statue. He also figured this explained why Hermione was wearing so much deoderant.

Harry slowly got up. He had plans to make. He either had to figure out a way to reverse his ghastly blunder, or else quickly and quietly move everything he owns to some private hidden island off the coast of Mexico or South Africa or Australia. He feared he would likely need the latter.
