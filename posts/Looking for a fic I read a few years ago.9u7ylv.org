#+begin_quote
  A Harmony story. Hermione is a Veela and discovers this shortly before their fourth year. What will Hermione's new powers do to alter Harry's fourth year? Warning- there's Ron-bashing ahead. If you dislike Ron-bashing, don't read.

*** Unfortunately that one isn't it. Thanks for the suggestion, though. It'll be nice t reread that one even if it isn't the one I was looking for.

** I think I've seen Draco in the triwizard tournament only once, but unfortunately I don't remember any specifics. the rest sounds like it might be the "Don't Fear the Reaper" Challenge by Reptilia28, maybe that helps your search.
