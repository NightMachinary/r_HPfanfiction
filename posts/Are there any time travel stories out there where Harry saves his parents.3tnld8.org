I mean I've read tonnes of stories where Harry has gone back in time to either his 1st or 4th year and changed things for the better. I've even read one where he goes back to just after he got his scar and Voldemort killed his parents. I've read one or two where he goes back and meets his parents while they are in school but never once has he saved them. I get the whole paradox argument but this is Fanfiction! You can explain away anything you want. Are there no stories where he uses time travel to save them? Just curious.


** Yes.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), Harry went back to 1975 and turned Bellatrix. I was very skeptical at start, but thought to give it a try based on 9000+ favorites. Now it has become one of my favorite HP fanfics. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. [[/spoiler][There are a fair amount of actions involving the Marauders, including Lily competing against Bellatrix for Harry's affection, and Bellatrix pranking the Dursleys.]]

*** I've actually read this and totally forgot about it when I posted last night. Lol. For some reason I always think of this fic in my head as a dimension travelling fic instead of time travel. Anyway thanks for the rec and I totally agree that it was an awesome read! One of my favorites for sure!

** Hmm ... I do remember this happening in “Harry Potter and the Freak Parade” (linkffn(3022004)).

Granted, the story is fairly silly, but eh, it's enjoyable.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
