*** I can only think it might be because they want James & Lily to live but also want Harry to have a similar family background to canon - maybe its easier to write in character then without having to include a well-adjusted Harry.

(Although by that point I question why let J&L survive if they aren't going to be the people they seemed to be any more)

**** Harry was canonically abused and withdrawn. Some of what the Dursleys do would even count as torture, such as the rations Harry was kept on in CoS. And any decent attorney can make Petunia taking a swing with a pan into attempted manslaughter since a frying pan connecting with a child's head can easily kill it.

Which is why I never understood the need to exaggerate the abuse in fics. It is already bad enough in canon.

*** It contextualizes the mistreatment of Harry as something malicious rather than a series of failures.

In canon Dumbledore twists Petunia's sense of familial obligation to foist Harry on the Dursleys to provide him with seeming flawless protection from Voldemort (Death Eaters and other threats are a grey area).

Dumbledore is prioritizing Harry's safely over anything else, the Dursley's do the bare minimum out a sense of responsibility, James and Lily are dead, and Sirius their most trusted seemingly betrayed them. No one person is really at fault, but if James and/or Lily live then they and Dumbledore can be a proper villain rather than someone making the best of a bad situation.

"Oh, he must have a heart of gold. He's just misunderstood. Hermione should totally marry this guy!" Their best friend routinely risks his life and stands by them even in direst situations, but has gotten into arguments a few times. "What a traitor! This guy is a filthy devil incarnate!!!"

There was a viral video a few years ago of some child (2-4 years old) chainsmoking. I also saw some colourised pictures from the early 20th century the other day and one of them had newspaper delivery boys (aged 10-12 maybe) take a collective smoke break.

Smoking has almost been eradicated from mainstream culture nowadays, but it is still way more common than you'd think. I remember the first people who were smoking in high school started around 13. It is unfortunate, but such is life. Whether or not authors should add such things to their fics is a very different question, but it is sadly founded in reality.

Not sure what exactly you mean, but there are two explanations:

- Because they are taught only to include scenes which advance the plot. So you either include random conversations with random people which never go beyond a passing acquaintance, or you just don't show it. Like canon Harry never having a chat with Katie, Angelina and Alicia.

- It is rather difficult to sell a love interest only to write a believable break-up (without cheating), have the MC cope and then do it again and again. If you don't get the readers invested in the passing relationship, they will drop the fic as it bores them. Or they will be mad that you broke up their OTP. And if you write a badly matched relationship, people wonder why your MC is stupid enough to not have ended it earlier.

***** to be fair, in pretty much any fic where adult characters talk about their 12 year old children marrying, the adult in question is bad/evil/delusional or its happening within an interpretation of the Wizarding World which places their society and culture as Victorian era or earlier equivalent, at which time it wasn't /exactly/ unheard of for 12 year old girls to be married off, so long as they'd begun puberty.

Doesn't make it right, and if it creeps you it creeps you, but there is usually context behind those things happening in a fic. Honestly I can deal with that kind of thing so long as they don't have sex or get intimate until they're at least at an age where kids during the 90's would have done so, at a minimum of 13.

Its odd to read about 13 year olds doing stuff like that, of course, but then they're fictional characters, authors usually give indication ahead of time if there's going to be sexual situations in the fic to warn you, and unless I decide to just not read any HP fanfic that takes place in any era before post-series/post-hogwarts when they're all above 18 years old, it isn't going to disappear.

***** Not sure where you are from, but here a pair of 14 y.o. could have legal sex as long as they both consent. I find the marriage and the acceptance at that age more way more creepy than them being intimate as long as the author does not make it too explicit. I know a few people who were intimate at that age. I know no one who wanted to be married back then. Horny teenagers are not immersion-breaking. Happily married on the other hand is.

To quote Wikipedia: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe][The vast majority of countries set their ages in the range of 14 to 16; only four countries, Cyprus (17), Ireland (17), Turkey (18) and Vatican City (18), do not fit into this pattern]]

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right?

***** As far as the HP verse goes, ghosts don't seem to be echoes, their personalities seem stagnant, but who knows if they were different when they died compared to when we see them? I imagine the Grey Lady was far less bitter a ghost before she lead Tom Riddle to her mother's diadem and realized what he would do to it, and Myrtle seems to be happier after the Basilisk is killed rather than being worthy of the name Moaning Myrtle.

The Resurrection Stone seems to bring back echoes, and Magical Portraits are probably echoes considering how they probably work, but I'd imagine ghosts are just souls that for some reason decided not to move on. Maybe death makes them more resistant to change than they were in death, but they seem, to use a very unfitting term, far too alive to not be fully there.

** I feel like sometimes people have hangups that I find confusing.

I enjoy AUs. But they don't (necessarily) relate to or impact either my perception of canon or of other AUs. To me, fanfic is a sandbox. You can build it one way on Monday through Wednesday and completely different come Thursday morning. To me, that doesn't suggest either interpretation is more valid or better, they simply are views, what ifs; literally /alternate/ universes, neither seeking to - or managing to - replace each other /or/ the source text in my mind.

For ex, one of my favourite fics is Arsinoe's /scathingly/ critical post-DH fic which villainises all of the Trio while lionizing Snape and an OC. I'm thrilled by the creativity and the perspective, and the efforts to make a coherent story that fills some of JK's gaps in a way that suits the author's purposes. But it doesn't make me, the reader, dislike the Trio, or like Snape more, /outside of the bounds of that story/. It's just to me an interesting thought experiment. The writer is saying to me, 'what if...this scenario', rather than 'this scenario is The Truth that I wholeheartedly believe and if you don't You're Wrong!'

Especially if it's a male character who's being taken advantage of by an older woman, which unfortunately mirrors the pop culture narrative surrounding male victims of child sex abuse by women that the victim is "lucky" to have had such an experience.

*** Not quite what you're going for, and it could very easily have tropes you don't like starting with the fact its a wrong boy who lived fic, but " *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw* " is a spin on the idea where Harry is abandoned to the Dursleys by his parents mostly due to a Manipulative Dumbledore, he is framed for the chamber of secrets in second year after Ginny dies, and after some time in Azkaban is given a chance to go back in time and change things.

The catch is that the life he remembers was the second life of his brother, John, who was sent back in time once but fucked it up(He was supposed to help his brother, the true boy who lived. Instead of was arrogant and stupid, got Ginny killed and then stepping into a killing curse from Voldemort thinking he'd just be given another chance anyways) so Harry ends up years before John's return, and turns everything upside down so that when the John that was given a second chance comes back, everything isn't how he remembers it being since Harry has been meddling.

Its an entertaining read, if nothing else. OP Harry Potter in some sense, but not to the point where everything is easy for him.

** I am always disappointed by the lack of fanfiction about the WWII/Grindelwald era. I know that there isn't an explicit canon connection between Grindelwald and the Nazis, but the timing seems awfully coincidental and the philosophies are similar.

Hitler wants to remake the world for the benefit of the 'superior' German people, and to the detriment of the 'subhuman' Jews and Slavic peoples, using any means necessary including genocide and virtual slavery.\\
In a similar vein, Grindelwald wants to remake the world for the benefit of the 'superior' wizards over the 'inferior' muggles; to place wizards in their rightful place over muggles, who would again be virtual slaves to their wizard masters. Both Hitler and Grindelwald claim that their inherent enemies (Jews and Muggles) are a mortal danger to Germans/Wizards, and have similar racial ideas about blood/race purity and the importance of keeping wizard blood/German blood pure.

Now I have read a number of fanfiction stories that reference the Nazi-Grindelwald connection, where the Nazis are making huge gold and blood sacrifices to Grindelwald, giving him enormous magical power in return for his assistance fighting the Allies. Others have wizards more directly involved in muggle wars, such as when Newt Scamander mentions in Fantastic Beasts that he worked with dragons on the Eastern Front in WWI, while his brother was some kind of war hero.

I think this period of time has enormous potential for new characters, magic, and creatures. Having large scale magical battles between different nations and their respective wizards would be great, as in most fanfiction is limited to duels or small group battles. Even in canon, there were only a few fights of any size (OoTP Ministry Battle; DH Seven Harrys Battle) and only one true battle that integrated large scale battle magics, magical creatures, real strategy/tactics, namely the Battle of Hogwarts. Imagine the magical side of Operation Barbarossa or the Battle of Stalingrad. Entire new magical societies and techniques could be explored in Japan or North Africa; the possibilities are endless.

We all know that Dumbledore is said to be the most powerful wizard in the world, but bear in mind that he was at least 100 years old during the war against Voldemort. We have one amazing battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort in OoTP, but in that Dumbledore was old, probably holding back to avoid completely destroying the Ministry, and had to protect Harry. Imagine a duel between a younger Albus at the peak of his power and vitality against Grindelwald, a ruthless wizard who is a near equal to Dumbledore.

These are just some ideas that have been floating around in my head, and I think it's odd that such a huge potential world has been largely ignored. I know it would be an enormous project just to write anything in this era, but many authors have created expansive AUs and worlds. And there are enough variations of possible connections between muggle and magical societies during war, Hitler and Grindelwald, and Albus and Grindelwald that anyone can shoehorn their favorite stories or themes or ideas in.

If there are any fics in this strain that I am not aware of, please let me know, and let me know your ideas for stories during the WWI, Interwar, and WWII eras.

*** I've never really understood the voting patterns of this community. Usually I can predict reasonably enough what is going to be upvoted or downvoted more or less (references to order/DE ships as preferred/OTP/whatever or my stance on love potions being especially prone to downvoting). Then a post I write which seems innocuous enough gets downvoted, and another where I expected unpopular opinions to cause several downvotes have the exact opposite effect and gets above-average upvotes. Eventually I just gave up trying to figure things out.

However, there seems to be one major constant -- request threads. These are what I dislike the most about the downvoting -- generally I don't care -- how frequently request threads are downvoted because of unpopular opinions. I don't read Tomarry and will never understand the draw of it. But why downvote? All it does is turn people away from the subreddit for fic requests, or possibly alltogether. In fact, I usually upvote request threads unconditionally to counteract this (and I never touch vote buttons, generally speaking) as long as it isn't spam or similar. As an example; a few days ago I had an odd crawing for Dramione and was looking for a specific fic of the kind. After failing to find it, I simply decided to read another Dramione fic instead -- it served my purpose just as well. Asking this subreddit wasn't even a consideration for me, specifically for this reason since it's an order/DE pairing (and because I expected replies to take too long for my temporary curiousity).

You won't, for example, see many Weasley bashing fics with Harry/Ginny (at least without a redemption arc for Ron/Molly). Harry/Daphne is bound to be "political", Harry/Tonks and Harry/Fleur will unfortunately often be very white-knight-y with a very dominant Harry and very submissive love interests. James/Lily will be teenage drama, Lily/Snape will shit on James and so on.

When I say I dislike Dramione, that's because the type of fic I'd be interested in reading with that pairing has not been written yet and I have disliked everything I have read with that ship. I'd love to read a fic where Draco starts to question pureblood ideology after PS with a slow change to rejecting it. Maintaining the Weasley rivalry, Draco gets a tentative friendship with Harry which puts Harry at odds with Ron while Lucius and Snape are still pieces of shit.

** More of a fanfiction thing in general, but here I go: bash fics are okay. Sure, they're not for everyone, usually playing to a very select audience in fact, but there's nothing wrong with saying "I feel like making Ron a piece of shit today". Sometimes you need that sort of thing. You know how some people write a letter or an email that they'll never send? Just venting all the things they'd never be able to actually say? This is the fanfic version of that. Some people do fanart of people being murdered, some people do angry rants on the internet, and some people write fanfics where all the characters they don't like are complete assholes. It's fine.

It's when it comes the hell out of nowhere that I have an issue with. Fic says straight up it's a Dumbledore bash fic? Could be interesting seeing another take on the idea. Fic just turns into that half way through chapter six? I'm out.

Basically I'm of the opinion that people can write, and post, whatever they want, so long as it's all tagged correctly so I know what I'm in for.

** Too many sex scenes ruin a fic IMO

The odd one now and then is fine (if well written and relevant to the plot) but all the time? I want a proper storyline dammit, not soft porn

And what's with making Snape a total sex god ladies man? I love Snape but he's the perfect example of a bitter, rejected, frustrated virgin. The man does not sex and if he does, he pays for it

*** People should be downvoted for throwing in slash fics when OP directly asked for no slash recommendations. If someone doesn't want to read something they shouldn't be forced. For instance I would request (if I ever made a request thread) that there be no "Enemies to Lover" trope present. Cause I dislike those.

The problem is pretty much whenever slash is recommended and slash isn't discouraged in the brief the OP gives they're brigaded with downvoted which makes people feel less welcome in sharing stories they enjoy and others may enjoy as well.

** Keeping your wand on your forearm/up your sleeve/in a wrist holster. It seems to be a /really/ common place to store your wand. Except... They won't fit there. Unless you have /really/ long arms, or a /really/ tiny wand. Has no one ever measured their arm and realized that basic wand length range means wands won't fit there? I mean, you could always say "Because magic!" Or claim some kind of undetectable extension charm on a fancy wand holster, but those are never explicitly mentioned - everyone just keeps their wands on their arms (or in some cases /in/ their arms). Every time someone pulls a wand out of their sleeve, I imagine them having arms like an insect that go down to their knees. And I cheered the last time I watched GoF and realized the champions all kept their wands on a leg holster before diving into the lake (since they couldn't keep in their robes, as per usual).

****** Yes, but my point is that no one ever does this. There are ways that you /could/ store your wand on your arm, but it would require something extra - a fancy wand holster with an extension charm, or a special pocket on your sleeve or something. But no one ever /does/ anything extra. It's just... assumed that wands fit on your arm. People just stuff them up their sleeves all the time; of their robes, muggle jumpers, long sleeve t-shirts, wear long-sleeved dresses so they have room to stick their wand up their sleeve, they hide spare wands there by strapping them on with tape (and I really have read more than one story with a hidden wand /implanted/ in someone's arm). No one ever mentions adding an extension charm to every piece of clothing of they own. And when they do have "wrist holsters," extension charms are never mentioned. It's always either because of some kind of quick release from flicking your wrist, or because it's presumably more secure than just shoving it up your sleeve (because that wouldn't really even work even if they /did/ fit -they'd just fall out. That's why robes have wand pockets.) So yes, of course there are ways you /could/ make it fit there as easy storage space, but no one does, they just assume that wands /already/ fit there. It irrationally bugs an inordinate amount for something that doesn't matter one tiny bit.

** There is so much fanfic touching on, if not expounding on or exaggerating, Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys. Now: I do not condone abuse. I do not condone the Dursleys' canonical actions. But I have not seen one fic that really delves into their bitter perspective which neither villifies them to a sociopathic degree nor turns them into good people all-along. A baby was left on their doorstep, and they had no choice to respond in any way but one. Is there no-one out there - [[/r/childfree][r/childfree]] anyone? - who can sympathize at least a little bit with the idea of "Oh fickletwigs; new baby. New baby suddenly missing his adoring parents. Baby will cry. Sleep schedules ruined. Teething. Medicine. Diapers. Food. Crib. Car seat. Potty training. Babysitters. Bed. Clothes. Developmental toys. Sleep schedules! BABY!" Children are /danged expensive/ to care for and take a lot of attention; even if you don't plan on being emotionally attached to them. Dropping Harry into their lives would have completely screwed with the Dursley's budget, schedules, and long-term plans, and there was nothing they could do about it without potentially calling attention to the mind-rapers and personality-killers and mortal killers of the freaky 'magical' police force and their freaky 'magical' mafia. Some people like their predictable schedules in their mediocre lives. It is a form of comfort. Dumbledore screwed with the lives of people so far removed from the situation, with little to no remorse.

*** Not to mention, that that was how Petunia learned that Lily had been killed.

Also, even worse than the expense and hassle of suddenly needing to double their baby budget, is the fact that Harry was a target for magical assassins. Dumbledore basically voluntold some dude who works at a drill company, a housewife, and a one-year-old boy to act as bodyguards against people who, at any time, could waltz into the house, murder the fuck out of everybody with a flick of a wand, waltz back out, all in the time it takes to call 999 and scream helplessly.

*** The minds of bigots and abusers are the same everywhere. They all justify their actions with, "but we didn't ask for this". They didn't seem to have actually spent anything on him. If they had shown him any kind of care, even the grudging kind, maybe the empathy wouldn't have been so hard to dredge up. But their canon!actions are at least borderline abuse, sometimes crossing over to actual abuse. JKR keeps wanting us to empathize with people who she herself has written as going way beyond the pale of decency. The Dursleys didn't at even a single point seem like they'd even try to meet the needs of the child they were made responsible for, and they were not destitute. They probably stuck it in the cupboard and occasionally opened it to give it food or make sure it didn't die.

It's exactly what you're talking about. The actual writing is not...bad, it's just a bit abbreviated. And they do a really good job of telling the story from the opposite side. It was called Devil's Child, or something like that. Gimme five minutes and I'll edit with the actual info and ffbot stuff.

*** I think it has a lot to do with its most ardent and vocal supporters being very similar (or desperately wanting to be very similar) to the main character, who most people find to be obnoxious, at best.

It seems to be a pretty common theme in fanfic (and also in the real world) for certain people to believe that everyone dislikes them or treats them poorly because they're so much smarter than everyone else, and everyone is jealous of them. Commonly, these people are quite intelligent, and also obnoxious to the point of being difficult to be around.

I've worked with some incredibly smart people over the years (I'm an Automation Engineer with 12ish years of professional experience) and while there have been some socially terrible geniuses, the vast majority of the time, the smartest people I've ever worked with have been awesome people, who have never made a single comment about how smart they are, or that everyone should listen to them, or that they know best because of X, Y, or Z. Guys way, way smarter than me helped me to get better, without having to show off or 'prove' their intelligence. Hopefully I can be as humble as they are.

The idea of people being so smart they become social outcasts works great in fiction for character development, etc. But the uncomfortable truth is they're really just smart people with really poor social skills the majority of the time.

** Early life abuse, trauma, and/or neglect are not things that just go away, or can be overcome through 'strength of character' - they cause serious, measurable damage that will affect someone for their entire life. Brain development is affected. Emotional control suffers. Attachment becomes extremely difficult and fragile. Learning becomes much harder in many cases.

The affects of this are almost never directly realized by the person being affected. They simply act out, misbehave, make poor choices, and quite often sabotage themselves and especially relationships. I.e. they don't understand why they do what they do, although they often realize it is wrong.

Stories where characters just shrug off an entire childhood's worth of abuse and neglect because their circumstances improved are pretty immersion-breaking to me. (I.e. Canon.)

And the periods of 'good times' among all of the normal (bad) times can often do more harm than good. Every time the 'roots' start to grow (a week with a family, or a relationship starting to develop) that is ripped away, teaches the person that nothing good ever lasts anyway, so why bother trying to have those things. Worse still is the lack of control or consistency - it is why many people will sabotage developing healthy relationships/situations. It gives them control, and provides consistency, even if the control is minimal and the 'normal' situation is bad.
