  Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night. “Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!”

As the dust of long decayed bones rose from the grave beneath his feat, Harry twitched his left arm as much as he could, hoping the special wand he had hidden up it could work while he was tied up. He couldn't speak, but the Wand of Nagamar needed no verbal incantations.

Wormtail wasn't even facing the cauldron, and thus couldn't see as the BONE OF THE FATHER transformed into a BENT HOOF FEATHER. Harry recognized the feathers that grew out of the top of Hippogriff hooves, but gave no indication that the ritual wasn't going as planned.

He was still worried when the mad Death Eater raised his knife hand and, with a great deal of hesitation and fear, lopped off his other hand. It was gross, and the man's scream of pain cut through him, but Harry still twitched his arm again, watching the FLESH OF THE SERVANT shift and writhe into A SEVENTH SHELF FORT, the miniature fort on top of stack of seven shelves splashing into the cauldron.

Wormtail still didn't notice, his eyes screwed shut as he moaned in agony. But too soon, they opened again and he stepped toward Harry, silver dagger slashing into his arm. His right arm, thankfully, not the arm with the wand hidden up his sleeve.

Wormtail turned to pick up the bundle of robes laying beside the cauldron as soon as the blood was off his knife, he couldn't see as behind him the BLOOD OF THE ENEMY turned into DOBO, THE MONEY ELF. Harry could only watch in horror as a house elf with a familial resemblance to Dobby, but dressed in an expensive suit, splashed into the cauldron.

The cauldron was wildly glowing and throwing off sparks, Harry couldn't tell if his new wand had done anything useful at all, until suddenly, the liquid inside flashed to steam. He twitched his arm once more, and the CONJURED ROPES binding him turned into a PRO JUDO SCREEN. This wasn't the time to watch television, no matter how amazing those professional martial artists were, instead, Harry prepared himself as a figure climbed out of the steaming cauldron.

The figure that had been TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE and had proclaimed I AM LORD VOLDEMORT was now TV MODEL ORIA M ROLD.

Harry looked back and forth between the attractive (also naked, as Wormtail was still standing there holding and bleeding all over Voldemort's robe) woman standing where his arch-enemy should be and the TV still sitting at the foot of the foot of the grave he had been tied to, which was now showing a commercial with the same woman advertising a fashion line.

"What even is my life anymore?"

He then looked around the OLD GRAVEYARD WEST OF HANGLETON before shaking his head. and pulling the Wand out of his sleeve.

"This might take some doing."

With a wide swish and a sloppy flick that would have horrified Flitwick, Harry transferred himself, the model, the still bleeding-out Wormtail, the dizzy elf in a ruined suit that had just climbed out of the cauldron, and the TV to the HOGWARTS YARD, where the elf HEAVED A LONG TON in front of the crowd.
