We need a fic where every character is the complete opposite to those popular versions of fics that don't make sense but people keep using.

We need a Harry that is literally the less dark and less powerful student in Hogwarts, he wouldn't have an animagus form, much less 20. A non-godness Hermione who can't really figure things out on her own and needs professor aid for everything. We need a Ron who is the best friend in the world and has world class table manners, with a wide emotional range. We need a Snape who is not supportive but a world class jerk, ugly, doesn't clean his cauldron shirtless, nor goes about bemusing young witches with his deep tone of voice. We need a Dumbledore who doesn't have a single idea of anything going in his school or Ministry and who is easily manipulable by everyone. Draco would be a bloody coward without a golden heart hidden, he has acne, no rebel attitude and is scared of everything. Also Luna has no magic way of knowing everything and Daphne just goes around laughing all the time. The twins would of course be talking normally without the need of someone completing their phrases. Goblins are the opposite of kind. Ginny doesn't know what a love potion is. Etc...


** "Professor McGonagall! Malfoy has challenged me to a duel at midnight in the Forbidden Forest! What do I do? I don't know how to fight!" asked a desperate Harry.

McGonagall looked at him for a second, before letting out a snort. "Ay yee blody pussy jus go an' kick his ferret arse ya wanker!"

Dejected, Harry turned to Dumbledore - he was his last hope! "Professor Dumbledore, what should I do?"

"My boy, I am sorry but I can't help you right now. Professor Quirrell just told me there was a massive sale at Diagon Ally - Florean Fortescue bought by mistake several tons of lemon drops, and he wants me to take them off his hands. Toodles!"

With these words, Dumbledore summoned a broom and skipped happily outside the castle. Suddenly, like the greasy bat his heart knows he is, Snape appeared behind Harry.

"Planning a fight, are we, Potter? A thousand points from you and detention for the next three monthes."

Of course, that didn't sit well with McGonagall, who started to throw insults at Snape. It's how Harry decided he'd have to go to the fight - his teachers were all incompetent fools, and that was worrying.

-----------------

"The nargles are strong within you."

"Luna, is that you ? What are you doing here ?"

Luna didn't answer, and simply let herself fall into the lake. After several long, painfull seconds, she emerged, with a fish in her hands. She looked at it for a second, pouted, and let it back in the water, with a soft "still no crumple horned snorkacks ..."

Harry just stared at her, confused - before remembering his duel.

-----------------

"Harry, mate, there you are! I thought you skipped out of the duel. Would have been a real shame, that. Let's pummel Malfoy to the ground!"

Harry, surprised, turned around. "Ron? Didn't I leave you in the common room?"

"Bah, mate, as if I would let you do this alone! We both know Malfoy, he's going to cheat and leave you dead in the Forbidden Forest!" At these words, Ron started laughing, and continued following the path. He was afraid, of course - but right now, Harry needed confidence, and Ron would provide him that.

Harry just smiled, and followed him.

------------------

It was a disgruntled Ron and a tired Harry that appeared in the common room well after midnight.

Hermione had fallen asleep in the common room. She had written something so that when they came back, Harry and Ron knew what she tried to do - but like always, whatever she wrote was impossible to read. She really needed to work on her calligraphy.

"Well, there is one positive thing about it all", said Harry, after a big yawn.

"What is it, mate?"

"The memory of Malfoy running towards the castle, screeming like a banshee, because we appeared behind him and his two goons - it's never gonna leave us."

The two best pals laughed at that, then woke up Hermione so that she could go and sleep in her own dormitory.

** Not that Ron isn't the most considerate of all of humanity, but he's got more emotional understanding than both Harry and Hermione. But I do disagree with your accusation that he's a bad friend. He faced his phobia and lethal danger to stand by Harry's side more than once. If there's anyone I want as a d√∏friend from the Harry Potter world, it's him.

*** I agree with you. I didn't say opposite of canon Ron, but Fanon Ron.

*** I really don't get why fanfics portrays Ron and by extension the Weasley as these money grabbing, love potion dosing scoundrels.

*** Yeah, totally- canon Ron is awesome. OP was talking about fanon Ron, though, who is usually portrayed as a piece of shit.
