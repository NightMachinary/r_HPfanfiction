When a line of dialogue is followed by a speech tag, you end it with a comma, a question mark, or an exclamation mark. For example, this line from the very first page of Chamber of Secrets:

#+begin_quote
  "She's bored," he said.
#+end_quote

As you can see, the dialogue is followed by the speech tag "he said" and thus ends with a comma.

It's not

#+begin_quote
  "She's bored." he said.
#+end_quote

It's not

#+begin_quote
  "She's bored" he said.
#+end_quote

It's definitely not

#+begin_quote
  "She's bored.", he said.
#+end_quote

Yet so many fanfiction writers get this wrong.


** It's because it's one of those things we don't notice unless we pay attention when reading.

So when writing, we don't even notice we did that. Most fanfiction writer have little to no formal training in writing, some(like me) are not native speakers.

Some also read a lot of fanfiction and/or other texts that are incorrect and so they don't experience the correcting and learning effect that reading a correct, properly edited text normally has on writing.

I was also told the second option was the correct one, but thanks for clarifying it's not(now for another round of editing).

And grammar can be hard to remember, honestly, I speak and write English with enough fluency to hold lengthy and sometimes technical conversations and I still don't properly know/understand what the damn Oxford comma is or how to correctly use.

*** I don't know if you actually cared, but the Oxford comma is a type of series comma that goes before the final item in the list. For example, if you were to write /"the dogs, the cats, and the birds"/, the Oxford comma is the comma after the word "cats". The Oxford comma is completely optional and your sentence is grammatically correct whether it is included or not. It can make sentences more confusing if not used in some cases, so I tend to always use it, but it is not strictly necessary in in any case.

**** My favourite example sentence for how to use the Oxford comma is this:

/We invited the strippers, JFK, and Stalin./

/We invited the strippers, JFK and Stalin./

Sentence one implies that you invited three lots of people to your event. One, some strippers. Two, President Kennedy. Three, Comrade Stalin.

Sentence two implies that you invited some strippers who happened to /be/ President Kennedy and Comrade Stalin.

There's an illustrated version of this example out there somewhere and it never fails to make me laugh.

***** Couldn't the second one be construed as, say, a note from JFK and Stalin telling someone that they invited strippers?

****** On its own, yes. And that's also an amusing interpretation.

In context of either a wider paragraph or part of this example? No, because words meaning is informed by the other words around them too, if that makes sense.

**** Don't forget you only use it if the list has 3 or more items. Not when there are only two.

** People probably just don't write fiction much in school, so when they have grammar class or whatever, dialogue isn't a main point of interest.

** Because even native speakers don't always learn all the rules, and grammar and punctuation are difficult things to learn and internalise, especially for something that most don't really notice the majority of the time.

** I'd also point out that punctuation rules in dialogue differ depending on language. I'd rather have good grammar and funky punctuation than the other way around.

One of the downsides of not being a native i guess.

** What value does the comma bring?

"She's bored" he said.

Seems absolutely fine to me even if it's not taught like that in school. Why should having ," mean more than just "
