Turns out Voldemort has his own tricks up his sleeve and curses them so that "if they like to act like animals, they should only be free in their animal form":

James ends up imprisoned in his own home.

Sirius ends up imprisoned in Azkaban and later on in his own home, experiencing freedom only as a dog.

Pettigrew, while a pet of the Weasleys, he is usually neglected so he still gets his own form of freedom. When forced to remain a human he becomes imprisoned as Voldemort's slave and later on Snape's and Bellatrix's bitch.

Lupin who is a werewolf and therefore cannot turn at will into an animal was not part of the attack so he is spared.


** It's a cool thought be he would just kill them. Like animagus forms don't magically just make wild animals dangerous to wizards
