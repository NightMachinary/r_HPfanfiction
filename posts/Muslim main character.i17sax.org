I'll even take an important side one. I just want to see Muslims in the Harry Potter universe.


** Well technically isn't magic/witchcraft forbidden in Islam? So if a Muslim becomes a witch/wizard either they are sinning or they no longer believe in the religion...

*** It's forbidden in Christianity too, doesn't stop wizards from celebrating Christmas.

Not like JKR really involved much real-world religion beyond that anyway, but I've seen plenty of fics rationalize it away by claiming Jesus was actually a wizard, etc.

**** Christmas as a cultural holiday is different from Christmas as a religious holiday. I mean, fuck, the bible straight up says don't cut down trees and bring them into your home and decorate them, because that's a pagan tradition and you're better than that.

In any case, there's no actual Christians in the HP series as far as we can tell, and the bible also said to execute witches, so having a super Christian wizard character wouldn't make sense.

***** We do have the Fat Friar, ghost of Hufflepuff, as one concrete example of Christian wizards. I also can't imagine that every muggle born/raised gives up religion upon coming to Hogwarts.

****** According to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Fat_Friar][this wiki]], which has most of the sources for his backstory listed as non-book sources (eg Pottermore and JKR interviews), he devoted his life to a religious organization, helped a lot of people by curing pox with magic (as well as performed magic tricks at the church he worked for), and was executed for using magic. There's a few things I take issue with.

One, these are arguably non-canon sources, depending on where you draw the line between Word of God and Death of the Author. Personally I only take the books as canon and consider sources such as Pottermore to be little more than JKR's personal headcanon. It can be interesting and sometimes give insight or extra context to what she had in mind when writing the series, but can also be random bullshit. However, since we don't really have any other info on his past, and it lines up with his title of Friar in canon, I'll accept it as canon for the sake of argument.

Two, while it does say he "devoted his life to religion," it doesn't explicitly state that he was very religious himself. It might on the source page, but honestly I can't be bothered to actually check. So, there's a possibility he was only using the church as a way to help people and wasn't particularly religious himself. But, let's say that he was religious. I'll concede and say that he is one example in the entire series of a religious wizard.

Third, this one example of a religious wizard has been dead for almost a thousand years. He was also killed by the very institution he gave his life to. We also know that the witch burnings happened, and that, historically, it was Christians who lead the charge against witches. While it was mostly Muggles who were the victims of this, since witches and wizards could use magic to escape, the mere fact that the Friar died to his fellow clergymen shows that some wizards and witches did die due to religious persecution. In addition, we don't actually know whether or not the Friar is still religious. While ghosts are described as being "imprints" of the soul of a dead witch or wizard, and they do not know what the afterlife is like, it's hard to say whether the souls of said ghosts have moved on and the imprint is something like a portrait, not truly conscious but a piece of essentially magical AI based on the originally alive magical person, or if the soul itself is bound to the mortal plane and the ghost is a projection of it. In either case, it's doubtful that the Friar would lose his faith over being a ghost, since his ghost doesn't know if there's a Heaven, Hell, or a god waiting on the other side for him. However, being murdered by his fellow Christians very well could have shattered his faith.

Finally, consider the fact that wizards know humans have souls. They can prove this, it's a fact. The afterlife exists and they know this. Yet, in the entire series, only one long-dead wizard is shown to have been religious when he was alive. Despite all of the evidence no wizard seems to be concerned about where their soul will be sent when they die. They don't even seem to have any kind of strong form of spirituality. This points to a society that, despite the clear proof of a soul and afterlife, does not believe in a god. Or, if they do, it's a deistic god at most, as they aren't concerned with judgement when they die.

**** There's literally no mention of any gods in the series. The closest you'll get is someone saying "oh my god/lord" and them celebrating Christmas, both of which are completely cultural and aren't necessarily religious.

**** Well true but if you are doing magic, religion wouldn't be your primary concern. That's probably why religious aspect is not integrated into the canon. It would be interesting to see students struggling morally though in a good written fanfic.

*** Not really, like sure there are forbidden aspects, but its mostly about fortune telling and influencing, deceiving and drugging people which is forbidden(though even that is debatable). Overall there are a lot of muslims who believe and practice various forms of mysticism. Like I could easily see a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism][Sufi]] just accepting Harry Potter magic. The only thing most muslims would have a problem with, is consorting with evil spirits, which isn't really a problem in Harry Potter.

** Midha is just very secondary person (room-mate of the main heroine) in [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491][Dursley's Daughter (A Harry Potter Next Generation Fan Fic) by writerer]], but I like the story, so why not to recommend it?

** I will probably get a lot of hate for this but Islam and Harry Potter series do not mix well. This is not limited to islam but all abrahamic religions. Wizards seem to celebrate christmas and Potters are buried in a church cemetry so one can say they are christians and my point is wrong. However Christianity is only as abrahamic as Budhism is a Hindu sect.

Religions such as Ä°slam and Judaism are not simply belief systems but promote a certain cultural contunium above all others and are often chauvanistic in this regard. Christianity does not consider Magic a sin except for a single line in the Bible. Islam however has an entire chapter in the Quran describing the evils of Magic and how oracles in Mecca opposed Muhammad and how Musaylima, a magician, falsely declared himself to be a Prophet. There is no mention of punishment in the Bible concerning those who practice Witchcraft while there are hundreds of Hadiths describing the forms of capital punishments that should be issued on witchcraft users in detail. I should know since i live in a muslim majority country.
