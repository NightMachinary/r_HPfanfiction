I don't know if self insert is the correct term to use but what I want is when a character goes into the potter world with knowledge of the books. These stories usually bash Ron which I don't want.

It would be better if Ron is actually involved but it isn't necessary.


** My story, [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/magic-and-mayhem-a-harry-potter-story-about-tom-riddles-diary-eating-an-si-of-sorts.368704/][Magic and Mayhem]] features an SI that got eaten by Tom Riddle's diary and so thinks of himself as Tom, but has my memories of the books (though not always the context) and various other things like muggle chemistry. (And Tom Marvolo Riddle's knowledge and skill at magic, albeit as of age 16.)

Ron is there, and while Tom's opinions on Ron seesaw a bit with his mood, I don't think there's any bashing. At least, I hope it's fairly obvious that Tom is just biased rather the story bashing Ron whenever there's a... negative point made about Ron (such as Ron being loud while Tom is hungover)

** If he's not bashed in self inserts, he's usually just not in the story. Here are two good ones off the top of my head. For some reason, they're both posted on a forum.

** Um. Well, my own contribution does feature bashing, but it's also super obvious that the bashing isn't coming from any meaningful place and is just childish pouting.

Also techically not 100% SI but...

"Ron dove in front of the crowd of first years, barely managing to block the wide area bone explosion curse with a hastily erected shield charm. Sol scoffed in derision. Wasn't that just like Ron, always trying to steal the spotlight, the greedy tosser."

On second thought, learn the ways of the Force, including the Dark Side, because that means Force Lightning and then you can just Force Lightning Voldemort and all his cronies.

*************** Panda's have very liberal ideas about the drinking age. Plus, in a lot of cultures and in a lot of past times, drinking weak alcohol was the main thing everyone drank as it kept the water safe. That, and by the time she starts making her own drink she'll be at least 16.

****** But the thing is he felt remorse eventually. I find it an important part of the books that even Voldemort's soul can be saved by remorse.

I suppose the question is do You think remorse is a factor to take in account when we judge someone. If we are not seeing everything then is there any room for true judgment?

I recommend watching Death Parade which deals with this question and then form your own answer.

******* I wasn't arguing that Snape should be executed, I was stating why Ron was not only a better person and friend to Harry but also not a murdering asshole and hence not a suitable target for bashing like Snape is.

Plus, we can judge Snape plenty short of saying he should face a firing squad.

******** Oh, that makes sense. Sure, Snape is a suitable target for bashing for certain reasons.

But in my experience, most fanfiction writers bash him for ridiculous reasons. For example, in one he is bashed, bullied and fired for his appearance and demeanor (before he has done anything but ask some questions). In another, he is turned into a full blown death eater with no remorse while it contributes nothing to the plot and is only there to bash him.
