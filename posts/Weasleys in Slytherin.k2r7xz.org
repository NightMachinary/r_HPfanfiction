The two youngest Weasley siblings, Evelyn and Bennett, are twins. They start Hogwarts in the trio's fifth or sixth year (haven't decided), and are best friends with Roan Lovegood and Jasper Diggory. They are closest to each other, Percy, Bill, and Charlie. They are not that close with the older set of twins, Ron, and Ginny. How do you think the other Weasleys would react to Ben and Evie being in Slytherin?


** "They are not that close with the older set of twins, Ron, and Ginny."

Why not ?

"Roan Lovegood and Jasper Diggory. "

How are these people related to Luna and Cedric ?

*** They have never gotten along well with them.

They are younger brothers to Luna and Cedric.

***** For years, Ron and Ginny were the youngest boy and girl and got all the attention, but when Evie and Ben came along the new kids got all the attention. So Ron and Ginny resented them for that.

For years, Fred and George were the only twins, but Evie and Ben ruined that when they came along. So Fred and George resented them for that.

Fred and George also don't get along with Ben because he's "too much like Percy". Evie could get along with them but doesn't because they pick on Ben with their pranks.

******* I don't think that's bashing. Siblings get very jealous of each other for silly things. My older sister didn't like me for a very long time because I stole her spot as the youngest, for example.
