There are stories about Fae or other creatures stealing kids and dropping something other than them behind, the changelings. This is mostly true, however they are only interested in magical kids. Wizard know how to protect themselves and Ministry does keep an eye on the muggleborns (or it doesn't, as it would give a nice second version of this prompt). But Harry doesn't get either of the protections and the fairy folk steals him from the Dursleys. Maybe Petunia does actually know it and she is right that kid living in her home isn't her nephew but a freak.

In any case, this prompt can be used in many ways, enjoy.

  Are you a witch or

  Are you a fairy?

  Or are you the wife

  of Michael Cleary?     “The fairies will do wicked things sometimes,” Harry murmured gently, “Steal the milk when they get a chance, or skim the cream off the milk crocks.”“Do they ever steal anything more?” Luna asked him rhetorically.Harry couldn't answer.

** There was that story - I don't remember its name - where Harry was the WBWL who kept asking animals and plants their names and they always refused to give it to him.

Edit: nvm... [[/u/WhistlingBanshee]] already suggested it.

  Harry Potter was not normal.Pretty, sweet, polite, and kind maybe... but never normal.Oh, she knew this all too well- had ever since she was set down carefully in the wooden cradle as the elder Potters were distracted, the other small crying baby she was meant to look like being carried off by a man with pointed ears.ORThe one in which Trelawney is a hack and there was a BETTER prophesy given to people who could actually make a friggin' difference (and who actually cared)
