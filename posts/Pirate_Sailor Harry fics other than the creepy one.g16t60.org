So, I'm looking for fics where Harry (though I'd accept other characters too) is a pirate or otherwise involved strongly with a ship/boat of some sort a la Sea King. Or at least, any of those fics that isn't the creepy one where Hermione's parents teach him and her the ins and outs of a bondage partnership. I'm all for young people feeling like they can talk to their parents about sex, but it really was too much. (It's called Rocking the Boat, btw, for anyone who might actually want to read it).

Sea King - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King]]

The Creepy One - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5721324/1/Rocking-the-Boat]]


** In linkffn(The Second String) Harry sails with pirates for a few chapters. Isn't really the main plot point or anything but it just came to my head when I read the post. I'm pretty sure he ends up accidentally hiring a prostitute but it was funny and doesn't strike as creepy.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** Can't recall the name or author, but this made me think of a somewhat silly fic where the trio sign up for a summer program where the students become the crew of a salvage vessel headed by Sinestra for the summer. Harry sees it as a way to avoid having to go to the dursleys for the summer. And Harry and Dobby wind up getting into numerous bar fights at a pirate port. Including, I want to say, a ship full of goblins.

Also includes harry and ron getting shitfaced drunk repeatedly and going on legendary rampages at night while in port. While naked. With few figuring out who they actually are.

** Sea King is awesome. I used to spend summers during college hitchhiking up to Alaska to work as a deckhand on 30' boats commercial fishing, and the notion of seeing HP doing such grueling work in such high risk circumstances would definitely change his perspective and see Voldemort as the piss ant he is.

** Absofriggenlutely! My very first day on the water a storm started just before we got to our destination, and I had to learn the ropes in twenty foot waves, on a thirty foot boat with no safety rail while wearing heavy duty Dutch Harbor rain gear and galoshes, but(get this) NO life jacket! When I asked the skipper why, he said that a life jacket would get caught on the net as I was feeding it out which would drag me in the water, and besides, I shouldn't worry about it as the cold would kill a man in minutes which would be sooner than he'd be able to work around the net to get to me😂 When death is on the line, you learn pretty darn fast how to keep the ankles loose and the body fluid to move with the motion of the deck and water, twenty foot swells or no! It was the hardest, scariest work I had ever done to that point, and I miss it every day. You would believe how amazing a sight it is when a big jag of salmon hits the 900' feet of net. Sigh! I used to be such a BAMF,now I am a stay at home dad raising four children while my wife brings home way more bacon than I ever could. Midlife crisis: Activate.

Honestly, the raising four children thing sounds far harder and scarier to me. Chaotic little monsters and their ability to make everything into a giant mess. I'm only an older sibling and that's a nightmare, I'm pretty sure raising four kids qualifies you for a medal. Or sainthood. And eventually an asylum. Either way, totes badass. :)

  Entirely Magical AU. In a world with no muggles, supreme, ancient magical beings -- the Archmagi - rule over the mortal realm, locked in an eternal struggle for power and glory... which was all background noise for ickle Harry, until he decided that he'd abandon his uncomfortable life as a common street urchin for a slightly less uncomfortable life on board a merchant vessel. It was supposed to be a few Sickles for a few days of mundane work, but circumstances spiral out of control, and Harry finds himself struggling to choose between mere survival and potential infamy, while demi-gods do battle around him.

**** The vibe is sort of a mash up of different fantasy/magical animes, it almost feels like it could be a video game. From memory there's only 1 scene so far since there was quite a bit of world building set up. It's definitely headed towards the harem direction though which is unfortunate because the smut is where it gets cracky and it's the weakest part of his writing.

** Just to let you know, rocking the boat isn't the only fic of that kind

I'm interested in the ship thing, I think I remember an SG-1 xover where they turned an old aircraft carrier into a space ship because the earth was becoming un inhabitable

I searched for fics with old warfleets used in magical warfare but the only fic I found was one where Hogwarts was attacked by voldemort using Durmstrangs war fleet (newly built, described as looking like viking long ships) in addition to the canon forces and some other powerful dark lords and ladies, Hogwarts had 5 of the most powerful light side wizards and witches defending and three seers. It was a great fic but the only one with an actual war fleet of old wood ships

******* Your sentence confused me for a second there, it took me a moment to realise you were referring to Rocking the Boat. Yeah, they're not overly smutty - it's more the fact that the parents are two steps from being "Well, if you strike downwards with the riding crop, you'll get the most pleasure and satisfaction out of it" and that's a bit weird that made me not a big fan of it. The boat bits are fun, the relationship bits are just odd.

************* Apologies for the delay, I wanted to check my bookmarks and see what was appropriate (I'm reorganising them rn, so I can download them with fanficfare and add them as ebooks to my Ipad).

Well first, I'd like to start with the Fanfiction Recommender site.

[[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/]]

It takes every rec given on this sub by the bot and ranks them in different ways. And I've got a decent selection of fics, but mostly they're just copied-pasted from my bookmarks and they're nearly all things I've recc'ed on this sub before in the last couple of months, so you probably have seen or know most of them.

************** Oh, wow that has officially beat my ”most fics recommended in one comment” #1 so congrats on that I guess

The wait was no problem honestly, I was reading a good fic so a ton of fics back then would have been a problem, but now, I've finished it so. :)

Also I'm shifting my fanfic collection onto a discord server for my friends and so that it can be added to easily, so you're not the only one who's moving stuff

Never even heard of that site, will start using it now :)

I'm not really into crossovers, but I will check the MoD fics you rec'd, I've read like all of the SG-1 xovers, 1 battlestar galactica xover but that was also SG-1, and then HP, squatter which is my favourite updating fic and #3 on my favourites soo.

I'm actually just getting into DnD so, I might check those out.

Future's past is actually the only fem!harry fic I've been able to read besides linkffn(the historical importance of runic war warding in the british isles)

Thanks for adorable violence, will read

No horror thanks, might check them out when I'm not scared by my own shadow anymore.

I'm almost offended you didn't link linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power) in Harry/OC but also am not because I've seen it recommended a total of 8 times and six of those are mine and one is the one that recommended it to me so... (now 9 and 7)

I loved the archaelogist fic series, so I might just read some others, also then there is linkffn(strength of steel wings) which got too repetitive for me and boring so I quit it, but you might like it

Haven't read any Honks recently, might check those out

My top 3 fanfics which I can't seem to arrange so they're all basically equal but squatter is #3:

1: Linkffn(severus snape and the art of war)

2: linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power)

3:linkffn(harry potter, squatter)

What kinds of fics do you like? I might have some, but I doubt it

Thanks a lot, it must have taken a while to link all of those

  Thanks a lot, it must have taken a while to link all of those
#+end_quote

Actually, it took less than five minutes. Most of the time was trying to remember what might be appropriate or good. Everything was already sorted(ish) and all I had to do was copy-paste the bookmark links directly from my folders in my browser.

#+begin_quote
  Never even heard of that site, will start using it now
#+end_quote

It's pretty useful, albeit limited. I've found a few new, good things on there. Well, old things to the fandom, but new to me. :)

#+begin_quote
  No horror thanks
#+end_quote

Fair enough. It's definitely an acquired taste. If you change your mind though, all of those are exquisitely good. :D

#+begin_quote
  I'm not really into crossovers, but I will check the MoD fics
#+end_quote

Also fair enough. I'd recommend Harry Brown regardless though. The 'crossover' fandom is undetailed enough that it's basically an AU Harry Potter story where he's raised by a weird Irish family. The other two in Firefly and Star Wars are a lot bigger though, since he's in those other worlds.

#+begin_quote
  Future's past is actually the only fem!harry fic I've been able to read
#+end_quote

In that case, I'd like to strongly recommend A Long Journey Home and add in 'Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise'. The first's Jasmine Potter is very like the one in Future's Past and the latter has some similar vibes/tones to her.

Iris Potter - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12568760/1/Iris-Potter-and-the-Goblet-s-Surprise]]

#+begin_quote
  I'm almost offended you didn't link... Harry Potter and the Elementals Power
#+end_quote

Well, that's quite simply because I haven't read it yet to be able to rec it. I'll add it to the list, though. :D

The only one of the ones you've recc'ed I've read was Harry Potter, Squatter - it being on the list I sent you and all. Thanks for those recs, :D

#+begin_quote
  What kinds of fics do you like?
#+end_quote

I like pretty much anything except for smut and most anime crossovers (though that's more because I'm not a fan of anime and thus have no knowledge of the thing it's crossing over with, but I enjoyed the Disgaea one [which is in the recs list I sent you] since it explained most of what I needed to know). And the smut is because sex scenes are really, really boring. I find football more entertaining and I fell asleep at the one Man-U vs Liverpool match I actually went to.

I'm of the opinion that there are no bad tropes (or even bad cliches!), just ones that could be handled better, so I have no trope tastes/filters there. Generally, I just like to be prewarned about things like characters being OOC (eg. Snape being Nice or Hermione/Ron being antagonists, etc) or relationships/plot lacking longer or slower developments so I can set my expectations, but other than that I'll read pretty much anything that grabs my interest.

**************** Ok straight off, warnings for the recs i put earlier, SS and the art of war is a Snily fic, extremely well written though

Elemental's power is kind of an OP! Harry fic, a slow burn (has a few smut scenes, but can be skipped) it's written amazingly well, even if it does have a bit too much cliche in some parts (to my taste atleast)

Historical importance of runic war warding can be shortened down to 'what if the connection was deeper and it took ”harry” into voldy's mind and then he noticed it'

With strenght of steel wings is harry being abandoned, and found by a criminal organisation trying to find out as much as possible about diagon alley and wizards&witches in general.

Now, I'm of the mind that looking for the fic is a part of reccing it so, don't try to downplay looking for several fics that someone might like..

Now how do you do that taking a part of the others comment thing to point out what they're replying to? It seems reeeally useful to make points and help people in these long reply chains.

thanks for those new fem!harry fics that are actually good, will read

Ok new fic links,

Linkffn(the guardians of power) Severitus, just a warning

Linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches) i think you've read this one or atleast heard of it, this sub was going crazy about the goodness of this a while back. Time travel, wbwl, OP!harry

Linkffn(harry potter, master of malicious compliance) this is just an amazing crack fic, please read it it's bloody amazing

Linkffn(escapologist harry) Keeping with the crack fics, manipulative dumbledore. Absolutely hilarious, and btw, it actually seems to have a plot so.. crack w/plot

Linkffn(king of magic) This, this.. this abomination is made off of the tutorial on how to make the most overdone fanfiction ever, it's on this sub's top posts, this will put to the test how good you are at not caring about tropes, first chapter is literally a list of all the things harry has, and taking all the lordships. Harem, manipulative dumbles, lord HJ too-many-to-list-without-having-a-deadly-heart-attack and more, basically this is a mashup of /all/ the tropes, some missing maybe.

Again, I apologise for that last one.

Linkffn(parsel) this, might possibly make you cry, or laugh, I don't know what it was but it'll make you feel everything between love and hate, animagus!harry

Linkffn(antithesis) I don't actually remember this one but I know it's good because I've marked it as ”should read again”

Linkffn(courage and cunning) amazing fic, you'll find out the main surprising thing straight off. Great fic, don't know how I forgot this

Linkffn(three to backstep) M/F/F pairing, time travel. Great fic idea but a bit underwhelming.

Linkffn(again and again) if you've read a lot of slash you'll know this one, you might know it either way, but still a good tomarry fic, actually introduced me to the pairing.

Linkffn(griffon reborn) this is actually one of the only fics that has a lot of exploration into wandlore and I absolutely love it.

Linkffn(3 slytherin marauders) somehow a good fic, severitus, also I haven't read it completely yet so I don't know all the things about it yet

Linkffn(faery heroes) Lunar Harmony time travel, great fic too.

Linkffn(the dragon of camelot) haven't read it yet but it came highly recommended soo.

Linkffn(why to sort a student is a horrible job) amazing cracky prank fic idk

Linkffn(harry potter and the lack of lamb sauce) what if instead of Slughorn, Gordon Ramsay comes to teach potions in Hogwarts amazingness in a fic

Linkffn(dark phoenix) cant remember the fic but it's marked as good so, why not

Linkffn(lily's changes) great fic, can't actually remember but marked as great

Linkffn(founding of happiness) great time travel fic, founders and animagus!harry

Linkffn(myrddin emrys returns) OP!harry fic, great read

Linkffn(breath of the inferno) fun short read.

Linkffn(harry potter and the game) holy shite I don't know how I forgot this, Harry becomes a gamer as in he's the MC of the game

Linkffn(core threads) just a god/op! Harry MoD fic, the only one I read that was decent thus far

You might guess that I was trying to find rarer fics, and you would be mostly correct, if I found a good one I'd link it but I was trying for those unseeb fics, mostly so that you'd find some you haven't heard of and will like

I'm still sorry for king of magic but I must test your limit (I got two and a half chapters in before the cringe fest became too much, but I could have just champed it through)

#+end_quote

I'll start with the easy-to-answer one. When you're writing a reply, there should be a little box underneath saying 'formatting help'. If you click on that, a table will appear with all the different things you can do - italics, bold, links, bulletpoints, and the 'quotation' thing, which you do with a guillemot from your fullstops (I don't wanna put the actual key, because I'm pretty sure it'll actually do the quotation thing midway through the paragraph if I do). Then you either select the part you want to quote before hitting reply, which quotes it automatically on PC, or you just copy-paste your quoted text after the guillemot.

Again, I've only read a couple of those - Faery Heroes is a personal favourite, for instance, and I've enjoyed Escapologist and Parsel - so good job on finding the 'unseen fics'. :D Thanks for the recs!

#+begin_quote
  i think you've read this one or atleast heard of it
#+end_quote

Indeed I have. It's the fic that keeps the 'is weird paedophilic grooming bad enough to outweigh good worldbuilding when reading a fic' argument going still. I like the worldbuilding, but I have no idea if I actually like the fic still. :D

#+begin_quote
  this will put to the test how good you are at not caring about tropes
#+end_quote

Definitely sounds more like a cliche-fic than a trope-fic, but it does sound fun. From the introduction, it's something I'll probably enjoy at least for awhile. I'll see if I can beat your two-and-a-half chapters. :D

#+begin_quote
  etc.
#+end_quote

Oh, and I forgot to add one to the Harry-Bellatrix time travel one (though it's not an actual confirmed relationship, just hints) - To Bow With Pride. It's one of the more interesting takes on Time-travelling Harry meets the OG Black Family. And definitely access the offshoots through the author's fanfic profile afterward too. The Narcissa matchmaking one is delightful. :D

****************** Ok, now to thank you enough times..

Thanks for the new fic link

Thanks for telling me the quotation thing And Thanks for accepting my view of searching fics

Am happy to know I succeeded in finding rarer fics, I think I have like five more but they would all be smut mountains so you wouldn't like them much

I've learned to ignore weird pairings so again and again just has good world building, which I like ----> I like the fic

You probably can beat my two and a half chapters, heck I could read the whole fic but I'd have to bleach my eyes after that so not gonna try..

I need to find out the difference between a cliche and a trope, if I keep making mistakes on that it's going to be even more awkward when I find out I've been using them as opposites or something the whole time...

Now for some new links

Linkffn(moebius past) rare, semi well-written Harry is Salazar fic

Linkffn(magical chronicles) the fic I wish would update in quarantine, it's abandoned, not in a bad spot though, the plot hasn't really begun..

Linkffn(harry potter and godric's legacy) Gryffindor's wand is op, Hinny.

Linkffn(on the way to greatness) I think this is a Slytherin or Ravenclaw Harry fic, can't remember, is rare (i think)

Linkffn(the phoenix burns brightest) i really hope you can ignore the pairing later..

Linkffn(more than familiar) a weird Hedwig animagus fic. Still good though

Linkffn(Luna's hubby) if this isn't the greatest Huna fic then nothing is, Luna is being Luna and Harry is confused.

Linkffn(broken wings) I'm pretty sure this is a severitus fic, haven't read it yet though

That's it for now, stay safe

******************* Apologies for the delay in response: life is a bitch who doesn't like me doing things. :D Bandwidth choking and a hectic schedule has made getting online to respond to things difficult (23 messages, when I started responding to them today - yay, freetime.).

Thank you for the fics. Another good collection where I've only read a couple of them. :)

  I need to find out the difference between a cliche and a trope
#+end_quote

It's pretty simple, once you learn it - though most people in this fandom don't use it properly and use trope when they mean cliche and never talk about tropes themselves at all, so it's not really useful to know around here. :)

A trope is like a recurring narrative archetype - a building block for a plot, or a thing in a story that you see that you're familiar with. Like if you see a 'Jock' character, you have a very broad idea of who that person might be and that makes getting to know them easier because you can essentially put them in a little box in your head before any character backstory exposition or action ever happens. Or when a hero gets captured and brought in front of the main villain, you know he's probably going to monologue his plans then order an execution in which the hero will escape, so that builds suspense of 'when are they going to do the clever plan to get out of there?'. Or knowing that a murder mystery will always end in the detective grouping up all the suspects, talking about the clues, then pointing and yelling at the culprit before they get caught/arrested. It's just a familiar pattern in wider fiction, basically.

Every single story has them, because they provide a foundation that you can relate to, so you can empathise with the stuff you can't. And you can have them implemented or come about in very different ways. For example, 'Boy leaves the farm' is a common narrative trope in which a naive, unworldly young kid leaves their isolated home to go to a big new place and have adventures. Harry Potter does this when Harry leaves the Dursleys to go to the magical world, Star Wars does it when Luke leaves Tatooine to go find the Rebels, Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit both do it when a Baggins leaves Bag End to go see the world. Same trope, but three very different ways of doing it. And they each allow us to build up empathy for the characters so we can stay invested and empathetic when The Fellowship are fighting trolls or Luke is dodging Space Slugs or Harry is casting magic.

A cliche, on the other hand, is literally just a trope that's been seen a lot that we've gotten tired of. In the HP world, 'Helpful Goblins' and 'Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-I-Write-Sins-Not-Tragedies-Emrys-etc-etc the III' are big cliches because a lot of stories have done them in the same way. Saying something is a cliche is basically saying it's a tired, boring, overdone trope. When most people complain about tropes, they really mean to complain about cliches.
