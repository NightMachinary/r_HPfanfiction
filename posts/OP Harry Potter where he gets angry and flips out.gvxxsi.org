I once read a story, can't remember what it's called, where Harry was powerful and independent, and he was a made a prefect. He finds out about Ravenclaws bullying Luna, and walks into the Great Hall and goes on a rant about it, then he walks out and says, “ONE THOUSAND FUCKING POINTS FROM RAVENCLAW!” At the end of the year Ravenclaw is still in negative points for the House Cup. Are there any other fanfics where this happens, or something like it? Nothing is more satisfying than Harry Potter blowing shit up and yelling at everyone.


** linkffn(the merging by shaydrall) i think

and as far as the second part of your post, this happens in pretty much every indy!harry story, though with wildly ranging levels of quality

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
