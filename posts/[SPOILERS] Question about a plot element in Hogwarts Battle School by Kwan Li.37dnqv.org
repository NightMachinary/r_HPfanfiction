** It's been established that certain wizards/witches are more powerful than others. While there has been ancillary evidence when they duel, it is most evident in Chapter 31 when Flamel has them repeatedly levitate a chair. Harry is able to go on far longer than the others. Seeing as how they should all have a very capable handle of the Levitation Charm, it's not a matter of concentration or familiarity with the spell. Harry is just more powerful.

Hermione, being Hermione, is obviously unsatisfied that her mental prowess doesn't exactly translate to having more magical power. Her frustration is further compounded when Harry creates his own spell and demonstrates a greater fluency with wandless magic, despite the fact that he does not put nearly as much research into spells or general magicka as her.

So, Hermione takes a shortcut, ignoring Luna's qualms about magical symbols in Chapter 33 and Flamel's warning about dark magic in Chapter 35. The exact nature of the spell she used hasn't been revealed yet, but in Chapter 44, Hermione hits Beauxbatons students with a Stupefy that had an extra kick. The ending of Chapter 47 has even the speakers underestimating her power (or her capacity for hate). So through a combination of Hermione's increasing depression and the ritual she performed, she has grown more powerful.

Of course, magic has a cost - especially dark magic.

*** KwanLi, I would just like to say thanks on behalf of every fanfiction addict for Hogwarts Battle School. Fanfiction has grown stagnant, and your story has brought back some enjoyment. Yours is the only story I routinely (daily after the projected update time) check for updates.

I'm relatively new here so I apologize if you get this quite often. I figured it would be easier to reach out to you here than on fanfiction.net (although I have left reviews there). My only wish is that more people on this subreddit and fanfiction in general were aware of this story.

which is?

There does not appear to have been any drawback at all.

**** I suppose it depends what you mean by drawback. She has more power, but what does that do to her?

Hearing voices is almost certainly a drawback. Blaise fails at the Imperio whilst Hermione succeeds. She's also able to cast the Killing Curse despite Moody telling them that few can manage it. That could just mean she is a stronger witch, but becoming adept at Unforgivables and dark magic is certainly flirting with the line.

** I was under the impression it was a ritual that helped her raw magical power increase to match Harry's levels

**** Again this is how I understand/remember it. The purpose of the ritual was to increase the person's power. Hermione does it to help her against harry in battle class. The tattoo is I guess sort of a notifier? Like it warms up when is being used and such. And yeah that part was mysterious enough
