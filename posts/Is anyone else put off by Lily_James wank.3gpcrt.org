It's there in canon of course, but you see it in practically every fanfic too. Harry gets told he looks like James, but has Lily's eyes and then whomever is speaking speaks of them like they're the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's ridiculous how common this is even in stories where some people have no place really knowing them well. Certain characters (like Sirius for instance) tend to be made to do just this in a number of stories and just seem to have their actions and feelings in the story be influenced solely by the post-mortem wanking of Harry's parents.


** They were what we'd consider a power couple, both were attractive and skilled at magic, they had a high School romance culminating in weding before they wer 20, and both died young, fighting the worst Dark Lord in history, saving their only child in the process, and helped defeat said Dark Lord. They had a perfect heroes' death, they didn't live to break up, have affairs, nag each other, or create scandals. It would be weird if the other characters didn't hype and romanticize them. But if the author starts hyping them as well, that could be a problem.

*** You also have to consider the context in which the praise is said. It's almost always said to /Harry/, you know: The hero /orphan/ who never knew his parents. Of course people are going to laud his parents.

Like, who's going to shit on his parents? "Yeah, I know your parents died while fighting to save our society, and I know you've never known them, but your dad was a real cunt."

Even if Harry wasn't the BWL, people would still talk up his parents. He's a bloody orphan. Who's going to walk up to an orphan and start shit talking his parents?

You know, besides Snape.

** Their in-canon semi-deification makes perfect sense, given the context.

On the other hand, like "Gred and Forge" or lemon drops, the fandom latched on to it and milked it for all it was worth and then some.

** I feel like it is a problem if they are alive in the fic but I think it makes perfect sense if they are dead, as in canon, because there story is very easy to romantisize. They are two intelligent, charismatic, and brave young lovers that stood up to Voldemort three times and gave their lives to protect there infant son. Who went on to defeat Voldy.

** They are war heroes, whose sacrifice single-handedly stopped Voldemort. In-universe it makes perfect sense that everyone worships them and focuses only on the good parts.

Like how "patriotic" Americans have a boner for George Washington and completely ignore all the fucked up shit he did during the seven year war. Or how many left-wing hipsters ignore that Che Guevarra was a racist mass-murderer. Compared to real world examples of blind idolatry, the Potter actually were upstanding citizens.

** Yes, it bugs me. How and when they died changed everything. Everyone forgets the bad and thinks of them as these perfect people, of which they're not. Harry caught a glimpse of that in Severus' memory. I actually can't stand fics that make James/Lily to be perfect, when they were horribly flawed.

*** So human?

15 year old James was a bully who grew up to fight evil and gave his life so his wife and child had the slightest chance to escape. Snape grew up to join said evil, torturing and killing people. He only changed when it would affect someone he loved and was quite prepared to let her husband and child die. He then goes on to teach and spend years terrorizing the children of the people who fought against including (the one we know about) an orphan whose parents deaths he's partly responsible for and a child who watched his parents be tortured into insanity.

**** Ugh, I can't even. You are going off making him perfect again. Perhaps if he was smart, James would have made Dumbledore their secret keeper or even McGonagall. The fact that James and Sirius were happy to believe Remus would join Tom is ridiculous. They were arrogant little shits, who wanted to play the hero. If James really wanted to protect his family, they should have hidden elsewhere, new country, hell move hemispheres. The so human character in the series is Severus, not James nor Lily. His story arc was very telling of human nature.

****** He was not a terrible person. He was a man who never allowed himself to heal.

He was raised in an abusive, harsh environment. He never received support or love except from one person whom he loved more than anything, and whom he ruined any chance he had with her. Yes, there are other characters in the series who suffer and who become better, even great people. Snape isn't one of them - he is himself. Not everyone can get over things which have deeply wounded them. People can be in the same situation, but because people are individuals, that same situation will have many different outcomes. Snape's destiny was of his own molding, his own making.

He is an excellent example of a character who is on the side of good, but not necessarily a good person.

Severus was a deeply flawed, complex, contradictory individual. He had his horrible side and his great side. He was a mixture, a clash of the best and the worst. He was two sides of the same coin; light and darkness, night and day.

He was a bully...and a savior.

He was a traitor...he was loyalty defined.

He was petty...he was just.

He was selfish...he sacrificed.

He was cruelty...he was honor.

He loathed for years...he loved for a lifetime.

My favorite character from the whole series and a character I undoubtedly feel immense pity for and who I really love, flaws and all. Truly a great character.

** I agree.

They were two 20 year olds who thought the middle of a war they were actively fighting in (and losing) is the perfect moment to get pregnant. That Rowling decided to deify them was weird enough.

On the other hand; the magical world is the size of a small town and they were celebrated as war heroes with James also being the 'it boy' during his school years. There are books about them, so that everyone resuscitates the few things they know about Harry's parents when they meet him doesn't seem very unusual.

Raving about James and Lily is something nearly everyone not very close to them can and would do without being OOC. And the few people who should be aware of their bad sides are either crazy, obsessed with being accepted and loved or dead.

** They died in their early 20s and were remembered by all the things they did in their teens, which were, let's face it, really memorable things. James founding a group of pranksters who's mark on Hogwarts was remembered well after they'd left, Lily being the smartest witch of her generation. James' prowess in transfiguration... They lived and supposedly showed very few bad traits. This is all not counting their contribution to the First War or their sacrifice. That's why they get romanticised as saints.

It's a case of oversight to presume that they're like that all the time. No one is perfect all the time.
