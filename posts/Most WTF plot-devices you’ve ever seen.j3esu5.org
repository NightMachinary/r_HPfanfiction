Ok, so there are some plot-devices that ask for a bit of disbelief suspension and then there are plot-devices of the never, not in a million years type. So, what are the most ridiculous, illogical and unreal you've read?

Mine is an actually quite good story in which the Triwizard Trophy sends Harry and Teddy back in time because it apparently spent too much time unclaimed around a bunch of random powerful magic.

Edit: just reading a story and had to hit back upon coming into overhelpful goblins taking care of the Horcrux at Ch. 3 for virtually nothing else than some spare change from excessively rich Harry, this is a very recurring and annoying illogical plot-device.

Or about how he used his Dumbledore super powers of knowing everything happening at any part of the world despite it being impossible *TM to guarantee that Harry would befriend Ron -who he absolutely knew for sure was lazy and dumb despite the poor having never been put in an environment in which this trails would have been evident and both his parents and siblings having proved themselves hard workers and smart- and Hermione -who he knew from day one was a rule-abider of the highest order who would always defer to him because of his positions despite the girl being only 11 and thus prone to develop and lose interests and viewpoints while growing up.

Or even deciding to make poor unfortunate Snape brutally invade Harry's mind repeatedly so as to deepen the security risk presented by the mind-link and foster even more bitterness between the son of the guy who Snape loathed and the professor who had insulted, belittled and being an all-around jerk to Harry and his friends.

** So as soon as I see marriage contracts, I usually hit the back button. You know, it's not even that I'm inherently opposed to them as a storytelling narrative, but I have almost never seen one that treats it with even a vague connection to how people would realistically emotionally act. It even has potential to be really interesting - I've read historic fiction that's included arranged marriages, and they're slow, careful and there can be a lot of grieving and negotiation to it.

But for some reason in fanfic, they're always used to force sex between two characters that otherwise wouldn't consent, usually within an egregiously small window (getting a letter that says you have to sleep with someone within the week - yikes).

And while I'm on my soapbox about it - it's really degrading to both men and women. Women in the obvious coercive themes that we often see discussed. But I don't know if most men in that situation could, like, physically do that? Such an act would be upsetting for both parties and the sheer lack of arousal would, yeah, potentially make it physically not possible to consummate. To write a story and assume a guy could get to completion under those circumstances is kind of shitty. I'm not a guy, so maybe it's more possible than I realise, but when a supposedly reluctant male character is paired with hermione in a marriage fic, then happily has sex with her I'm like - is that possible? I imagine there'd be problems there or at least be very uncomfortable? Highly violating at least.

In fact, that applies for all fics where a supposedly reluctant male character has no physical problems sleeping with someone. I kind of think it implies those characters, and men in general, are just animals that will take anything put in front of them if given permission and that's not my jam. Kind of degrading.

*** Yeah, I agree that most fanfic treat marriage contracts in a way that is ahistorical at best, and /problematic/ at worst.

I've been spending a good bit of time researching them for a fic I've been writing, and I have developed a head-canon regarding them: Marriage contracts /probably/ do exist in Wizarding Britain, but not in the way many ficus portray them. Instead, they're basically just the magical equivalent of a pre-nuptial agreement, and lay out in a legally binding manner the expectations, property rights (my head canon is that the Ministry of Magic has not repealed a Coverture) dowry, &c. Perhaps even what constitutes grounds for divorce, whether Levirate or Sororate marriage is expected in the case of death or infirtility, &c.

I think that if writers were willing to write marriage contracts /as contracts/, they would make a powerful plot device to provide conflict, rather than just a propellant to start the desired ship. And even if they /are/ treated as a non-consensual arranged marriage, there are stories worth telling there, too: either the psychological trauma of it if there is no escape, or the conflict involved in trying to avoid the contract. I suppose even the more common story of learning to accept it and grow to love /can/ be done well, but it is more difficult, and most writers don't seem interested.

**** I agree, I think the ideas of acknowledging the marriage as contracts, or as nonconsenting and traumatic, both have the potential to tell a valuable story, tbh - i think there'd be the opportunity there to actually engage with some of the bad ramifications of the marriage trope setup itself. Even if not traumatic, and there wasn't a weird sex clause, it would be interesting to see people cope with an arranged marriage in a magical setting. Arranged marriages have long historic contexts and there's lots of existing stories and myths to draw from in that regard.

Interesting headcanons by the way! I always thought a legal remnant or old law would be more convincing as a premise than a grab at population control. As soon as I read the words “due to the falling population of wizardingkind” I smash the back button like “oh no!”

***** Exactly. Marriage contracts actually /were/ a thing in the UK during the early modern era, before the statute of secrecy. If we make the assumption that the creation of the statute is when the legal systems and cultures diverge, then English common law and practices from before then still apply. In the UK, Coverture (the practice by which women ceded all legal rights to their husbands) was only repealed in 1882. Forced marriages (such as by a contract) were only made legally voidable in /1973/. Consensual arranged marriage contracts are still legal, even if they are almost never practiced except among immigrant communities.

Indeed, the only reason the muggle aristocracy no longer has arranged marriages is that aristocracy is now almost entirely symbolic. There is no longer a /reason/ to set up politically advantageous marriages, and modern muggle culture places a significant value on marriage for love.

Is it so hard to imagine that the culture of ‘pure bloods', who seem to imagine themselves as a sort of aristocracy, would model themselves after the aristocrats of the pre-statute era, marriage contracts and all? That they would not have developed the same value of love-marriage that muggles had? I do not think it is.

But there is a difference between acknowledging that ‘pure blood ' culture values different things in marriage, and accepting that they would have ridiculous clauses in their marriage contracts such as mandatory consummation on pain of death/loss of magic. It is more likely that lack of consumption would simply be grounds for dissolution of the contract; at /worst/ opening up liability for a breach of contract lawsuit.

**** Another possible good way would be to go the arranged marriage route (but only regular contract-level of binding, possibly even with escape clauses), but use the trope of Harry being unaware of it. Thus, you end up with a girl/woman (depending on when it's set) that has known for years that she's promised to Harry but sees him ignoring her or at least not acknowledging their betrothal, which is a recipe for easy drama.

*** I think the primary argument that marriage contracts do exist in the wizarding world is in the case of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. She made a good, pure-blood marriage because she had to, because it was what was expected. Who's to say her father or uncle didn't sort out all the contractual details for her?

But she's certainly not weak or downtrodden. Rodolphus doesn't get a single line of dialogue in the whole story. There doesn't have to be an abusive element just because there's a marriage contract. I think it can be done well canonically, but I don't think forcing someone like Hermione or Ginny into a marriage contract will ever work.

** Frankly, I can suspend disbelief on /almost/ anything; it's magic. I think where I find trouble is less with the /what/ of the plot device and more of the /how/.

For example, most fics that have Snape mentor Harry, his change of attitude is too abrupt, as though he just /changes his mind/ overnight. Snape, a man who has held a grudge for over a decade, who hates a /child/ because of what his father did, who goes out of his way to psychologically torture Harry whenever possible. And he just decides Harry's okay now because he noticed that Harry has Lily's eyes (as if that wouldn't make him hate Harry /more/ for reminding him that James got her in the end) or because he sees the cupboard while doing Legilimency, or whatever.

But, if it's done /well/, the same plot device works. If it's a gradual change, where both Harry and Snape have inner conflict to learn to stop hating each other, and external conflict with each other, then it can make a good story.

Pretty much the only plot device I find irredeemable is the Goblins being super helpful/powerful and solving all of Harry's problems immediately; removing the Horcrux, closing Death Eaters' vaults, &c.

Gringotts is a bank. They don't have Horcrux removal specialists (in canon there is literally /one/ book that describes Horcruxes to any level of detail beyond just the name, and it just gives instructions). They wouldn't side with Harry over the Death Eaters (They didn't in the previous war). No bank would, as it would set a precedent that the goblins are willing to /steal all of your money/ if they disagree with you politically. Even if that /isn't/ illegal in wizarding Britain, it would definitely make a whole lot of people take their money elsewhere. Not to mention probably start another goblin war.

**** Cursebreaking, yes. But Horcruxes are so esoteric in canon that there is /literally/ only one book--/Secrets of the Darkest Art/--mentioned that has anything more than the name. Tom Riddle himself resorted to asking about them to one of his /professors/. That he was willing to take that risk to learn about them suggests that there really was no other way. Add to that that there has, presumably, never been another human Horcrux, and that the confirmed methods of removing them are all destructive (fiendfyre, basilisk venom, and the killing curse), and it makes It astronomically unlikely that Gringotts has anyone who has ever so much as encountered a Horcrux, let alone having specialists in removing them from the curse scars of a curse that only one person has ever survived.

That said, with sufficient changes to canon, I suppose you could conceivably create a scenario in which Gringotts could feasibly offer a Horcrux-be-Gone service to its customers. It would just require jumping through a lot of hoops to justify a plot device that /almost always/ serves only to weaken the story by removing conflict.

Conflict is the lifeblood of fiction; without conflict, there is no story. If you have the goblins solve the Horcrux problem in a single chapter, what do you do next? Where can you go from there?

If the story that you want to tell has nothing to do with the Horcruxes, then it's fine, get them out of the story however you want. But dedicating a large chunk of the story to justifying the deus ex machina that you use to remove them is unnecessary. If you don't want the scarcrux, and you're willing to alter canon, just use the author fiat and say there isn't a scarcrux.

If the story you want to tell is one where someone /cough/ Dumbledore /cough/ is manipulating events, there are better ways to show that than having that someone refuse to remove something which is well known enough that the wizarding /Bank/, not an academic or a Doctor/healer, knows how to remove it. A Dumbledore who is as manipulative as such a story wants you to believe would know not to lie about information which can be easily verified by going to the /Bank/, a place which Harry visits every year.

As to the curse breaker thing, a Horcrux is (probably) not a curse. /Arguably/ it is an enchantment, but I would say it is wouldn't fit into any simplistic categories of magic, instead being an amalgam of all of them. Perhaps Alchemy, but even that is questionable.

** Warning: The following content might anger you. Read at your own risk 🙃

Most WBWL fics out there have a plethora of questionable plot points.

Dumbledore declaring Harry is not the Boy-Who-Lived because he has low magical levels which most explain it with the fact that Harry lost a lot of magic power when the Avada Kedavra was reflected.

The Wrong-Brother-Who-Lived having a mark on the shape of "V" for Voldemort. It is mistaken for a Cursed Mark even though it is caused by a burning shrapnel of wood.

The Potters hating Harry for no reason, especially James. Oh no! We can't have a WBWL foc without James despising his eldest son, denouncing his existence, and throwing him out of the Potter family.

The Wrong-Brother-Who-Lived having the intelligence of Grabe and Goyle. Oh, and his best friend is Ron Weasley who also suffers from the stupidity that afflicts every Gryffindor in these types of fics --with the exception of Fred and George, of course. Because the twins are cool, and no way would they ever be anything but little mischievous geniuses.

Harry might also be a squib (but not really). He gets diagnosed as a squib when he is a baby (because he reflected the Avada Kedavra, obviously) even though in canon a child isn't declared one until he doesn't manifest his magic at minimum 11 years old. Following Harry being a squib he gets sent to the Dursleys. He gets abused, obviously. Then on his eleventh birthday, surprise, surprise, he is a wizard after all! It's always a bonus if Snape takes the role of a mentor for Harry, which makes no sense if you think of canon.

Harry not being sorted in Gryffindor because that would put him in the same house as his brother and we can't have that. No, why not go for the route where Harry and his brother would have a way better chance at interacting and developing their realtionship. We can't have family love between The Wrong-Brother-Who-Lived and Harry. Harry should be a Slytherin and then his brother will definitely hate him because Slytherin are the evil spawns of Voldemort and Harry will certainly become a Death Eater.

The character bashing. You all know what I am talking about. I don't need to expalin this one.

This and many other reason is why I don't read WBWL fics anymore. I am not saying that every WBWL fic out there is bad. I am certain there are some great ones. I just haven't found them yet.

Really, the way many stories treat it is as if Harry or his sibling are expected to survive the supposedly unsurvivable curse and as if boy-who-lived is some sort of pre-coined and widely know title given to anyone who survives the killing curse.

The one fic I saw that used this was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][Stepping Back]]. And even then, it was explained enough to where it passes the JKR BSmeter. It used to be the room the time turners were in until they smashed. They then "stabilized" the room to where it just freezes time." They made the time turners, so they should be able to clean up them breaking. Otherwise, why would they hand them out to 13 year-old girls to be able to take an extra class?

Because wand lore is a thing? Pretty detailed thing too. Sort of like why you would put some thought into which gun a character uses and why. Yeah they all poke holes in things, but the specifics help establish character and setting.

I agree that some stories, and canon at times, don't do as much with wand lore as they should.

Olivander makes a good general purpose wand from readily sourced materials. People using the more exotic materials may get better results for a much higher price, be more specialized due to more severe variations in performance, or just want it as a status symbol.

Or for that matter, a character may just refuse to buy from Ollivander for personal reasons, and not be able to find a compatible wand at the "lesser" wand makers.

** - if they want a certain pairing to work like Hermione and Malfoy (I've read them before but I dont care for it. I dont like either character), some just completely throw out the beliefs of the characters so quickly. Like Malfoy doesn't believe muggles and muggle borns are bad anymore and Hermione trusts Malfoy despite the past X number of years.

- I suppose this counts but I usually see this is in fics where Harry is smarter and such (I think it's called indy Harry or something). He's super smart, he knows all about wizarding politics and addresses people like Malfoy as Lord. He's smooth with the ladies. I don't wanna bash the whole idea because I'm sure some are written quite well but sometimes it makes him sound like a middle aged adult. I'd rather read about awkward Harry.

- and I think this one counts but when people baby-fy Harry. You'll typically see in those Snape adopts Harry fics. He'll be normal at first then as the story progresses he's like a 5 year old and super weepy and it's a huge turn off

But my answer is still time travel, especially as the main plot.

*** I have to disagree, time travel docs are a guilty pleasure of mine, at least when it's handled well.

Perhaps I'm just a sucker for happy endings, but I do like Harry going back and time and righting all the wrongs of the series, and generally being bad ass whilst doing it.

And I also really love stories when characters meet their past selves. Character arcs usually progress slowly, so to force then to confront the stark difference between the start and end of their journeys is really interesting, if handled well of course. Most fanfic writers can barely get a handle on the general values of the canon characters, let alone how they change.

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.
