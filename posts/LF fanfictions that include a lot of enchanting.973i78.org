What the title says


** Just so you know, enchanting can be pretty much whatever the author wants right? It's not really defined in HP in any meaningful way. It could just be synonymous with ‘charmed.'

*** I guess what I meant is having something be like the Invisibility Cloak. It's not just a simple charm? Or am I wrong? I'm not very sure

**** No, it isn't defined at all. It's totally fanon and can be whatever you want, within a certain limit of course.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

*** Its not really enchanting though. If anything, it should be a form of transfiguration since he is conjuring and reshaping the material.

That fic has so many problems though, and Harry's abilities are just power-wank and yet he his such a dang baby I want to reach through my computer screen and punch the idiot in the face.
