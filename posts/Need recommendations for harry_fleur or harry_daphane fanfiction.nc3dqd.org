** Oh boy there are some good ones here.

Cadmean victory is harry/fleur [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]]

A flower for the soul is harry/fleur [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13747655/1/A-Flower-for-the-Sou]]

Letters is technically harry fleur, but it has some harry daphne in it and thhere is an alternate ending where harry ends up with daphne instead of fleur [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]]

There's a fic I'm not remembering where harry dates tonks for a while before dating fleur. I can't remember the title though. There is a CHANCE it is cadmean victory, but I don't think that it is. I'll try to find it.

/Start edit: found it, it's called for the love of magic/ pretty fun read!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/]]

Honor thy blood is harry daphne (this is the remastered version. The origional was kind of light on the harry daphne ship, the remasters improves the entire story while also making harry and daphnee relationship more important. Be advised, the remaster is not finished but is actively being worked on)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13290222/1/Honour-Thy-Blood-Remastered]]

Serpentine advice is harry daphne

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13653786/1/Serpentine-Advice]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13275504/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Vanishing-Princess]]

One of my personal fav with muggle Daphne.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12150047/1/A-Fateful-Walk]]

An after hogwarts-battle encounter that links them. I like his writing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12557197/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Friend]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12927652/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Dogfather]]

Unexpected series, nice friendship blooming around.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13408959/1/Don-t-Look-Back-in-Anger]]

My absolute favourite of enemies (not mortal, just school rivalry. Head boy and head girl) to lover Haphne.

Beside these I'll suggest you read all works of Dorothea Greengrass and James spookie.

Edit - And how could I ever forget this in recommendations... I apologise but here it is now recommended

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13745293/1/]]

Another nice but a bit darker story (time travel a bit dark Harry but lovely Haphne)(came back for Daphne). Original author deleted their work, it's a copy.

Also, you can find a doc in one of the posts at [[/r/Haphne][r/Haphne]] which contains a list of well written Haphnes. Cheerio

*** Awesome recs. I'm proud to say that I have read and loved all your Haphne recommendations mentioned here.

Although just to have a little discussion, what do you think of individual books of Harry Black? I adore the first one for Haphne, love the second one for the OCs (and their relationship). But from 3rd book, my interest declined heavily. I read the third but it felt more like a chore and I dropped the story on second chapter of the fourth book. Its nice but I think I don't like the heavily differing AU (starting from book 3). At least they were in hogwarts so it was ok and fun to read.

The author is really good, it's just book 3 and 4 are not for me.

**** I actually really enjoy AU. If everyone simply rehashed canon for every story, the harry potter fanfiction universe would be dead already /because/ there are only so many ways to rewrite canon.

As such, I enjoyed the whole series immensly. Specifically, book 3 I really liked the whole thing, especially when it culminated in the fight located at you know where against you know whom. I really enjoyed it. I haven't read the 4th book yet because I'm waiting for it to be finished so I can binge the entire series start to finish

***** Yeah true that. I guess I'm more of a romance reader with a bit of familiarity sprinkled in. I love AUs (cuz technically every fanfic is one) but it's an issue with me as I don't like AUs that differ a lot from the Canon. Not to say that I won't read them but rather they don't excite me that much. I like re-reading my favourite fics so that's that too (5-6 times and still love them like the first time xD).

And book 2 has one of the best presented OCs ever. That I loved a lot. I will apologise as I can't comment much on book 3 cuz I don't remember much of it (the key sign that I didn't like it), so I guess it really was just me and not the story ðŸ˜…

****** I love au divergent and canon rewrites. But with stories that go mildly to heavy AU, I feel like I'm always getting a fresh new story. And that's why I like au divergent fanfiction so much, I get to see the same charectors I like, but in so many new ways and in so many alternate storylines.

I guess I'm kinda the opposite of you, if a story sticks too close to canon, I can still enjoy it, but I find myself a lot less invested, because I feel like I've already read the story a multitude of times. Canon compliant or close to canon fanfiction just makes me feel like I've already read the story 50 times ya know? Doesn't mean it can't be good, it just feels much less riviting

Another one I like is Harry Potter and the Vanishing Princess by StruggleMuggle. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21163406/chapters/50371844]] Sadly yet unfinished. No Bashing.

  Dumbledore was surprised when Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, came to Hogwarts. He expected a saviour, what he got was a damaged boy who has no interest in playing hero for anyone. What does Harry want? He wants to be left alone. Will have my own characters starting from chapter 26. Dumbledore, Hermione, select Weasley bashing.

  Athena Potter, daughter of Harry and Ginny, wants nothing more than her parents to be happy. With Ginny marrying Oliver Wood, her father needs a date. Luckily for her Teddy Lupin is glad to help. Now to find the impossible; a date for her father, Professor Potter. An EWE story, not part of the Professor Muggle series.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
