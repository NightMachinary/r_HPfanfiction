Obviously one of the major events of Dumbledore's life was the death of his sister, Ariana, when there was a falling out between himself, his brother Aberforth, and Gellert Grindelwald. This event also had a major impact on the world as a whole, IMO. Grindelwald's war and the original "Greater Good" plan would have gone much differently if Dumbledore had continued to work alongside Grindelwald.

This event was a source of grief, shame, and trauma for all of Dumbledore's life. In the cave in HBP, when Dumbledore is seemingly re-living his worst memories due to the Evil Potion, he fixates on the death of Ariana and how he doesn't want anyone else to get hurt.

An interesting detail of this is that, in the King's Cross scene at the end of DH, Dumbledore hints that Grindelwald is the one who killed Ariana:

#+begin_quote
  â€˜Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana ... after all my mother's care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.'
#+end_quote

So what do you think? Was Dumbledore's rambling of "It's all my fault" literal in the sense that he believes he directly killed his sister, or is it meant in a more abstract sense? "I'm the one who encouraged Gellert's ideas, I'm the one who failed to protect her, etc".


** I don't think it matters. To reach the point in an argument with people you like/love where you have spells strong enough to cause death flying around, you'd have to have lost control completely.

It wasn't just Grindelwald who lost control, and Dumbledore was just as 'dark'/evil/enamored with utilitarianism at that point. Any of them could have done it, and my moneys on multiple people hitting Ariana. If she was in the middle of the fight she'd likely have been hit by multiple sides.

When Dumbledore says its his fault, I think it means he himself lost control.

** I think Albus knows that whether he cast the spell or not, he is responsible for his sister's death. Even if it wasn't his spell that killed her, his negligience did.

** I agree that it doesn't matter. Dumbledore thinks he did, he was obviously casting the right spells, even if he technically didn't he very well could have-it doesn't make much of a difference.

** Does it matter? The fact that Dumbledore himself doesn't even know makes him just as responsible, even if not directly.

** Honestly, I want it to be Aberforth's spell, but it only hit Ariana because of something either Grindelwald or Dumbledore did (deflecting the spell, throwing his aim off, warping space, etc.). Just to be contrary.

*** Heck, maybe her Obscurial just happened to kill her then because of the stress, and no one else's spell was involved at all.

** Oh it definitely was not Dumbledore's spell that hit and killed his sister.

But to engage in combat near his sister which resulted in her death was his fault and it is that which he blames himself for.

** I always figured that Dumbledore didn't KNOW if it was his spell that ultimately killed Ariana or not... it plagued him that he didn't know, but ultimately he still viewed the entire thing WAS his fault... No matter if the actual kill came from his wand or not, he was still responsible for the situation having come to that in the first place.

** In my headcanon it was Dumbledore. Gellert had a thing with Arianna and just played Dumbledore to have a powerful ally. Dumbledore realised that his feelings were not returned, the fight escalated and in the end Gellert fled, cursing Dumbledore and the entirety of Britain for siding with Dumbledore's version of the events.

Makes for a better story than good vs evil.

Mine also. Albus /never/ says who killed Ariana even though he's had use of the Hogwarts Headmaster's Penseive for decades. He doesn't say he doesn't know, he just says she was killed. Albus' statements are evasive and uncommitted, a tell that he knows something he doesn't want to reveal even by accident. His rambling while drinking the poison in the sea-cave reveals a considerable freight of guilt, too. Aberforth may /say/ he doesn't know who killed her, but his reaction to his elder brother - blames him, punches him in the face at Ariana's funeral - is quite speaking, no?

And, really, who's more likely to have been careless in her general direction? The madman who saw her as a resource for his plan of world domination, her favourite brother, or the brother who saw her as the reason he was trapped in Godric's Hollow?

**** I always figured the guilt and the punch was due to Albus being partly responsible for the fight happening, not the actual spell that killed her. He also could have not used the Pensieve out of fear of what he'd find.

Or because he knew right well what he'd find.

****** I read your comment, there's no need to repeat yourself. I was just offering an alternative reason. The whole thing still makes perfect sense even if it was not him who killed her.
