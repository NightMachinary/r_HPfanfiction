I flared this as discussion because I think it's a really interesting concept, but feel free to use this as a Prompt or even a Recommendation thread as well!


** Why would Voldemort make an unbreakable vow? Why put his /life and magic/ on the line for Snape?

If the Vow was made to Snape, why would anything Lily did affect it ("transfer" it to Harry: what does that even mean)? How would Voldemort know the vow had been altered so that it was safe to kill Lily now? Even if he knew it was safe to kill Lily, why would he when whatever reason he had to make the vow was still in place?

This idea needs work to make it plausible.

*** I read an otherwise forgettable fic where this vow was part of the lordship vow. So when Snape swore to be a loyal vassal and wear Voldie's mark, Voldemort had to reciprocate with a vow to be a good lord and protect Snape's family or the Dark Mark wouldn't have worked. The plot twist was that Voldemort didn't know Lily counted as Snape's sister.

*** Well for the transfer she willingingly offered her life for her son's. In this scenario voldy had vowed to spare her so when she offered up her life In exchange she replaced herself in the original vow with harry when he killed lily. Therefore when he then tried to kill harry he broke the vow. I can see it being explained as magic is all about intent so when voldy killed her he in essence accepted her offer. It's a little flimsy to be sure but what isnt when we're talking about magic lol

*** No, Voldemort simply promised not to kill Lily and was defeated by the backlash of her sacrifice.
