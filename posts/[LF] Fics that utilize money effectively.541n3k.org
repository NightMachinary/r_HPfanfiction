I have seen lots of fics where Harry goes to Gringotts and they say "You have x Galleons" but never does anything with them other than Harry just being able to buy anything.

I'd prefer something like his trustfund gaining 2000 galleons or so every year, so he uses it all effectively


** I second this request. I would really like to read a fic where money is actually important and used intelligently. People usually either give Harry 500, 000, 000 galleons and then have him never use any of it or they make it so that Harry basically owns the whole wizarding world and Dumbledore just never told him about it/plots with Molly to steal it.

***** Actually, not really. Not the way you put it, at the very least.

We do know that it's possible to buy a galleon with about five Pounds, and buy from the goblins at that. That implies that however much the gold used to mint that coin is worth, and however much you can buy with that one coin, the worth of the coin in British currency is about five Pounds because the goblins are too greedy to let anyone who has a bit of cleverness take their money by melting down the galleons and then selling the gold; thus, either the coins are protected against that with some kind of charm or curse or whatever or they aren't actually made of gold but of an allow that looks like one (and my bet is on the former).

Sure, it does seem that a galleon allows you to buy more than you'd expect to buy with five pounds. But the wizarding and muggle societies are separate to a high enough degree that this “it does seem” in itself is not reason enough to say that one galleon is worth however many pounds you'd need to buy things that could cost you a galleon.

******* You should have clarified, then. As it is, people did take it as a proclamation that a galleon really is worth so-and-so much, because occasionally there are people out there making arguments, often quite loud ones, about how that's the truth and they are right and galleons really are worth as much as they say; and since the comment you replied to didn't have anything people could take as a start to the kind of joke you say it was, well, you got what you got.

**** I have to say that alas, I do not, at least not if what you want is the theme (money being used effectively).

I do know of some stories that are /similar/ in theme---which might or might not be enough for you because they tend not to be about money but rather about this-or-that being used better than you'd expect; and some of them, unfortunately, do contain bashing of some characters to some degree (generally not an issue since they tend to be short and over-the-top in some way anyway, but for some people it still does ruin their enjoyment)---so I can post those if you want, and if it's the writing style that is to your liking then I recommend simply going through esama's stories as though I will not discuss whether or not she's a /great/ author, a /good/ one she definitely is.

** I've read some stories where Harry uses his money to "win", by bribes, or buying people out, or hiring people, or whatever else.

That said, I think those stories still basically just assume Harry has infinite money, and that there are no laws against racketeering in the wizarding world.
