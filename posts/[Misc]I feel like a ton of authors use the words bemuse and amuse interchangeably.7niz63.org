** It happens, you have to keep in mind that when it comes to fanfiction, not everyone has a degree in English literature/language. Some writers are still in high school, others have never had a great knack at language/vocabulary, but do have an amazing creativity. Fanfiction is also, most of the time, edited by only one pair of eyes (the author themselves). When I read fanfiction, I don't expect to see Tolkien level writing (hell, half the time I don't even expect to find a plot).

** I had this thought a few weeks ago and it drives me a little nuts. I hate the pause when reading where you have to figure out if they meant the word they used, and you need to reread the sentence for context. Worse, sometimes that's all you get for character reaction, and you have no real idea which it is. Distressingly common when writers use Luna.
