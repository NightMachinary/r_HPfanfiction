To be fair, I don't like most fics with bashing in it, but I can ignore it if it's Dumbledore or a few others... but god Ron bashing is just the worse to me I absolutely cannot stand it.

To me I just purely dont understand it, I get that Ron has some faults in canon, but he always gets through it and comes out as a great friend to Harry, I love Ron cuz he's like the best bro to Harry and is so needed for the trio friendship to hold them together. I dont get why people dont like him?

Ron Bashing is like one of the biggest things for me to stop reading a fanfiction am I the only one?


** Ron is one of my favourite characters, however I can cope with a little bashing (of any characters) if its:

A: Done well And B: Not either overt or just plain ridiculous.

An example, and forgive me for forgetting the title of the fiction, I attempted to read that started with Harry just straight murdering the Dursleys, had Dumbledore set up as a vampire hating mass murderer who started the order of the phoenix as an anti vampire terror group, and had ron as a moronic slitheryn hating twat who, and says (paraphrased) " Ron didn't need harry, he had Albus Dumbledore as his best friend now"

Other highlights included harry owning a house with a magical time closet that allowed him to learn Dumbledore level power in a day and a sexy adult vampire who falls in love with harry immediately after meeting him.

Needless to say I did not read the whole Fic

ETA: My favourite quote about Ron in any fic comes from The Problem with Potions; "This is why Ron was Harry's best friend, if Harry Jumped off a cliff, Ron would immediately follow him, and they would try work out a way to not die on the way down"

I can totally see him going from: "WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE HARRY? A BLOODY BIRD? COULD HAVE FOOLED ME." to a "I am SOARry about it." in the matter of minutes just to defuse the tension.

** I like Ron and agree he's a great friend. People may be more inclined to bash him because they don't think he's good enough for Hermione, he gets jealous of Harry, says blunt rude things occasionally...people might also hold his fight with harry in book 4 about the triwizard and him walking out on h/hr in book 7. And although I think he's a way better wizard/much smarter than he gets credit for, he doesn't have Harry/Hermione's talent. And he comes from a family of talented siblings who excel above and beyond in at least one area...Ron is just known for being brave and helps Harry during the adventures.

** I like characters to remain reasonably within their canon personality. So fics where Ron acts like a jerk and overreacts, puts his foot in it, but has some sort of redemption arc are fine by me. Fics where Ron gets thrown downstairs on a regular basis, finds toads in his toast and just overall has more bad luck than Odysseus are too much for me.

** Eh. Personally I don't care, so long as it works for whatever story a person is trying to tell, but even that depends on how well it's used. There's a comedy fic where Ron gets put in the Triwizard and ends up bumbling around through it that I find semi-amusing, for example. It is hard to use well, I admit, but it can be done.

Generally, bashing is relative anyway. You consider Ron a great friend to Harry, but others interpret his character in more negative ways (usually either feckless idiot or borderline death eater). Whether those interpretations are accurate or not, people hold them, and that makes these conversations a little confused as 'Ron Bashing' subsequently means different things to different people (though I'm currently too tired to work out an example to demonstrate exactly what 'Ron Bashing' would be for someone who perceives Ron as the worst thing since sliced bread). For example, there might be a fic that you stop reading due to Ron Bashing where Ron is a disloyal and aggressive character who expresses such severe Slytherin hate that Harry is chased away. Other people might have a mental image of Ron where that fic is perfectly 'in-character' for him.

*** Yes - your reply is excellent. I've got a fic going where Ron is a great friend to Harry - understanding, patient, and empathetic - and I consider that to be massively OOC for him.

Frankly, any fic that lionizes or treats Ron well is AU *in my opinion*, not because he is evil and deserves to be bashed, but because - again, in my opinion - he was a legit awful friend to H & Hr in canon.

I totally understand why people like him - he's average, mediocre, the only 'every-man' of the main characters. Hell, he's also the only one with a sense of humor.

We all read fics that appeal to us personally. Having been burned by people I considered friends, I can't look positively on Ron as a character without some *MASSIVE* changes to who he is. That's not a concern for a lot of other people.

Good thing there's nearly a million fanfics for us to all pick from!

**** There's a reason Ron bashing is so common, he might not be a horrible friend, but I don't think Rowling have Ron enough positive moments to offset the negative moments. It's easy to point out flaws in Ron because he never changes. People didn't have a problem with Ron the first three books, he was the fun friend that had Harry's back. The fourth book ruined Ron in that we never saw him actually overcoming his jealousy in later books. It's just sorta glossed over. Flaws like Harry taking out his anger on his friends and Hermione's being bossy are way easier to gloss over than abandoning your friends in life or death situations.

That being said, I don't particularly like Ron bashing, I would much rather prefer if authors actually had him grow as a person.

***** So true, great point. It's a real shame, because Ron really /should/ be able to relate to Harry in a lot of ways that almost no one else can - they both grew up poor, not having possessions of their own (Harry bc of abuse, Ron bc of hand-me-downs), they both have real fears about not living up to expectations (Harry of his dead parents, Ron of his exceptional siblings).

All the pieces are there for Harry and Ron to have a really beautiful, loving friendship. Instead, JKR made Ron into a resentful, immature, disloyal jerk. And that /does/ suck!

**** Exactly. And equally, many people will disagree and be able to cite a million reasons why Ron is in fact the bestest friend ever. It's the nature of narrative and perception.

It's why I always have a slightly confused moment in all of these sorts of conversations because my brain reads "I don't like Ron" or "I hate Ron Bashing" and immediately wonders which 'Ron' they're talking about. It's pretty much the same with most characters - there's a dozen or more variant interpretations of Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore, Malfoy, Voldemort, etc. floating about the fandom.

Harry was much too forgiving in general, and that's due to his complete lack of self worth. He let Ron and other characters get away with too much and too easily, and it sucks to read in canon.

Bashing is usually shitty writing, but I genuinely like when authors either make Ron actually grow the fuck up and change his behavior, or have Harry realize that he deserves friends that treat him better.

***** But the problem with Ron bashing is more Rowling's convenient writing than anything else. Every time Hermione makes a mistake, something shitty/"plot"-wise happens to put it under the rug, or fizzle it(so it can be justified), where as for Ron its much more clearer(as well as Harry too, but much much less than Ron), easier to spot and call him out. But that's just Rowling's favoritism to Hermione. So Ron-bashers aren't anything more than hardcore movie fans(which are great, but only looking separately from canon books) who think that Draco is just so misunderstood/that he secretly likes Hermione/Harry is much more suitable for her anyway/Snape is actually the only man for her etc, or aren't just great readers after all(Ron critics are a completely different thing). Ron got the harder end of the deal, cause he was the fan favorite from book 1 to book 3(people stated that, and there were polls about it, it was his golden age), then after Kloves influence(cause he made Hermione a Mary Sue), Rowling just realized that her self interest must have a broader meaning than she already has(reducing Ron's exposition as a wizard who is a pureblood, and knows a lot of things about it to a person who "forgot" that his friends weren't raised by wizards and they don't know their stories for children/he doesn't know inheritance laws), cause she could have read it in a book(even DoM, and half the time when they were at the Horcrux hunt, which blantanly prove that Hermione should not be placed in the front lines of the battle, where some of the best Ron moments in fights were just mentioned by Tonks(or Hermione when she was surprised by his quick wits)).

🤔

Double standard: A double standard is the application of different sets of principles for situations that are, in principle, the same. It is often used to describe treatment whereby one group is given more latitude than another.

Hermione is given more latitude in her actions than Ron because you like her more, even when said actions are the same. That's literally a double standard.

** I hate Weasley bashing overall, but especially Ron bashing. He is a great character and so lovable. I like more creative ways for why Hermione is with whatever character in the story or why Harry can't tell Ron something. I tend to stop reading if the bashing gets too intense. Don't drag ickle Ronnikins y'all!

** I never really liked Ron much, and I started reading the series as a teenager before book 6 was released. All the times I remember him calling Hermione 'mental' for being a massive nerd and spending so much time in the library... well, I probably took it a little too personally, being a pretty voracious reader myself.

Also, he's a bit shouty and aggressive, and angry guys scare the shit out of me due to anxiety and childhood trauma. He'd have given me panic attacks if we'd gone to school together.

I think his vision in the Mirror of Erised turned me off him as well. Even when I was in my early teens, it seemed a bit shallow and selfish.

** I'm not a fan of any bashing. To create believable well-rounded characters (whether they are simple or complex), you've got to have redeeming qualities just as much as character flaws. Like, I'm not a fan of Ron however he does have moments in canon where Harry or Hermione need him.

** Bashing characters in fics is lazy and unimaginative, and extremely boring to read, even for characters I don't like.

If I don't like a character, that's because there's plenty of reasons in canon for me to find them unlikable. No reason to make stuff up.

As for Ron bashing in particular, I absolutely judge people who hate him. Everyone has their favorites and their least favorites, I'm not saying everyone has to love him. But when someone is frothing at the mouth to *hate* on /Ron/? In a story with characters that are actually cruel, evil, manipulative, shallow, bigoted, and malicious? I'm definitely judging you.

** Can't stand it, I think it's lazy writing. If you hate a character so much you don't want to write them at least a little in character I prefer they not even be in the story. I hate bashing of any kind really, but Ron and Dumbledore are probably the most bashed so it's especially irksome.

** I think what annoys about Ron-Bashing is the same people who hate Ron tend to love Hermione and ship her with Harry.

Which disregards the canon personalities beyond the point of recognition. I know the point of fanfiction is to do your own thing, but to me it's always just screamed a lack of understanding to me of the characters.

I don't bother with these fics beyond the first chapter or two, because I just can't get any enjoyment out of them.

I don't think I'd enjoy Hermione-Bashing fics either, not that I've ever seen a fic like that, but if Harry with his canon personality was going to fall out with one of them and not be bothered about it, it'd be her, not Ron.

** I very much hate Ron-bashing. Though, if some other characters got hit with the bash stick more often (Hermione, the twins, Arthur, Bill, Charlie) I wouldn't hate it so much.

And before anyone says "Well Hermione/the twins gets bashed too!" I mean stories where ONLY Hermione or the twins are bashed. 99% of the time if Hermione is bashed, so is Ron and Dumbledore. If the twins are bashed, Ron and Ginny are too. Where are the fics where Hermione's the sole bashed character and everyone else is left alone? The twins? Bill? Charlie? Arthur?

I rest my case.

*** You're right that Ron bashing is on an order of magnitude more frequent than Hermione bashing, but those do happen. I should know as I honestly, completely dislike Hermione's personality and look for stories that are without her.

An example, where Hermione is clearly in the wrong (every single ff by this author is a masterpiece, straying far from canon):\\

** I I actually don't like Ron that much, mostly because I think he's a jealous git, he abandoned harry in forth year, even when he knew how harry actually is, and after harry got the finished the first task, BAM! It's like those fight never happened, I honestly don't think abandoning your 'best friend' when he's forced to participative in a game which was closed because previous contestants died, not a good quality. He's also very biased towards Slytherin or anyone that is not griffindor. I feel like he's using harry, before you say anything about how he saved harry from his uncle's house, the idea was twin's.

Anyway it's just my personal opinion, not arguing with anyone.
