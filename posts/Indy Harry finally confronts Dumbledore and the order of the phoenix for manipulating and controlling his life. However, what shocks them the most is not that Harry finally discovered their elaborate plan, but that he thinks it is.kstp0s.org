Indy! Harry finally confronts Dumbledore, but in fact Harry thinks that all of this is a play, that the order, Voldemort and the Death Eaters are just following the script, and that this whole love potion story, Hermione and Ron being paid to be his friends, and the whole thing of Lord potter-black-slytherin-peverell are just the directors and producers of the play trying to spice up the story.


** Expanding on the prompt: the conspirators confirm his delusion because they think it's easier to just give him a script and deal with a spoiled child actor.

/Morgan Freeman voice/: It wasn't.

*** But since Harry is not an actual actor with any practice whatsoever, believes heavily in improvisation (with reason, no directors has appeared to berate him for not following the script) and is just plainly terrible at memorizing his lines (frequently misremembering bits of dialogue, stealing other characters' lines and even using lines that are for scenes much further in the script with knowledge he should /not/ have) plus he deciding to go totally spoiled diva-queen actor on the order (treating Snape like his personal slave for one) the entire experience becomes so stressful and hellish for the manipulators that they just throw their hands skyward and give up on all their plans.

**** Exactly! The classic "not only is the thing not working but it's also /shattered and/ /on fire/" plotline.
