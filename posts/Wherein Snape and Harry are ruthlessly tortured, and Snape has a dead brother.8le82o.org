Hello! I found a fic awhile back that I had started and quite liked, but I can't remember the name.

In this fanfiction, Harry is captured and tortured by Voldemort, and Snape tries to save him. Snape failed, and so Harry /and/ Snape are being tortured. Harry and Snape bond over the torture, and Snape has a dead bro named Quietus, who was killed by Voldy. I think Harry dies in the end.

I can't seem to find it anywhere. Any help is much appreciated!

It wouldn't, but you can reply to an edited comment with "ffnbot!refresh" and it'd do it.

  First part of the complete HDH trilogy. Post GoF. A tale about a captivity which brings two unlikely persons closer - much closer. Not a slash story. Currently re-edited.
