Hello all!

​

I have just recently started writing a HP fanfic, it's set during the second war and is about an "underground railroad" that smuggles half-bloods to safety. I'd love to hear some feedback as I am a writer, but this is my first crack at a fanfiction. Hopefully i'm not being annoying by plugging this here, but i suppose this is a community for sharing stories.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
