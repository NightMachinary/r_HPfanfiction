Generally, just stories with a specific focus on them as a trio? No ships necessary, some examples of this are [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630][The Sum of Their Parts]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]].


** Horcrux within linkffn(7505602) and Three's the Charm linkffn(8326928) has a trio focus, with the latter also having some romance (it's minor really).

Trio focus fanfics are quite rare. :)

** I just read Forging the Sword and wow - it's great! I'll keep a look out for trio fics but I haven't come across any apart from The Sum of Their Parts, which you've already mentioned.

** *Forging the Sword* is great, but unfortunately incomplete and likely abandoned. :(

*** As of October, it's being worked on again according to the author's profile. Apparently some sad real life happened.
