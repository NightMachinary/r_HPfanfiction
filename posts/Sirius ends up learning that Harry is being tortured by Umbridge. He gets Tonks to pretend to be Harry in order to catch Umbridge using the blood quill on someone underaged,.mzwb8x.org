** Tonks gets side tracked when she realises she has a chance to relive her school days. /Very/ side tracked

*** I don't think that Tonks would like being Harry very much. Even though she isn't really Harry and wouldn't have the visions that come with being Harry, she'd still have people hating him, Snape being needlessly cruel, some people being obsessive with the Boy Who Lived status, etc.

**** I can't imagine Snape was very kind to her the first time around either. Sure he ratchets it up to 11 with Harry, but Tonks is an adult now.

When I was a kid, facing down a mean teacher like Snape would have terrified and bewildered me. As an adult, he would probably seem ridiculous. Like, who behaves like that??

And re the people hating her thing: again, I can't imagine that's new. She must have been popular in school, but she was /also/ a half-blood Black. What must that have been like? The actual Black cousins and assorted other Slytherins would have been very not-okay with her.

** Tonks reveals herself. Umbridge proceeds to accuse her of impersonating a student and sends her off to Azkaban.

Tonks can't do shit about Umbridge since she's basically a junior employee while Umbridge is senior undersecretary and the Minister for Magic's representative at Hogwarts.
