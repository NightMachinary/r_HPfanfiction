:END:
So, Bookworm Potterhead sent this ([[https://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/]]) to a recent thread of mine and it got me curious. Has anyone in the fanfiction community written some in-world non-fiction stuff like this? Textbooks, worldbuilding information, etc?

I know Rowling did some stuff for a charity giveaway, but I'm curious if the fanfiction community specifically has taken a thwack at writing stuff to populate the 'ole Syllabus. :)

I'll also take fics that quote fictional textbooks prominently, even if they're not fully 'textbooks' in and of themselves. Y'know, where they start with a massive wall of text from "Funnyname McWizardyMan" that's like three paragraphs of prattle on whatever magical thingy is mentioned in that chapter? Yeah. Those're cool for this request too. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** There's linkffn(An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley), which is quite good and set as an actual in-world interview in 2008, memorializing the Second War.

The authors of NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series have a spinoff primer on dueling, but it's rather short and I wouldn't read it unless you've finished the series.

There's also a relatively popular fic that's in the form of a scientific paper written by Hermione, but I can't remember the name. Can someone link it?

Lastly, I'm sure there are quite a few takes on the Lockhart adventure books, I haven't delved into that corner of fanfic yet so not sure which ones are good and which ones are not, or how many there are.

*** That's an interesting fic. Thanks for the rec. :)

Also, for the record, I don't mind if a fic isn't good. I'm just curious what there is. I can usually find something to interest me in most fics, no matter the technical quality. :D

** [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by By Aaran St Vines]] : How did magic in Harry Potter's world come into existence? The first witches and wizards weren't just born with wands in their hands, were they?

Extensive Muggle and magical historical and anthropological research has revealed much, but not the whole story. In 2023, ten years after the master wandmaker's death, a provision of Mr. Ollivander's last will and testament allowed Harry Potter to give several exhaustive interviews telling the wizarding world the Ollivander family history - the founding of the oldest wizarding business in the world. Finally, the StoryTeller can chronicle this in a readable manner -- from Harry's eyes the summer before his third year.

A/N - One reader commented that my "382 B.C." is the definitive history of the beginning of magic. However, most readers don't review at all, so don't be that impressed with his kind words.

*** Heh. That first paragraph with the wand types interspaced with the story did make me chuckle. That'll be a fun and interesting read. Thanks for the rec! :)

** The same person actually runs a blog called Thelethifoldwitch (plus a wandlore blog), and in the same vein there's the postmodernpottercompendium. I think if you also look around a bit you'll find a bit more. I'll link them in a short while.

Edit: links

[[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://thelethifoldwitch.tumblr.com/&ved=2ahUKEwjPz_q-jIHrAhXotYsKHa2xCzoQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw3I-7RN4nG2xp5kTkO0FUGZ][thelethifoldwitch]] - snippets of the everyday world of witches and wizards, including some abroad pieces.

[[https://thepostmodernpottercompendium.tumblr.com/explore][postmodernpottercompendium]] - a blog that kind of world builds but through historical pieces? Has written a fanfiction on Ao3, linked through their blog. I haven't personally read it, but [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://archiveofourown.org/works/1575593/chapters/3344900&ved=2ahUKEwjmip_wjoHrAhWPrIsKHfptAAYQFjAAegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw0OAtpFU_ZpbEJbgmaCmG9m][here]] you go.

[[https://flourishandblottsstories.tumblr.com/][Flourishandblotts]] - in the same vein as the above.

[[https://amortentiafashion.tumblr.com/][Amortentiafashion]] - Wizarding world fashion, as it says. Not my cup of tea, but others may enjoy it.

[[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://departmentsofmysteries.tumblr.com/&ved=2ahUKEwjxn8bBjYHrAhVo-ioKHUuFAE4QFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw0rGXUPbfvGRpwzl-RptjXd][departmentofmysteries]] - fun read, does more to the Unspeakables than any fanfiction I've read before.

*** Wow. Thank you for all those links. Damn, those're fun. I do like that Post-modern potter compendium particularly - and it actually is semi-post-modern, which doesn't always happen with things named that, so that's nice too. :)
