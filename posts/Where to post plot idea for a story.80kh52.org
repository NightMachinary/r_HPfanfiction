Hi all. I have got an amazing (according to me) plot idea. I've got the entire story and idea, direction etc plotted out but I cannot write a story at all. I've tried. It's terrible.

So my question is, where is the best place to post the plot idea where I stand the best chance of someone seeing it and possibly writing it.

P.s. I hope the flair is correct


** Possibly Tumblr, or maybe a prompt meme on Ao3? It might be worthwhile talking about it here, too, you might spark someone's interest.

*** Thanks. Yeah. I might post it here if it would help. I've previously tried to find a beta to help me a little to no avail. Will try writing it one more time and then post here if I'm still unsuccessful.

**** What's the story about? I may be interested in helping beta if you like, it just depends on whether I can get into the story and whether our writing styles mesh. If I don't like your style or you don't like mine then it might not work...

***** Thanks for the response. Very roughly, it's Basically a end of 5th year story. Sirius dies. The dursleys leave Harry home alone. He comes across some "self help" books which help him to calm his mind. Get over Sirius and basically say f#$& it. That's the backround. Part of the story is him being his usual self but certain points he adapts his new f#$& it philosophy where he does some out of character things. If you are interested let me know and I will send me my complete plot line in more detail. This is not so much a serious fiction. More a lighthearted story

****** I am interested. I think it could go well, depending on how interesting you make the story and how well you write it. I'll message you my email address if you want to send it to me.
