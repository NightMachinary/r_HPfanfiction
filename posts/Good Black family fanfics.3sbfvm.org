Where Harry/OC/Protagonist is Sirius/Regulus son/daughter Where Harry is adopted by the Blacks. Where neither Bella or Regulus join the death eaters. Where the protagonist loyalties lie with the Blacks. Whatever along those lines. Guilty pleasures are ok with me.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  When Sirius Black ran away from home, it was the result of five years of being tugged between his Dark family and Light friends. Contrary to what he told Harry, nothing about choosing sides had been easy. He was just an excellent liar, especially about his mixed loyalties, his Dark past, and his role as the Dark's most successful spy. (Sirius's early Hogwarts years.)

**** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9832189/1/Dead-Man-Walking]]) is a very good one, but doesn't focus on the family as a whole so much as Regulus, Kreacher, and Sirius.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith]]) is a Malfoy family SI, but has a good deal of involvement with the Blacks.

Both of the above are rather unfortunately abandoned.

Another that may fit the bill (but might not if you don't like crossovers) and is currently updating is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky]]). It also involves a fem!Harry like PotB, but one raised by the Black family rather than taken in by them later in life.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.
