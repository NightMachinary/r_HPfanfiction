What are some clever ways writers ecaped The Trace?

The story i'm writing atm requires a couple of muggleborns finding some loophole in The Trace. I need some inspiration.


** From how the trace actually /acts/ in canon (versus what a few people say about it) I've come to the conclusion that it is only a charm on the houses and surrounding areas of muggleborn (or raised) Hogwarts students.

**** I would add that responsible adult wizards take it upon themselves to exaggerate the usefulness of the Trace- for instance Ron's parents enforce the "no magic during summer break" at home and probably pretend it's due to the Trace. That's why Lupin is so sure the Trace couldn't stay on Harry once he was 17, it was never actually on his person or wand to begin with.

It's like Santa- a fiction that all adults participate in and kids are only told the truth about once they reach a certain age.

** You can rework the Trace however you want, however from what we know of it in canon, it is simply a charm that exists on all magical users until they are of age. [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/trace-the/][Refer to the Lexicon.]]

Many assume that the Trace goes on wands, but it doesn't, so if you want to stick to canon, simply buying another wand won't do it, nor will casting a spell in the presence of wizards who don't have the Trace. In fact, the Trace seems to detect and alert the Ministry to /any/ magic used near an underage wizard. We're told this by Moody in the fourth chapter of Deathly Hallows, as well as through the Dobby incident.

This makes it kinda hard to get around. I suppose you could say that something like an Aging Potion could do it, at least for as long as the potion is in effect. I can't really think of anything at the moment, so sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

**** Why does Trace need to be anywhere near an underage wizard? Magic that makes muggles see Hogwarts as an abandoned ruin isn't on the muggles, but on Hogwarts. Trace isn't on the wand or the person, it's probably more like a radar spell of some kind maintained by the Ministry. The spell was cast to "detect magic around underage wizards" and so it does. How does the spell determine who's underage? The same way Hogwarts knows to hide from muggles - it's just who they are. Muggles are muggles and underage wizards are underage wizards. It has to do with the very language, concept, which we know from canon are an important factor of HP magic.

** Quoting the wiki,

#+begin_quote
  The Ministry trusts magical parents to properly discipline their children if they perform magic due to the fact that the parents' own magic will constantly interfere with the Trace. Children who grow up in the Muggle world, such as Harry Potter, are more closely monitored --- any magic that was performed at or near 4 Privet Drive was assumed to have been caused by him because he was the only known magical person living in his neighbourhood. Thus, when the house-elf Dobby used magic at that location, the Ministry blamed Harry.

Thus I would recommend doing magic around proper magical adults, which would simply confuse the trace.

Why would they discuss it? IF it gets applied, it is presumably applied at birth. They wouldn't remember/know. But I doubt that it's applied at all, but rather it's somehow naturally occurring (since it breaks automatically at 17 rather than actively being removed, it seems likely that something changes when a wizard turns 17 that makes a wizards' magic untraceable).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione doesn't get a letter when she performs magic before entering hogwarts.

Don't confuse enforcement with knowledge. As far as we know, it is not illegal to perform magic pre-Hogwarts, just between Hogwarts terms.

Similarly, after the Ministry picks up on Harry's Patronus in OotP, they don't send him another letter about his Lumos Charm. They've already served notice of legal proceedings against him, to do so again would be redundant. But that doesn't mean they didn't detect it.

The Ministry has figured out how to trace that feature of their magic. The system is therefore composed of two parts: a naturally occurring piece of magic on individuals, and a spell cast by the Ministry that can track it.

A feature of that naturally occurring piece of magic is that it allows you to track all magic in the person's vicinity but not the identity of who is casting it.

Because (as already mentioned) it isn't capable of distinguishing between the magic of different wizards. It's only capable of detecting magic regardless of its caster (and, presumably, magic that hasn't been cast at all, i.e. natural magic such as that created by creatures and plants).

Since we don't know if that's a limitation of magic itself or a limitation by design we can't really say if it has anything to do with competence or bigotry. It may simply be a technical limitation which they have not yet figured out how to overcome.

**************** If magic is dangerous, they'd tell people that they are not allowed to work magic as soon as they get a wand and the books. They wouldn't wait until they have started Hogwarts. You have to be braindead to not tell people when they buy their wands if they can't use them at home. Again, fits a stupid inept Ministry, but makes no sense otherwise.

Also, a law you can only enforce against part of your population and you know will be ignored by the rest results in discrimination. Especially, as pointed out, if it's not making sense to begin with in how it is worded. Again, fits a bigoted Ministry, makes no sense otherwise.

******** How would young riddle being able to practice wandless magic before Hogwarts as we know he did, without getting a warning, if he's under the trace since his birth?how does the ministry recognises underage illegal magic from accidentally magic? If the trace spell targets a peculiarity in underage wizards' magic, then this peculiarity should be present in accidental magic manifestations as well.

It doesn't make much sense, too, that the kids don't trigger the trace in the department of mystery.

Maybe the way to beat the trace is just too cast enough magic to overwhelm if.

  As far as we know, it is not illegal to perform magic pre-Hogwarts, just between Hogwarts terms.
#+end_quote

I'm re-reading old threads because insomnia, and I've thought that performing magic in the home pre-Hogwarts by muggleborns might be tolerated or even approved of (as long as the Statute of Secrecy isn't broken), because it would help keep the muggleborn (and muggleborn's parents) from believing it is all a trick, and remind them that magic is:

A) Real

B) learn-able at a school that they are going to attend.

******** No, I have actually conducted a search of the epubs of the books to prove it to someone else before.

The noun "ward" is used only once (or multiple times in one scene, I'm not certain) and in the sense of a hospital ward at that (in OotP). Feel free to quote all the other many times it's used, though, I'll be waiting.

Edit: (hospital) ward is also used in HBP, I think

** Casting spells in a wizarding home or any place with lots of wizards such as Diagon Alley, Ministry or Hogsmeade will do it. Officially the Trace will go off but it is automatically assumed that the spell is cast by a nearby wizard.

I'm now wondering if the Trace surrounding pure blood wizards is even enforced. If 15 year old Ron Weasley cast a spell in the middle of nowhere will he receive a letter or is it automatically assumed that there is an adult nearby?

** Depends on how it works!

Is it a charm on the person? If so: Why does it not work at Hogwarts (hell: Why didn't it alert people to Harry and friends casting stuff in the DOM in 5th year?)? Wards? Is it only applied at the beginning of the school-holidays and removed upon return to school?

Is it on the wands? (if so getting another would work...however you want to do that: From using the wand of an older wizard to buying one without the trace on it etc. etc.)

Is it something that covers areas? (meaning only muggleborns would be targeted because it wouldn't work in Diagon Alley for example because of all the wards and people casting magic there)

It's really up to you :) - I've seen all of those in fanfiction and I don't have a preference!

** If the Trace searches for instances of magic without an adult capable of performing magic around, then it's simple: find an adult capable of magic and bring them around with you.

I suggest you use Lockhart. For maximum convenience, stun him, apply Draught of the Living Death, then Transfigure him into a piece of roller luggage.

*** Depends on how much the potion can age you and if the trace is firstly actually on your person (or if, well say magic goes through some sort of puberty, too and the trace is really on the wand - so any wand, even the wand of an older wizard, would report you to the ministry if you aren't an adult wizard yourself!) and if it wouldn't just reapply itself (hell, maybe underage wizards kind of "leak" magic and that's what the trace-spell picks up and that stops once you are off age? (maybe because magic is involved in growing up if you are a wizard)...maybe that's why it doesn't work in wizard homes...every magic around the underage wizards trips the trace, but in wizard homes it's just assumed that it's the adult wizards? Hell, what about a pureblood/half-blood being in the middle of nowhere when a spell is cast near them...will they even get a notice or is it just discrimination (or a plothole...I mean Voldemort didn't get a notice when he was murdering his father and grandparents!))
