It's about a self insert who thinks he's been inserted into the HP verse, but was actually inserted into a fanfiction.

the original fanfiction features a competent Dumbledore, which was why i wrote the fanfic.

It's a fanfiction of a fanfiction, just incase that isn't clear.

Anyway, here is my fic:

linkffn(12518394)

and here is the original fanfic:

linkffn(11762850)

I've been told you don't need to read the original to understand my own, so yeah, read one or both, IDC.

  I'm a Weasley that made freinds with Harry Potter. Too bad I didn't know that being friends with Harry Potter was the first step towards being press-ganged into Voldemort's service. Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux recursive fanfiction, Self Insert.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
