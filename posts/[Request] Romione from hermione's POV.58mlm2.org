I'm looking good romione fics from Hermione's POV.

Anything from fifth year onward is preferred, when they're mature enough to be interesting. Canon compliant is also a bonus, though not a necessity.

Continuation fics would also be great.

(For example, I've read and I love Australia by MsBinns and Pinky Brown's work)


** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]] is a non-magical AU where "Harworts" is a school for superspies and skill and James Bond style superscience takes place of magic. It's told entirely from Hermione's point of view and has canon pairings.

linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) is about half Hermione's point of view.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11807757/1/In-Love-and-War][/In Love and War/]] by keeptheotherone, which is a canon-compliant continuation of the books. It switches point of view between Ron, Hermione, and Percy.

** linkffn(8103339) switches POVs but is probably the best Romione missing moments fic in the game. So many of these scenes have been done to death but these are some fresh, interesting takes. Definitely read it from the beginning - it covers all 7 years but the 6th year and on chapters are a lot longer and meatier.
