Just wondered. Seems like most of the posts here are rec requests and I wondered if my fic writing questions would be better posted elsewhere.


** This sub is an appreciation for all things Harry Potter FanFiction, whether that be writing or reading.

Of course, the ratio of readers to writers is heavily skewed towards the former, but every once in a while you'll see threads of aspiring writers looking for feedback or advice.

Feel free to pose your questions, it brings a nice variety to the sub.

** A lot of the sub's regulars are writers as well.

In addition to DLP WBA (which isn't for everyone), you might find joining the The Teachers Lounge on fanfiction.net for feedback on writing. They're a chill group of writers, good people in general.

** I'd second, or third or whatever, the recommendation for DarkLordPotter and our WBA (I'm staff there, full disclosure). It's not for posting questions about writing fics, but rather, posting your fic in question, either a scene, or scenes, or full chapters, and getting feedback on it. There are other areas of the forums to discuss ideas, if you'd like to brainstorm.

*** Yeah, requests are certainly drowning the sub. You know, because it's such a busy place and all. I certainly agree that it would be better to restrict the number of request posts. It's simply disgraceful that this sub has a dozen posts a day, we really need to get that in hand.

*** I have a tiny objection the "too lazy" part. There are 737k HP fics only on ff right now. I know we have search engines etc but 1. some requests' can't be searched. For example if i want a harry that uh let's say idk likes muffins. Nothing came to my mind. If it's not major enough i can't search with that. And 2. even if i have a type i want to read for example i want a good WBWL story, there are more than thousand of them, and i know this sub would rec the good ones. All these said i only request if what i'm looking for can't be searched and i would have to literally manually search through 737k fics. But yeah i agree on too many topics part.

***** Think I'll just go straight to my common room from now on. Folk here are great and usually helpful but there just isn't enough relevant stuff to writing to be a regular draw unless you're a reader first and a writer second (which is not a criticism, just an observation). Perhaps my house mods will let me start a weekly writer's thread in the common room to brainstorm and trade WIPs for feedback or something similar.

** There's this subreddit, which is more a gathering place for HP fanfic readers to find stories and discuss fanfiction and the HP universe.

For writing, you can go to [[/r/writing]] or the new [[/r/WriteWorld]]. Especially the latter is for discussing writing. It's not focused on fanfiction or Harry Potter, but you can chat a bit about how your writing is going.

*** I could, but I think fan fiction is really its own genre now, with tropes and conventions and even formatting unique to it. So while some of the standard chestnuts (Show don't tell!) apply many others do not.

That's before you factor in looking for discussions regarding ideas within canon or fanon and everything else related directly to fandom.

I appreciate the suggestions though :) Thank-you.

** I find this seems to be more skewed to reading requests and conversations about stories that people read, but there are some discussions. It's interesting to hear from a reader's perspective too.

I'm also a member of Diagon Alley II on ffnet if you'd like to check us out. The idea is to help each other with writing and there's review games for people to leave each other feedback and a discussion thread where people sometimes post for help, along with writing challenges and other threads.
