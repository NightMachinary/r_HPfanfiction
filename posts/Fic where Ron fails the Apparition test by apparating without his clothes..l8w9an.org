:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
That's the only scene I remember from it. It wasn't a Ron bashing fic but he did play a bit of a comic relief in the story. Also one of the main plots is Voldemort often being compared to Satan as he gradually possess Harry and the tension between Ron and Hermione was so strong that whenever they interact, people just leave the two alone.

Edit: Oh, I also remembered it's a fic set over multiple years (sixth, seventh and a few after) and Dumbledore retires because of an unknown illness, while the sorting hat refuses to sort students anymore unless they learn inter-house cooperation so Snape and McGonagall resort to doing personality tests in order to sort the new students and a bunch of Muggleborns end up in Slytherin.

***** Found it, it's called Harry Potter and the Rise of the Dark Lord by LogicalRaven. It's in fact a trilogy (sixth year, seventh year and the aftermath of war) and it was written pre-HBP

******* I honestly don't remember... I read that fic like in 2004 or something but if I had to guess it would be in the first few because Harry reunites with the Weasleys quite late into the summer.

******* skimming through it now it seems pretty shitty writing but I suppose 11 year old me had looser standards... and apparently it's not his test that Ron fails that way. It's just an accident while practicing to apparate.
