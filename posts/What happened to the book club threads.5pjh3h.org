Just curious. I thought it was a great way to discuss fics. Any chance of starting that up again?


** In future, please use only COMPLETED stories.

You can't really judge a story if it's not complete.

*** I agree with you, though it seems to be an unpopular view on here. A good start doesn't make a good story (I think anyone can write a good start) but a bad ending can ruin one.

**** I like that idea. I'd also like to have at least one fic of each theme being a completed story. I can't stand an abandoned fic. I rarely read them because I dislike them so much, which means that I won't read many "jewels" of the community .

***** Why don't you like them? Abandonned fics are the best.

****** Because there's no ending or resolution. Its like watching only half or three quarters of a movie. I want to know how it ends!

******* I used to be like that but I'm almost always disappointed by the endings so I now don't worry if the story has them or not.

******** I guess my needs are much simpler than most. I don't have any high expectations of a story so as long as its complete I'll usually read it.

********* I think the book club should stick to completed stories. Until it's finished, you can't really judge it.

********** That is a very good point. I've read many fics that start strong and end weak.
