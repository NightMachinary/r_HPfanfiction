I'm not saying cannon!harry is stupid but he isn't really the brightest. Does anyone know any fics where he /is/ the brightest?

EDIT: And yes, I've read HPMoR.

Only Harry isn't Harry - he is a she.

If you like reading about magical theory and magical history, if you're the kind of person who reads the books in Skyrim, you'll probably like this fic.

** I can't believe no one has yet linked Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived]]

It's an academic Harry that makes every other "smart Harry" look like dumb brutes. But at the same time, Santi writes with moderation, and you never feel that his level of intelligence is ridiculous or unrealistic.

The FF.net version has 11 chapters. There's a hell of a lot more in DLP's WBA section.

** Hm...

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2358016/1/This_Means_War][This Means War!]] maybe?

Kinda a romantic comedy that morphs into action/adventure, I'd say. Parts with canon after book 5, I'd say? Starts off with prank wars that snowball into bigger stuff. Uses the wonderful M-Mail system that sometimes pops around (wizard email, essentially).

Edit- Let's try this again: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/1__Surprise_Snog/][This Means War!]]

** Try the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving_Connor][Sacrifices arc]] (links to 1 of 7, all 7 are completed). Harry is at least smart and powerful, even if you want to beat him over the head for not always learning from his mistakes. Eventual HP/DM.

I've been working my way through this for about a month. My favorite parts are the pureblood dances... Worth reading for the detail and awesomeness the author creates for the dances alone.

*** Sacrifices Harry starts off extremely one-sided and boring, but he gets somewhat intelligent and things get interesting around the third book. Lightning should also be commended for writing probably the only complete AU septology.

Environment and setting (those pureblood rituals are insanely detailed and thought-out) are pluses, constant emotional breakdowns and unintelligent self-sacrificial morals, not so much.

*** I'm only on chapter 8, and having just read his right and wrong spiel after making a bunch of teenagers sign their magic away should any situation arise where they have to help the dark lord (such as a family member being taken hostage, etc) I really feel that that sense of morality is not something most people will agree with.

What he's basically doing is any time there's ever a threat, all you have to do is make every single magical wizard in the country sign a contract. Anyone who doesn't sign it is obviously evil and therefore arrested.

It's just a really horrible thought/system (and abuse will happen instantly (just put lots of secret clauses in like he did and you have every wizard as your slave), and it bothers me that he'd start by having a 15 year old sign away her magic and life so she can take down a bothersome teacher.

**** You never said anything about laudable morals. Fanfiction authors (even the good ones) tend to be susceptible to not being age-appropriate with their characterisations.

I just liked the way they examined the physical basis for magic.

I should note that I haven't read it in several years, so I can't address your hypothetical about signing away the magic of every wizard in England, but I will say it doesn't sound like a consistent extension of what I remember happening in the fic.

Of course, but the implication is that HP isn't Lord Voldie reincarnate. Indeed, if the compulsion contract could do that then Lord Voldie should just make all his followers sign a contract that says if they spy on him they lose their magic.

So I'm really unhappy about it's inclusion, because there's no way it can exist without it being abused by someone else and I doubt that's going to retroactively be added. It's just a huge oversight to include something that basically is:

If you sign this, if you don't do X you will die.

If you don't sign it, you are an enemy and we will kill you.

The prospects of abuse for that system is unbelievable, and the obvious implication is that Harry would have no problem making everyone sign one (but you say he doesn't do that and that's a serious inconsistency) and they'll also have to justify why Lord V never thought of it.

Well the idea is there, I assume the writer wouldn't follow it because it's pretty obviously not a morally right thing to do.

******* No, because even if I am okay with the War Mage's right and wrong happening to be okay with that kind of contract, then it still is an issue that it's never used by anyone else.

If you don't mind morally doing something like that, then you should have every single person in the wizarding world sign it.

Harry on his own, single-handedly by making them SIGN THEIR NAME removed every member of the houses bar Slytherin from ever working with Voldermort. Even in the even where V won they still would lose their magic and then die just by working with him.

And even assuming that Harry for some reason only is okay with doing it to school children and not the wizarding world at large, Voldermort certainly won't have that kind of moral obligation. If compulsion contracts really existed then he would have used them to make sure that no death eater can spy on him, and also make anyone they capture obey him completely or die.
