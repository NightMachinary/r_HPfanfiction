So after a short and decisive battle with AutoModerator and the site's CSS, [[/u/denarii]] and I fixed the automatic flairing of posts.

The tags available are currently:

#+begin_quote
  [Discussion]

  [Request]

  [Suggestion]

  [Meta]

  [Misc]

  [Promo] or [Promotion]
#+end_quote

They can be written as either =[tag]= or =tag:= in the post title. In addition, mentioning "LF" or "Looking for" anywhere in the title will automatically mark it as a request.

NSFW anywhere in the title will also mark the post as NSFW.


** Good job. :)
