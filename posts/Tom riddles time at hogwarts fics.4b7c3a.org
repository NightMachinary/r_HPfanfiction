Does anybody know of any fanfiction based on Tom riddles time at hogwarts? Absolutely NO time travel OR different dimensions OR odd pairings. I Just want a canon compliant account of Toms rise to power within Hogwarts. Iv recently read "Tom Riddles School Days" and it was great, but has left me wanting more but all I can find online are alternate universes that simply do not do it for me.


** linkffn(The Dark Lord Exposed) linkffn(Little Differences) linkffn(All Roads Lead to Rome) linkffn(Ladies Man) linkffn(Witchcraft by a Picture) linkffn(The Broken Victory)

Just to let you know, I haven't read any of these yet but I did a quick check to see if they were focused/took place during Tom's schooling. I'm sorry if these aren't quite what you were looking for, but I hope that you can find something that you like.

******* Tom stood still on the moderately busy London side street. He had followed Dumbledores directions precisely and was now looking up and down the road for a building he had been told would not be visible to anyone but him. After a couple of glances each way Tom scowled, he thought back to his meeting with the old man. He had mentioned the name was The Leaky Cauldron.

No sooner had he finished this train of thought, a small, very ancient looking building straight opposite Tom suddenly began to appear, pushing the two either side of it out of the way! Nobody seemed to have seen a thing and people were still walking straight passed, apparently oblivious to this apparition.

Amazed, Tom crossed the road and read the sign above the black, chipped paint door. This was it, he had found it! Tom put his hand on the door and pushed it open, not knowing what was to be expected on the other side. He knew it was a pub of course, but Tom hadn't been in one before. Especially not a magical one.

He stepped inside. As the door closed loudly behind him he tried to look around but it took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the semi darkness of the place. As the pub became more visible, Tom realised everyone had paused to look at him. He simply glanced back for a moment and after a few seconds passed, chatter resumed as people decided the knew arrival wasn't a friend or family member of theirs.

Tom made his way slowly towards the bar. Glancing as he did so at the various groups of people he passed. Some were extremely old, others weren't nearly so. Most were dressed in long cloaks of different colours and textures, a select few were dressed quite as oddly as Dumbledore had been.

Tom reached the bar and continued to look around. He noticed a couple of older men, both with thick grey beards and a long pipe protruding from their mouths. Toms eyes were focused on the smoke. It was strange, it didn't seem to be following a breeze or moving with the air at all. Instead, it seemed to be rising a lot more slowly and deliberately. The difference was quite subtle but Tom noticed it just the same.

His attention switched to a small group of older boys, stood in a circle not too far from him. "I was made captain this year and a prefect." said a boy with his back turned to Tom. He was wearing a very dark, rich green robe. "I'm the only fifth year in 150 years to receive the honor!" His voice carried across the pub, causing a majority to glance in his direction.

Another boy in the group, slightly shorter than the first cheered, grabbing his friend by the shoulder. Tom could see this boy clearly because this one was facing in his direction. He was dark, bald and wearing an unnaturally black cloak. As he pulled his friend into a boisterous hug, he spotted Tom at the bar looking at them.

He looked Tom up and down, his eyes narrowed. Looking back at the first boy, he nodded in his direction. The group turned slowly. Tom counted four boys and a girl now that he could see all their faces. They all looked much older than himself. As he held their gaze, they began to make their way over.

Within a short few strides the group stood directly in front of Tom. "Orion Black." Said the boy with dark green robes, holding out his hand for Toms. "Tom Riddle." Replied Tom, accepting the handshake. Orion was tall with bright grey eyes and black hair brushed neatly backwards, not quite reaching his shoulders. Two badges gleamed on his chest. "Riddle? I don't know any Riddles, how about you Sis?" The girl looked Tom up and down. She looked very similar to her brother. Tom thought they might be twins. The girl smirked. "No, can't say I do." She replied slowly. "I'm guessing you're a first year, am I right?" She added.

After a couple moments, Tom nodded. "And you are?" He said softly. He was starting to feel uncomfortable with the way they looked at him. Like they were birds of prey looking upon a small rodent. The girls small smirk split into a grin, which showed off four shiny silver teeth. "Walburga Black, heard the name before have you...Black?" "No." Replied Tom simply. His sense of foreboding creeping up every second spent in their company. "Not too worry sweetie, I didn't expect you had." She leaned forward, until her nose was mere inches from Toms.

She spoke again but this time her voice was lowered "In fact, I expect an ickle baby mudblood like yourself to know exceptionally little about anything." Tom stared unblinking into Wulpurgas bright grey eyes, so much like her brothers. He began imagining ways he would dim them... However, Tom knew he would be no match for these obviously trained, older students...yet.

Tom took a step forward so that Wulpurga was forced to stumble backwards slightly. "I'm not seeking any trouble from you, I'm actually late for an appointment with the landlord." This was a lie, of course he had no such set appointment. But he wanted to appear less alone. Surely that was the real reason they had picked him out of a crowd.

The bald boy in deep black robes scanned behind the bar. "If you were waiting for him here, it would seem he is also late." He said, looking back at Tom. "I imagine you can spare us an extra few minutes, eh mudblood?" He finished silkily. The others smiled appreciatively. "What do you mean by mudblood" Tom retorted defiantly. Orions hand slipped inside his robe and pulled out very slowly, a long and thin piece of wood. Tom knew what it was because he had seen Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire with a similar looking instrument.

He stepped closer to Tom and very discreetly, aimed the wand into his ribs. "Do you know what I despise most about your kind Tom? He whispered. "You all reek of weakness. You reek of your worthless muggle parents and your worthless muggle values. You come into our world and you infect us with your filthy opinions and your filthy blood." He spat.

Tom had no idea why his lack of magical heritage offended them so much but found that right now he didn't much care for why's or who's. He just wanted to get away from them but as far as he could tell, he was trapped. He could always shout for help. But nobody had ever bothered to help him before and in any case, the thought of asking for aid was repugnant.

Suddenly, he felt a surge of recklessness as he grabbed hold of the wand poking into his side and bent it with all his might. Before Orion could respond in any way, Tom felt the wand splinter in his palm followed by a satisfying crack. At the same time a sharp burning pain shot through his hand which made him let go and recoil backwards. Orion seemed to have felt something similar for he had also leaped back and had let out a yell of pain. Wulpurga and the others all drew their wands at once and pointed them at Tom. It was Wulpurga who acted first.

"Depulso!" She shrieked. A white bolt of white light shot towards Tom, hitting him square in the chest. He flew backwards along side the length of the bar. Where he should have flew back into a wall or some other customers, instead he felt a kind of cushioning feeling in his back. Within a few seconds he had slowed down in mid air and was able to catch his legs underneath him and attempted to stable himself.

He had barely managed to when the dark, bald boy shouted. "Repugno!" This time an electric blue light flew at Tom. Before he could do anything to react, a large circular mass appeared in front of him and blocked the spell, which then ricochet into the many bottles behind the bar, causing them to explode in all directions around the pub. Tom and everybody else ducked to avoid the glass. As he looked up, a tall figure wearing robes of bright purple stood in front of him with his back turned, facing Toms attackers. "Enough!" Bellowed the figure. "But Sir, the boy broke Orions wand sir!"

There was a loud bang and then an unmistakable shriek of pain. "Wands away now!" Yelled the figure. His command must have been quickly obliged because he turned now to Tom. The man was quite round and was sporting a huge, bushy moustache. He offered his hand to help Tom up.
