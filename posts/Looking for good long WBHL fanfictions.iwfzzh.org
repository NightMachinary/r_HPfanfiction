Anything over 100,000 words would be most appreciated. I'm fine with anything along as there is no slash.

**** Well, there is obviously linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) but you've probably read it. There is also linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) It was started early this year and is already over 300k words. It is excellent!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

****** It's not. I am a huge fan of PoS, and it is not a rip off. It does use a similar mind magic system and Lockhart is competent (though I'm 99% sure he's not an imposter at all) but not a rip off at all.

The first few chapters obviously seem similar. 90% of WBWL stories have the same (ish) first three or four chapters. PoS is no exception. It is my favourite story on the site, but TSM himself adits the first few chapters are not at all original. That's just a WBWL thing. Not so much an Ashes of Chaos thing.

AoC has original characters which make it interesting, as well as a super cool dynamic between Harry and Voldemort. And a very well thought out magical theory system that I find super fun to read. The author hasn't gone super in-depth about it yet, but every time it comes up, it's a highlight for me.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
