** This is the written part of a humorous one-shot I have been working on for some time. It's neither polished nor properly formatted for Reddit.

.

Nymphadora Tonks walked down the mobile stairs, straight onto the hot apron of the Airport of Gran Canaria. Even with the trade winds, which made the final approach a lot more a beater drill back at Hogwarts, continuously blowing cool air over the asphalted ground the heat was unbearable and the young witch lamented that the waiting bus did not had a working air conditioner. Or that there were too many people around to apply a cooling charm. Even the cramped Airbus managed to cool down its close to two hundred passengers to pleasant 18 degrees.

Sure, sitting still for more than four hours while the plane carried her from the rains of Gatwick to the burning sun of the Canary Islands was not the most comfortable form of travelling but was still leagues better than an international Portkey trip, or even worse, trying to cross 1800 miles through the Floo network. The furthest she ever went had been the six hundred miles from Hogsmeade to her parent's home north of London but even that had been more than enough for Tonks' tastes. Thanks to the airplane enthusiast she called dad, this had been far from her first experience with flying without magic and therefore nothing but a mild inconvenience. The metamorph still fondly recalled the shocked expression of her friend Ashley when the pureblood thought that the Concorde was a muggle time machine because the arrival time was before its departure from Heathrow.

While the shuttle bus waited for the remaining passengers she couldn't stop herself from once again laughing about the reason for her improvised vacation. Harry Potter had gone missing shortly after a Dementor attack. The Minister had gone completely mad and spit out a raving rant that would have left even her mad aunt blushing with envy. And while the magical government of Britain finished its descent into insanity, everyone else tried to find the missing boy, be it out of worry or to cash in the fat bounty on his head. As the latest member of Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix she had drawn the tedious duty to investigate a rumoured sighting on a remote Spanish colony, or at least that's what they told her. Once Tonks learned that the “remote colony” was in fact a bustling tourist location she promptly took two weeks off from her work in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and told her former headmaster that she'd conduct a thorough search on the entire island. The old man praised her diligence and willingness to make sacrifices and Tonks had to use all of her metamorphic ability to stop herself from laughing. It had been a hard battle, but in the end she not only won but talked into Albus paying for the trip. And using muggle transportation to avoid alarming anybody was certainly not a chore if she considered the alternatives.

Now, Tonks would be nothing but diligent, a thorough examination of the most likely spots already planned. Should Harry, against all her expectations, had somehow managed to get onto this island, he would had to have a fake ID. The Potters had been well off and there were exactly two kinds of places a fifteen year old boy with de facto unlimited money and a forged ID would visit, the beaches and the nightclubs. And being a skilled investigator Tonks deducted that she would have to begin her search at the likeliest place and that going undercover would yield the best results. In the end, this whole order business did not seem bad at all.

Three days passed and the investigation of the nearest beaches turned out to be fruitless. After a close call with sunburn the Auror concluded that Harry Potter was nowhere near the airport and that she needed better sunscreen. The magical lotion she had been using had been produced for the occasional warm day in Britain, not the subtropical inferno above her.

And so Tonks found herself in Las Palmas, the island's capital, enjoying a delightfully cold coffee while the sun slowly climbed higher. Her spot in a small cafe overlooked the harbour and made it easy to watch the enormous ferries and gigantic cruise liners as they came and went. Her intelligence briefing, courtesy of Dumont, mentioned three climate zones but experiencing a desert changing into English rain within an hour of driving was something no book could properly convey, not even the travel guide. It was a sobering thought how many wonders, both great and small, were spread across the globe. It was enough to spend a lifetime travelling and yet never see all. Due to her sudden inspiration the witch decided to forgo drinking and dancing for this day and see if there were any tours which took vacationers like her to interesting places. After all, you never knew where Harry Potter was hiding.

A waiter explained the way to the next travel agency as she settled her bill and a short walk later big signs promoted over a dozen different adventures, from swimming with dolphins to hikes through the countryside.

“Can't decide what to do?”

Tonks spun around, expecting that the sing-song voice belonged to an employee eager to talk her ear off. Instead she came face to face with a young woman wearing a backpack bigger than her own suitcase. Her curly hair was an interesting mixture of green and black which would be challenging to copy, even with metamorphic abilities.

“How did ya know that I speak English?”

“I think ‘s obvious.”

Looking at her clothes the Auror realised that she had, once again, made a fool out of herself. “Completely forgot about that.”

“Not a fan then?” the stranger asked, pointing at the English football Jersey Tonks was wearing.

“Not really, only my mum trying to be funny. Dad's nickname is Ted and there was one incident when I was five and called him Teddy. Mum never lets me forget about it and thought it hilarious if I had Teddy Sheringham's name on my shirt. And since most of my stuff is black I just grabbed the first white shirt I could find.”

“Your mum is odd.”

“That's what I've been saying for the last two decades. I mean, she's just trying to be a joker but you run into one business dinner and she won't let you hear the end of it.”

Apparently that was the wrong thing to say as the other woman first giggled and then burst into laughter.

“Sorry, but I'm just imagining a mafia gathering, dark room filled with smoke, and suddenly a cute little girl with purple hair and a fairy dress runs to the godfather, calling him Teddy.”

“I did not wear a fairy dress, ever. And no one was smoking.”

“But your dad is the godfather?”

“I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.”

After another round of laughter which followed this deadpan reply the woman introduced herself as Gwen Evans. “I heard that ‘s rude to laugh at people without knowing their name and you wouldn't want me to be rude, right?”

“Name ‘s Tonks, Dora Tonks.”

“Well Miss 007, I take you work for MI6 then.”

“MI5 actually,” the Auror replied. It was their official cover story and the department even had handed out matching badges in case any Muggle would demand to see them.

“They allowed you to have purple hair for this?” Gwen wanted to know after examining the badge. Tonks froze for a second because she had forgotten that the picture on her ID was charmed to always look like her.

“Yeah, I know the guy who issues these. And usually people have bigger problems when they see this.”

“Say Dora, you want to do something awesome?

“What 'ya have in mind?”

“There are these coach tours that go across the island and show you the best spots. I did one of them on Lanzarote last week and it was awesome. There was this huge lava field and they played some classical music while driving through it. The landscape there looks like the moon out there and when they played the Star Wars theme I had shivers running down my spine.”

“Are you sure you're not trying to sell me something? Because it's working.”

And so Tonks found herself in a coach with her new friend, driving to banana plantations, old villages and onto the island's tallest mountain while a guide told stories about Gran Canaria. There were no lava fields accompanied by music, but the company made more than up for it. Gwen, a second year at Cardiff University, had been backpacking across Europe for the last month, taking advantage of her father's fortune to see places she only ever heard of instead of going on ”that bloody cruise with all the boring rich people only interested in stuffing their faces and their pissing contests who's got the largest...fortune.”

They spent hours talking about their lives, slightly edited on Tonks' part. Stinging hexes became electric shocks and Moody had fought the Argentinians on the Falklands, not Death Eaters in Diagon Alley. But there were more than enough stories devoid of magic, like her cousin Mel talking her into joining Norwich City's youth squad. The Welsh woman told stories from her architecture studies in return.

By the time the bus made its way to the southern end of the island the outdoor temperature once again crossed the thirty-degree mark and not a single cloud was in sight. Since the largest dunes in Europe were a sight to behold, Tonks did not object to ditching the tour and continuing her investigation into Harry Potter's location on foot while her friend prattled on about the towns surrounding the dunes. One of them was called Playa de Ingles, the Englishman's beach and it sounded like a place the wayward wizard might visit. The outstanding local nightlife had of course no influence on where the valiant Auror chose to investigate.

***** Well, kind of what you've got is giant blocks of not very interesting text. Harry Potter being missing is just told in a way that indicates it's not important to the story. If it's not important, then why have that giant block of text that starts with "while the shuttle bus..."? It's a bit difficult to figure out what the story is about with the way you've presented it and there are no interactions with another character until halfway through. Why not pick it up when she meets the Welsh woman? All of that exposition can be easily dealt with with a bit of dialog.

Start with the "Can't decide what to do?" and go from there. The Miss 007 is a perfect opportunity to get the reason why Tonks is there out of the way.

“Well Miss 007, I take you work for MI6 then.”

"MI5, actually. I'm here to track down a rich kid that's done a runner."

"Oh, an /important/ rich kid then? You don't usually hear about MI5 trying to track down Paris Hilton when she's gotten into a strop."

Tonks grinned, remembering the hue and cry that had gone up from various quarters once Harry hadn't shown up for the Hogwarts Express on September first. Sensing the opportunity for a bit of a holiday, she'd been the first to volunteer to go hunting for him. So far, he'd resisted her efforts to locate him. /Guess I'll have to move on to Ibiza next./ "Well, this rich kid is a bit more connected than your average spoiled heiress," Tonks said, giving her new friend an insouciant shrug.

And then you're off. You've got the reason for Tonks being in the Canary Islands without giant blocks of exposition. Is the fact that Tonks traveled there in a plane important? If not, why even mention it? It seems to me that the meat of the story is her meeting this woman and going on adventures and that beginning just really slows it down.

It was meant as a humorous way to point out the absurdity of Tonks assignment with not even her believing that Harry would be there and basically treating it as a vacation.

Actually, the story is supposed to be a short fic which aims to make the readers laugh at some light-hearted jokes. It's supposed to have a humorous narrator that edges the line between telling a story and mocking it.

My envisioned end has Tonks showing up at King's Cross with Harry on September first and everyone is like "You found him? Why didn't you tell us or bring him here?"

"Well, I sent a postcard since I wasn't supposed to use magic and I had no legal authority to actually take Harry somewhere, so I just made sure he had /protection/." *wink*

*** Personally, I don't think the exposition is too much for a full-length chapter. If we got to see the whole thing, I think it would flow well enough. It was an interesting start, but I didn't get a good feel for where it was going (unless "Gwen Evans" was secretly Harry in disguise somehow). A little more development could make it work, though.

**** Nah, she's just a random Muggle with one of Britain's most common last names (although come to think of it, it makes a good red herring). She was never intended as a love interest, but maybe a holiday fling (I am undecided on the matter).

The general idea was to Tonks to go on a morning run along the beach (which is a common thing in Playa de Ingles) and get hooked on Fleur's allure, only to find out that she is with Harry, both completely oblivious to the chaos they had caused in Britain. While "undying love"^{^{TM}} between them would be unbelievable at this point, a teenage romance (based more on lust and boredom rather than deep emotions) shouldn't be too far fetched.

** I've managed to write 11 complete chapters for 6 such stories over the years. I could do the Google Doc thing, but now I'm wondering if it would make sense to post one of those plot bunny anthologies that some people have.

Edit: Since you asked, I finally had time to make the Google Docs. Most of these are my early work and unedited, so expect mistakes. In chronological order, as best I can remember:

- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDyDwCcWmg6phb8qN2921TkaNKp5OX_T2cKzsMgn2eo/edit?usp=sharing][Untitled Time Travel Fic]]. This would have been pretty cliche except for the Basilisk acting like a real person whom Harry had to befriend and convince to come around to his side. I dropped it when I realized /A Little Child Shall Lead Them/ was a better idea.
- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgQo82V1hlmbR0IZ5pVYLNnQi6fUgD1vB1LsMcETfFY/edit?usp=sharing][Forged in Fire]]. My attempt at a Harry/Hermione soul bond. Also would have been very cliche.
- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gOc8AnESisSbH--zw27riRpqp_t8QM6ISQRRPMYJxQ0/edit?usp=sharing][The Brothers Gaunt]]. The other horcruxes wake up after CoS, and all of them get new bodies, resulting in a bunch of Tom Riddles trying to plot around each other.
- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uKi_-4H0Awe9TlKGujX_WVMmD7OUUqBeYTU8sdtDu6A/edit?usp=sharing][Ferte in Noctem Animam Meam]]. Dumbledore genuinely believes Harry has to die from the start and actually acts rational about it. It would have involved Harry being raised similar to a child with a terminal illness and being very surprised when he survived at the end (if he survived).
- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NeiDP-4uLYZ_DbcU6Efiu-_4Z_PMKmPm5S6RQ_GpHSs/edit?usp=sharing][Strange and Dangerous]]. An Obscurial!Harry fic, although I started it before /Fantastic Beasts/ came out. I dropped it because I couldn't figure out how to fit the Scamanders into the Big Sis!Tonks story I had planned.
- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14hUSlCmSHYyP8TlPwzc21LR71LGTBxXsre06EYxWdAg/edit?usp=sharing][Untitled Super!Harry Parody]]. Harry reads one of Ginny's Harry Potter books, and it's basically every Super!Harry cliche. I could never figure out how a plot that made sense, though, and I later discovered that linkffn(8553100), though incomplete, did it better than I ever could.

**** The problem is that the plot didn't really make sense. Most of the good scenes were toward the end and would have made it far too much of a canon rehash. I never planned out what the story would logically look like from the start. For example, Dumbledore would make a serious effort to destroy the horcruxes as quickly as possible, but also to delay Voldemort's return as long as possible for Harry's sake. I didn't have enough of that to really build a good story.

** Here's a bit of a Teddy story I'll eventually get around to:

I smiled as I turned the corner, my favorite coffee shop coming into view. The bell over the door tinkled merrily and I looked toward the counter to see if my favorite barista was there. Shauna was a whirling dervish behind the giant espresso machine, stepping lightly around the other busy workers as she efficiently assembled mochas, lattes and cappuccinos for sleepy San Franciscans in need of their morning caffeine.

I got in the long queue, resigned to my fate. There were other, mass-market coffee places, but this one roasted their own fair-trade, ethically sourced beans and ... God, who am I kidding? It's Shauna. I watched her brown curls bounce as she bopped around to her own music, deftly ejecting steam from the espresso machine and wiping it down.

Pulling out my phone, I scrolled through my messages while keeping an eye on Shauna underneath my fringe, waiting to see if she'd notice me in the queue. I was about three people away from ordering when I saw her notice me. She grinned and waved, my heart thumping just a little harder at her bright brown eyes and beautiful smile.

“Morning, Josh,” I said to the young man behind the register.

“Hey, T-dizzle! The usual? I think Shauna's already got it made.”

“Yeah, thanks.” I tapped my card on the terminal, still mildly amazed at the things Muggles came up with to make their lives easier. I moved down to the pickup area, grinning at the cup with my name written on it. Shauna had gone the extra mile, surrounding my name with stars and little music notes.

I took a sip, savoring the rich taste of the flat white coffee. “Perfect as always,” I said as Shauna continued her dancing behind the counter.

“I know how upset you get if it's not just right,” she said, setting down another drink on the pick up bar and calling out for David.

“It's a good thing you always make it just right then, isn't it?” I put on a mock scowl. “You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.”

Shauna paused in her espresso ballet, fixing me with a lifted eyebrow and a skeptical look. “As if you could ever get angry. You computer programmers are all the same.” She mimed furious typing at a keyboard and he shook his head. /If you only knew what I really do,/ I thought.

“Well, we're not all the same, you know.” Shauna rolled her eyes and went back to expertly manipulating the machine.

“Uh huh.” She glanced toward the line that stretched almost to the door, full of young men staring down at the devices in their hands. I cleared my throat and put my phone away in my pocket.

“So, what are you doing at the weekend?” I asked, hoping that maybe this would be the time she took me up on my invitation.

“Hmm, I thought I might get a pedicure. Coming up on sandal season. And I should really go see my folks down in San Mateo. I talked to my dad yesterday and he's got a few things he could use help with around the house.” She set down another drink, calling for Christopher this time.

“Doesn't hanging out with your favorite programmer sound more interesting?” I carefully enhanced the blue of my eyes, just enough to look more enticing, but not enough to make her suspicious. “I have a much more interesting accent, you have to admit.”

“Please, this town is awash in accents. Yours is a dime a dozen.”

I placed a hand over my heart and gave her a shocked look. “Shauna. I'm wounded.”

She glanced at the clock. “You're late is what you are. You'd better get going. Don't want to lose your cushy gig and be stuck pulling espresso like me.”

I straightened up, realizing she was right. I had morning briefing in ten minutes. “Well, hopefully I've given you something to think about, yeah?”

“You always do.” I turned to walk away, turning back when she called to me. “Here, I can't let you go out on coffee alone,” she said, handing me a small paper bag.

Peeking inside, the buttery scent of a fresh croissant assailed my nostrils. “Ooh, croissant. What do I owe you?”

“Nothing. On the house.”

“You sure?”

“Of course. You're my favorite programmer, remember?” She winked at me again and resolutely turned away, thumping the filter hard to empty it.

Whenever I read a cleark say "you're my favorite..." my mind immediately goes to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JhnigAQmd8]["The Room"]] :D

In any case, obviously there isn't a lot to judge yet, but I can say that I immensely enjoyed how you kept painting Teddy and Shanta, or rather, the relationship between them. The coffee shop scene made a few things about them clear. They're affectionate, but keeping a distance. They like each other, and only one tries to take the next step, while the other doesn't really say "No", but doesn't say "Yes" either. She keeps him in a bit of a limbo, and I do enjoy the uncertainty that creates. It makes me root for Teddy to go back there again and try again.

In this story, Teddy is in his early twenties and an Auror. The meeting he's almost late to is the daily briefing. I'm glad you liked their interaction. In my mind, Shauna is the cute barista that gets hit on a lot, but manages to not seem too annoyed by it because tips, but she has a genuine soft spot for Teddy. Because who doesn't, right?

Seeing him functioning competently in the muggle world is interesting enough, but for a magical-raised boy to be able to code professionally, there's got to be an interesting story there.

**** Teddy is definitely not a programmer--he's an Auror. As to San Francisco, I have a whole [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][Potterverse]] where Harry and Ginny have pulled up stakes and decamped for SF where they have many adventures. Harry teaches Defense at a fancy wizarding school up in the Berkeley hills and brought Teddy to stay with them and go to school there.

The stories take place in the modern day, and I figure that modern witches and wizards living in the City would take advantage of Muggle technology readily available to them because why not? Also, in my mind, Harry is a bit of a gadget geek due to growing up around technology but not really being able to use it because it was all Dudley's.

** WELL, um, okay, here's a sort of random collection of a few scenes from a story in my ideas folder. They're not really thought out, because my IDEAS folder is for me to write down specific scenes or general ideas when they come to me that I will use and fully flesh out LATER. :( So sorry if it's incoherent or bare bones or whatever!

The point of this story is to be a Hogwarts era fic, with a girl Harry, and it will be something of a canon rehash but I'll do my best to make it interesting and different in a lot of other ways. :) It's only going to go from year 1 to year 6's end, though...because of those differences... :)

The story's main idea is that the Horcrux inside her took much more of a root or hold than it ever did in canon. So it REALLY influences her in so many ways. :)

"I know this is all a lot to take in, Sadie, but yer ARE a witch. Now how 'bout yah read tha' letter of yers, eh? Bout time yeh did, I reckon. Whaddya say?"

"She doesn't SAY anything!" Petunia shrilled. "That- that FREAK hasn't said a word since the day we took her in! She never even cried as a baby! And her eyes...when she's not wearing that ridiculous thing on her face...trying to HIDE her freakishness..."

Sadie looked between her relatives and the giant man. Hagrid. A wizard. And she was a witch? She felt joy. Wonder. She opened her Hogwarts envelope with a smile, and she silently read the letter over. A list of supplies. Pets? A wand? A reply due by August 30th? She was to go to Platform 9 3/4 on September 1st?

A strange feeling of familiarity coursed through her. Deja Vu. Like she had read this before. Experienced this situation before.

Sadie shook her head, brushed her hair behind her ear. She smiled up at Hagrid, held the letter tight to her chest.

--------------

"Sadie, did they hurt yeh ever?"

Hagrid's question as they were on the boat shocked her.

Sadie startled, looked at him. She hesitated. Looked at the ocean. Nodded.

"Alrigh'." Hagrid sighed heavily. "Dumbledore was hopin' you'd answer that different, but...guess it's not a suprise, the kind o' muggles they are. M' sorry, Sadie. Whatever they did to yeh over the years, M' sorry. Dumbledore's gonna fix tha' for yeh, though. Great man, Dumbledore. We'll talk to ter Ministry, get them muggles the full punishment o' the law. An' get yer into a nice home. A safe home. I promise yeh, yer won't get hurt ever again, Sadie."

Sadie, of course, was silent. She stared out at the ocean harder. Reached up to wipe her eye of blurry vision. Readjust her eyepatch.

"They do that ter yeh?" Hagrid indicated her eyepatch, looking angry and upset.

Sadie shook her head. How could she explain this? Maybe just...show it? Hesitantly, she reached up and pulled her eyepatch aside to reveal the eye beneath. The glittering, ruby eye.

Hagrid reared back, almost fell off the boat. He stared at her with a scared expression. Then he calmed. "Dumbledore said yeh might've...might've developed some side effects from the...that night. Bein' touched by the darkest of magics, an' living like you did, course nobody coulda expected yeh to come outta it without any problems. Like tha' scar of yers, too. It's famous in our world. Yer eye though...prolly be best to keep hidin' it, M' sorry. It's a mark o' a dark mage, a show of dark magic corruption. Least, when it's done deliberately. Yeh just have it from an accident, I know tha', it ain't yer fault at all. It was...You Know Who's fault for...directin' so dark o' magic at an innocent little baby."

Sadie pulled her eyepatch back into place. She sighed, leaned over the side of the boat and dipped a hand into the cold water of ocean. She swirled it around, made a few splashes.

So it seemed she was a freak even among freaks.

--------------

Sadie sat with the girl on the train. Daphne, large and yellow-blond haired. Her nose was a button. Sadie thought she was pretty, real pretty. Daphne didn't seem to think so. She didn't seem to think much of anything, actually; she was real quiet and shy, withdrawn physically as much as mentally. The few words she'd spoken to Sadie were words of admiration, and then she had gone on a half-hearted muttering tirade about herself and how she was so ugly and fat, and how she could never compare to the great, beautiful heroine and savior that Sadie was, and how all those stories about her...on and on, until she'd just fallen into total silence and gotten back to her book.

To Sadie's relief. Sure, Daphne was pretty, and seemed nice enough, but Sadie hadn't asked the girl for her whole life story, or all the reasons why her life was so horrible - as if she could even outdo Sadie on that front! She hadn't asked her for ANYTHING - but she had gotten all that anyway. Now Sadie was just annoyed with Daphne.

Sadie took out her own schoolbooks and started refreshing herself on potions stuff. Hagrid had told her about a Professor Snape, and how the man had been her mother's friend at Hogwarts. He taught Potions and was Head of Slytherin. Sadie wanted to impress this professor. She'd been leaning toward Slytherin as it was, what with her being able to talk to snakes and the whole House being ABOUT snakes (not to mention the green and silver were nice colors), but after hearing this she KNEW she wanted to go there.

** SIXTH YEAR ENDING
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sixth-year-ending
   :END:
'Well, I've learned everything I can from this place - and as much as I can from Dumbledore. I think now is the perfect time to leave.'

Sadie hid under her invisibility cloak as the Death Eaters passed her by completely to get up the stairs to the top of the Astronomy Tower.

Screaming, yells. Spells flying.

Silence, stillness.

Then...

The door burst open again, and Snape emerged out of the stairwell. He rushed up to the top of the tower.

Silence again.

"What're YOU doing here?" Malfoy snarled out at Snape. "This is MY MISSION, not yours! I've got the old man cornered here, I'm about to kill him - and now you show up here like this! Trying to steal my glory for yourself? I knew it! Well you're too late, Snape. I beat you to it. I'm going to-"

"Avada Kedavra!" Snape's words came like a whip. His wand hand flashed up quicker than Sadie could follow. But what she COULD follow was the green light flaring, striking Dumbledore, sweeping him backward through the air...taking him off the tower...

Dumbledore's wand was left behind on the tower as his body fell from it.

Sadie eyed Snape for a long moment, a moment frozen in time itself. Everything she'd felt toward him in first year, so mistaken - rage, desperation, betrayal - all came flooding back into her tenfold. A hundredfold. A thousandfold.

She'd been right all along - just...off by a few years.

And because those years of delay had happened...it hurt so much more.

Sadie remained where she was; she watched the Death Eaters go, watched Snape and Malfoy go.

Then she moved over to the broomsticks and took up one, and she flew away from Hogwarts.

In all the pain, all the fear, all the uncertainty...Sadie felt more free than ever had before. And with this new freedom of hers in her grasp, she had some things she needed to take care of sooner rather than later - before someone else took care of them for her.

*** I'll just comment about both parts here:

First off: Sadie is a pretty new name for a fem!Harry. Like it.

The whole thing takes a dive for the really dark real quick. I did not see that coming, but probably because it was just bits and pieces of a whole story.

I did like the implications I read: Sadie liking Snape but still respecting and idolizing Dumbledore. That could be an interesting triangle. I'm also glad you kinda kick Daphne as a sidekick for what (I assume) is a Slytherin Sadie fic.

Quite frankly, I think you'd have a great story on your hand if you /don't/ make it a rehash. For example: Let her become part of a different family (or maybe even let her life with Hagrid during the summers). You obviously want her to become entangled with dark magic and develop a violent streak out of her past. I honestly think that this path is logically closed to you in a rehash.

In any case, thank you for sharing. I had a blast reading your work.

**** Thank you BBQ! Yes I picked Sadie because it's two syllables like Harry, and I found it on a list of "old fashioned girl names" on google, because Harry is an old fashioned boy name. So I wanted to stick with that naming convention.

Also yes, Sadie is a really interesting "dark" character because in the story I do fully intend to have her have a genuine respect and fondness for Dumbledore, despite the plans she makes and how she changes over the years in ways that would put her opposite to Dumbeldore - sort of like how in X-Men 3 when that mutant insults Charles after he dies Magneto goes off on him like "CHARLES XAVIER FOUGHT FOR US ALL, AND YOU'D NEVER FIND A BETTER MAN!" So Sadie will have that for Dumbledore, where even if she doesn't care for what he does or anything, she still does respect and care for him. :) And for Snape, of course, but as my little scenes show, that disappears in the end...

And yes, eventually she just goes darker and darker until that's all there is for her, and she's "free". Free from laws, from her abusers, and from having to maintain school life like any other girl, which she thinks she isn't. Well, sort of KNOWS she isn't, because the prophecy and everything. So Dumbledore telling her that sort of makes her arrogant about herself. It's really interesting I think, and it's one of the stories I'm most excited about starting to write fully.

Oh yes, I'm definitely going to have her be adopted by a different family and stuff, she won't be with the Dursleys like canon. :) But that's sort of the sad thing about her, is no matter how much help she gets, no matter what people say to her, she still just...she's who she is, becomes what she becomes.

Sorry it got really dark there, but if you give an abused girl legitimate superpowers and a situation where she can cast off and believe herself to be ABOVE all social norms and laws - at least, muggle ones - then she's going to make her revenge fantasies a reality. :(

She's dark yes, she's disturbed, and it gets worse until it culminates in that ending where she just tosses everything aside and embraces doing whatever she wants in the world "because she can," but I don't want her to be some super sadist or try to become the next "Dark Lord" like in most fanfics with a darker Harry. She's NOT some aspiring Dark Lord, she's just...sad, to me. That's it. Just some sad case of a girl who got power and had people she wanted to use it all on.

Of course, the Horcrux inside her had a major influence, but that just makes it all more sad to me.

The story is supposed to be sad.

*** I don't read much Dark!Harry, so I don't have much to say there. I second not making it too close to canon. That's an easy trap to fall into because the framework of canon makes the writing flow so easily (speaking from experience). This is a very different Harry in a different house. I don't know how much you've plotted out, but you should start by figuring out what her plans are and how those would drive the villains' canon plans off the rails.

**** Okay thanks! :) Yes she's definitely going to do things a lot differently during her Hogwarts years, but some things will still happen because they were independent of her, like Quirrell/Voldemort going after the Stone in year 1 and trying to kill her for being her, and then Lucius starting the Diary plot, which leads to Sirius seeing the newspaper which leads to him escaping to go after Peter at Hogwarts, which leads to Lupin getting hired as DADA. :)

*** SORRY PART TWO BECAUSE IT SAYS ITS TOO LONG.

--------------

"What the hell are you doing here in our home, girl? Your freaky school doesn't end for another three weeks!"

Sadie, her invisibility cloak stuffed half way down her waistband, hanging from a hip, raised her wand and pointed it right in her uncle's face.

"Oh, don't go thinking you can pull that one on us, girl!" her uncle sneered at her, though his face had gone pale, and his eyes wide. "You can't use your freakishness to hurt us, or that school of yours will kick you out! And that MINISTRY OF MAGIC that your folks have will take you away for it after, for breaking THEIR sort of law - surprising they even have them!"

"The school DID kick me out - that's why I'm back here early," Sadie spoke, purring her words and languishing in the joy of it all. After an entire lifetime of this...the dark cupboard, the starvation, the bars on the window, the frying pan and the other beatings... "As for the Ministry and their laws? Uncle, haven't you been telling everyone for years now that I'm a deliquent of a girl? A total lost cause? I don't give a damn about the law. I don't give a damn about you. I don't give a damn about Petunia. I'm going to hurt you tonight, pay you back for all the times you've all hurt me my whole life. And then I'm going to leave, and I'm never coming back."

"You- you can't- you- how dare you even threaten us when we've-"

Sadie slashed her wand, nonverbally casting Sectumsempra. her uncle yelled, staggered backwards down the hall and fell to the floor with massive, deep gashes across his front. Blood poured, pooled very quickly, very dark in color. She repeated the spell two more times over. Her uncle convulsed on the floor. Sadie cast a spell back at the door, an Imperturble Charm. She began casting concealing and protective enchantments around the entire house. It only took a minute. By that time her aunt and cousin had come to see what the noise was about so late in the night.

Petunia screamed. Dudley ran back down the hall and nearly dove into the kitchen, faster than Sadie had ever seen him move.

Sadie flicked her wand at her aunt; Petunia was frozen to the spot, unable to move except her eyes. Sadie stalked up to her, slow and enjoying it. She jabbed her wand into Petunia's chest, right between her cleavage. She smiled. She was feeling such a RUSH from it all! God, she didn't want this night to ever end - though, she'd have to end it, and get on with the rest of her life come morning. "Auntie...how're you feeling right now? Do you feel like I did, all those nights you'd come into my bedroom? Sit at my bed with me, put your hands under my clothes? I hope you do." Sadie regarded her aunt for a few moments more; then she stepped around her aunt and moved into the kitchen.

Dudley was throwing his considerable weight against the back door, trying to get out into the backyard to escape.

Sadie flicked her wand and lifted her cousin up off the floor, rotated him around to face her. He hovered there, helpless and terrified. "You never tried to help me," she began, soft and slow. She sat down at the kitchen table and rested her wand hand on a pristine surface. She gazed at her cousin as he hovered in the air still. "Our whole lives, you knew what they were doing to me. But you never went to the cops, or to a teacher, or to a neighbor. You never did a thing to help me - oh, sure, you never did anything to HURT ME...but you never helped me, either."

"I- I can h-help you n-now!" Dudley whimpered out, helpless and desperate. "S-Sadie, you- last summer, when you...saved my life...I- I started thinking, and I- I- I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Sadie, for everything! I should have tried to help you, I should have told someone! I should have! I'm sorry! But I can help you now - whatever you want, whatever you want to do, just let me down and I'll help!"

Sadie nonverbally cancelled the spell, cancelled it with a thought, and Dudley fell to the floor. To his knees. She stayed at the table. Dudley straightened up, but didn't try going anywhere. He looked at her in relief and shock. "Your dad's probably going to die tonight."

"A-and...m-mum?" Dudley choked.

"She's perfectly fine - just unable to move, for now," Sadie explained casually. "I haven't decided what to actually do with her yet."

"Y-you could leave. I- I mean, Sadie, I could help you leave!" Dudley went on quickly. "They couldn't...hurt you anymore if you were gone."

"Yeah, but I really want to hurt them before I leave," Sadie responded.

"Sadie, please don't! Please-"

Sadie twitched her wand, froze Dudley where he was. She stood from the table, and went back into the hall. Walked up behind her aunt. She pressed her wand to her aunt's lower back, right against her spine. Then she cast a Cutting Curse. She unfroze her aunt, and Petunia fell to the floor like a sack of potatoes. She was yelling and sobbing. Sadie crouched in front of her, grabbed her hair and yanked her head back. She pointed her wand at her face and cast a second Cutting Curse; Petunia shrieked like an animal as her eye was mutilated. Sadie let her go, stepped away. She turned and walked past her uncle's corpse, and stepped out the front door.

She walked down the garden path to the street, and then she concentrated, and she disapparated.

*** The first one, it sounds like this is going to be a /big/ story if you get to writing it--big as in ambitious. Stories with a lot of worldbuilding like that can be pretty good, but you have to be careful to keep them from running away from you. This is looking good so far. My biggest criticism is that I find it hard to believe that Horcrux!Ron could steamroll the goblins and hold his own against Voldemort Prime so well.

The other two aren't really the kind of thing I read. Nothing seriously wrong with them, but I'm not in the prime audience for them.
