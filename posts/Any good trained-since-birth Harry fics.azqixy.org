Are there any good stories out there where they (Dumbledore, whoever) decide that Harry should be as prepared as possible, as fast as possible? I don't mean a full on dehumanized walking weapon situation, just rigorous training from an extremely young age.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

** This one does but it's not super relevant if that's what you're looking for. It's glossed over basically.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
