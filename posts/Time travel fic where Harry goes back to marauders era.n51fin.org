Ik this isn't much to go on, but all I really remember was that Harry often compared Pettigrew to Neville and he might have taken on the last name Porter. I'm not sure on that last one. Thanks


** Was it Second Life by blucross on ff.net?

** Maybe this? I don't remember if he compared Peter to Neville, but the rest fits.

#+begin_quote
  The Mirror of Erised fulfills an eleven-year-old Harry Potter's desire in the strangest of ways. Suddenly thrust into the past, Harry copes with getting to know a newly dating James Potter and Lily Evans while Dumbledore figures out how to send him back to his own time. There's only one problem; time travel has many repercussions and Harry finds himself getting...younger.
