I remember Remus and Tonks were investigating a werewolf enclave for the Order and during the climax, Harry, Hermione and Ron used the Cloak to secretly grab on to Tonks' Portkey and broke it when they landed in the middle of the enclave. Tonks chewed them out for it before they all had to fight their way out.
