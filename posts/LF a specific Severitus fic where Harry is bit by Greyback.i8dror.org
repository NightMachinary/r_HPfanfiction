:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This might be a stretch but I remember really liking this fic. Harry gets a bloodline curse where he starts seeing white dementors and passing out. He finds out he is related to Snape, and this is Snape's bloodline curse. I remember him obliviating Pomphrey at one point.

Also, I remember that Harry was being stalked by Greyback, who wanted to turn him. At some point Harry is bit and transforms into a werewolf in Snape's basement with Remus? Oh yeah, and Harry has a crush on Ron (I think?)

It's kinda fuzzy so sorry if it's hard to identify, but I would love it if someone could help me find this fic!!!
