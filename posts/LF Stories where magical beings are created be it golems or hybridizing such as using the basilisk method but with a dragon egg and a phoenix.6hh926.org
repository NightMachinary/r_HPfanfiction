*my headcanon is that it would create dragonettes with fairy wings with combustion problems.

Also, another example of a golemesque character: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/7/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]]


** I've also been looking for something like this.

*** Today i was thinking about complications(see watches), legion(from mass effect), and the story of the golem from judaism. Totally imaging it takes hundreds of simplistic spells working in combiNation to get a child level golem and thousands to get one to being combat capable,

**** I was thinking along the lines of creating other creatures, not of the Hogwarts world, through the use of genetic manipulation, rune work, etc, etc... Like creating various types of dragon that have four limbs and wings on their backs unlike the wyvern-like dragons in Harry Potter, each with their own elemental breath, Sapient- Sentient intelligence, and hybridize versions.

or creating golems that had spell enhancements that drained enemies of their energy(i stopped thinking here because I noticed I was basically describing a magical version of the weeping angels. I got a little freaked.).

also thought of adding spiritual animals.
