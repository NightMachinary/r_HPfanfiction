Hi guys, I'm pretty sure that asking for fanfic recs isn't against the rules so I thought I would give it a go. Does anyone know anything fanfics that deal with Harry after he kills Voldemort. Such as that he even misses Voldemort's, or regrets killing him. If not, something to do with how Harry copes with not being a Horcrux anymore would be much appreciated. I know such fics exist because I have read one before but I cant find it. Thanks!


** I know a few where Harry /couldn't/ cope with living without a homicidal Dark Lord in his life. linkffn(Standstill, Asphyxiating; Deal With A Deity; 10248658)

  Post-epilogue. Naturally, Harry could never love the Dark Lord, but living without him has just never been an option. 19 years later, life has come to a standstill for both of them, but the Lord will have what is his, his alone. HP/LV, kinda-anti HP/GW.

  When the war ended all was well, at least for a little while. For Harry Potter life without his crimson eyed madman was even worse than with him. A drunken trip to Diagon reveals why Harry feels like he's slowly dying inside and the manipulating hooks that had been pierced into him, controlling him like a marionette. Is there a second chance? /MPREG/ used to be Ultimate Betrayal

** I'm not sure if this fits, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8966727/1/Vengeance-from-the-grave][Vengeance from the grave]] deals with how Harry copes without Voldi to fight against, in its later chapters.

The story is pretty good overall, so maybe check it out, even if it doesn't hit your criteria spot on.
