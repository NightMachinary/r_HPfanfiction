#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.

Grindelwald is really interesting, with so much possibilities. I wish you luck for writing your Grindelwald fic!

*** Thirty-Five Owls is my absolute favorite fanfiction. I've read it so many times! For such a small community, there are some really fantastic Grindeldore fanfictions.

**** You're the author of Escape to Darkness, right? I really enjoyed it so far! I know you aren't active right now, but if you ever feel like writing again, I hope you choose to write this one.

** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9904603/12/Phantasy][Phantasy]]. Its a great take on the Peggy Sue and Master of Death Harry tropes. In this case Harry's been revived a dozen times trying to stop an apocalypse, but on the thirteenth time Harry is able to choose to take Tom Riddle and Grindlewald reborn to help him.

*** Phantasy. Ooooh boy. You can tell by the fact that it has a great premise and hasn't been updated in a year that its a Tsume Yuki story. God damnit, why haven't she been banned yet? I'm 99.8% sure that there is some convention out there outlawing starting so many good stories and abandoning them all, to a fault (not really though, she finished the one with Harry as Sirius and Regulus' brother. Not the sequel though ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )

  Bella Potter had it all. The money. The fame. Her brothers were the same, with superior smirks in place. But it had never occurred to them that they were wrong. That it was just a mask to cover their true faces and their Sins. SEQUEL TO Inside My Mind
