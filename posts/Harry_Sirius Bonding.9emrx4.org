** The only one that springs to mind is The Wise One: Book One. linkffn(4062601)

It's the first part of a trilogy that, to be honest, gets worse with time. I've always really liked the first book, however, and it's exactly what you're looking for.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

** I really, really like this /Too Far From Home/ linkffn(5757945) though the Sirius/Harry bonding doesn't come in until the later chapters. Premise: Harry is sent to a parallel universe by Voldemort after GoF, and living with the Potters isn't...ideal. Lots of angst, good character studies, some really surprising action (though it takes a while). Cons: Author is extremely slow in updating, but is still working on the story.

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*

** makes me think of a way bigger bonding.

Sirius shows up just in time to burst into the room where Voldemort is going to kill baby Harry. Sirius tackles Voldemort right as everything explodes. Somehow Harry becomes Sirius' horcrux.

** If I could suggest you my own linkffn(Dysfunctional by Rose9797).

It's not very angsty, because I wanted Harry and Sirius to have some good times before the angst arrives next year.

  Post-OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family that he can fall back on this time. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? No slash/bashing. Harry & Sirius family fic. Canon divergence after OotP but compliant.
