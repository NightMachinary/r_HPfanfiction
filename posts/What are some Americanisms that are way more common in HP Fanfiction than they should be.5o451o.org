  By the time Hallowe'en arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the Deathday Party. The rest of the school were happily anticipating their Hallowe'en feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, *Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns* large enough for three men to sit in and there were rumours that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.

**** I see where you're coming from, but the fact remains that your average brit will not call carved pumpkins 'Jack-o-lanterns'. Origins of the word be damned, we just don't call them that over here.

The part you're quoting doesn't contradict what I'm saying, as I'm referring to a distinctly American label - we all know what a lantern is, and a candle in a pumpkin qualifies as one. But we still don't call them 'jack-o-lanterns'. And JK hasn't either.

I mean yeah, cookie instead of biscuit is annoying, but when it feels to me like it's a bunch of American teens going to high-school instead of Hogwarts, then it's really a big problem for my enjoyment. It's always nice to read fics from british or at least European authors for that reason alone... feels more familiar somehow.

****** The biggest difference with the UK/US I've noticed is in the UK I feel religion is a rather personal thing, rather than an identification you wear on you sleeve.

For example, I helped out at a Church at University (They did regular concerts and similar and I used to sing in the choir) while not being religious. It felt a lot more like a social group, where the majority happened to be Christian, rather than a real barrier to entry. I feel extremely unwelcome attempting to do the same thing in the US.

** Only two really annoy me:

Grade Point Averages - which just aren't a thing in the UK. You take an exam after however many years of study and that's it. If Super!Harry has spent Tuesday afternoon saving the word from his evil, extra-dimensional, pregnant clone then he could just do a crappy potions essay for Wednesday and go to sleep. Not every bit of work need a timeturner and perfection.

Healthcare costs - The Dursleys were so fat that they couldn't afford to feed Harry and pay for Dudley's triple bypass etc. etc. Sorry Yanks, but in Europe and quite a few other parts of the world healthcare is freee! Definitely sucks to be you but please don't forget that part when setting your fics in the UK since it can snap me out of a story instantly just because the idea of paying for healthcare is so very alien.

And that's about it.

** Canadian half-Brit now living in America....Imagine how fun it is in my head sometimes!

Minor things - like spelling it color instead of colour (ugh, it took me so long to get used to spelling it the American way) - don't bother me at all.

But something major - Like what side of the road people drive on in England, etc., I think are completely inexcusable. People, generally, are writing fanfiction because they're a /fan/. And if they are a fan, I would think it safe to assume they've at least read the HP books or seen the movies, or both. And some of those major differences, the ones that would pull me instantly out of a story, are so clearly addressed in the books and movies.

I'm not expecting every author to do a massive amount of in-depth research (I totally do whenever I write), but a quick Google search is all it takes for some of the more blatant Americanisms.

There's a similar problem in the Labyrinth Fanfiction world; stories that either completely ignore the fact that the movie was set in the late 1980s and have a sequel take place that references current events, or the story does take place in the correct time but includes items (like smartphones) that didn't exist in the early 90s. And again, a simple Google search is all it takes.

***** "England and America are two countries separated by the same language!"

My dad (where I get my British side from) loved using that quote, because it's so true.

Even between Canada and the states there's some differences, and I quickly discovered those when I started high school. For example, I would say "I'll phone you" vs. call you. After 20 years, I don't really even think about it much - Unless I'm talking to my family in Canada, or England, or visiting them. Or watching a Canadian or British TV/Movie.

So while it is the same language, it's a lot like having to interpret things in my head.

English is weird, bottom line.

Sometimes I'll just read a sentence and it's so overtly American I will close the tab. You don't have to be British to write fanfiction about British characters, but just as I won't read something where Dean Winchester is saying, "Indeed, that may be rather the best course of action, brother," I'm not going to read something where Harry Potter's talking like a fucking New Yorker.

They're like an afternoon tea type item, and sweet - with sugar and lemon, or with Nutella (and strawberry/banana too is very good).

******* This is really late but there's a list of differences in the UK and US editions [[https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/differences.html][here]], near the bottom of the page. The site linked only goes up to Half Blood Prince.

Here's [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2001/08/25/differences-between-british-and-us-versions-of-ps/][Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone]] as an example. Sweets become candy, jelly becomes Jell-O, ice lollies become ice pops and mummies become mommies.

As a UK reader myself it must be pretty interesting to see these Americanised characters in a UK setting, interacting with each other in very British ways. For example, I hear from a lot of US readers that Harry's cheeky nature, that Brits feel an affinity for, is often misconstrued as rude by Americans.

It's hard to know your'e getting something wrong, when you don't know that there's something TO get wrong.

I mean everyone knows trunk/boot etc, but despite having lived for a month with a family in the UK, and been a casual "fan of the british" for several years (NOT a britaboo. I just really enjoyed my time in the UK. It just felt... comfortable.) and have read a ton of Harry potter and stuff. ... I was still taken aback when someone said the other day that people in the UK don't say Mom. It's Mum.

It's seriously the little things sometimes, as I can think BACK on that, and see that it's true, but my brain never attributed a spelling difference to it.

*** The "write me" thing really bothers me, as well as mail instead of post, because it comes up so much in fics. Sir and ma'am is just so weird too - they never say this in the books, why suddenly have them say it now?

But the most annoying one is 'mom' instead of 'mum'. It MUST be common knowledge that British people say mum, right? I know there's a small area in the midlands where people say mom, but most British people don't know that, there's no reason an American would, and none of the main characters are from that area, as far as I'm aware. But I see so many references on American tv shows and terrible British accents, not to mention I heard that Rowling was strict on Mrs Weasley being referred to as mum even in the US editions?

Most other Americanisms annoy me, but 'mom' is one that actively makes me close a fic. It just completely pulls me out of it, and makes me feel like the author has made no effort.

From what I've been able to find, there's only one instance in the entire series when someone uses the term "Ma'am"... and it's Filch who says it when talking to Umbridge. Given that Brits tend to use "Ma'am" only when addressing female superiors in the armed forces, or the Queen... this says a bit about Filch's level of worship for Umbridge.

It's not a deal breaker for me or anything, it just irks me a lot because obviously witches and wizards use owl post a lot. So phrases related to letter writing come up a lot, so every fic seems to have these sort of Americanisms- mail, write me, mailbox, etc. Individually they're not a big deal, but it adds up and ends up breaking my immersion.

I assume that these reasons, and likely more, are why people don't follow Rowling's lead with these types of things.

  Breakfast appears to be a stumbling block for a lot of writers, in fact food in general
#+end_quote

This is actually pretty hard because we grow up in a place and it's hard to imagine what other places do.

I mean, seriously, I grew up in Hawaii, where, if I ate breakfast AND lunch at school (my bus came pretty early) I was pretty well guaranteed to eat rice at least 5 times a week, at a minimum. Then I moved to Alabama, where no one eats rice, and they eat grits?? when I first came here, I think I said "People actually eat that?" as I'd long thought it as one of those 'historical' foods like you might find in a book about the civil war or something. I was regaled with tales about how mawmaw (who lives just up the hill right now) likes sitting on her porch with a glass of buttermilk and some corn bread.

I felt like I had been transported to another century, honestly.

#+begin_quote
  Another is everyone one introduces themselves and kids call adults sir or ma'am.
#+end_quote

W..what? Could you please explain this one to me?

This was actually another hawaii <-> alabama thing I had trouble with. In Hawaii, there wasn't any press for formality when dealing with adults or strangers. Actually it reminds me--a LITTLE-- of some asian cultures, where any woman near your age is "sister" (or, Sistah) and any male is "brother" (Braddah, or Brah) or elder could be Auntie or Uncle. Or, "tita" or "moke" (of course, all of these are complicated words, because tida can mean, like "a girl who'll kick your ass", but tita, in Hawaiian/english, is Sister, while in filipino, it means 'aunt'.. anyway) ... so in the store, you COULD be like "hey, auntie, where the fish? Thanks!" whereas over here in alabama "Excuse me ma'am, can you please tell me where the fish is?"

Formality is a complicated thing to understand :)

Like, I was reading how in parts of india, saying "thank you" to a friend or family could be insulting... because it implies that you don't think that they're close enough to you that they would do whatever thing they had done for you, and that you need to be thanked.

So... british kids... don't introduce themselves or call adults sir or ma'am??

....

Man, I wish I could make a website. I would love to move a webpage based on the idea of 'writing around the world'... where you talk about what 'normal' breakfast foods are, and attitude towards people and stuff like that. for every country, not jsut the US and britain. :)

**** No one is denying it's hard, but it's similar to anachronisms where you WILL slip up here and there but good writers should be constantly aware of it and trying their best.

I'm not quite sure what was meant by introductions (although I have noticed when I have spoken to American tourists or something they sometimes introduce themselves even if they're just asking directions which is weird), but for the Sir/ma'am thing... Yeah kids only call their teachers sir and their female teachers miss. No one uses ma'am unless referring to the Queen. As adults, you might use Sir if trying to placate a difficult customer or talking to a high ranking superior in certain professions like the military or police, but not your ordinary boss or any random man. Never your dad or another relative as I see in fics occasionally - there's no way Harry would call Mr Weasley sir, let alone Vernon. Remember that Sir here is used for people that have been knighted, so it does actually mean something more than general respect here.

Well, my point was more.. it takes a lot of life experience to learn that not everything is the same. Life experience is tricky to get. and it can get tiresome googling "What do british people..." every 3 minutes. I mean. Do brits brush their teeth? I presume they do. What kind of toothpaste do they use? Well, brand doesn't matter, but is it mostly minty, like it is here? this article mentions salt toothpaste in the UK.... is that common or a 'weird' flavor??

Most people just... assume. Of course mint toothpaste. Of course pancakes for breakfast. pancakes are so universal, aren't they?

One should try one's best, but speaking as someone who has been writting stories set in other countries, you can get seriously bogged down by searching for little details. And some of those details just don't turn up when you search. (now add in that a lot of fnfic was written many years ago... when google wasn't quite so comprehensive...! I mean, I remember my cat had kittens less than a decade ago and it was /hard/ to find information about how to care for them. It isn't, these days.)

All that said, thank you for the insight into 'sir'.... that actually is very helpful to me personally and is something I'll keep in mind. :)

What would one say to a difficult female customer, or a female boss? "Miss" still?

....I could actually see vernon insisting that Harry call him sir. And see Harry developing 'weird habits' as a result (after all, if he's learned wrong at home, then is 'sir-ing' at everyone in school... .... kinda like that classic slip of calling your teacher "mom"

But that is interesting. And see, that's one of those things that is so culturally tied up, that an american would never think to question it. Sir or ma'am is so built into 'this is what you do to be polite'... at least hear in the south, it's habit to say 'sir and 'ma'am' even to people who are serving you. ("Excuse me ma'am, would you like more coke?" "Yes sir, thank you.") .... it's like.. .default polite address when lacking a name.

.... what do brits use in that case? o_o

****** I appreciate that, and like I said obviously people will slip up, but there's plenty of ways you can avoid mistakes. I'm writing a fic set in the 70s. Well I wasn't alive then, so of course I made a couple of little mistakes but I corrected them immediately when a reviewer pointed them out, and I've been watching British sitcoms from the 70s to get a feel for the language they used. By doing wider research you'll gradually pick up those little details you assumed were universal.

For a woman, you would use madam, but I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to refer to someone that way. Some people really don't like it because it sounds like you're getting told off or your a brothel keeper or something. If you know their name, you would say ms/Mrs whatever. I'm afraid I don't know what it would be for a senior position in the army. Perhaps ma'am, but the association with the Queen is still to close in my opinion. We just honestly don't really use titles as pronouns that often. I call my boss Maeve because that's her name. I think she'd laugh in my face if I tried to call her madam or ma'am. If we're saying excuse me we just say excuse me, if we're saying would you like a coke, we just say would you like a coke. The manners comes in the tone and facial expression. We're British, we like to minimise the words we say to strangers.

I can't see Vernon ever asking harry to call him sir because it's /really/ weird to do that here. The Dursleys are all about being normal. I think maybe in terms films they did that at one point but it just feels so awkward.

Trying to ascribe reason and intent to it is where your problem is. You have a common phrase, "couldn't care less", and in casual conversation the negation starts getting dropped for whatever reason. I could easily see it disappearing from rapid, connected speech. People still know what you're saying. They understand the phrase as a unit rather than just the sum of its parts.

If everyone treated the written word with the same laxity as speech then a university professor checking a class' reports would have some written in a southern drawl, some written half in Spanish/Portuguese/French/what-have-you, some half crossed out and refilled in, some written in Hagrid speech, and no two reports written in the same manner.

So I totally agree that doing badly in one exam affecting your whole grade isn't fair for those who aren't 'good' at sitting exams.

But equally I do find the idea of every single piece of homework counting a bit mad too - what happens if you've got a really bad cold one week and rush through or don't do your homework? What happens if you're in a play or have a really big sports game?

****** It depends what you mean by 'your grade'. The only grades that really matter are what you get in the national exams usually taken at the ages of 16 and 18 (although you can take them at other ages, and they can be retaken, etc): the GCSEs and the A-Levels, or possibly other qualifications like NVQs. These are like the OWls and NEWTs. Your teacher's assessment of your work over the year does not affect your grade in these.

Your grade or level or whatever that your teachers report to your parents as you go through school? That's usually a combination of them looking at how you do in lessons and homework, and how you do on exams, but not in the formalised way American schools seem to use. Different schools will have different systems, but it's very much based around how much progress you are making towards where you are supposed to be at the end of your whole school career, and predicting what you will get in your GCSEs and A-Levels. Some schools use end-of-year exams, but +the Hogwarts model with ranking everyone based on percentage performance in each subject is an old-fashioned thing that is invoking ideas of the old public schools (not the same as state-funded schools at all) because the Harry Potter books are being like the old school stories from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.+ EDIT: I don't think they say the grades are based on a percentage ranking: I'm remembering a fanfic and incorporating Hermione's Charms mark.

Everything is about exams. If you fail your GCSEs, you don't go on to sixth form (but since the law changed you'd still go into an apprenticeship or some other kind of formal education [that law changed sometime in the last 10yrs; we used to only have to be in school until 16]) and if you fail your A-Levels you don't go on to uni, but there's none of that whole re-doing school thing. And even if you do poorly at schoolwork throughout the year, if you ace your exams, you're fine.

But even then it's not as simple as "pass or fail GCSEs/A-Levels". You could pass English and fail Maths, and that's fine if you don't want to go into further study that requires Maths, and there's no overall grade. When we talk about how we did in those exams, we would say "I got 7 GCSEs". The more you have the more impressive it looks, but for uni the important thing is what you have and the grade you got in each individual one, rather than how many.

It's not uncommon for people to do well in some subjects, so they can carry on studying them, but not get their C in English or Maths, so they have to keep taking that GCSE alongside their other studies. At A-Level (or other qualifications at college) you generally only do the subjects you want, usually a maximum of 4 or maybe 5.

The main change for the new system (which I think is partly just designed to allow grade inflation more subtly, because adding a '10' above the 9 is less obvious than when they added A*) is that the exams are supposed to be much harder, and the grade 1 is equivalent to an old F grade: G grade students will now fail. Given the grades are still based on deciding that x% of students must get each grade, this seems a little mean. It does mean that we're going to eventually only have A, B, C grades at A-Level and nowhere else, unless they change those too.

If you get A's in, say, English, French and German, you could easily continue and get straight A/A* at A-level and get into a very good university course for languages. However, if you failed maths, you won't be doing Maths, or likely any sciences, to any real level.

It helps that our universities ask for specific grades only in relevant subjects, so you aren't expected to have passed everything (although a lot do). On top of all that, apprenticeships and college (ie vocational, below degree level) courses don't require the same pass grades as universities.

*************** No, that's not really the question I asked, though I do see how you could interpret it that way.

My question about specific requirements being put on certain things was about following educational paths that required those very subject, so if you got someone who actually could qualify for a given grade in a certain subject but didn't get it because it just so happened that there was a crop of students doing exceptionally in that very subject, it means that a student would become unable to follow their chosen path due to no fault of their own. As such, a high enough grade in other subjects might be /some kind of result/, but it might very well happen to be a result that they really don't care about and as such that is worth nothing for them; heck, what if just as their grades in the subjects they cared about got shafted due to the amount of exceptional students, their grades in those other subjects, the ones opening “alternative” path, were only as high as they were due to the lower-than-usual level of students. Such a situation, as unlikely to occur as it is, would force someone to either repeat the exam that they could and would do better but which would be an effing waste of time, or to instead follow an educational path that they might not actually be well suited to and that they might actually dislike.

It might very well be that the system works “well enough”, but to me the potential for a student to get shat on even though they really could have done well enough objectively makes it quite bad, and depending on the student the consolation prize of having another educational path open might vary in worth from good to worthless so /that/ does not, in my opinion, diminish the badness of the system.

**************** I see where you're coming from. The thing is, it's graded across the whole country, so the marks tend to vary for grade bands by only a mark or two every year. Generally, students know the approximate marks they'll need to get to get certain grades, and the variation is only slight. So, whilst it very possibly happens in odd situation, the number of kids hovering around the pass mark at GCSE and the ones that would have been able to get a good enough grade at A level are not the same kids. And obviously without a level they don't study that subject further.

There are worse systems. Like a system where everyone can get an A to the point where A's are valueless, and kids with A grades now can't be differentiated. Where we can't tell who is actually the better candidate for a post, or for research degrees, when there's no point even having the grades because they mean nothing. It's getting like that with degrees - they mean nothing because everyone has them, and everyone is getting into debt to not be any further ahead.

It's not the best scheme, but equally massive grade inflation isn't any better. We've already got grades from A to G because we hate telling people they've failed - at least employers and unis can tell who to take on from that.

The thing is you can technically pass with a really low grade--pass grades count from A*-G (pronounced A-star) and then there's U (ungraded/unclassified) for if you do so badly that nothing you write is worth anything. So even if you get a G, you can still say you got the GCSE, it just wouldn't be any good to you. You'd need a C or higher to study the subject further. The same system is used for A-Levels, but calculating what grades you need to get into uni gets a little more complicated.

******** I don't really understand the question. No, you can't fail out of school. You could fail to get any qualifications at the end, and very very very rarely you could be held back a year but that's usually because of some medical issue or something. If you want to show you have basic maths skills, you need a C (or a 4, under the brand new system this year) at GCSE. You get that by sitting the GCSE maths exams at a registered centre: that can be by doing them in your school gym on the designated day in Year 11 because schools are registered centres (or in Year 10, because your school entered you early and you might try again next year, or throughout years 12 and 13 because you didn't get a C and it's now a legal requirement to keep slogging away at maths if you don't get a C), or by getting any other centre like a college to let you take them there on the designated day. If you're an adult, you can pay the exam fees yourself. Every so often you get a fluff news story of some 8-year-old getting pushed into doing it early and getting a D or whatever. The qualification is exactly the same: how you did on a piece of homework is irrelevant. There are GCSEs in dozens of subjects.

I mean, it's possible some schools (particularly independent schools) give you an A, B, C, D grade each year. That would be very old-fashioned. For a few years you got National Curriculum levels (from 1 to 8, with 4 being the average at the end of year 6 and 6 being the average at the end of year 9), but the Tories did away with those a couple of years ago and schools are trying to find something new to use instead. Mostly schools just report on if you are performing above or below where you should be, and give some suggestion (as you approach GCSEs) of the grade you are likely to get on those in each subject.

********** So before the National Curriculum you still had to stay in school until 16, but it was a bit more like Hogwarts in that there were the national exams at the end and otherwise the school and teachers could teach whatever they liked, really. So secondary schools usually tried to make sure they covered stuff that would be on whichever national exams they had picked for their students, but primary schools were a very mixed bag and you could learn a very unstructured mixture of bits of maths your teacher liked plus a lot of dinosaurs and nature studies.

The National Curriculum came in in the 1980s to say what everyone should learn at different 'Key Stages': Key Stage 1 is about 5-7 years old (reception, year 1, year 2), Key Stage 2 is the top end of primary school (years 3, 4, 5 and 6, they leave at 11), Key Stage 3 is the bottom end of secondary school, Key Stage 4 is GCSEs and related qualifications in years 10 and 11, and Key Stage 5 is the 16-18 year olds doing A-levels or college courses. They line up with traditional groupings (Infants, Juniors, Lower School, Upper School, VI form).

The National Curriculum was arranged like a ladder in different levels. Different skills and knowledge were placed on different levels, so if a child was working on those skills they could be said to be 'working at level 3 in maths' or whatever. You could work at the levels at any age, so some children would reach level 3 in year 2, most should have reached level 4 by the end of year 6, and a few would be working at level 3 in year 9. Once you started Key Stage 4, you were past the levels and into grades. It got warped and distorted by politics, though, because they made all schools put children through exams called SATs (which don't stand for anything, it's weird) which gave them their levels in maths, English and science at the end of each Key Stage, and then they judged schools by putting them in league tables based on the results. While this definitely increased the amount of the tested subjects that most children learnt, and gave some structure to that, it turned the levels into something more like grades that children were pushed up and teachers were given incentives to inflate, which made them less useful for assessing actual progress. And the sublevels (which were meant to be very holistic things like 'can do some of these skills with help', 'can do these things but makes mistakes', 'can confidently do all of this') became like grades, so children would get a 2a and aim to make two sublevels of progress a year.

The National Curriculum was simplified a couple of years ago, and so the levels have gone. All the parents still think in levels, and schools are looking for new ways to measure progress.

But I do think it indicates a different approach to the typical American approach. It is not about passing that year at school, but about overall progress over a wider curriculum across your whole school career.

The GCSEs and A-Levels are totally graded 'on a curve', though, if I've understood what Americans mean by that. It's just that you are competing against everyone in the country, not just your school.

***** As an american, "extra credit" tended to come in a few different forms:

- an extra question or two on a test that /may/ be harder or more in depth than the other questions, that would enable you to get, for example, 110% on the test... which may help you make up for a missed homework assignment (since, those are all kept up with) or a question on the test that you got wrong.

- an extra assignment, again, to help raise grades as a result of poor tests results, missed homework, or simply a desire for high scores. Again, remembering that all of these things MATTER in American schools. Many of my math classes had 40% of my final score based off of homework. the remaining 60% was a combination of tests and class work. Mostly tests. the Extra assignments could vary from teacher to teacher. Some give out none. Others might toss them out randomly. Exmaples I've had over the years: We're learning about recycling and the 'reduce, reuse, recycle' concept. Make a list of ways your family can reduce and reuse items you've bought lately. or: If you were (person), write a paragraph about what would you have done in (situation). or: "why do you think so and so did such and such?" ... some teachers would hand out basically "extra homework sheets" that we could do if we'd missed some. I think one week, there was a canned food drive, and our teacher let us turn up a few cans for 'extra points'... Another (and most useless teacher, honestly. He was the Gilderoy Lockhart of our school. Loved talking about his travels in Africa) ... he'd have a word search every week that we could work on after we finished our test. extra points if we turned it in finished.

It's important to keep in mind that it's not like we're getting extra credit at every turn. Some teachers never gave extra credit. Some would only put a 'bonus question' on a test now and then. Some might offer a few opportunities near grade time, while others offered them constantly. For me, anyway, extra credit was a pretty scarce thing.

But the point of all my rambling is... it's not being taken advantage of, it's being given an opportunity to correct our past mistakes by doing more work. Which I think is fair enough considering every work day, every homework, every class period, pop quiz and test are recorded and contribute to our grades.

Sir would be used to most authority figures, unless you have a degree of familiarity with them, and strangers unless you have no manners at all, but it would almost never be used for parents or even friends' parents, especially not after you've met them a few times.

** Just the painfully obvious one like using american unit system, fahrenheits, spelling words with "z" instead of "s" like apologize or realize. Since I'm not American nor British, I rarely notice the less obvious ones, often times because I actively use both the British and the American terms.

** I think it's just as mind boggling to think that magical Brittain would use the same vernacular as Muggle brittain. Magic brittain has effectively been a separate and isolated country from Muggle brittain for almost a hundred years LONGER than America.

And during that time MagBrit has been so isolated that wizards cant even manage to dress like Muggles. Combine that isolation with influences from sources that couldn't possibly affect MugBrit (like magical creature language and grammar slowly morphing the MagBrit English vernacular) and I would think that MagBritisms would be even more evident than americanisms could be.

The only mitigating factor would be the constant influx of muggleborn, but considering the relatively low number (an assumption), the fact that they're brought into the fold and indoctrinated at 11, and the fact that the books show how little the Muggle culture that the muggleborns would have access to actually affect the Wizarding culture, I doubt it would lessen how different MagBrit would speak compared to MugBrit.

So obviously JK didn't want to go through the effort of coming up with a completely new vernacular, so besides the obligatory magical specific words that have no Muggle counterpart, she stuck with writing in the vernacular she know most intuitively. Same as American fanfic writers.

***** I beleive what they're trying to say here is...

America-the-continent has been home to people (Native Americans/indigenous people/the first people/etc) for millennia. There is evidence of some norse settlements dating back to the 10th century CE in North America, evidence that the Polynesians visited the Americas (and the other way around, possibly.), evidence of contact between Asian visiting (east, south and Japanese), evidence of African and middle eastern contacts, all over the thousands of years before Columbus sailed the ocean blue. There's even some evidence of ancient roman contact... but perhaps most interesting of all, there was a gentleman named Henry Sinclair, who was a scottish nobleman who was born in 1345, and there's some evidence that HE also explored North America... or at least visited.

What I"m saying is... America--as a land mass-- has been populated for around 25,000 to 11,000 years. Many cultures have probably discovered the American continents over the times.

Columbus did his stuff in 1492, beginning a great big wave of colonization from many countries. The British colornies that would become the United States of America wern't founded until the 1620's... and they didn't declare independence until 1776, 300 years later, basically.

And none of that takes into consideration that /the whole land mass was populated already/... and in the years since Columbus came over, a lot of them died off due to disease or warfare. Or the Americans deciding they wanted to get rid of them. But, they were here first, for far longer than the europeans.
