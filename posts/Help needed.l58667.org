:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What's that one 4th year au did that changes third year by killing Sirius. I'm pretty sure it's abandoned and I know that Gabrielle is a pretty important character. I also I know if someone tells me the name of this fic I'm going to feel really stupid.


** The title is Harry Potter and the Power he Knows Not - The Reluctant Champion. Don't know if you found it already, but [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p3--CrZNoZGre5iY8LinmHjKOcgpWEsG/view][here]] is a backup posted here a few months ago.

** Are you thinking of ACI100's story? I think it was called The Reluctant Champion.

If it is this story that you're looking for, then you're out of luck. The author deleted it, since that story was written years ago, back when he first started writing. He didn't really like how he wrote the story, so he deleted it to focus on his many other stories.
