I just finished reading whats available of this amazing story and I'm quite disappointed that there isn't more.

I would definitely like the trio to have a strong bond. They don't have to be dark, but they should be willing to get their hands dirty. I would like to avoid most of the tropes that plague independant!harry stories, unless they are well done well. Oh! And I'd also like to avoid stories that get really edgy and angsty, like Stages of Hope. Sum of Their Parts fits what I'm looking for pretty well.


** I generally write stories with a strong friendship between the trio. "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water" might fit your request - it's an AU set post Hogwarts, with the trio having had to fight most of the war against Voldemort by themselves after Dumbledore died in year 5, and as a result they have become a bit estranged from the rest of Britain (other than Luna).

*** Started reading this 1.5 hours ago because it's Friday, I'm at work, and my give a shitter shut off this morning. I'm partway through chapter 6 so far and I like the attention to historical detail you've given it.

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** Forging the Sword was SO good. It had such great Ron characterization too.

*** I know, and it seemed like it was building him up to be the charismatic strategist, which is how I feel Ron should be done. Why did it have to be abandoned ;~;

**** Yeah, Ron never really came into his own in canon. I guess that happens in real life too. :( Still I would have loved to have him join the Chudley Cannons or something (instead Ginny because the professional Quidditch player... ).
