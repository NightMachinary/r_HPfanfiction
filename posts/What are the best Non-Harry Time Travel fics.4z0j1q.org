I'm a big fan of non-Harry-centric fics. Sadly, pretty much all the time travel / redo fics have him travelling in some way.

So list your time-travel / redo / dimension-travel fics here! No slash, no crossovers and definitely no time-travelling Harry.

** I don't understand why anyone would downvote you. This is a perfectly reasonable request. So, I have several to recommend, including a few one-shots:

*A Little Child Shall Lead Them*, linkffn(10871795): Hermione sent her memories back to her two-year old self in 1981. Hilarity ensued, back also heart-breaking moments.

*Don't Waste It*, linkffn(8669569): Even Wormtail deserves a 2nd chance

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107): Instead of Harry losing everyone and going back, it's Ginny losing everything and going back in desperation. This fic is probably the only one that has Ginny as the lone time traveller and is still finished.

*Here and There*, linkffn(7525570): a decent time-turner travels involving Hermione and Ginny. If not for the last 3 chapters, this would have been a great story.

*Heterochromic*, linkffn(10938984): Astoria time travel

*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*, linkffn(8581093): Hermione used a time turner to go back to 1981, or 169 days before the Halloween event, and enrolled Sirius and Remus in her scheme.

*Spectrum*, linkffn(9561455): The only fic in which Hermione travelled back to Tom's era and actually killed him

*The Greatest Minister of Magic*, linkffn(4487319): If Wormtail deserves a second chance, why not Cornelius Fudge?

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** Most of the ones I know have Hermione as the time traveller. Not sure if this is all the ones I know, but to start, there's linkffn(Palimpsest), linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World) and linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds). That last one is excellent and completely sold me on a pairing I thought I could never ship. It also has sequels, but you musn't touch them until you've read the first one. I think the first two might be unfinished, but there's still decent devlopment in what of them does exist.

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

** linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters)

Just started reading this yesterday, and it's incomplete. Severus and Lily centric and really well written. It's probably the only fan fiction that I have seen where the author has used em dashes.

** I'm a big fan of linkffn(The Debt of Time; Misplaced Moony; Storm of Yesterday)!

(Well, I completely botched the name of one of those fics. It's Misplaced Moony, not Remus Returns. Not sure where my brain got that from!)
