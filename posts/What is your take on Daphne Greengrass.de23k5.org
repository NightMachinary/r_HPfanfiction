A Discussion on Daphne's fanon developed character. Whether neutral Daphne, Light Daphne or Dark Daphne and the overall fan built character of The Ice Queen of Slytherin.

/Hail The Ice Queen/


** Functionally, Daphne Greengrass is an OC with a name and baked-in house designation and certain expectations built around that, based on her being a Slytherin who must value ambition and pragmatism. In the case of Daphne (and Astoria's case), we know that they're purebloods whose families care somewhat about blood status, if they haven't mixed with Muggles/half-bloods in generations, and qualify for Pottermore's Sacred 28 status.

On the other hand, Daphne's lack of canon appearance and interactions with Harry allows her to take on the role of "The Good Slytherin". Zabini is a raging elitist, Parkinson is a snitch, Crabbe and Goyle are dumb thugs, Bulstrode is unnattractive, Draco is racist. But Daphne is a blank slate, and that's an advantage, because she doesn't have a list of crimes to repent for. This means that Daphne can be a safe, non-problematic love interest to hook up with Harry. This means she can be a walking plot device for Harry, a teacher of Pureblood Etiquette to turn Harry from an everyman kid into the powerful, respected Lord Potter.

In the fanon-verse, Daphe is basically the straight version of Draco in Drarry fics, without the author having to find ways to Leather Pants her, or make Harry gay.

I think one of the big appeals of fanfiction is giving a protagonist an attractive, high-status, and above all, loyal partner, and Daphne is a character who can easily be fit into the mold. She can be made into the perfect partner for a happy, satisfying, and cathartic fic, without having to file off the personality flaws like for characters such as Draco (bully, magical Nazi Youth recruit, whines a lot) and Hermione (nagging, overbearing, cries a lot). And isn't catharsis and satisfaction why we first turned to fanfic in the first place?

****** And that's what makes Daphne fics so bad IMO. It's not only the repetitiveness of the political arc, but also that Daphne is more a plot device than an actual character who has a life outside of the plot. Which makes her fall flat as a love interest.

****** Dunno. If Harry can enter politics as a half-blood, why couldn't Tracey? Not to mention that having Harry serve as the "entry ticket" into politics for the ambitious half-blood girl, instead of being guided by the pureblood princess and her influential family, seems a little more challenging.

** I dislike her because stories with her in pretty much all follow the same script. I am also not particularly fond of the political arc you usually see in fanfics with Daphne. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to read a good one, but everyone who thought about writing one knows why they suck. The plots and intrigue of House of Cards or Game of Thrones aren't something you can just shoehorn into a side plot of a fanfic.

I remember two good fics with her in, Ice Princess by Luan Mao because it shits on her fanon self and one called "The List" (or similar) where she and Harry make a list of naughty things they didn't get to do as teenagers and then work their way through it. Importance of Intent looked good but kinda fizzled out IMO as Daphne's parents got involved.

**** We already have a "good Slytherin" in canon in the shape of Andromeda Tonks. And honestly I find her arc a lot more interesting than fanon Daphne. Think about the massive balls it took for her to run off from her abusive family which produced at least two Death Eaters and elope with a muggleborn (and how big Edward's were for going along with it despite Bellatrix).

Compared to that, the "helpful political guide" Daphne falls kinda flat. I mean, in most of her fics her parents are supportive, so there's not even that avenue for conflict because not only Daphne is good, but so are her parents. The stakes aren't really that high for her, or at least not higher than for any other associate of Harry.

***** That's a fair analysis. I suppose I should have clarified and said "A good Slytherin in Harry's year". That said, yeah, using Daphne as a way of guiding the story into the political arena is pretty boring.

I'm going out of my way to avoid politics in one of my fics, so I removed the Greengrasses from the Sacred 28 and made them businesspeople. Daphne only wound up being friends with Harry and Hermione because Tracey is an opportunist who will jump on any chance for excitement and she always drags Daphne along with her.

***** I get what you are saying about Andromeda Tonks and actually agree. She is a fascinating character that isn't delved into enough...particularly as it relates to her courage and defiance against the dogma she was force fed as she grew up. For anyone wanting to write a May-December romance for Harry she has much more in common than Narcissa and Bellatrix..it's a shame more stories don't deal with that.

But the reasons Daphne is more popular are obvious.

1. She is Harry's age and can be more easily paired with Harry. They are in the same grade at school and she has more at stake in the here and now based on the decisions she will need to make. Lots of plot contrivances need to be made to bring Harry and Andromeda together unless it is post war.
2. Andromeda has already set her path...the tough decisions she made and her journey took place off the page twenty years in the past. Using Daphne allows for much more freedom and, more importantly, let's a writer chronicle that same sort of journey as it relates to Harry and the other characters.

For what it's worth I agree with you as far as "political Daphne" being uninteresting. And having Daphne's parents disapprove of her choices isn't explored nearly enough.

****** About 2:

The thing there is that authors never really put Daphne through the same journey, or even a similar one (given that compared to Voldemort, Daphne's family doesn't look like much of a threat to Harry).

And Post war would be almost a given due to the 24-29 year age difference, where Teddy is such an obvious bonding opportunity.

** I'd read pretty much any (positive) characterization of Daphne, and I have no issues with the Ice Queen trope, I just wish it was actually relevant for more than the first chapter. Fics usually give us half a chapter where Daphne is described as the Ice Queen, and then she and Harry get together and she's instantly warm and kind to him and his friends. Maybe Daphne has trouble showing affection or intimacy with Harry so it creates some tension with their relationship.

Also, more fics in which Daphne doesn't become a background character the instant she and Harry get together would be nice. Too often she's just a damsel in distress for Harry to rescue, then serves as a pretty cheerleader while God Harry smites down any who would dare oppose him.

**** Sadly. I mean, you can have the love interest be irrelevant to the main arc and still have a good romance arc if you can write good chemistry. I'd much rather read of Harry's muggle OC girlfriend with whom he genuinely has a good time rather than a "involved" love interest who is little more than a tool for the plot (eg Susan for her aunt, Daphne for pureblood politics, Hermione for knowledge).

** 2 things

1. This subreddit greatly exaggertaes how much ice queen happens in fanfiction that goes double for bashing and a few other things. The issue is when its done its usually pretty trashy or awful.

2. I dont really have much of an opinion I like how most writers Write her in Slash fics a similar role as Pansy, Ginny, Hermione, or Milicent.

Basically to play the role of a fag hag. The inevitability of all women in Slash fics. If you arent bigoted or bashed you shall be a fag hag. It is known.

*** To point 1:

There might not be many Daphne fics around compared to Dramione or the canon compliant stuff, but she is undoubtedly popular and any fic with her (and Harry) in is guaranteed to get a lot of attention, which will make it pop up a lot earlier if you sort by favourites than most next gen or, for example, Bill/Fleur.

** *A/N :---*

This post is quite a large one explaining why, in my opinion, Daphne is probably the best girl for Harry. I have described her in every way possible /(traits, skills , characteristics, yada yada yada, you get the deal)/. So if you're not the one for heavy reading, you've been *warned*

What I have in my own mind for Daphne's Characterisation is that she's from a neutral pureblood wizarding family with a sophisticated lifestyle which contrasts to Harry's brash and reckless attitude and yet, complements it with her own. Harrys jumps in without a plan, She's the brains of the plans. He has any theories, She'll consider it (unlike Hermione in /Half Blood Prince/).

The point is that She's someone who has a different viewpoint on life as she's a Neutral Pureblood Slytherin and not a Death Muncher either. You want the traditional Light sided views? you have /The Weasleys/. Want a dark sided view? you got /The Malfoys/. You wanna some Grey or Neutral sided? Oops..we don't have those.

Daphne's /Fanon/ built character (considering that we have no canon background on her apart from an /assumed/ cameo in /Order of the Pheonix/ during the exams near Crabbe and Goyle and other Slytherins), depicts that She is The Perfect Slytherin of her house. Cunning, Ambitious, Resourceful and Adaptive to any sudden obstacles appearing between her and her goal. She wants to stand at an equal position to her partner (mostly harry with some rare instances of different pairings), colleagues, Lords, etc. The point being that she wishes to make a name for herself and not being tied down as a Trophy wife or anything around that spectrum '/shudders/'.

Her appearance is shown to be a Honey blonde haired (I like to depict her as a blonde, some fanfics do depict her as a ravenette), Smokey blue eyed, average height (not too tall or to short, just the perfect stature.) /Goddess/ of a woman/girl with /really/ more than average bust, hourglass figure and shapely legs that go on for milesssss..... {Just like [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] said, She's like Serena from Gossip Girl}

Her personality is like any Ice queen you can imagine, ice cold glares, Cold and distant way of talking, Stoic and aloof personality, Quiet but ready to defend herself, i.e. Independent. Acting like she's cut off from the world but rather, observing everything. Keeping away bumbling stalking too proud for their own good albino peacocks away from her and having a /really really/ smalll friend circle, like only Tracy Davis. And she /must/ know some /Freezing Charms/. ❄️❄️❄️

She mainly acts as Harry's exposure to the true workings of the wizarding world, the corruption system and the power chain of the goverment. Maybe to the Muggle businesses and Magical businesses.

{Help out in expanding this section cause apart from politics and Business exposure, I really don't have an Idea about it.}

Magical talents is all up to you, whether you wanna design her as a potion mistress, charms mistress, spell crafter, etc. Its all up to you. Her being a great Oculumens with an above average Legilimency ability is a must.

Mostly I like to normally bash Dumbledore, Ron, Molly, Ginny and rarely Hermione. You can guess About Albus /for the greater good/ Dumbledore. Ron, Molly and Ginny for the Potter fame and fortune and Hermione for being the best one out there and /i know what good for you/ attitude and bossy nature.

I apologise for describing her a bit too much about her every characteristics so, do forgive me '/fanboys HARD in the corner/' but, thats what I have in my mind She's also from a rich pureblood family so she's not for money and she doesn't value fame and glory considering her Ice Queen persona. So, that rules out any 'personal gains' motives. She's also has traits which contrast and yet complements them all the same. She's assertive, ready to take charge and is completely Independent to not act like a damsel in distress, waiting for her knight in shining armor. Thats another point for the queen.

All this make me believe that Daphne might just be the perfect girl for Harry. Anyways that's all on your opinion and your views. Im just here to share my thoughts. It was nice watching the discussion growing so much and helping me get more different views. (/Seriously, I didn't even know Gossip Girl, let alone Heathers. Thanks broys '/High fives everyone/'). So, */Thank You** from the bottom of my heart. You guys have been great, I'll see you next time. Till then,
