Not looking for the Sacrifices Arc or the usual bevy of 'neglected' or 'abused' Harry stories.

Hoping for live!Potters and some realism. While the family dynamic might be skewed by the famous sibling, they should still be a more or less normal family, without the pointless angst or inexplicable neglect and abuse.


** +Goddammit. There was this realtively okay one I read a while ago where Harry's younger by a couple of years brother has some weird magic shit that puts James in a wheelchair. Only thing else I can remember is that the brother has this weird jewel bracelet limiting his power and there something about Voldemort trying to Aizen his way into becoming god in Australia and some stuff about magic being shot towards the moon on Stonehenge but not sure about that I remember moon halos being important though.+

+Hopefully someone will be able to find it for you.+

Edit: Fucking found it. HA! linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7353678/1/][Fraterculus]])

  It may be Harry's little brother's destiny to save the world but it's up to Harry to make it so. Follow Harry as he struggles to keep his family safe while trying to have a life of his own. /Check out my profile for more details.

*** Thanks! I have read it, but that was a very long time ago. Good story. Pretty disappointing that more people don't opt for the organic tension that would arise from Harry having a BWL/GWL sibling, going instead for the contrived angst of extreme abuse/neglect.

Amazingly, the story has recently been updated, which is just awesome.

** linkffn(5010738), /Unto the Breach/: AU. Two Potter brothers, one marked as the Dark Lord's equal, the other not---but both with a touch of destiny about them. Will Harry be pulled into darkness, or can his little brother Edgar save him? A different 'brother of the Boy-Who-Lived' story. [On hold - work in progress]

Note: *very* on hold
