So I've been reading a lot of Hermione/Snape time-travel fics lately, and I got curious if this was a thing. Where Hermione travels to the past, falls for Snape, Potters still die and they raise Harry. Would be cool if they raised him all bad-ass, but anything is of interest. Except evil-hermione, evil-Harry, etc. No joining Voldemort or anything like that. :D So, anyone seen/read/written anything like this that's not complete shit? :D


** That's a melding of two already somewhat (Snape raising Harry) and very (HG/SS timetravel) niche themes, so it's unlikely that there's any such stories, and even in the event that such exist, the likely small number combined with the rarity of good fics almost guarantees that they'll be shitfics.

*** doubtful that they'd all be shitfics, considering SSHG has a higher chance of being written well than Severitus, just statistically speaking... I know there are fics where Harry gets de-aged and Snape and Hermione take care of him. Most SSHG writers who write interesting plots, though, ignore the time travel idea in favor of making the age difference work.

** I'd totally read this, too, if it's sufficiently well-done. It's a great plot-bunny, anyway!
