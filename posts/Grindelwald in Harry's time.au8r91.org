Hi, I'm looking for stories where Grindelwald is a main player in the plot, but necessarily set in Harry's time (either his childhood years, Hogwarts years or adult life), not having a character travel back in time.

Preferably Harry-centric, and the longer the better, but other than that I'll take absolutely anything :)

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

Has Grindelwald be a player in Harry's time. Yes, the fics summary makes it sound as if it belongs to a certain subgroup of fanfics. But so far, no.

  A massive change to the time line creates a world where Harry Potter attends a different Hogwarts. When he meets Hermione Granger again, dark clouds gather, and Harry has to deal with the challenges of being a hero. Harry has a clue, but his enemies are deadlier than canon. Year 4. Some action, some politics, some banter.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

It's a great story, but as with much of Voice of the Nephilim's work, it's not a feel good story.
