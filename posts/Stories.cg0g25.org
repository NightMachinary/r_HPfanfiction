I'm not against Slash and I do read some but why is there an increase number of stories in fanfiction.net. Most of the stories are slash. Only some authors going for het/general in the mature section.

Most? I just went to ff.n and sorted to show M-rated fics in English. On the first page, we have:

​

Hermione/Draco (3)

Hermione/Snape (2)

Remus/Tonks

Fred/Female OC

Ron/Daphne

Snape/Lily

Harry/all-female harem (2)

Harry/Katie

Harry/Ginny

Harry/Hermione(2)

​

No pairings (4)

​

Harry/Male OC

Ginny/Bellatrix

fem!Harry/Susan

Sirius/Remus

Charlie/Male OC

Hermione/Bellatrix

​

By my count that's 6 out of 25. Hardly most. Doesn't even seem like an increase to me.

*** Out of curiosity, I decided to check the below-M ratings. The most recent uploads are:

Voldemort/Female OC

Draco/Hermione

James/Lily (3)

Harry/Daphne

Harry/Hermione (2)

Remus/Female OC

Harry/Ginny

Neville/Hannah

Snape/Hermione

Harry/Fleur (2)

​

No Pairing (9)

​

Various, het and slash

​

Albus/Scorpius

​

That's an even smaller percentage of the most recent fics that include slash.
