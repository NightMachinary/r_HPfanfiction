** Mine is a series of reviews on The Dark In Peace from some guy named meech macko who complained that my 22-4ish (it's been a while) auror Harry wasn't in a committed relationship with Ginny and was instead going on various dates with two different women.

He pretty much just said "your Harry is always just a playboy sleaze in all of your fics" which is almost hilariously false. And complained that "Harry was just knocking women up!" Which, well, didn't happen at all. I don't think he understood being an adult or the connotation of "knocked up"

The best part though was the guest review that came a few minutes later agreeing with everything he said in the exact same diction with the same vocabulary.

Weirdly it's reviews like that that made me give up on DiP. I wasn't really enjoying writing it, then spam of reviews whining that everyone isn't happily married with kids at 22. Ugh. I actually wound up so burned out after that I gave up fanfiction for years until i got conned into writing Vitam Paramus

** Someone once registered an account on FF.net just so they could meticulously go through each chapter of my story and rant about how muggles are evil, wizards are wonderful, and anything and everything that involves American culture is horrific and that I was a complete and total moron. There may have also been some death threats. Now, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Iron Lady) is about Harry being raised by muggles, specifically an SAS Major, so that he can help unite the muggle and wizarding worlds when the next magical threat arises. So I wasn't really sure why they were reading my story, since it blatantly is about how muggles are actually pretty smart and wizards can be kinda dumb about some stuff.

As for the American culture stuff, what made it really hilarious was that it wasn't brit picking, it was random rants about how guns are evil, America is evil because all Americans love guns, and that the American military is responsible for all the worlds woes. I didn't have Harry raised by an American family, it was a British one.

Eventually they just gave up, but it was kind of amusing to have each chapter reviewed 2-3 times by this individual as a guest or on their account just so they could go off on me.

Here is one such review. Note that the reviewer is obviously a native spanish speaker.

*Well... A strange chapter...

The reunion, OK... But then, thanks to Alastor, we see how it's absolutely impossible that Dumbledore don't know Prewett's real intentions, nor Harry involvement with the British army, thanks to Harry "home shield" and the fact he have a mitary weapon (obviously saw by Alastor eye)...

And the part of Petigrew? The Weasleys see how the rat transform into a man... and they attack him without any thought!? They know NOTHING about him and they attack immediately? The man could be imperioused, brain damaged, without any memory, or ten other explications... The attack has no sense!

The training in magic combat and "air combat" it's totally logical... Probably the quiddich players will be much better and stronger, as they train physically and fly often...

And then, "brainwashed Harry" making gun propaganda!... Oh, dear!... No, Harry. Guns aren't "brilliant tools". Guns, in adults hands, are murdering machines, in child's hands, are only a premature death wish.

Obviously Harry don't know EVERY YEAR, more than a hundred children kill themselves in gun related accidents (800 adults), 20.000 children are wounded, and 75.000 persons are wounded or killed?... Why, all this deaths? EEUU, a gun armed country, has a homicide rate of 4/100.000... Any European state, with very few guns, 0.7/100.00... Harry. Guns don't protect your loves ones, guns will kill them.

And, not, Ron. Gun will not make you safe. Aurors have guns? Not. Why? Not because they don't know, (a lot of Wizards are muggleborn), but because guns are totally useless against wizards... As simple as that...

PLEASE, DON'T PROMOTE GUN USE BY CHILDREN. PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY...*

*** I've had people complain when I include guns in my stories on "accuracy" grounds because "they don't have guns in Britain". They might not be aware that the gun ban only bans handguns (hunting is still a thing), that it was not in effect until 1997 (this surprised me, too), and that some police in Britain /do/ carry guns (they're called firearms officers).

But besides all that, the most important fact they're missing is that /Vernon had a rifle in Book 1!/

*** I've always been shocked at how irrationally afraid of guns a lot of people are and how many lack a basic understanding of guns. I was actually pleasantly surprised that only one person chastised me for having gun violence in 1952 Britain in the last chapter of a fic I'm working on. When the guns used were WWII Lugers taken from German soldiers by British Soldiers. Doesn't seem unreasonable to me that down-on-their-luck former soldiers would have those. I expected way more 'there are no guns in Britain!' comments. So that was pleasant.

A ton of Europeans I've encountered in fanfiction and on my travels abroad also simply don't really understand how it works in America. I spent five years in Chicago and currently live in Milwaukee, two of the most 'violent' cities in the United States by most studies and have never felt threatened.

The commentary that 'stricter gun laws reduces gun violence' has been disproved quite often. Chicago has some of the most gun violence in the United States. It also has some of the, if not the, strictest gun laws in the United States. Gun related crimes in Milwaukee dropped drastically and have stayed consistently lower since Wisconsin passed legalized conceal carry.

I myself am not a huge fan of guns. Yet I do possess a concealed carry permit and I do own a handgun. It spends 99% of it's time in a locked safe in my bedroom. I go to the range maybe once a year with friends and honestly more often than not forget to buy bullets. I've never once felt like I possess a 'murder machine' but I took the gun safety classes and what not to get said permit. It's really not that dissimilar to getting a driver's license.

I used to live in a rather high-crime area where armed burglary wasn't uncommon. I figured I'd take a better safe than sorry route. Our local sheriff at the time even went as far as putting out Public Safety Warnings that if an armed assailant is in your home, chances are the police will not be getting there in time.

But the issue doesn't come from guns. That's the part that isn't often realized or understood. I'm not going to get hyper political here, but it's purely about political support and money.

In Milwaukee, it is a felony to own a gun after begin convicted of a felony. Yet when arrested in this situation it's something like half the cases are never charged, and 75% of them that are spend less than a year in Prison when the 'minimum sentence' is something like ten years. The Cheif of Police in Milwaukee, Ed Flynn, a couple of years ago, had a quote along the lines of 'how am I supposed to clean up these neighborhoods if we can't even arrest felons with guns?'

The problem comes with people too quick to jump on firearms. A few years ago a convicted felon out on parole here shot and killed a little girl. The media outcry was 'we need more gun control, see what concealed Carry has done!'. The felon never possessed a concealed carry permit, and was commiting another felony by even having the gun. A felony that is equally as likely to not be prosecuted as ti is to be. 'Stricter Laws' aren't the answer when you're already not enforcing the laws on the book.

...that got away from me a bit. I guess I just really dislike ignorance toward guns.

** "I am not a Dumbledore hater..." followed by 1000 words or so of Dumbledore hate, including things that didn't happen in canon. The chapter wasn't particularly kind to Dumbledore to get this person mad in the first place.

People asking for a Harmony pairing in /The Accidental Animagus/, in which Harry and Hermione are adopted siblings. A couple of reviewers persisted in this even after I challenged them on how wrong it would be.

Another reviewer for /The Accidental Animagus/ called me a Fudge-supporter after Sirius /voluntarily/ gave up compensation for his imprisonment in Azkaban for other gains. The same reviewer accused me of hating Harry because he didn't learn the Patronus Charm in third year (which he didn't need to) and thus supposedly wasn't as good as canon!Harry.

** I think one of the weirdest reviews and subsequent message chains I had on FFN, was when some guy declared my story The Bloodmoon Rises bullshit because "There actually is a vampire at Hogwarts". I was really unsure what he meant. Did he mean Snape? Did he mean the vampire that came to Slughorns party?

Turns out he meant a vampire Professor who has been mentioned *once* in the notes of Rowling, but never saw use in the actual novels afterwards. That is such an obscure piece of trivia that I can't even find it anymore.

He did not like my dismissal of that information. Oh no, sir, he did not. He went on and on about how I dismiss canon, while spewing fanon in crazy amounts. At the end, when I just gave up on responding, I was just amazed that there are people who are obviously passionate about their fandom, but so unbelievably ignorant about its canon - to a point where /the movies/ could disprove them.

** In my story, which is a time-travel do-over job, Harry deliberately brings Sirius chocolate (to help him recover a little from exposure to Dementors) from the Dursleys' house when Sirius approaches him (as Padfoot) at Magnolia Crescent.

Because I had Harry give said chocolate to the transformed-Sirius, /knowing/ that the dog was in fact not a dog at all, I got a bunch of reviews from people telling me "You do know that chocolate is poisonous to dogs, right?", and "You shouldn't give dogs chocolate, you know".

The amount of patronising just got out of control. Of /course/ I know that chocolate is very bad for dogs, and people are willing to suspend disbelief when it comes to magic spells and broomsticks and all the stuff in HP, but somehow /not/ suspend that same disbelief when Harry gives an Animagus chocolate.

And I'm /still/ getting reviews bringing this up, even though it's now less than halfway through the current length of the story, /and/ I try to make my reasoning clear in /the very next chapter's/ author's note.

#+begin_quote
  I had to stop reading midway. This story was completely awful. Couldn't find the challenge in question; the humor was dry, the racism towards Arabs noted, and the hatred for US patriotism for besmirching Saudi Arabia, the US's closest ally in the Middle East and treasured ally who received 90 billion in weapons contracts every year by the US gov't, is noted.

  The attempts to make it seem like a hollywood film made it feel like you really didn't have any ideas of your own. It was also incoherent and not so much meta as... just random bits of story you seemed to put together with no real plan, plot, or anything noteworthy.

  This story was just an utter mess. Not much else I can say. I read your bio, I suppose it's your generation that may also be a problem, as older generations seem more bigoted and intolerant than we, the Millennial generation, who are more empathetic and humanistic in our values compared to you warmongering monsters who continue to tout peace while being complicit in wars and genocides like Iraq without much thought on any long term plan or the human cost for both our soldiers and civilians who unfortunately get caught in the crossfire of drone warfare.
