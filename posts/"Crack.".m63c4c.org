  I'm not trying to police anyone or to assume that folks who throw around the word "crack" to describe their fics are malicious.
#+end_quote

No, you're just trying to imply it because you know no one would take you seriously if you actually presented that argument.

** When people use the term “crack fic,” they are not thinking about crack cocaine, and this fic type is not tied to racism. It's a specific type of fanfiction that goes beyond humorous into the realm of absurdity. I'm not sure how the term for this type of fic originated per se, but this is what people use it for. I think you're trying to create an issue where one doesn't actually exist, that being of crack fics being related to crack cocaine and then to racism.

*** In regards to the origin of the term crack fic here's a quote from TVtropes.

" Crack Fic is often considered the result of a challenge, either from someone outside the author or from the author him/herself: "This idea is completely unworkable, but I bet I can /make/ it work." The name stems from the notion that [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs][the author must have been ingesting some illegal substance just to]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs][/think up/]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs][the idea, let alone write it]].

*** Language can be hurtful and oppressive even without conscious malice from the authors' part. I'll never use the word "crack" in the context of fanfiction now that OP has brought this up.

*** Congratulations that you came up with a facetious comment I guess? I'm pretty straightforwardly talking about crack cocaine and the allusion to it when describing fics, not the verb.

** The biggest problem with crack cocaine is that racists use its existence as an excuse to hurt people of color. But that's not a problem with crack, it's a problem with racists. If it weren't this, they'd find another excuse. Racists would survive a nuclear war, just so there would be someone being a bigoted dick in the irradiated wasteland that followed. The fuckers are like evil cockroaches. You can't get rid of them by doing something as easy as avoiding a few words and phrases when titling fanfics.

Compared to the hydrochloride salt (i.e., powder cocaine) taken orally, freebase ("crack") cocaine by inhalation has way faster kinetics, which makes it a somewhat greater addiction risk. In reference to the kinetics difference between crack and powder cocaine, "crack" is a decent description for some of these stories, because they do tend to pack a lot more humor into less reading time. All we need to make the similarity perfect is to have a group of bigoted, violent people attack the people who like crackfics for no good reason.
