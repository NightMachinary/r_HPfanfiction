I'd just enjoy something moderately fluffy about Harry finally getting the family he's always wanted.

I'm looking for het here, not mpreg. I don't care if the baby is planned or accidental. Or even if the mother dumps it with him and runs - though I'd prefer him getting to anticipate the birth some. Any pairing really - Ginny's not my favorite, but if the fic's good I'll read it.

Something along the lines of linkffn(beltane child by white angel of auralon).

  Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?

** I just caught up to The Space Between by YelloWitchGrl, linkffn(10890018), which focuses heavily on family, but also has a great plot. It also has the most realistic depiction of Ron and Hermione's marriage I've ever found, so there's that.

Northumbrian's "Strangers at Drakeshaugh", linkffn(6331126) and little0bird's "The First Day" linkffn(4367121) and "Questions and Answers" linkffn(3954448), also feature Harry as a father. I love the first - it was my first harry potter fanfiction ever - and the other two are great, if a bit angsty.

frombluetored's "Put Your Gun Away, It's Tea Time" linkffn(12096051) and its sequel "Put Your Curse in Reverse" linkffn(12121323) are excellent, and has some of the most fun Harry and Ginny interactions.

All of them feature Harry/Ginny because they're my otp, with Ron/Hermione being next, and I hope you'll grow to like everyone's (my) favorite fiery freckled redhead.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  Harry and Ginny's lives have finally evened out. They've faced trauma, and loss, more than most have, but they've fought hard to find a normal. If only things could stay that way... Old enemies find new ways to seek revenge. A/N: This story will flip between POVs, including the children. This is needed to build the story, but I wanted to warn readers just in case that isn't your

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there. (Sequel, switches POVs)
