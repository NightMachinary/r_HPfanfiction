I'm writing a Slytherin Harry fanfiction and I'd like any references i can get! I already know about Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. I'm writing canon-compliant style but that doesn't mean a non-canon-conpliant fic won't help. If you have any advice I'd also like to hear that too!

**** I think it's a 'must read' when it comes to Harry in Slytherin. He's not over-the-top evil, he's not an 11-years old politician, and he's not smarter and stronger than both Dumbledore and Voldemort at the age of 11. It's a damn shame the story is abandoned

** linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure)

I think the great thing about that is it doesn't rely on the tired 11-year-olds-are-politicians tropes you've seen a million times. Stories like Prince of Slytherin manage to be great in spite of those tropes, not because of them.

I think a story where the Slytherins are like the Drones Club from Jeeves and Wooster would be about a million times more interesting than reading yet another fic about how the Dark families are doing this, and the Neutrals/Grays are going to vote this way, and “Heir Malfoy, please believe that Heir Potter meant no offense when he didn't take your hand. Don't forget Heir Potter will have ten-thousand wizengamot seats once the Black heir dies in Azkaban” or some such nonsense.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

*** Nah, I'm going canon compliant. Potters aren't a part of the sacred 28 and I don't think they even had a wizengamot seat. Also I don't think I'll incorporate too much politics.

**** All I can say is good. 11 year olds don't do politics.

I can't help but mention that the books never actually said what the hell being on the wizengamot meant and never really explained anything at all about it, so pretty much anything you do with the wizengamot is canon compliant by default.

** One of my favorite slytherin harry fanfics is called Leo Inter Serpentis. It's just the story of harry potter, but he gets sorted into slytherin and befriends Draco, who replaces Ron in the golden trio. The story doesn't drastically change, but there are a few subtle changes that make sense when you think about it.

** I'm enjoying this series (still in progress):

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/539758]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1973944]]

This is a darker short fic:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28165626/chapters/69015786]]

And these are some short fics that probably won't be helpful but will hopefully make you feel good after reading them:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5761591/chapters/13275517]]

I recommend exploring the Slytherin Harry tag on AO3. Usually the stories that are well-written try to avoid cringey tropes or otherwise do them well, like having a snake pet. The trick with canon-compliance is understanding that a Slytherin Harry by necessity cannot be exactly like the book version with just different colored robes. Balancing the underlying spirit of canon with refreshing twists that come with the different House make for an interesting story.

#+begin_quote
  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** Harriett Potter is sorted into Slytherin and definitely belongs there - because she'll do whatever it takes to reach her goals - in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). The depiction of eg Draco is more positive than canon though (perhaps because Hogwarts is Pureblood-only). Similarly Hermione in linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) is very focused and driven.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
