I had an idea that sounded interesting. Everyone writes ron as being overly jealous (at least in typical cliche fics). Why shouldnt harry be overly jealous. But of EVERYTHING. And when he gets jealous he lashes out and uses his fame to cover it up or turn the tables. Example: Hermione gets better marks- Harry frames her for cheating or something in their final exam, so she is disqualified, and must retake the year. Idk. Tl;dr a super jealous harry slowly kills or socially ruins everyone he comes across, because in reality he is totally useless. Just a plot bunny... hope you like it.


** that sounds incredibly hard to read

****** No, if done really well It works, ie bojack horseman, but if it isn't done super well you'll just get a character who pisses everyone off including the reader with their bad decisions.

#+end_quote

Because a huge part of Ron's character is defined by his insecurities; Harry is, in large part, defined by his orphan status.

As it was already pointed out, this is prime for an unlikable character the readers hate. You have to make him sympathetic, so you'd have to make his jealousy revolve around his greatest desire: family.

The problem here is that there are a ton of people around to give the BWL a family and a Dumbledore written with the intelligence/wisdom he's said to have would try to give him one.

*** How about an AU where it is recognised that Lily stopped voldemort, not harry. In this au, harry is brought up believing he has some "divine right" because he is the savior's son. His jealousy revolves around the fact that most people are aware enough to see he is nothing. He is jealous of everyone being good at something. (Lily and James still die, but lily is hailed "the woman who sacrificed or something")
