I feel like I read an exceptional fic a long, long time ago with the above as the main premise. Does anyone have any recommendations, old or new? Please exclude students only a year younger than Harry.


** linkffn(Return of the Marauders by TheLastZion) has harry basically adopting this young metamorph girl, she later turns out to be petunia dursleys daughter who was taken away from them by umbridge to be put in an orphanage until she was old enough to be sold. BTW its AU where lily never died and sirius is alive , with neville as the boy who lived and harry is pretty powerful.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

*** I want to like this fic, but it seems very... off, somehow. Like how it completely glosses over all the things I want to see (like Harry's first classes), ignores important details (like why Harry didn't discuss his new "elf magic" with Hermione when he ran into her during the summer or why/when Harry fell in love with Ron -- especially since those are pretty major departures from canon), etc etc. I feel like the author had a decent story in mind but didn't bother to actually write half of it.
