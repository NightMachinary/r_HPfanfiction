Anyone have anything similar that they have read? I also really enjoyed linkffn(A place called home).

Both are light-hearted romance/family stories that focus on after the war.

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards, and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry just really doesn't want in.
