The character who played Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) was partners with Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix) at some point. He was also married to Emma Thompson, who played Trelawney. [[https://www.google.com/search?q=kenneth+branagh&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=kenneth+branagh+family][Check it out]]


** Worse, he cheated on Professor Trelawney with Bellatrix Lestrange. Which makes it especially horrific in Love Actually when she's all ðŸ˜¢ at Professor Snape for cheating on her, because you KNOW she's been there.

*** I coukd also see it being the slapstick style of professional Inspector Clouseau and his butler: Gildreroy keeps trying to obliviate Trelawney but she bumbles around, foiling his plans without realizing it.
