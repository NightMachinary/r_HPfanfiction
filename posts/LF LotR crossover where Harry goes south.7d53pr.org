Harry Potter enters middle earth in the center of a battle with orcs and men. He is a prisoner and eventually escapes I think. Goes south. Stuff to do with a village, becomes king basically and meets one of the blue wizards. Hopefully it wasn't an abandoned story I lost.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

**** Isn't this the one where he goes off to Saruman and stays with dwarves? I don't remember him going south at all to the men there. There was the time with the people near lonely mountain. None of it involves him going south and becoming King of that region.
