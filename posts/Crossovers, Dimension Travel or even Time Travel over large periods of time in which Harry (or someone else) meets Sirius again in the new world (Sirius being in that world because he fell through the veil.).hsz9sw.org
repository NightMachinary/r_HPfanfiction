I am aware there are several of those but I've lost track of the ones I read and enjoyed except this one: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15780963?view_full_work=true]]) It's slash.

I know a few more dimension travel and crossover stories but they don't have Sirius get there via the veil.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** um, the Bonds series works. He follows Sirius into the Anita Blake universe. Fair bit of power-wank, among other despised tropes, especially in the first installment, but you can easily skip it if you like. Slash. I only have vague ideas about wtf is going on in the other fandom (I read one book and didn't particularly like it), but managed fine with the story because shit was explained for Harry's benefit.

linkao3(23919460; 24277744)

If you want to go straight to Honor Bound (the crossover), then here's a spoiler-rich summary and you can avoid helpful goblins:

Harry realizes that Sirius is alive, gets handed a whole list of blocks on his magic and shit like that from Gringotts, hides away in Grimmauld Place with the portraits and a time turner he stole and studies like hell because evil dumbledore is manipulative. He breaks the blocks with the help of the portraits. Then he jumps through the veil, the horcrux dies in the void, and part two starts.

  Harry stepped into the Veil in the Chamber of Death in the Department of Mysteries and steps out into a new - and strange - world in search of his godfather Sirius Black.But Harry should beware: the differences between the two worlds are more than skin deep and if he isn't careful even the most ancient bonds of blood and trust won't be enough to save him when someone in St. Louis starts slaughtering vampires for their power.A Harry Potter/Anita Blake Crossover

  Harry has started learning the ropes in his new world, will he survive the deeper he goes or will it drag him under? In the tense and delicate power structure of St. Louis a single misstep could be lethal. With a past cloaked in mystery and a godfather trying to keep him safe, he's drawn the eyes - and attention - of several powerful players in St. Louis's preternatural community.Not all attention, as Harry very well knows, is positive.However, Harry isn't the only one causing mayhem in St. Louis, and a secret that has been carefully kept from him may be the undoing of all that he has managed to build.
