Looking for any (ideally complete) fics in where for any reason, a Víctory for the light side ended up being the worst possible scenario in hindsight.

The day Harry defeated Voldemort would be seen as the day when shit truly started hitting the fan.

Think of /Anything but Slytherin/, but it doesn't need to be so bleak.

*** As a fan of this trilogy, I have some remarks about your summary though:

#+begin_quote
  There also exists a ritual that, when a two people have sex, one can force the other to permanently "bond". When a person is bonded as such, from then on the bonder can access the bondee's magic as if it were their own (essentially, one person becomes magically weaker and the other becomes magically stronger).
#+end_quote

This is not a ritual. It's merely something that magically happens in this world without any party having any real control over it. The number of people who could stop this from happening can be counted on 1 hand and always involved special one-of-a-kind circumstances. I think this distinction is important.

​

#+begin_quote
  Initially the reader supports Voldemort because, well, this system is horrible.
#+end_quote

WTF no!! Voldemort is always protrayed as an insane mass-murdering megalomaniac terrorist. At no point does he even try to be the good guy.

​

#+begin_quote
  There's no real good guys.
#+end_quote

Harry's faction is very much "the good guys".
