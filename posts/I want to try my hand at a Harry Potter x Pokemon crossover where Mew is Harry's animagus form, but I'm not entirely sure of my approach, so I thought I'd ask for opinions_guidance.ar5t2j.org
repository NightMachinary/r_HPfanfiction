My inspiration is 'Harry Mewter' ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4826372/1/Harry-Mewter]]), which I think does a fine job with the whole Pokemon-animagus concept. I like how Harry is learning of his role as a Mew through the story, his growing distance to regular people, and that Ron and Hermione also got their own forms, too. There were a few small grievances I've had, such as the pretty loyal stations of canon and a plot twist I thought was coming based off a certain graveyard scene that did not come. Overall, it was a casual story I enjoyed, but I'd like to go a bit deeper and tackle it from some different angles.

Anyone who might be interested please consider giving me some advice/your thoughts, even if it's just what you'd want to see in this kind of story.
