***** Author littlewhitecat on ffn has a series where the Order bring Harry back after he's mysteriously disappeared, only to find he's an Inquisitor. Hijinks ensue, and it's super fun.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

******* Different than [[/u/Sam-HobbitOfTheShire]] I, and many others from request threads over the past months, greatly enjoyed that series. Also often, like in my case, with absolutely no knowledge of Warhammer at all before reading it.

So I would say to just give the first part a try and check for yourself.

******** Basically this. There's some jokes that rely on a basic understanding of WH40K, but honestly just reading this fic will let you pick up quite a bit.

The one thing to really remember is that in WH40K, generally speaking millions-billions of people die pretty much every other day, and in horribly graphic ways, so Harry/Carrow finds the threats of canon laughably quaint

*** I can prepare a dataslate if you'd like.

But basically it was just a funny thought i had that i ran with. I mean the galaxies a big place. So there might be a few HP's running around.

The guard regiment wouldn't just be one regiment but more like a bunch of Harry's from a few different regiments. So we'd have a fee different Harry's from catachan, cadia, vostroyan, vallhallen, etc.

The space Marines are self explanatory.

The tech priests are there for flavor and general heresy accusations.

And the depressed psyker would probably just be the actual Harry but he's a sanctioned psyker so you can imagine how fun that'd be.

I even thought about throwing a freebooter in there for shits and giggles.
