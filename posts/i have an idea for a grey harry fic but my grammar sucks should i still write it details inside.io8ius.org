the idea is that grindelwald receives a vision in 1981 that shows bits & pieces of voldemorts reign . He also receives a vision that harry potter will defeat voldemort. so breaks out to raise harry but because he is like 98 he's weak but still able to train harry after getting potions ect.

i believe harry would absolutely buy into grindelwalds ideology at a young age coupled with his abuse.

thus at hogwarts we have harry knolegble about magic & eager to learn. harry is stated to be powerful he just needed training.

harry would be sorted into ravenclaw & he'd continue his studies charming his teachers making allies in all houses. while grindelwald hides in the forbidden forest with the centaurs given sancutuary because of bieng a seer.

harry would eventually learn of the philosopher stone. & actually acquire it & give it to grindelwald

the flamells would die off as in canon. & grindelwald would become ageless like flamell. but im adding a twist. most people think of the elixer of life as a potion of youth /ageless. flamell only got it half right. which is why he looks so frail in the movies

the stone needs to be submerged in water from the pool of eaternal life in shangri la for it to produce the true thing keeping you youthful & ageless.

as alchemy originated in china

the paring would eventually be harry & cho to facilitate the shangri la plot and because its a super rare parring.

thats all of got at the moment

i love grey /dark harry but hate most fanfiction execution of the idea so this is my way of doing it

we have a smart powerful harry

a harry thats against both Dumbledore and voldemort

grindlewald is one of my favorite characters

a very rare parring

oh i also am not going to have grindelwald obsessed with the hallows i think if the wand failed him originally he'd give up that particular dream

i want honest opinions

would you read it?

should i have Dumbledore be manipulative? why or why not

should i have the trope of the ancient & noble houses

who at hogwarts do you think would buy into grindelwalds ideology? i plan to have obvious ones. Daphne greengrass. blaise. (due to his Italian heritage & ww2) anthony goldstien (hes supposed to be jewish so his grandparents could be camp survivors)

what about students from france & durmstrang. ?

igor karkarof i could see.

tell me your thoughts

thanks for any responses !

** Your grammar is fine, but the spelling could use some work. Spell check will work wonders for you.

I was with you until the weird twist situations. The China thing is an odd turn, and something that would not only cause me to roll my eyes, but also to give up on the fic at that point. Every other plot point is fine. The pairing is fine. Even the thing about the centaurs and whatnot is fine.

*** why is china an odd thing ?id think grindelwald would seek a way to restore his youth as that would give him an edge both magically also politically which he'll need & the elixir obviously is flawed as hell as it just stops you dying of old age. so your still frail n weak physically. & the pool of eternal youth is probably a thing in hp /somewhere/ some legends say its in china in shangri la

**** Because it came out of nowhere and isn't really necessary. You took what could be an interesting story, and made it some Indiana Jones thing for some reason.

** I don't really dig the China and the youth angle to be honest, I'd probably find it more interesting to read about how he'd overcome being an old as hell dark lord trying to get the young folk to follow him. But it's your work so do whatever, it's your show, you're the captain now. As for the grammar and spelling and everything, you won't get better if you don't write. I'd recommend getting someone to beta your work before publishing. Other then that, if you want to get better, you'll just have to take the plunge and write.

** For the grammar part, I would suggest Grammarly followed by a beta. Grammarly isn't perfect, which is why I suggest a beta after, but it helps a lot with the common grammar, punctuation, spelling, and homonym (their/there/they're, moral/morel, etc.) errors.

I'd say go for it, it sounds like an interesting story!

** If you want Grindelwald training Harry, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(10645463;13045929), can offer you some good ideas. I like the second one way better though.

98 is not old for a wizard, but 50 years in a prison can take a toll on his sanity. In "Reformed", he breaks out to avenge Dumbledore, he thinks he's reformed, but old habits die hard. Surprisingly, it's Hermione who's the most enthusiastic about his new cause.

Remember in canon, Xenophilius Lovegood proudly wears the Deathly Hallows symbol, also Grindelwald's sigil.

That's because it was the Deathly Hallows symbol long before Grindelwald appropriated it for his own purposes --- just as the swastika was used by many cultures over thousands of years as a symbol of spirituality and prosperity, before the Nazis decided to hijack it. I honestly think it was JKR's intent to mirror that subversion.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
