So I am looking for a fic where Harry is paired with Kelly Gibbs and escapes Dumbledore's clutches. He ends up in the USA with the Gibbs and at one point deposits his memories into a pensieve where the whole team watches his past and Kelly berates him. Also I think he is invited to join the American version of the DOM. Not sure if this fic is even still up, if anyone can point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.
