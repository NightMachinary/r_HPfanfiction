Has anyone heard of the fanfiction where Sirius becomes really good friends with Lily through Potions because the Marauders are ignoring him after pushing Snape to go to the Whomping Willow? Told from Lily's perspective.


** It isn't linkao3(glass of water by lyin) is it? Same premise but divination not potions.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

** Linkao3(In The Black by izzythehutt) and its sequel has absolutely fascinating interactions between Lily and Sirius and the rest of the Black family.
