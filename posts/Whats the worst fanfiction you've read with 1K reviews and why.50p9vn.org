*** Came here for Harry Crow. Was not disappointed.

The sad thing is, I kept reading. Past cravat-wearing Harry, past Harry telling McGonagall her entire subject is a lie, past idiot!Dumbledore getting beaten down so many times you have to feel sorry for him, past bitchy girls getting beaten up for getting in the way of the perfect couple.

I think I was about a quarter way through by the time I gave up, severely traumatised. There was no semblance of anything resembling conflict in the plot anymore. I have no idea what robst filled the remaining god-only-knows-how-many words up with.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

** HP and Methods of Rationality. I've read a few chapters and left because I find it unbearably pompous and from what I've seen from randomly jumping into later chapters and fanart done for the story the super (bratty) Harry is not the only character who went through personality transplantation. The idea sounds interesting. The writing itself is painful to read. That's just my opinion tho, I know many people love this.

** The Lie I've Lived. Author tried way too hard to be gritty and realistic, to the point where it comes off as shallow and petty. The characters act like caricatures of themselves, whitewashed to hell and extremely polarizing in their actions. The action itself gets bogged down in a lot of nonsense, and there's plot twists upon plot twists, just for the sake of complexity, to the point where you just roll your eyes because it's such a chore to read. Yet, people gush over the story because it has the Sorting Hat swearing a few times. The fic has very few redeeming qualities.

** Most fanfics I've seen with that many reviews also have a lot of chapters, and then it comes down to about 10 reviews a chapter. That's still not a lot. Don't get me wrong, I would love to receive that many reviews for every chapter...but it's mostly due to persistence, I think and not because it's extraordinarily good. Edit: Harry Potter and the Methods of rationality. It was well written but it destroyed the magic of the books for me

** I probably can't think of more than two or three with that many that I think remotely deserved it, but then I am a terribly pedantic reader and not anybody's target audience when it comes to fanfiction. I would definitely never use number of reviews as an indicator of whether something is worth reading.

** linkffn(Lord of Caer Azkaban) and linkffn(Poison Pen) immediately come to mind as fics, riddled with cliches, that just fail to be competently written.

I have no idea who is writing this tripe and thinks it's worth publishing, nor who's reading it and leaving /positive reviews/.
