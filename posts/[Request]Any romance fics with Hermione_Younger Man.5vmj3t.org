Any romance long or short smutty or no fanfiction with Hermione and a younger man


** I'm all for Hermione/Albus Severus. A potential plot could work like that:

Ron died in an accident 2 years after the CC event. Hermione was heart broken and severely depressed. Al, in his last year at school and still remembering the passionate kiss two years ago, tried his best at comforting her. Hermione greatly appreciated his nephew's help, and offered Al a ministry job close to her after his graduation. The family all approved and was happy.

Al, now a very confident and competent young man who also greatly resembled Harry, was actually falling in love with Hermione. Hermione, feeling increasingly lonely two years after Ron's death, was using her work as a distraction. So one late night, after several hours of overtime, the two.... You get the idea.

Despite their precaution at keeping this affair secret, one of the family members managed to piece everything together. Harry was livid: "Al! It is unnatural! You are such a freak in going after your aunt! This is a gross betrayal of your uncle Ron!"; "Hermione, Ron would be turning in his grave, seeing you committing such despicable act with your nephew!". Things fell apart, most of the family (still needs to be worked out who) were against them. One of more less savory family members leaked/sold the dope to the press.

The largest scandal since who knew when erupted, Hermione was forced to resign her Minister position. This humiliation however ignited her stubbornness and hardened her resolve: "Why is it wrong for a woman to be in love with a younger man? Al holds no blood relation with me. If we truly love each other, why can't we get together? We are going to show all of you that we mean business! And if you don't like us, then we are going to leave!"

Hermione was very rich at this point, making money not only from her salary, Ron's business, and also from her many good investments over the years. She was financially completely independent. Al, on the other hand, wrote 'bye bye' to Harry, boarded a plane with Hermione and simply left the country. (The destination could be any English speaking countries, although I prefer the US) They married upon arriving in the new country in a Muggle ceremony. Hermione was preparing Al to enter a Muggle university, while doing her own research at same time.

It turned out that during her last couple years as Minister, Hermione grew increasingly concerned about the rapid Muggle technology advance and the Status of Secrecy. She came to the conclusion that the greatest safety for the future of her children lay in space exploration and colonization. She initiated preliminary research at DoM to identify potential applications of magic in space explorations. Early findings indicated that magic was possible in outer space, and using portkeys to launch freight into LEO (Low Earth Orbit) was highly feasible and would greatly reduce the need for expensive rockets. Unfortunately, her resignation forced the termination of this research project at the British Ministry.

Undeterred, Hermione approached the three major private Space Exploration Companies (Blue Origin, Space X, Virgin Galactic), intending to reveal magic to them. She was rebuffed by Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, and was forced to obliviate people there. But Elon Musk of Space X (and Tesla Inc) already knew magic (magicals in family?) and was ecstatic that someone from magical world had identified this opportunity. They immediately formed a team and began planning...

** Canon, technically. Ron is younger than Hermione by a bit more than 5 months, and we don't know how much she might have aged over and above that from using the Time-Turner for a year.

** im looking for the same, Crossgeneration Fics. Depending on the Mood, i would also read Fleur and a Younger Man/Boy. I only know a couple of fics including albus or James with Hermione and they are mostly Oneshots. Since i read the first Chapter of "finally 17!" (include Rose and Harry), i hoped it would also have either James or Albus with Hermione because in the first Chapter there is a teaser scene with this. Unfortunetly, it never happened, but i grew only more eager to read one after reading "Not Ron" (Oneshot, no sex, just romance and i love it) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11571337/1/Not-Ron]] and scenes from an Affair (also Oneshot, including affair with James and Hermione) [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hermione%20Granger*s*James%20Sirius%20Potter/works]] Still, i would like to see a continuation of Scenes from a Affair or a "just romantic" fic
