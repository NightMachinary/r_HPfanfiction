Any GOOD fics where Harry is pitted against Ron using valid reasons. Not the usual crap where the Weasleys are stealing money and feeding him love potions.


** Do you mean fighting or competing?

** I like the idea of Harry being pitted against Ron in the Duelling Club if he was put in Slytherin instead.

** And besides chess (and maybe quidditch) what could they possibly compete in that Ron would have a chance? He is an average student who is generally lazy and avoids work. That is not the mindset to win any competition with the one who keeps defeating Voldemort.

*** Ron is well above average, but he falls in the "Overshadowed by Awesome" trope. We also never got to see how he'd have flourished on his own, since he saw Harry and Hermione as two more shadows he'd have to step out of, and he just didn't think it was worth the effort. That's why he always feels second best. He spends his entire life grasping at brass rings. He's not as good a student as Percy, Bill, and Hermione. He's not as good at quidditch as Charlie. He's not as popular as Ginny and the twins. And more than anything, he has no path in life. He goes with being an auror because that's what Harry wants to do.

“I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left --- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first."

**** Even if it is a trope, Ron would have to take on awesome. At thirteen Harry drove off 100 dementors. At fourteen Ron was jealous that his "best mate" was forced to engage in mortal combat and forced into a magical gladiator contest.

***** Well, he was taught the patronus charm two years ahead of everyone else and spent countless hours working on that singular spell. Harry's feats are few and far between, and is never suggested to be an extraordinary wizard, though he is more skilled in DADA than the rest of his year.

Harry got congratulations from all of the Gryffindors and they even threw him a party. Even then, Ron tried being supportive of Harry until he thought Harry was lying to his face. Harry's the one that started the argument. Even then, Ron was still looking out for him by warning him about the dragons. Once he had time to cool down and see just how dangerous the Triwizard Tournament was, he was right back at Harry's side, where he'd stay until three years later when influenced by the horcrux.

But try watching everything you've ever wanted fall into the lap of someone who neither worked for it nor appreciated it. But Harry stays beside him, even if the only accolade he'll ever get in that position is "Harry's sidekick".

Though, "jealousy" is just something that Ron has to overcome. Same way Hermione and Harry have their own flaws, attitudes, and behavioral problems. Harry's moodiness is actually a center plot point in the series.

******* My mistake. This was just the movies, though it does induce questioning as to why Charlie didn't tell Ron about the dragons.

But nevertheless, Ron was still 100% behind Harry, even going as far to call an Karkaroff out on his bullshit.

“/What?/” Ron bellowed furiously. “/Four?/ You lousy, biased scumbag, you gave Krum ten!” But Harry didn't care, he wouldn't have cared if Karkaroff had given him zero; Ron's indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him. (GoF Ch.20 p.360)
