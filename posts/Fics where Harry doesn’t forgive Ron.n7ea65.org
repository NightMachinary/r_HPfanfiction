I can forgive many of Ron's flaws, but him not being there for Harry during the Triwizard Tournament is, in my eyes, something that would've gotten him black listed from the best friends list for all time. I'd love to see a fic where Harry doesn't tell Ron to just forget it, but instead let's a bit of a vindictive side show. Thanks!


** It's discussed alot in "The Brave New World" by bellerphon30. Harry leaves to go to school in America and the not believing him for the triwizard comes up alot. It's Harry/OC. Books 6 and 7 divergent though.

** Just try the tag "Ron Bashing" in ao3.

(...that being said, I absolutely /love/ Ron. But that's your choice, ofc. Try Ron Bashing, without Molly/Ginny Bashing, because those tend to incline towards Dumbledore being evil.)

** Maybe not quite what you are looking for, but in linkffn(Fate by thetruesparton) there is a serious amount of distrust between Harry and Ron.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** I'm not making assumptions about you, but I've generally found that people who're concerned with Ron's attitude during GoF to be around the age of Harry during that book.

As I've gotten older, a bit of jealousy and anger on Ron's side of things - while unfair to Harry - has turned into much less of a deal breaker.

You can see JK's attempts to show that Ron still cares throughout this entire hormone-fueled temper tantrum. Like Ron (‚Äòs unfortunately timed) checking up on Harry during his floo call with Sirius.

Coming from a primarily HHr shipper, Ron is a great friend.

*** Unfortunately, I'm nowhere near Harry's age at that time.. however, if I were ever to find myself in danger of losing my life in a tournament I hadn't signed up for and my friends didn't believe me, I would never speak to them again. Trust has to go both ways. I couldn't care less about Ron's jealousy, we've seen it at other times in the book. It's this specific instance of being selfish and abandoning Harry when he needed Ron the most, knowing full well that Harry hated his fame.. it's unforgivable

****** Uh aggressive much when my words were don't even try that one Just thought you'd come nosing around, did you?‚Äù Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he'd walked in on, knew he hadn't done it on purpose, but he didn't care --- at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.

Then, when Ron told him that he maybe wanted to practise for the new interview, Harry absolutely lost the control, and threw a badge at him.

‚ÄúSorry about that,‚Äù said Ron, his face reddening with anger. ‚ÄúShould've realized you didn't want to be disturbed. I'll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.‚Äù

Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off.

‚ÄúThere you go,‚Äù Harry said. ‚ÄúSomething for you to wear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you're lucky. . . . That's what you want, isn't it?‚Äù

Harry and ron were both dickwads so saying harry was a dickwad and threw a badge at ron your literally excusing what ron does and thats the problem here your far too defensive for a 4 word response saying don't even try that one you ignore what the character you like says to fuel an argument ü§î but idk man aggressive much it fuckin happened in the canon.

******* Wow I'm excusing what Ron did by pointing out that Harry also did something? I didn't know that! Seriously, I'm not dealing with this. You're going nuts over me pointing out something from the story. I wasn't trying to fuel an argument, I'm actually trying NOT to get into a stupid argument with YOU. But you're being a trollish dick who uses emojis, so whatever. Disabling replies. Stop going so hard on me for making a single comment about Harry, jesus. Yeah I like Ron, so what?
