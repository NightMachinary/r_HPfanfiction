****** Anyone feel like the later books were in some way influenced by fanfic? We know JKR read fanfic, and I feel like they kind of had a bit of a fanservicey feel to them in some aspects compared to the fifth book. Maybe it was because HBP was setting up for DH, but the relationship drama felt very out of place, and while DH is not as bad, it has moments that feel off for the characters

  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE

** robst, rorschach's blot, and a few others tend to have Harry snap. There's a funny story where Harry accidentally time travels during Goblet of Fire, ends up with Rosmerta after dating Amelia Bones who Sirius "steals" from him, mentors Harry, and effs a bit with the minds of Draco and Snape. SketchySituation on A03 has a a story titled "Oh and I'm sorry suddenly makes it all better." Potter's wheel by esama.
