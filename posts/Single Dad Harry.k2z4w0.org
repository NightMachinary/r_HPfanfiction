Hey! I LOVE single dad Harry, and I hoped you could recommend me the stories you have read about this, either long fics or just one shots and it can be Harry parenting teddy or/with his own kids. Doesn't matter the pairing the kids come from. (Sorry if something here doesn't make sense, my English sometimes is not that good ahah)


** It is a romance story, but there are many scenes of Harry spending time with his kids.

  How does one deal with a child who is different? Some do, some can't bring themselves to.

  Fifth Year: Harry fathers a child with Grace, a muggle girl he believed was his soul mate. Now she's gone and he's left to raise the babe on his own. However, Dumbledore, Mrs. Weasley and a few others don't believe that the baby is Harry's, but a plant sent by Lord Voldemort. Who is right, Dumbledore or Harry, and will they be able to deal and accept the truth? Occasional OOC.
