I'm looking for a Lily/James story that involves Lily and her friends playing a game around the castle where they have to (gently) hex each other for points. I believe it also has James using Polyjuice to be Remus on their Prefect walkarounds. One scene I also think I remember is Sirius and Lily taking the train home and Lily noticing that Sirius is unable to sprawl on the seat because he was taught to be so proper. Any help is much appreciated!


** OH, I think I remember that one! I looked through my FF and I can't find it though. Sorry! I've only recently gotten into favorite-ing stories.
