I had an idea but I know realisitically I will never write this because I can never get my head around time travel enough to weave everything together believably! If something like this already exists, please point me in its direction. If not, go wild. If you want...

/On Roxanne's wedding day, George Weasley finds a way to travel back in time to one month before the battle and save his twin. But he will have to live the last 30 years of his live over again from that moment onwards knowing what that action will cost him. He'll never marry Angelina, and Freddie and Roxy will never be born. George travels back, but will he carry out the plan? OPTIONAL TWIST: (If George ends up in the body of his younger self) Fred is aware of everything and will actively try to stop George from saving him./

  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE
