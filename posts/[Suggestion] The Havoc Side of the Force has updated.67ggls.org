** Am I the only one that has gotten a bit bored with this story?

It's well written, has good dialogue and the author knows the Star Wars universe quite well. But to me, it seems like it lacks direction. I can't figure out where it's actually going.

I was exited for new chapters earlier in the story, but not so much anymore.

*** The writing and the dialogue are interesting, and things are happening that move the story along. That's better than 95%+ of even readable fanfic, so I'm willing to give it some time to get back to events I'm more interested in.

*** I agree one hundred percent. It started out interesting but now Harry is so incredibly overpowered that theres no stakes in anything.

*** It entered tedious/boring territory around chapter 14 I'd say.

** It had absolutely awesome beginning. But somewhere along the way it kind of lost its way. I think Harry taking young Anakin kind of ruined the story's direction. Not sure where this is going, but ...

*** I actually liked that part. I think it could have taken another interesting direction by focusing more closely on young Anakin. I'm hoping it starts to aim more directly at the main storyline soon, but the Harry of this story could probably defeat canon Palpatine trivially, and that could leave the story aimless. The most recent chapter's HK portions are solid gold, though.
