For recommending the HP series to me, I want to gift a friend a printed copy of one or two fanfics from the top 5 from the sidebar.

How do you propose I do that - should I convert the epubs to pdf and then print the file? Or is there a better way?


** I would not recommend it. It's a sweet idea, but I tried to do it for my brother, and I wildly underestimated how much paper it would require.

So. Much.

** Are you sure they like fanfic? Be careful because people's tastes can vary wildly, even among the most popular fanfics, and some people don't even like the concept of fanfic at all. That's without even getting into the minefield of pairings.

** You'll need to ask them what stories they like. You really will need to. I honestly don't even like most of the stuff on the sidebar of any fandom recommendations.
