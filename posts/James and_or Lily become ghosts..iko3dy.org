Tbh I'm not sure if it's more accurate to say they become ghosts or create ghosts or leave ghosts behind, but you get the point. They die to Voldemort and then there are ghosts of them.

Any recommendations?


** Spirits in the Future by MillieW, linkffn(2299259). Lily and James are kind of just there, and don't have much purpose in the story, as I recall.

[[http://imagine.e-fic.com/viewstory.php?sid=735][On This Night]] by Lady Foxfire. I didn't care for the story that much, but the spirits of Lily and James are actually involved in the action.

Justice Served with a Side of Fries by Lady Foxfire, linkffn(6300111). I thought the story was a bit too pat, but Lily and James are involved in the action.

  Voldemort attacks the Potters, James and Lily tries to protect their beloved baby boy. Then suddenly they're in a house they do not know. Harry isn't with them and they don't know what happened. Where are they? And where is Harry? Award winner!

** I read a fic a while back where Harry gets the resurrection stone in HBP and is accompanied by Lily, James, and Sirius in “ghost” form. I'll try to find it.

I failed.

** Only linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions) comes to mind. It's the second fic of Barb's psychic serpent trilogy. James is a ghost in this one.
