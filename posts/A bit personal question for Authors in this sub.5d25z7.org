Roaming through the sub I very often see the replys like:

- I did it in my fic
- Oh! I already use it several times in my fics
- This plot bunny suits really well for my fic

Ok! Fine! Great! But how can I merge the redditname with ffnAuthor?

People! You are great in help and recommendations! Give me the a chance to find you are even greater in your writing


** I've got my ao3 name in my flair, which could be an option for people who don't have the same username across sites?

The stuff I write is not the stuff this sub likes though, so I tend not to promo it much because I recognize that I'm a minority here.

Same. Not that it stops me, but I do recognise the futility of it.

**** Yeah. I mean, I knew, just based on the LF posts and what gets requested a lot. But seeing the results of the survey really reinforced for me that this sub has a very common set of interests, and my writing is not of those interests.

That said, my tumblr followers seem to like my stuff, and I've got decent feedback on ao3 so I'm probably doing just fine. But it doesn't always seem worth it to bring it up here. The last thing I need is people whining at me for not writing Harry centric fic or whatever.

***** It's more appropriate for the admins to appoint a point-of-contact and be done with it. (We shouldn't have to pester some random admin for that.)

** I don't use the same username here that I do elsewhere because I like that degree of separation. Sometimes I do self-plug, but I don't like to do that too often as it seems rather conceited -- which it's not, it's just that what I write is sometimes one of few examples I know of that answer a particular infrequent request and I know no one else will suggest it if I dont . . .

OP, if you're interested in what someone says, reply to their post and ask for a link. Simples.

I've always been a bit shy about sharing my work here, especially since I've started writing barely 6 months ago and my stories aren't all that good at all compared to the gems that get shared around here.
