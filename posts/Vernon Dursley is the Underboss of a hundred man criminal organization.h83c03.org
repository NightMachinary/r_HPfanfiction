It would make things very interesting if Vernon Dursley was actually a member of a crime family. Him being an underboss and raising Harry well would make the plot go off the rails but also effect how Petunia and Dudley see the world.


** Maybe... But tbh, I always assumed that the reason Petunia married Vernon was because he was 'normal' and given how much she cares about her reputation and being completely ordinary, I'm sorry, but for some reason I can't really picture this...

*** Concept: Petunia is always spying on the neighbours and trying to appear normal /because/ her husband is part of an organised crime group... "always have a reason to walk through a door marked private", as the main character from Layer Cake says (he also says "I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine").
