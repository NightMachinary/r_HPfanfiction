So Cursed Child has been out for almost an entire year now. After reading it, I felt like I was reading poor fanfiction. It had some promising points, but was executed so poorly. Then I had the thought that someone would probably write a novelized fan-fic which could possibly retcon all the poor character and plot choices the official book made. So I decided to wait and eventually forget about it. Until today when I saw they're getting to release the final script version.

With a year come and gone, has there been any decent fics come out, whether complete or (currently) WIP, that attempt to retcon/rewrite the story? I've done a few searched on here, and googled a few pages worth of results, but most attempts I've found were left incomplete in the mid-to-late last year range. I didn't know if anyone had a promising project going or not.

I'm not really into the Scorbus pairing, as I've seen featured in the few abandoned fics I did come across, so I don't know if that would further limit any possible results.

*** This fic is honestly one of the most adorable fics I've ever read. Delphini is so cute, and the relationship between Harry, Hermione, and Delphini is beautiful.

** I cannot enjoy this fic as long as its main time-traveling plot is not ripped out.

If I were to fix it, I would make dimensional travels instead of time travels. I would have ASP find the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest, and an extra feature caused them to travel to alternate dimensions. The three of them, ASP, Scorp, and Delphi visited three such worlds, with the final one being ruled by Voldemort. Delphi betrayed them, and they barely escaped. They eventually made contact with the Resistance, then found a way to get reinforcement from the canon dimension, and together, liberated this dimension from Voldemort.

** Stumbled upon this one ages ago with the intention of reading it straight away but iv just been pushing it down my read list, so i cant really vouch for if it changes anything or stays true to the play/script, or of it does a good job or not, but its seems to be what your looking for. Its also completed.

  This is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child as a novel. From the perspective of Albus Severus Potter and sometimes Scorpius Malfoy. Dialogue and directions the same (except for one scene ahem). With added novel-ish character stuff.

*** I've read it (most of it at least-skipped a few chapters), it stays true to the play-there's a few additional scenes and one change. It's definitetly a good novel format of the play but it doesn't fix any of the problems I personally had with the play.

Furthermore, the author's attempt to make Ron less 'goofy' ended up making him slightly incompetent. In the novel he's taken over Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes completely from George and is failing to run the business without him. This addition was incredibly annoying-it didn't really change anything and only made Ron seem completely hopeless.

** It doesn't change the story of the play-but it did make me feel a whole heap better about it. They're Scorbus but it's very minor-I really liked the Potter and Weasley family dynamics.

Searching Ao3 by Cursed Child and looking at the recently updated/or complete might be helpful.

** I do think there are seriously interesting stories hiding behind the useless script. In fact the script itself points out the sheer incompetence and technical inadequacy of the script writers. I wish it didn't exist and my opinion of every person involved in creating the revolting thing, including JKR, couldn't be any lower, but it does exist, so . . .

I did start writing a story (and I still think it has a solid premise) but my writing confidence has hit rock bottom and real life isn't being kind to me, so I don't see it happening now. I hope somebody somewhere is writing something though. It needs a fix.
