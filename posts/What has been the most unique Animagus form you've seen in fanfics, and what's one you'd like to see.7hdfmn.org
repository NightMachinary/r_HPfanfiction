Myself?

The most unique one has to be - at least for me - Mew, which was done in the HP/Pokemon crossover linkffn(Harry Mewter)

One I'd like to see is Raptor - I mean, why can't animagus forms be those that are extinct?


** in weeb harrys form is an octopus and i think it was a cockroach before ? maybe the cockroach was in a different fic though...

linkffn(Weeb)

just in case youre interested theres a crossover fic with Jurassic Park where a dinosaur comes out of Hagrids Egg, (not Norberta) and becomes Harrys pet. The fic suffers from a bad case of Hermione bashing, who somehow doesnt even recognize a dinosaur

I mean what seemed a bit bizarre to me was the choice of the animals (although JKR has never really explained the mechanisms of animagi and this fanfic was, as I recall, basing it purely on luck). The animagus forms for the marauders seemed more believable. But a panther? More dramatic and less realistic, if you ask me.

Anyways, it's in the aptly named linkffn(Raptor) is a Harry Potter/Jurrasic Park fix that is a lot of humor, but also adventure and action where applicable.
