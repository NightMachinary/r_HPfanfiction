I'm wondering if there's any fics where Harry voluntarily gives up his magic to the Goblet of Fire. The reason for it could be anything, I'm curious to see what people might have written. Personally would prefer there be minimal to no romance, and no harems.


** I've definitely read one, I don't know who by, but it was quite short. Might have even been in one of those collections of ideas fics? It was pretty great, because by the time he makes that decision he's super over the magical world, so he's like ‘you know what? Fuck magic' and everyone is incredibly horrified and don't understand. and him becoming a squib made Voldemort a squib too, lmao

Possibly he retired to an island with Sirius? That's the end of a lot of fics though, so I might be confused

  My first attempt at writing. When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed that Harry would lash out angrily and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon.

** I'm pretty sure linkffn(Fates intervention) has this. Although I could be wrong with the name - I'm about 83% sure its called this

​

Edit: I found it linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11955570/1/When-Fate-Intervened]])

#+begin_quote
  Following the fulfillment of the Great Prophecy, the Fates decide that the Olympians' stubbornness is going to be the end of everything, and there won't always be a demigod around to help. So they force some quality family bonding time in the hopes that things might change. Percy just wants to know why it's always him. Time travel. If you don't like Luke, this may not be for you.
