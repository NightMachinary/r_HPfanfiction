Hello Witches and Wizards! I know there's a lot of this type of Fanfic but I think I already read most of it (some of them were too similar to each other and the interesting ones are sadly abonded or WIP).

This happened because I read this Fanfic by Tsume Yuki called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5273285][Ambrosial]] That's only the first chapter and I was already hooked and that triggered something in me. To. Find. More.

Please Please Please let me know if you have a story you can recommend. I'm actually looking for Fem!Harry cuz i love the idea of red hair and green eyed Harry cuz she looks badass in my imagination. (Example is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5356241][Flecks of Rust]] by Tsume Yuki also). But as long as the story is nice then i dont really care.

Thank you!

Summary: Harry is drinking his life away as usual. Suddenly, he's back in the past, 1943 to be exact. Harry's given a whole new chance at life as Harrison Evans and this time he's not planning on saving anyone.

Unfortunately, the Potter luck strikes again and Harry's sucked back into the conflict and face to face with one Tom Riddle. Somehow the more he tries to stay away the more entangled he gets.

Finished bamf Professor Harry who teaches Tom Riddle well written except that it isn't fem Harry and its slash ):
