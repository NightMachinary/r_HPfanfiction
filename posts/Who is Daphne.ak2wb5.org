I don't think Daphne Greengrass has ever been named in the books. If she has, then she must not have been mentioned many times.

Is she like an OC that the community made and now people just include her in their stories?


** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Daphne_Greengrass][This]] is all we know about her.

TL; DR: A slytherin in Harry Potter's year who's name was called with Granger's during the OWLs exams. And she's Draco Malfoy's sister-in-law. That's probably it.Also, a good looking blonde actress played a slytherin girl in OotP that probably might be Daphne.

As others have mentioned, it provides an opportunity for authors to show her as an example of a "Not all Slytherin are evil" concept. It also provides a different love interest +/ Ally in the enemy base to Harry who isn't related to Quidditch or Elder or in Auror Forces.

I'm fine it [yeah, it's just an OC with a canon stamp... But we've got Cursed Child too, heh?] and think the Ice Queen Trope is overdone. But a few of my favorite stories also feature her. Linkffn(11487772) - Post DH - A literal dork forced to Marry Harry.

*** Oh? I hadn't realized my whole “she's the ice queen, hair to the rich Acient and Most Noble Greengrass family. Her family is big in the potions market, and they have a seat or the Wizengamot*. They're a neutral family, mediocrely well off, and run a solicitors office in Diagon” was fanon. The more you know.

** Her name was used once in the books during the OWL exams. Author's likes to use her because she has no personality in the story and is still canon character.

** She's Astoria's sister - and Astoria married Draco according to CC, so she is, indeed, very much a canon character. I did notice that there is a big push in writing about her lately, probably for the reasons everyone else has mentioned, and I've seen some interesting stories that include her, usually paired with Harry. I think it's definitely fun to build up a foundation for a canon character that wasn't explored much!

** I think she's maybe mentioned once, but as some people used her a certain way other fanfic authors liked that way and did the same and now she's kind of her own character. Personally I think it's kinda cool the way that happens.

** Daphne Greengrass is named a couple times in all of the books. Very much a background character.

As for why so is used so often and with such prominence? Well she has zero characterization other than being a Slytherin and having a sister. The community wanted to pair Harry with another girl. Someone in Slytherin gives the chance to show that not all Germans are Nazis.

*** I see. One thing that has annoyed me about her is her lack of consistent characterization. While all stories describe her as attractive with blonde hair, her personality is never consistent so she just seems very Mary Sue to me.

I mean, she is consistently made out to be an 'Ice Queen'. Not every story, but it's her typical characterization. More on all of that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ndp93/discussion_origins_of_ice_queen_daphne/][here]].
