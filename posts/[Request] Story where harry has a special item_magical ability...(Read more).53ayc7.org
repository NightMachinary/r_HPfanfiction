I am looking for a story where either Harry has a rare magical ability he actually uses a lot or a story where he gets an item that is rare or the only one of it's kind and he actually uses it. Preferably 100k words+ but any will do <3

** Does the one-of-a-kind invisibility cloak count? Or a rare-enough-to-be-only-known-in-rumours ability to speak to snakes?

Because ... well, every story ever.

The (half-)jokes aside, you might want to take a look at some “gamer” fics as the very presence of such mechanics counts for a unique thing (I'm not linking that stuff because I simply don't know if you like such stories and I don't want to call for an unwanted wall of text from the bot), and some of the crossovers too (again, not linking any because I don't know if you want that; if you do, just reply and I shall dive through the stuff I have in). For pure---or at least not fully crossed over---HP stuff a quick dive through what I have gave me /“Inspected By No 13”/ (power of bureaucracy, short and complete; linkffn(10485934)), /“Wraithspeaker”/ (ability to speak to muggle ghosts, a bit longer though abandoned or something but ending in a good place and enjoyable overall, linkffn(5702750)), and /“A Black Comedy”/ (invisible magical hand ... things, longer and finished, linkffn(3401052)).

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Death was the first real memory Harry had, thanks to the wizarding world. He would return the favor, one day, as was only proper. After all -- their culture was simply too sick to survive. Vastly AU, pre-Yr.1 progressing.

*** I enjoy slight cross over kind of like it has him using items from the story or a slight use of crossover but I don't want to read any story where hes adopted by naruto or some weird shit like that :P But He never used parseltongue in most stories and the invisibility cloak is always an afterthought :(

** Linkffn(darkness ascendant) he controls the darkness, the only person who can. But he has to train to control it, it doesn't just work for him as he wants it to until he understands the 'physics/magicks' of it. For now he doesn't use it much but by fourth year he'll be using it fairly often because all of his enemies are in play against him.

A Black Comedy got linked. Hmmm, what else. The issue is, few people realize that if you mention a shotgun hanging on the wall in the very first scene then that shotgun is supposed to be relevant to the story, either as a murder weapon or the resolution of the story.

I'll come back and potentially add more as I think about it.
