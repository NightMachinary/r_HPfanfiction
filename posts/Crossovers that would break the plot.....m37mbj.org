I was reading a particularly weird crossover, namely /Star Trek: The Next Generation/ and /Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha/, and I have to wonder, what crossovers would simply break the tension of the /Harry Potter/ series?

I can't help but think that some of the /Persona/ characters, especially the ones that confront parts of people's souls, would likely be able to destroy horcruxes, though I'd imagine the dungeons that they manifested to defend themselves could be outright terrifying.


** Warcraft universe comes to my mind in that regard. Any warlock or death knight could just kill Voldemort and destroy his horcruxes by using soul-sucking magic... Could be fun to see Voldemort striking a deal with an Old God or the Burning Legion tho.

Dark Souls maybe too. What can you do against a warrior who just can't die ? You can murder him a thousand time, he'll just come back to fight again. Voldemort might want to get cursed as well for it does grant true immortality.

*** But I think that the part where the curse also enslaves you would be a deal-breaker for Voldemort.

**** It doesn't enslave you tho, just makes you lose your mind if you will falters. Strong willed people like good old Gael were able to carry the curse for ages

** I used to read a lot of Harry Potter and Percy Jackson Crossover with Harry being the son of Hades. So naturally, Hades takes great offense to Voldemort trying to escape his realm and destroys all Horcruxes, including the one inside of Harry, with little more than a snap of his fingers.

*** I've not read many /Percy Jackson/ crossovers. Of the one I have read, one had Percy thrown through time to the Triwizard Tournament(but Harry was just a normal wizard, not a demigod IIRC, and I haven't gone back to read it since it was updated), and one where he's a demigod, but not the son of the Big 3(Zeus, Hades, Poseidon), but the son of the spoilers:goddess Tyche

These are the ones I've read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1/Harry-Potter-Squatter][/Harry Potter, Squatter/ by Enterprise1701-D]](note: this fanfic is exceptionally fluffy and not to be taken seriously).
