:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember much about the rest of the story except for this part because it's so hilarious to me. Basically what I remember is the Dursleys being at Hogwarts during the final battle and then everyone who was injured in the hospital wing with them started throwing/spelling the furniture out of the windows to hit the death eaters. I don't know why I remembered it suddenly but now that I do I just really want to find it again. I'm pretty sure it was on fanfiction.net, but not completely.


** That sounds really familiar to me so i must have read it i will see if i can dig it up

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.

  Harry won the war against Voldemort but at a terrible price.Fawkes gives him another chance in a new world where he died as an infant and where Voldemort still lurks in the shadows...but not for long, because when one exists the other cannot survive. AU
