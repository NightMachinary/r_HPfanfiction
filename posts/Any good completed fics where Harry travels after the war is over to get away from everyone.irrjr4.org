Basically, I am looking for any fanfics where Harry, tired of his whole life growing up and all the devastation of the war decides to travel around the world after it's over, to get away from everything and live with some kind of normalcy and take a breath for once.

Along the way, he meets different people from around the world, some he connects with and some not. But people see the signs of his weariness and some even recognise the signs of war and slowly while travelling and with this, he starts to come to terms with it.

It can be in process if the updates are regular but I would prefer good, completed fics. Doesn't matter even if they are cross-overs, it would be even better if he travels in the muggle world. I would like it if he is travelling alone in them but I guess I don't mind if Ron and Hermione tag along. Any recommendations?


** This might not be quite what you are after but is is complete and Harry does open a cafe in New York.

** So... I have a fic that goes over Harry travelling and learning a lot of different magic and stuff, but it doesn't actually showcase the travelling itself. Harry basically goes back to his younger self after travelling the wizarding world for a few years and he celebrates the pagan holidays and all this shit and it's absolutely brilliant. It's called linkao3(Grounding Magic A-T). I recommend reading the other works of the series, as well, because the worldbuilding and characterizations are absolutely brilliant.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
