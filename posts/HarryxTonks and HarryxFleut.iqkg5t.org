:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a story I used to read and Harry practiced the “northern magics” which were basically chaotic magics that were forgotten and he falls in love with tonks who refuses him at first because of the age difference. He also has a deer familiar which can sprout water from its antlers because he saved its life with the northern magics. If anyone remembers this fic i would love help getting the name!
