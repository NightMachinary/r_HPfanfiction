** I don't have any recs for that, sorry. It would be an interesting angle to explore though. Not sure why the Death Eaters never seemed to target the Dursleys, in any way. Their house may have had protection but up to the end of year 6, I don't think they themselves did.

*** Depends on when they do it. The Death Eaters wouldn't be known to them properly the first time around, and not be a force of note until 5th year at the earliest.

** As awful as the Dursleys were, I don't think they'd do business with the people who killed Lily.
