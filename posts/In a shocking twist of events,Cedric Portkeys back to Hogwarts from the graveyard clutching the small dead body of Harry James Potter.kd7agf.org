** Cedric's breath was laboured. He was in shock as he tears fell for his once opponent, his classmate, his brief friend. Dead before him.

He barely registered the triumphant sounds of horns, the celebrating victory song, the cheers and applause. The abrupt stop.

​

The /screaming/.

​

"HARRY?! /HARRY!"/

​

It was the Granger girl, he thought. He didn't care. Nothing mattered. Everything was barely registered by him in favour of Harry's limp lifeless form and a harsh pounding in his chest. In his head.

​

'He's back he's back he's back HE'S BACK HE'S BACK HE'S BACK /HE'S BACK HE'S BACK HE'S-/'

​

"Diggory!"

​

Cedric startled, barely looking up. He met Headmaster Dumbledore's eyes and... never had he seen the old man. Look so broken. Never had he ever thought he would hear Professor McGonagall cry but a heart-wrenching wail of horror escaped her at the sight of her students body.

Snape stumbled backwards, looking sick. Moody... was grinning?

​

"What happened?"

​

"He's back..." Cedric muttered, so softly. Yet it pierced into the horrified silence. Everyone heard. "You-Know-Who's back..."

​

He looked around, dead eyed. Then he saw it. Saw Moody, saw how he started /grinning./ It clicked in place. How Harry's name had gotten into the Goblet of Fire. Who has changed the Portkey. Who had ensured things would go this way, that Harry would get so far just to die.

He was the one who he kept seeing talk to Harry out of class. Cedric's grief turned to rage and his wand was out before he knew what he was doing.

" AUFER ARMA!" A purple bolt of magic struck the wizard in the chest before he could react, his arms falling off. "DISCEDITAME!"

And with powerful blast that cut into the very dirt the bastard was thrown back.

​

"CEDRIC! STOP!"

​

"HE DID IT!" Cedric screamed. "HE SET HARRY UP! HE'S BACK BECAUSE OF /HIM/!"

​

Snape at least seemed to have some sense amongst the people present, immediately pointing his wand at the man, followed by a few others. Especially when they noticed the signs of bubbling on the teachers face.

​

"Professor Sprout." Dumbledore spoke, his voice grave. Cedric felt his heart ache, having never heard the man sound so broken. Cedric couldn't look at him, nor Hermione who was wailing uncontrollably, holding onto Ron who stood still, mouth open in horror. Several other Wealsey family members seemed to be doing one of the same themselves.

​

Draco Malfoy looked like he'd been hit with a sickness inducing hex, his face was green. He didn't look triumphant, he looked scared.

​

He didn't realize how long Dumbledore's pause was as all eyes darted between Moody who was being pinned down by the staff and Harry's body. Oh god, Harry' s...

​

The shock was beginning to wear off. Cedric felt the heaving in his chest as the tears began to start anew.

​

"Take mister Diggory somewhere to recover. I'll... talk with him soon."

​

Cedric was aware of hands on his shoulders, trying to steer him away. "W-Wait..." He took a breath. "Please, l-let me j-just... say sorry."

​

He wasn't sure why, but his request was granted, so he knelt down, his eyes meting those now lifeless green ones that had once been so kind and, even when riled, held a compassion in them. Gone now. No one would see that look again.

His heart clenched further as he closed the Boy-Who-Lived's eyes for one last time. "I'm sorry.... i'm sorry... It should have been me... i'm sorry..."

​

His eyes darted to the wand in Harry's hand. Somehow, Harry had the presence of mind when they'd arrived to unsheath his wand but hadn't gotten much further before it all went long. With a brief, sudden moment of clarity, Cedric pocketed the wand before standing up. He looked back and at that moment, he made a promise.

​

The Boy-Who-Lived may lay dead before him now, but Cedric would make sure in spirit, in ideas, in what he would of stood for... he would make sure that Harry lived on with him. No matter what, even if he had to face down You-Know-....

​

Even if he had to face down /Voldemort/ by himself to do so. He wouldn't let Harry's death be pointless.

*** (That is so good!! I'm gonna add on a tiny bit just for fun :))

Cedric looked away, tightening his fist around Harry's wand, and then on some strange instinct he looked back one more time.

Gasps erupted from onlookers, and Cedric felt his own jaw go slack as Harry- the same Harry who had been dead moments earlier-slowly blinked his eyes open and raised an arm to his forehead with a grimace. Then, he shot up straight and brandished his hand through the air, as if he were still holding his wand.

“Harry!” Dumbledore exclaimed, his voice full of bewildered astonishment.

The noise that erupted from the crowd was unlike anything Cedric had ever heard before. Students and teachers alike began screaming Harry's name, mixed with a lone garbled howl of fury and curses.

Cedric dropped weakly to his knees, then crawled over to the boy who'd apparently returned from the dead. He grabbed Harry's hand tightly in his own and watched the boy who refused to die gesture frantically towards Dumbledore. The old wizard crouched down opposite Cedric, took Harry's other hand, and leaned in. Against all the polite manners Cedric had been taught, he leaned in as well, his heart hammering wildly, and though what Harry Potter said next meant absolutely nothing to Cedric Diggory, his blood ran cold just the same.

“Sir... I am-was... a Horcrux. My Mom told me so. And I wasn't the only one he made.”

**** (Oh, that is good.)

​

"A horcrux...." Dumbledore muttered and his confused elation quickly turned back to dread. "Harry, are you sure?"

​

"Positive, sir." Harry nodded. He gulped. "He made... he made eight, including himself and I."

​

"This is...." Dumbledore sucked in a deep breath. "Come on, both of you need to get to the hospital wing. The other contestants as well it would seem."

​

"Harry..." Cedric muttered quietly. "I thought... I was so sure-"

​

"It's not your fault." Harry said. He said it quiet, yet so firm. Then the next thing he said loud, loud enough for everyone to hear. "It was Voldemort. Voldemort tried to kill me again."

​

The horrified reaction of the crowd was to be expected. Fudge was by fair the stupidest.

​

"Poppycock!" He cried, panicked. "He's j-just hit his head, probably wasn't even-"

​

"Don't say that!!" Cedric practically snarled, surprising even himself as he shock. Even with Harry back alive he was shuddering. "I could feel how cold he was!"

​

"But still-"

​

"Minister, with all due respect, stop being an insufferable dunderhead." Snape's voice shocked the crowd, especially with his tone. All turned to him and suddenly, they understood why. "After all, if they are lying then I must question, what was the point of this deception?"

​

And Snape nodded his head down to the man beneath his wand. It was no longer Mad-Eye Moody.

​

No, it was Barty Crouch Jr.

​

"Oh dear Merlin...." Fudge muttered, horrified. "But this doesn't-"

​

"If you truly think everyone will believe you now, with how many have just seen the proof here, I think you are sorely mistaken." McGonagall's voce rang out, finally having come back to her senses. "So for once in your life, Cornelius, don't make a fool of yourself."

​

Cedric looked down to see Harry had sneaked away during the confrontation. He was currently wrapped in a family group hug with the Weasleys and Granger. Even some of the other Gryffindors eventually broke in to hug him.

​

A profound relief washed over him, but only for a moment. There was so much that needed to be dealt with, clearly, and though Harry may have surived, Voldemort was still out there.

​

Though they may have grabbed the cup together in that maze...

​

Right now, there were no champions.

** Cedric gasped as he hit the ground, one hand clenched tightly around the handle of the Portkey, the other gripping Harry's arm.

Harry...

Harry was dead...

It had been a trap. The entire Tournament had been a trap. The Cup had been a Portkey. Sent them right into the clutches of Voldemort and that weedy little servant of his...the one called Wormtail.

They had blasted Cedric and he had hit his head on a rock. By the time he'd come to, Harry was tied to a tombstone and that slimy servant was slashing at him with a knife and then that ritual...the potion from hell...

And Voldemort...and his Death Eaters. That snake Malfoy and that bastard Macnair and Crabbe and Goyle and Nott...devils...

Cedric had feigned death...tried to hear as much as he could without giving himself away.

And Voldemort had made Harry duel him. And their wands had connected. It was the strangest thing Cedric had ever seen...bodies had come out of Voldemort's wand...a Muggle man and a witch named Bertha Jorkins and...Harry's parents.

And then Lucius Malfoy had fired another curse--the Cruciatus Curse--and it had hit Cedric. And he had yelled and given away his position and he'd broken Harry's concentration. The connection had broken.

They had run for the Porktey. But Harry had fallen over Cedric when Cedric stumbled and hurt his leg even worse and Cedric accidentally grabbed Harry's wand in the confusion.

And Voldemort made to "kill the spare, properly," but Harry had stepped in front of the curse...

And then it had happened...

Cedric had grabbed Harry's body and his wand and ran for the Portkey. And the Death Eaters had been right on their tails...

A thunderous noise hit his ears. Yelling. War cries. Death Eaters? Those bloody bastards had managed to follow him. How was that possible? Did it matter? No, it didn't matter...Cedric had to protect Harry's body. He wouldn't let them use his friend for anymore of those rituals from hell. He couldn't fail again...

Cedric groaned weakly as he let go of the damned Portkey and reached for his wand. Or was it Harry's? He was bruised, bloodied, and trembling from the Cruciatus Curse. But he wasn't beaten. Cedric had shown restraint before...in the maze...and the graveyard...but not anymore. They had /killed/ Harry. This was war.

"You did it, my boy! You won!"

/Dad?/

"You did wonderful, Ced! Triwizard Champion!"

Damn the bloody Triwizard to the fires of hell. Cedric raised his head and saw his father smiling wider than he had ever seen him smile before.

"Dad..."

"A true winner! A champion! Best of the lot! Alright now, Harry up you get. Molly's in a right state about you...Harry?"

"Cedric!"

/Professor Dumbledore?/

"Cedric, what's happened?" Professor Dumbledore knelt beside him, his blue eyes blazing with purpose.

"Professor Dumbledore, I'm sorry...Harry...It was him..."

"Good heavens!" Minister Fudge appeared suddenly, at Dumbledore's side.

"They...they killed Harry..."

"Dead? Son, that can't be!"

There was more talking now. Lots more talking. Cedric could barely stand to hear any of it. Fudge wanted to talk to him. Cedric didn't want to talk to anyone.

"Cornelius, I will not allow Cedric to leave this courtyard."

"At least, the body has to be moved," Fudge answered. "People will panic if they see it. They're already starting to move. If too many see it--."

/It?!/

"HARRY'S NOT AN 'IT!'" Cedric bellowed. "I can't leave him! I won't!"

"He needs the hospital wing," a new voice interjected. Cedric looked up and saw Mad-Eye Moody. "Potter's dead, but Diggory's injured. I'll take him to the infirmary. We can go now."

"I'm not leaving my son," Cedric's father set his jaw. "I will not, Mad-Eye."

"I'm not leaving," Cedric grabbed Dumbledore's arm. "Sir...Voldemort...he said that one of his servants, his most faithful one, was here at Hogwarts."

"Boy, you're not talking sense," Moody interrupted. "The Dark Lord..."

/The Dark Lord?!/

There was a flash of red and Moody fell over, Stunned. Standing on one leg was a one-eyed, heavily scarred man with a look of pure hatred on his face.

"Headmaster," Alastor Moody whispered, hobbling. "If you'll help me retrieve my eye."

*** Part II

--------------

The scene inside the hospital wing was the worst Cedric could ever remember.

His parents, Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Harry's friends Ron and Hermione sat in chairs surrounding the two beds.

"Word will be given to his family," Madame Pomfrey said quietly. "They'll decide what to do with Harry's body..."

Ron made a noise somewhere between a sob and a howl. Hermione cried harder.

"Molly..." Dad was saying. "I'm so...tremendously sorry. He was as good your son."

"It wasn't your fault, Amos...It wasn't your fault, either, Cedric dear."

Good old Mrs. Weasley. So kind and generous. Cedric turned his head as he saw her caresses Harry's face, the way a mother might comfort a sick child.

Cedric had related everything to Dumbledore in the Headmaster's office. His parents had been there. And Professor Sprout. And...Harry's godfather, Sirius Black.

The imposter Moody had been restrained in McGonagall's office. Hagrid had broken the man's spine and was standing guard with his crossbow.

And now, Cedric was supposed to sleep? How could he? Harry was /dead./ Cedric should have done more--that louse Pettigrew couldn't have been much. He should have dodged the spell and smashed that rat's head in. He was even shorter than Harry and Cedric was big and strong--one solid punch to the skull would have been enough to kill that bastard.

Madame Pomfrey handed Cedric a potion for Dreamless Sleep. Cedric mulled it over...the idea of sleep without dreams, without having to see Harry's broken little body was nothing short of intoxicating...but no...he had to live with his failure...hiding from it would be an insult to Harry's memory.

--------------

"You're all mad! This is a ploy to get me out of power!" Fudge shouted. "I will not see the peace

"Your winnings," Fudge said shortly, as he handed Cedric a bag. "One thousand Galleons. Ordinarily, there would be a ceremony, with the other champions accepting you as their superior but, in light of the circumstances..."

Cedric took the bag and felt a great rage bubble inside him. Winnings? Ceremony? Even now, Fudge was concerned with appearances? The damn dirty coward...

"I don't want this damn blood money!" With every bit of strength he could muster, Cedric threw the bag across the hospital wing, showering Galleons everywhere. "I want Harry back! I want my friend back! I want to find Voldemort and Pettigrew and make them pay!"

"Peter Pettigrew is dead. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is dead. Harry Potter is dead," Fudge said quietly. "Do take care to make sure you don't meet the same fate, Cedric."

"COWARD!" Cedric shouted and he thought he heard Ron shout it as well.

Cedric was too consumed with rage to be able to even feign sleep anymore. He grabbed the potion from his nightstand, the one for Dreamless Sleep, and downed it in one gulp.
