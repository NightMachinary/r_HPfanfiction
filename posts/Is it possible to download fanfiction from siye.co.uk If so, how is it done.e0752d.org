Where it says "In Datei drucken" should be "print to file" or "print to pdf" in english.

Should be about the same with other browsers.

Edit: I picked some random story so don't take it as endorsement should that be something weird. :P

** I tried a random fic with the Calibre addon Fanficfare and it had no problems creating an epub of the story.

[[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre Ebook Management]] - Once installed (or you plopped the portable version somewhere) go to Preferences (down arrow) > Get plugins to enhance calibre. Install Fanficfare.

To download a fic, copy the url of the story (it doesn't really matter where it is: ao3, ffn, dlp, whatever) and find the icon for the plugin at the top. Click the more arrow > download from url. The address should already be present. Hit okay.

To update an in-progress fic with new chapters, highlight the story and click the plugin button. It'll check the original url (which is saved in the metadata), and will add any missing chapters.

With a kindle paperwhite and the kindle app on my phone, I can use the email function in calibre to send a fic to my Amazon docs. It'll then sync my progress between my devices, which is pretty handy for longer stories. I download 5-10 stories at a time, email them to my amazon account and I'll always have something to read: I can download any story from the cloud storage on my phone or ebook reader.

** [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] perfectly supports SIYE (and other [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/SupportedSites][more than 150 sites]]), and can download to ePUB, HTML, or plain text files. If you don't feel like running commands on the command line, then there is a web version on [[http://fanficfare.appspot.com/]] and it can be also downloaded as a plugin to Calibre.
