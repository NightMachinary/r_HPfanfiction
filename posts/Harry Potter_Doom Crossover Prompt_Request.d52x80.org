Instead of Digging Doom Guy out of the ruins, the UAC uncovers a coffin with the (in)famous Boy Who Lived. Badassery ensues. Or is there any crossovers with the two?


** On ffn there's only 3 fics in the Doom / Harry Potter crossover. I haven't read any of them. AO3 might have more but it's a really small market.
