** The tropes are codified now. And tags are usually more helpful in determining whether you want to read something than the rest of the summary.

If you're really looking for when instead of why, I probably started seeing it somewhat frequently in 2007, and it plateaued in 2014/2015 maybe.

*** Yes I'm really looking for when. The plateau was that recent? I did stop/significantly reduce ff around the HBP time, so according to you I missed the very beginnings of tags.

**** Yeah, it seems very recent to me, and seems to be coming from ao3 to ff.net.

***** I'm glad that ff.net only allows four characters to be tagged. There's a lot of stories on AO3 that have like half the characters listed even though they play some tiny little part in the fic. The summary tags that people use, especially on FF.net are quite useful, often more than the summary itself.

Random side note, how do you set a pairing to be a pairing on FF.net when you're writing a fic? I can tag the characters, I just don't know how to denote them as a couple.

****** There is a click box for 'pairings' in the story set up page (where you select the characters). However, it is sort of new on FFN (I think about 2-3 years ago), so most older stories are not tagged like this, and even a lot of newer stories fail to tag the characters correctly.

*** It was definitely a part of the community around 2004-06 too. I remember talking about Dark!Harry and such on mugglenet and fictionalley, although I don't remember it being so common in fic recommendations until much later.

#+begin_quote
  Grey!Ron, Demon!Dumbledore, BAMF!GitantSquid
#+end_quote

I ended up searching for Grey!Ron, Demon!Dumbledore and BAMF!GiantSquid... I found one fic of Grey!Ron and another one of Demon!Dumbledore but none of BAMF!GiantSquid. You'd think these ideas would have at least been tried more.

Fanfiction can be so disappointing at times.

Ron is criminally underused and abused. #reclaimron

** The exclamation point thing was definitely around in the early 2000s. I started reading fanfic 2001 or so, and while my memory of the Fanon culture is a little hazy for the first year or so, I'm pretty sure adjective!character was well established (though less universal) by 2003 at least. It seemed to come from the LJ community, and was pretty popular with the Draco slash crowd. Leatherpants!Draco was a popular description for Cassandra Claire's stuff, as well as the horde of imitators.

What /does/ seem to be new is the use of run together ship names (Drarry, Jilly, etc). Back then it would just be H/D, H/H, H/R, etc, with some other rather stupid names for ships, like H/Hr was "Pumpkin Pie" (Harmony is much more recent) and R/H was "The Good Ship" (though of course H/H folks didn't call it that). "Snarry" is an old term, though.

*** See I remember (around 2004-2006) that the full trope name was used - "Drace in leatherpants" (didn't even know tropes were a thing till I joined this subreddit).

I'm thinking I probably read way less fanfiction than I think I do.

*** I suspect the running together of ship names is bleeding over from anime fans who then became fans of HP. My very first fandom was an anime circa early aughts and that kind of thing was the norm.

** I'm not gonna lie, that's something that turns me off a bit from AO3 - the excessive tagging. It's like FFN levels on steroids.

*** It's the author that sometimes use excessive tags. Sometimes search page entries have one line summary and then ten lines of tags.

A more better solution is allow authors to add atmost 5 tags or something like that. So they don't push their fics in other search criterion. eg. if it's Harry!Multi, you don't have to add another 11 tags listing every single character Harry bones.

** Hmm, on sites that do allow actually tagging the tags can be useful for determining if the story might be something you will want to read, assuming that the stories actually are tagged properly. But it is not a necessity of any sort, really, it's just convenient /if/ it works the way it should.

For sites that do not have anything of this sort, however, in most cases the tags are simply inelegantly-looking clutter.

And, as controversial as that may make me sound, the overuse of tags is something we got because a part of the society is ... well, deteriorating mentally, and at a higher rate than we'd expect them to; it's as if the part of their brains responsible for common sense was replaced by a gismo that goes “oh, have to tag it, otherwise you'll die” at every single thing.
