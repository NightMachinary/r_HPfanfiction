Just a question that occurred to me just now. Throughout the books it's repeatedly stated that Dementors are blind, and track humans by their emotions; Sirius used that fact to escape by turning into a dog right under their noses, Barty Crouch Jr. was freed right under their noses, et-cetera.

So the thing I'm wondering is, how did they home in on Harry and Dudley at the start of book 5? They weren't at #4 Privet Drive, they were a few streets away in an alleyway in Magnolia Crescent.

Did they fly there of their own volition? If they did, how did they spot him and Dudley in the alleyway and positively recognize one of them as Harry? If they saw Harry before, why didn't they attack then?

Given that it 'suddenly' gets cold and dark in the book, maybe they were deliberately portkeyed in? But that would require someone to follow Harry and confirm his location and identity.

But yeah, most important question; how did the two dementors positively identify Harry, when they're blind and he and Dudley were still a few blocks away from Privet Drive? Why were they looking in that alley at all instead of waiting at that house? Is it that they can distinguish between muggles and wizards and have a long emotion sensing range?


** Magic.

** Well, given that the dememtors in PoA were set to find Sirius Black specifically, they have some way of distinguishing specific people, so Umbridge probably used that method to sic them on Harry, and probably portkeyed them to the area.

** I'm sure they are capable of traveling on their own. I mean, owls can find you anywhere, even if you're under the Fidelius Charm and your location is unplottable.

And since Harry is the only wizard in the area, it's certainly possible that they have some attraction to him. So they could assume (and the Ministry constantly assumes) that any magical person in that area is Harry Potter.

I mean, that's all just guessing but I don't think it's too far fetched.

** I don't know, Harry's got two fucking souls inside him, maybe that was interesting to them. Maybe the ministry has some sort of spell that can control the dementors. Maybe you're right, and somebody portkeyed the dementors in intentionally.

***** If the soul is quantifiable, then the first split was 50-50 (diary). Then the next split halved the remaining 50%. Then it was 25%. And so on until split 7.

I for one do not like that hypothesis. If a soul exists, quantifying it would be more gross than splitting it.

****** But why would the removed parts split themselves and then magically reattach themselves in order to make all parts equal? The whole purpose of a Horcrux is to keep that part of the soul shielded from anything. If it could magically travel despite being a Horcrux it would be absolutely useless.

****** I agree with you, but we do see that Riddle's Diary is seemingly more powerful than the other Horcruxes, and it was the first to be made. The Locket was made either second or third IIRC, and that put up more of a fight than the others as well.

It could be linked to how important the object used is, or the significance of the murder, or any number of variables. Fanfiction that comes up with plausible and thought out mechanisms for this kind of thing is particularly enjoyable for me.

******* Locket was 3rd or 4th, most likely 4th.

Diary, Ring, Cup, Locket. I put Cup before Locket because Hepzibah had both artifacts, but her death was the one used for the Cup horcrux, and a tramp for the Locket. I'd think the murder and creation of the horcrux have to be close together in time.

****** I thought we didn't have anything in canon to state that it was a 50/50 split each time? Split doesn't necessarily have to mean half, it can also mean along a grain/fissure. Murder causes damage to the soul, so it could use that damage/weak point to cause a breakage. It would explain why the Locket, for example, was plenty powerful, while the Cup doesn't seem to have been as powerful, both having been created in the same time period (They appear to be in good spirits, not looking any worse for wear, and the phrase "it was nothing" was used. To me that implies it wasn't nearly as difficult). It's also implied the cup was created first- Hepzibah had both the Locket and Cup, but Rowling stated that Hepzibah's murder was the one used to turn the cup into a Horcrux, and a muggle tramp for the locket. So by the 50/50 reasoning, the cup should have stronger/more powerful protections than the locket.

(I'm with you, I don't like the 50/50 hypothesis)

  "They are not undying," said the Headmaster. The words mild, the gaze sharp. "They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in the world, and attacking a wound only makes it larger."

  "Hm," Harry said. "Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it be destroyed?"

  "/Throw/ it into the /Sun?/â€¯" squeaked Professor Flitwick, looking like he wanted to faint.

  "It seems unlikely, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said dryly. "The Sun is very large, after all; I doubt the Dementor would have much effect on it. But it is not a test I would like to try, Mr. Potter, just in case."

** I always assumed that Dementors prefer magical targets. Therefore when they were sent on their assassination attempt they homed in on the only magical soul in the area.

But still, I mean even owls can find specific people in the magical world. Its not so out there that Dementors can know and identify Harry in some way and specifically target him. Maybe they got a personal vendetta against him for the uber-Patronus he sent against them when they finally captured Sirius.

** Dementors were all around Hogwarts after Siruis escaped and surprisingly enough, that is where he was. The Ministry of Magic didn't know where he was. Not only that, a Dementor specifically targeted Harry on the Hogwarts train and only attacked him.

Dementors seem to somehow know the general area of people and are also actual guards with shows they aren't just mindless beast. They don't go around kissing everyone and target specific people.

Actually, considering Voldemort himself or any of his lackies never tried to storm the house that may be part of the reason idk It seems odd someone Harry is a pretty famous person.
