Are there any decent stories where Harry and a friend/love interest travel either back to his school time or even earlier (Marauder/Riddle-era) and change the past to some extent? Stories with a similar premise like "What's a little death between friends".

The time travellers should not be involved with anyone from the past (for example no Hermione/Marauders or Harry/Riddle) and an eventual romance between the companion and Harry should be the endgame.

Preferably without a multi-pairing (like the Harry/Hermione/Luna challenge), Ron/Hermione and bashing, although I can suffer through some of that.

** If you're interested I can search for Harry/His-Twin-Sister-Rose/Gabby.

During Harrys underage-magic-trial Harry lost his temper, got expelled, obliviated and his Magic bound....

That's the gist of it
