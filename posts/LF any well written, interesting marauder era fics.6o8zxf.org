** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2429621/1/I-ll-Take-it-Shaken-Not-Stirred][I'll Take It Shaken Not Stirred]] linkffn(2429621) Same author as The Life and Times, and has kind of been overshadowed by it a bit, this is just as good imo, its really well thought out and its actually finished which is a big plus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10939132/1/An-Unexpected-Attraction][An Unexpected Attraction]] linkffn(10939132) - Very long, and it does that thing where nearly every named character from the marauders era is a Gryfindor in seventh year (eg Marlene McKinnion, Mary McDonald, Prewett Twins etc), which may turn some people off, Starts summer before seventh year and runs all the way through to the order of the phoenix, its still WiP too and its updated fairly regularly. I really liked this fic but it does have its issues, mainly that its just chock full of Drama, might be a bit much for some, and it jumps from character to character a lot too which might annoy some people.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8236381/1/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Stag-and-the-Doe][Rise and Fall of the Stag and the Doe]] linkffn(8236381) - Very similar to An Unexpected Attraction. I personally preferred the characterization in An Unexpected Attraction, but id argue this is probably better written. Also Complete.

  Lily Evans in no way fancied James Potter, that was a fact. The pair becoming friends was shock enough but Lily having an actual crush on him? Hell would have to freeze over first...at least that's what she thought.

  Moments. They make or break relationships. Lily didn't just happen to fall in love with James. It wasn't an accident, but a long drawn out process that grew out of the relationships of the people around them. And when it came down to it, even Lily and James couldn't fight fate.

** linkffn(a month of sundays) is a really cute and complete James/Lily story that starts at the end of fifth year and ends toward the end of seventh year. It features all the marauders, Snape, and several pretty good OCs. It's mainly about James and Lily getting together but there are a lot of political things happening in the outside world that they have to deal with too.
