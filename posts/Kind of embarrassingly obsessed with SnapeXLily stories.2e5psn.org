I'm sort of embarrassed about this, but I love a good tragic love story involving childhood friends who grow up and have awkward feelings for each other.

Can anyone suggest a good story that I might enjoy with these characters? Unfortunately there is an absurdly large amount of content in this vein and it is really hard to slog through and find the good ones.

Comics or graphic novel adaptations are also welcome.


** I haven't found a Snape/Lily story I enjoyed. They are usually written by either James/Lily shippers, in which Snape is presented abominably (or is given credit as "someday will be a better person but we will never show it"), or the ones where there are Snape/Lily shippers and then James is some sort of caricature of the Ron-bashing thing. I also think that Snape/Lily wouldn't work out when Snape was a kid; Lily made the right choice for herself at the time.

There is the ridiculous subgenre of "Snape gets a second chance", in which after his death he gets to never call her mudblood. Well, with the mind of a 38 year old man who has seen some shit, people just gloss over the fact that the emotional maturity of a 16 year old would be the one thing he wouldn't want to deal with.

I liked their relationship in A Difference in the Family, where the author shows the difference in working class vs. middle class (they can't hang out in the open), Slytherin vs. Gryffindor (they similarly can't, but also their friends keep trying to turn them against one another until they finally succeed), yet through it all, they can't help but care about one another. If there were stories like that, I'd read the shit out of them. I have yet to find one though.

** You should try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4418724/1/Rewriting-The-Song][Rewriting The Song]] by Silens Cursor. I haven't personally read it but Silens is a great writer so its hard to imagine it not being good.

***** And the damned thing made me like SeverusxNarcissa, so it was like a double whammy for me. Now I'm running around with another impossible pairing that I love.

****** /sigh/ the emotion that comes with reading a well written fic with great potential only to find it deserted, and to add salt to the wound by writing a great pairing is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo annoying.

** I'm new to the whole Snape fanfic scene but I found this one not too long ago in which Snape gets a second chance after dying and basically redoes his life starting from not calling lily a mudblood. I thought it was really well written. It's called The Moment It Began: [[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=5906]] and it's on fanfiction.net as well under the same name.
