Prefferably with 50k+ words.


** I really doubt you're going to find one. It's like asking for a good harem story except even harder. It would be possible to write a good Harry/Lily story, but generally speaking the people that are looking to write a good story and the people that want to write a Harry/Lily story are completely separate.

** What is DT and TT?

Anyways, any Harry/Lily story is going to be either smut or harem. A well-written story would probably have to examine the nature of such a relationship, and if an author could pull it off, they're better off writing it as original fiction, since such a story would probably get as much acclaim as Lolita.

  Based on smaster28's Harry Potter & The New Life. Harry goes is sent back in time months before the start of his 1st year in Hogwarts. Only problem is that it isnt like he remembered as his parents are alive and had more children, Sirius got married and has his own family, oh and apparently Neville is the Boy Who Lived.
