Hi all! I'm looking for any fics (preferably with Harry as protagonist) where a lot of the story unfolds like a young adult novel: think angsty teenage rebellion, drugs, booze, and sex. Not picky on pairings, M/M, M/F, F/F, I'm open ;)

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass

** There was this fic I read in which harry runs away from home and joins a death metal band and changes his name to "emerald". I don't remember the name but in hindsight the fic was quite ridiculous.

*** ... In hindsight? Sounds like some quality British comedy material right there.

"And who is that young man in your band, Nigel?"

"Ah, yeah, dat's Emerald. N' it's 'Destroyer' sir."

"... Quite. Emerald, in case you didn't know, your bandmates' names are Nigel, Wollstonecraft and Phillip, NOT Destroyer, Deathbreath and Chaser Gordon when you sign legally binding contracts. Is that understood?"

"Um, yessir."

"And what is /your/ name? We need to know for legal identification purposes, of course, but I am sure our marketing department will be utterly delighted to hear your stage name."

"... It's Harry, sir."

"Ah, yes, Harry. Good old solid British name, Harry. Why, I have no idea why one would discard a name such as that. Harry. It's so... solid. Traditional."

"And what about your name, sir?"

"Pugsley Biggleson The Second."

"..."

"It's quite traditional, I am told."

"... I-yes, I am sure it is, sir. Say, Ni-Destroyer?"

"Yeah, Em?"

"Ouch, please don't say it that way-I think we have our new album title."

"Great initiative Em! Saving us from having ter fink up words n' increasing our inspirationin' time, you're a credit ter this band man!"

*** I think I just read this, but I can't remember the name of it now. Harry didn't run away from home though, Vernon beat him half to death and then dumped him in a ditch, then told everyone he ran away. I've read better fics.

edit: Just realized this is a three-month-old thread.... whoops.
