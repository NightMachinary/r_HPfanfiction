** Albus and Harry's World Trip by ZebJeb contains both Dumbledore confronting the Dursleys and mentoring Harry. The story starts after Harry's second year.

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but this a beautiful Abused!Harry fic that was recently published. I found it tragic, haunting, and so well written that I shed a tear at 2 in the morning while reading it. I'm a little miffed there aren't any reviews posted so I can compare my thoughts with other readers... linkffn(13657777)

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.
