I met such point several times here and in other places and honestly I don't understand it.

Hitler started the war where dozens of millions died. Riddle and his followers killed several hundreds, definitely less than a thousand.

Yes, he is cruel and racist, but on the scale he isn't even close to the leader of Nazi Germany. Hitler took the country in legitimate way and then used his charisma, social and political skills to create Nazi regime. Riddle is just a terrorist.

Compared to Hitler Riddle is just a leader of Ku Klux Klan cell.

As I remember (I may be wrong) in the books it's stated that true analogue of Hitler is Grindelwald.

Am I missing something?

[Edit]: thank you all for participation in the discussion!

I see that Hitler is a role model for Riddle in terms of ideology and methodology. I agree that in this case the analogue works fine.

But I'm steel confused when this analogue is used for describing crimes where the scale matters a lot. Even Muggle-Born Registration Commission was more about imprisonment and in the books and other sources there're no indications that there were mass killings.


** Because scale is essentially the only significant disanalogy. Voldemort is like Hitler in ideology, goals, and methods. Grindelwald, on the other hand, has a fundamentally different ideology, one that doesn't care at all about blood purity.

Grindelwald and Riddle were both charismatic and powerful, they each had their own groups and ideologies but Riddle never came close to being an international threat.

We never see other wizard countries taking interest in the 'most powerful Dark Lord of the century', not even once. Riddle was the leader of a terrorist group and Grindelwald was the leader of an international movement. He even puppeted Hitler! It's like comparing the French Militia Resistants and the Third Reich.

******** There's a lot of pure fanon in your post. Here are things that are not canon:

#+begin_quote
  Grindelwald nearly conquered Europe
#+end_quote

Grindelwald did not "nearly conquer Europe". Grindelwald's goal was the shattering of the International Statute of Secrecy, resulting in a war between wizards and Muggles which the wizards would win. The wizards would then rule over Muggles as "benevolent" overlords.

Grindelwald did not attempt to take over magical governments or territory. His methods involved trying to expose magic to Muggles through large scale magical events which magical governments could not contain. He came into conflict with magical governments because they were trying to enforce the Statute of Secrecy, not because he wanted to take them over.

#+begin_quote
  We never see other wizard countries taking interest in the 'most powerful Dark Lord of the century'
#+end_quote

Both the Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters have international wizards in their ranks. Wizarding governments do not have militaries - international intervention in the wizarding world does not take the form of governments joining in, but rather individuals.

Further, we know that both Voldemort and Harry were internationally famous. See the article entitled "DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL" - [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-2014-daily-prophet-reports]]

On top of this, Voldemort's movement is considered to be of international significance, not just restricted to Britain:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed.
#+end_quote

(DH Chapter 2)

Moving on...

#+begin_quote
  He even puppeted Hitler!
#+end_quote

Simply not canon by any stretch of the imagination. JKR has been clear that the connection between wizarding and Muggle wars is more abstract than direct cooperation or interaction between the two worlds:

#+begin_quote
  JKR: I'm going to tell you as much as I told someone earlier who asked me. You know Owen who won the [UK television] competition to interview me? He asked about Grindelwald [pronounced "Grindelvald" HMM...]. He said, “Is it coincidence that he died in 1945,” and I said no. It amuses me to *make allusions* to things that were happening in the Muggle world, so my feeling would be that *while there's a global Muggle war going on, there's also a global wizarding war going on*.

  ES: Does he have any connection to --

  JKR: I have no comment to make on that subject.

  [Laughter.]

  MA: Do they *feed each other,* the Muggle and wizarding wars?

  JKR: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Mm.

  MA: You've gone very quiet.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm]]

So rather than wizards literally being involved in Muggle wars, you have a kind of parallel conflict - that is, wizarding and Muggle worlds mirror each other without actually having causal links from one to the other. It's like there's a "spirit of the times" which encompasses both Muggle and wizarding worlds, and when tension rises in one it is also rising in the other.

The exception to this is WWI, where wizards directly interfered, contrary to wizarding law:

#+begin_quote
  Archer Evermonde

  1912 - 1923

  In post during the Muggle First World War, Evermonde passed emergency legislation forbidding witches and wizards to get involved, lest they risk mass infractions of the International Statute of Secrecy. Thousands defied him, aiding Muggles where they could.
#+end_quote

As for Voldemort, people simply consider him a more powerful wizard than Grindelwald was.

We see this for ourselves in OotP, where Dumbledore needs to be rescued by Fawkes to avoid being killed by Voldemort. Had they been duelling on skill alone, without outside intervention, Voldemort would have killed Dumbledore there and then. This despite the fact that Dumbledore was wielding the Elder Wand. In contrast, Dumbledore was able to beat Grindelwald in a duel, even when Grindelwald had the Elder Wand.

On top of this, the characters recognise Voldemort as the more powerful wizard. Dumbledore refers to Voldemort as the most powerful dark wizard of all time, and he is familiar with both Grindelwald and Voldemort. On top of that, wizarding society more generally ranks Voldemort as more dangerous:

#+begin_quote
  The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown.

Being feared doesn't mean he would win. Dumbledore could match Voldemort, and based onto his mistake in GoF where (according to Dumbledore) Voldemort was afraid Harry managed to match him in skill, Voldemort is terrified by even the possibility of meeting an equally powerful wizard.

For that matter, notice that Voldemort fled the battlefield the as soon as a handful of Aurors arrived. Fawkes was out of commission by then, so Dumbledore couldn't teleport, either. So, at the very least, we know that Voldemort believes that

A spell missing is not blocking the spell. "Blocking" implies getting in the way, not evasion. And Dumbledore said in OoTP that he didn't cast such spells because "Killing you [Riddle] wouldn't satisfy me, I admit", implying he was well within the right state of mind to cast the Killing Curse.

#+begin_quote
  Why not? He's a psychopath, so it comes to him easily, he is probably not a Transfiguration specialist (though very good at it, of course), and he seems to be prone to getting stuck in a rut.
#+end_quote

Riddle is a psychopath but he's also a genius whose knowledge of magic was unparalleled and wouldn't bother using the Killing Curse if there was a better way of killing someone. And there is nothing suggesting Dumbledore was any better at Transfiguration than Riddle. The fact that even with the Elder Wand he couldn't Transfigure Riddle's madness-inducing potion would seem to suggest that Riddle may have even been a notch above Dumbledore at Transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  Again, that's ignoring the need to protect Harry and that Dumbledore needed to pin Voldemort down, not kill him. For that matter, notice that Voldemort fled the battlefield the as soon as a handful of Aurors arrived.
#+end_quote

It doesn't ignore anything. Until Riddle possessed him, Dumbledore was not a single time stated to have been hampered by the need to protect Harry. Dumbledore did need to kill Voldemort as then prophecy was not impossible to negate (JKR has confirmed this about prophecies in interviews and Dumbledore did in OoTP as well). Killing Voldemort (had it been possible) would have proved Dumbledore's case and saved Harry. Also, Riddle wasn't running from the Aurors. You're forgetting that he had been trying to hide the fact of his resurrection and was soon outnumbered by the dozens of people streaming in. I doubt he could have taken them all given Dumbledore was there but there were other factors.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort knew stuff Dumbledore didn't, and Dumbledore knew stuff that Voldemort didn't. What's your point?

The point was that Dumbledore in this instance was explaining how Riddle's magical ability exceeded his own hence why none of his defensive spells could have protected Harry from Riddle. In other words, and example of how Riddle's power exceeded his own in some respects.

Indeed in DH we do see Voldemort hopping around the continent, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.

Further, though he was later defeated, Voldemort achieved his political goal of taking over the British ministry and commenced the genocide of Muggleborns. Grindelwald on the other hand never successfully exposed the wizarding world to the Muggles. So by that measure, Voldemort was more politically successful.

(DH Chapter 2)

In any case, I'm not sure about this attachment to geographical extent being the same thing as importance. The wizarding world is highly integrated at the international level, with freedom of movement and global wizarding laws. It's essentially like a global EU. The complete take-over of the government of a "member state" would be significantly more troubling for the community than an unsuccessful international terrorist.

Or they're too scared to, knowing that said action would likely be ineffective (the British Aurors had no success and it's not clear that having more Aurors would help).

Or there are political impediments to interference.

Or they are sympathetic to Voldemort's cause.

There are many possible reasons beyond "they don't consider it important". The fact that Harry is mobbed by people globally, not just in Britain, indicates that the international community is very much invested in what happens with Voldemort.

But no one in this thread is claiming that they operate on the same scale.

Hitler and Voldemort both:

- Subscribe to a radical racial philosophy which dictates racial purity according to blood.

- Advocate the cleansing of society of certain ethnic groups.

- Killed or otherwise "disappeared" their political opponents.

- Recruited supporters by radicalising young people.

- Performed a coup to take over their domestic government.

- Once in power, began to enact their racial philosophy by rounding up members of the ethnic minority they demonise.

Yes, there is a disanalogy in the scale of their actions. But that single disanalogy does not break the analogy between the two. It simply means that they are not identical.

On the other hand, Grindelwald:

- Had a philosophy of a privileged elite ruling a large underclass, purportedly for their own good.

- Did not take over governments but rather attempted to subvert them.

- Never achieved power.

The only analogy between Grindelwald and Hitler is that they were both defeated in 1945. But even the timescale analogy isn't good, because Grindelwald was operating since the 1920s, where Hitler only came onto the scene in the 1930s. They're not even both German, as Hitler was Austrian.

** The Death Eaters are pretty much an SA/SS ripoff. A mixture between a political street fighting gang oppressing other opinions and a fighting force loyal to a person/ideology and not the state.

The Muggleborn registration thing is an almost exact copy of the committee which resulted from the Nürnberg laws. If questioned by them, you have to prove your aryian/magical decent or face consequences. They began deporting the muggleborns to Azkaban, which had been repurposed as concentration camp. The snatchers act as Gestapo/SD squads. The entire thing is a small scale Final Solution of the Muggleborn question.

On a relative scale (small population), the Death toll is massive. Not quite Soviet Union or Poland level, but definitely surpassing the American one in WWII. And he was stopped before he could truly enact all his plans. Voldemort nearly won in 81 and even by 97, he wasn't done.

Tl; dr: The ideology and the methods are very similar to the Third Reich, just on a smaller scale due to the small population of the magical world. Voldemort had his own SA, his own Nürnberg laws and his own Gestapo. He was enacting his own Final Solution. While not a perfect analogue, the parallels to Hitler are there.

The example that always comes to mind is /A Princess of Mars/. While somewhat fun to read if you take it's historical place into account, if you discard author circumstances it becomes a very bad book.

******* Well, I did slightly conflate historical context vs author intent. You can ignore author intent and still take into account historical context.

The approach certainly has its uses. It isn't that uncommon for works to transcend the original authors intents. In the extreme, you can have a work that was intended to be critical of a movement that ends up really speaking to members of that movement and they take it as their own and rallying cry. In those situations, the question gets discussed a lot about 'does the hostile intent of the author reduce, enhance, or not effect the effectiveness of the piece'

I think this would frame it best: If you were going to give an award to the "Most Important" "Most Foundational" and "Best" entries in a category, discarding author intent (and historical context) would be a way to consider the entries for "Best", where you want things that stand on their own and stood the test of time well. Foundational would focus on that context while Important would be more balanced.

If this wasn't a kid's series, this would read differently:

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort seized control of the Ministry of Magic in 1997, Muggle-borns were required to register with the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. Political propaganda claimed that Muggle-borns were really Muggles who had stolen magic from "real" witches and wizards, supported by research supposedly carried out by the Department of Mysteries. The Ministry continued to promote the belief with the distribution of agitprop such as the pamphlet Mudbloods and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society. The Commission punished anyone who could not prove to have wizarding heritage for this alleged action, sentencing them to Azkaban. Anyone who resisted was threatened with, and perhaps given, the Dementor's Kiss. They also issued two Ministerial Decrees stating that it was any wizards' duty to report suspected "Mudbloods" to them and that failure to do so would result in imprisonment.

  This led some Muggle-borns, such as Dirk Cresswell, to forge their family trees. Those who refused to register, such as Ted Tonks, were forced to go on the run and were pursued by Snatchers, sometimes fatally.

If you read books about megalomania types like Hitler and Stalin, it's interesting to find how superstitious these people are, with all their power. It's part of their paranoia, the desire to make themselves bigger then who they really are; they love talking about destiny and fate. I wanted Voldemort to also have those paranoid traits. But the fact that the prophecy from book five becomes true in the end is because Voldemort and Harry chose to let it come true. Not because it is destined to.

Its primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, especially the Red Front Fighters League (Rotfrontkämpferbund) of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), and intimidating Slavs, Romanis, trade unionists, and, especially, Jews -- for instance, during the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses.

The SA were also called the "Brownshirts" (Braunhemden) from the color of their uniform shirts, similar to Benito Mussolini's blackshirts.

********* I agree that I made a mistake when I said that he gained his power using legal ways only.

Still he had great social and political skills and they played huge role in his raising.

He used his trial to push his ideas.

He used his time in prison to write "Mein Kampf".

He served 9 months instead of original 5 years.

What did Riddle make similar?

Instead of going to prison he literally came back from the dead (that's a bit grander than serving 9 months instead of 5 years). Then he changed his methods and overtook the government from the shadows in a semi-legitimate manner, while his violent thugs killed and intimidated his political opponents. At the same time he instituted laws to spread his ideology and oppress those he deemed unfit for his utopia. Do you seriously not see the similarities?

*********** Several times Riddle's great plans were ruined by school children.

His regime hadn't lived even a year.

It took combined efforts of several countries to defeat Hitler and his regime, but Voldemort was beat by a mere boy who didn't even finish a school.

************ So we have established that there are differences between Hitler and Voldemort. That's why people compare him to Hitler. He's not literally Hitler. It's an anlogy, not a same-ity.

************ You are, as Taure said, simply pointing out the difference in scale (and the fact that, as this is fiction, the MC is a child). You've not pointed out a single structural difference between the ideology and methods employed by the two.

I hate to ask (seriously, it's an awful question), but are you a Hitler sympathizer? The consistency of your insistence of the difference between the 2 (even just analogously) is quite odd.

************* It was pointed that Riddle has just two things in common with Hitler:

1. he is racist and uses blood purity ideology as basis for his actions;
2. he copied some of his methods from the Hitler's handbook.

And those two points are generally common for any leader with radical views.

But Hitler was more than that. He build horrible regime (I don't know where you got your question from), but he also played a huge role in the history.

Unlike Riddle Hitler had great political and social skills.

In politics Riddle is a looser. At the end of GoF he had a huge advantage over his opponents: no one believed in his return, the governance was against Dumbledore and Potter, his followers were in the elite of the society. But instead of playing his cards right on the political field he used them as mere soldiers and then there was DoM fiasco.
