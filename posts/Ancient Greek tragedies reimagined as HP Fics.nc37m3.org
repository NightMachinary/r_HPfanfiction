Are there any such Fics where the plot is trying to mimic a well known Greek tragedy?

** Well... the battle of Hogwarts is quite similar to the Illiad where several beloved characters die during the siege of Hogwarts. It doesn't really have the same outcome as the Illiad though, but - and I know the author is very hated these days - in the "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness", the siege of Hogwarts is far more tragic than what we see in DH.

Edit: and all still because a man couldn't keep it in his pants and a woman responded well to his advances... namely James and Lily.

** What I would like to see is a reimagining of the Odyssey. With Harry as Odysseus, Hermione as Penelope.

And maybe Ron and Victor as Antinoos and Eurymachos?

Ginny maybe as Kirke/Circe?

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

** Not exactly mimicking the Greek tragedy plot, but “Puzzle” by we-built-the-shadows-here linkffn(6622580) is as close as possible.
