Yeah that's not right ...

​

...But there have been a few fanfics I've seen especially Slytherin Harry ones Gryffindor is shown as pompous, stupid and rash I find that really interesting are there any other fics that explore a houses potential for being an unhealthy environment?

like Ravenclaw being intelligent but exclusionary but intelligently dishonest.

Or Hufflepuff being loyal to a fault and almost being like a cult.

And Gryffndor being stupid and rash.

​

Or is there any fanfictions that kinda play out like Divergent in the way that sorting people by their personality maybe is not the best idea?


** If you can get them marching in lockstep, large groups with deep in-group loyalty and a common purpose are /dangerous/.

Hufflepuff House is the great untapped Dark Lord resource: the first wizarding villain to figure this out is going to /clean up/. I mean, leading Slytherins is like herding cats, Gryffindors are even /less/ controllable, and Ravenclaws are too busy contemplating the whichness of what to make effective baddies. Hufflepuffs, all you have to do is sell your agenda as appropriately fair and inclusive and get them doing the metaphorical goose-step in the right direction. You end up with task-oriented team-player minions, and if you can train them to contribute individual initiative to the groupthink they're positively /scary/.

** I remember reading a fic about Tom Riddle being sort in Hufflepuff. He then began to gather followers in Hufflepuffs but his quest for world dominance was so much more subte since nobody doubts a Hufflepuff. Especially all of them.

​

I don't remember the name of it but I can search if you're interested. I think it was on ao3...

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

** I remember a story in which a very smart arse Harry was sorted into Ravenclaw , where he refused to play by their rules and was excluded from the secret Ravenclaw society which enables them to get good jobs later on.

Hufflepuffs are loyal and hardworking , a Hufflepuff trying to take control of the wizarding world would be amazing. Badgers are vicious little beasts

** I agree that you're on to something with the house system being a pretty bad idea, and each having the potential for villainy.

I've a series that sets up Ravenclaws as the villains. They're the intellectual elite, full of arrogance and lacking compassion. To me, it's the house that creates the classic super-genius villains. The Hufflepuffs are their counterparts, being academically inferior, but caring about goodness and kindness and friendship over personal superiority.

Hufflepuff, though, could easily be monsters. Their first trait is loyalty. Being loyal says nothing about being good. While the other three houses are all very individualistic (individual bravery, ambition, and intellect) Hufflepuff is about unity, and unity is not a particularly good thing.

** Voldemort in Hufflepuff would be a scary thought -- abusing Hufflepuff's sense of loyalty and gathering a fanatic army. Can't really use blood purism as an excuse there though... it would probably end up more akin to Grindelwald with magical vs muggle.

** I have no fic-recommendation, but in my personal headcanon Umbridge was a member of Hufflepuff.

After all, her loyalty to the ministry in general and fudge in particular was absolute. I'm pretty sure most other Hufflepuffs would be ashamed of it, though.

** I remember two,

one was the Saving Connor Series, where a few of his loyal were hufflepuffs and quite... evil, and slavishly loyal. Even getting their families to help them??? (maybe?)

another is the reason Draco doesn't want to be in Hufflepuff was because his mom kept telling him it was evil as it was where Bellatrix was sorted and she was evil.
