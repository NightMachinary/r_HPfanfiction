If you really think about if they are all inbred for so many generations...

so what do you have to say on the issue of malformed mages?


** Meh, as long as you don't have first cousins marrying, or marrying within near family multiple generations in a row, you'll be fine. Really, it was the Gaunts who went too far.

** "The problem isn't as bad if you assume that all families of Europe sleep with each other"

That is what I think what happens. For wizards distances play less of a role, and so in the pureblood society people married across country-lines for ages. Canon doesn't say much about that either way.

Also, this means that the probability of new genes entering the pool is raised quite a bit (Who can tell that the mother of this girl over in poland was a half-blood over here in England?)

Also, half-bloods seem to be acceptable for many families.

And finally we have magic who makes sure people don't die when hit with a canonball at high speeds ("Quaffels") - a bit of 'correct the problems of incest' ahould be possible.

I mean we have quarter-goblins, quarter-veelas, half-giants, ... - Magic can be used to breed.

*** We have Blast Ended Skrewts. If a cross between a burning crab and a spiky lion is possible, rest assured, I think that DNA has little to no effect. (Except when Rowling is inconsistent with her own implications, and makes the Gaunts ugly stupid almost-Squibs.)

**** I like to think that magic corrects the DNA stuff up to 3rd cousins marrying (maaaaybe 2nd cousins if they're in love), but anything closer and she gets too creeped out and just washes her hands off the whole matter. And that's why the Gaunts are garbage-tier people.

***** My problem with that sentiment, even though I generally agree, is that Sirius' parents were first cousins and both Regulus and Sirius were said to be more or less normal, handsome young men before death and long term imprisonment respectively.

****** I think it was less about the fact that the Gaunts married close as it was that they never married far so it was a close breeding generation after generation after generation and that is what made something go wrong.

It's the same with real-life incest: have people close to each other get a kid once and the chance of something being wrong with the kid is only minimally higher than normally; have it happen again and again and again, however, and it becomes almost guaranteed once enough generations pass.

Or they'd send them to Australia. Fanon loves sending people to Australia.

***** Anecdotally, I've once read a fic where the /magical/ community of Australia was formed not out of actual scum but rather of decent people who got fed up with something and used the laws to get exiled there. I do remember it started with some floor-level bureaucrat who was told to do something with the whole thing and disagreed with it so badly that he was the first one to get exiled (by stealing a loaf of bread, I believe, though I might be wrong as it's been a long time since I've read it).

So yeah, there could be just scum in the Australian magical community, or it could be that someone saw it as an opportunity and pulled decent people into it and it's not a complete cesspool. As canon doesn't touch on it it really could go both ways.

** Most families were okay with marrying other families / half bloods. For example, even the Malfoys would be known to marry halfbloods if there were no other choices other than first cousins available. The Gaunts and to some extent the Blacks (Orion and Walburga were first cousins, and Bellatrix is clearly unhinged -- whether from Azkaban or pre-Azkaban) were the ones who married their cousins too often

** marrying your first cousins is avoided by pure bloods and even if its done its not really dangerous as long its not done for multiple generations. so they would fine for the most par as long they dont marry exclusively in the family
