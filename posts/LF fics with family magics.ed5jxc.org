it's a bit overdone as a trope to give harry quick power boost but i was hoping for good fics with the concept

i have read linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12516323/44/Defiance]]) and really liked them both


** linkffn(3695087) is a crack-fic that is very good, and plays with the idea of family magics in several ways...or rather the concept is central to several different plot elements.

** Linkffn(13313064) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13313064/1/All-According-to-Plan-supplementl]] I've just finished reading all that's available of this and loved it. It's about Black family magic, not Potter, but definitely focuses on family magic. A young Bellatrix Black from an alternate universe gets dropped into the main universe in third year and tries to bring back the family and kill Voldemort as a kind of side quest. It's surprisingly well done.
