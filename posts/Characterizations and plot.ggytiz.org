How do you plan a character's psychology? Do you adapt their personality to the plot or do you create the plot around the various characterizations? Or do you have other methods? If so, which ones?


** Personally, I do a /lot/ of planning, since I'm a worldbuilding fanatic, but the plot and sequence of events generally stems from the characters and their choices/motivations. And in order for that to work, you really have to have an intimate understanding of all the characters involved. For me, character consistency is really important.

I'll usually write up an outline of a progression that I think will happen based on the main character(s) personality. Most of the time, it begins with a catalyst. This is what a lot of people would call "plot", but it's more just an inciting incident. So let's say that idea is "character A gets sorted into a different Hogwarts House". Just as a simple example (mine are normally longer than this but yaknow), the outline could look like:

Ch 1 - character A gets sorted into a different House Ch 2 - character A meets their new dormmates Ch 3 - character A defends their brand new friends from a bully

Cool, I think that character A is a person who makes friends quickly and easily, and is bold enough to stand up for them. But it's not set in stone-- sometimes I'll write a scene and it will progress differently. Maybe in chapter 1, the bully character decides to humiliate character A in front of the whole school. Maybe in chapter 2, one of the dormmates accidentally says something offensive to character A and it sparks an argument. And because of those things, in chapter 3, character A is too afraid to interfere when they witness that person being bullied.

In that way, if you know the characters, and always stay true to each characters strengths and weaknesses, their goals and desires, then the story can weave into something truly complex and human that you couldn't 100% plan from the start. It requires some constant reevaluation of the "plot" itself, but the central focus is on consistency of character, and evolution of relationships/personality. Or similarly, if your plot revolves around a villain, you'd constantly be thinking "what does the villain want right now and how are they working to obtain it", and from there you evaluate your hero's goals as well and see where you want them to intersect.

Then again, not everyone has these same priorities in mind. I love exploring psychology, relationships, and mental illness in my writing; therefore, my process is more suited to those interests. So it's really up to what themes you want to explore, what fascinates you about what you're writing, and what style you're looking to write in.

**** Hmm... Well, I've been working for a year and a half on co-writing a longfic that heavily relies on this format. We have many Google docs/sheets to attest to our rigorous, but adaptable, planning methods haha.
