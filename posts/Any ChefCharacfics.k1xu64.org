In almost every fic I read, none of the characters (save for Kreacher and Molly) seem to be able to cook anything without burning it.

So can you please recommend me some fics where the characters are chefs, or just write ideas in the replies.


** I think there was a fic about gorden ramsy being the potions teacher at hogwarts. U might wanna post a post to look for that

** Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce might be what you're looking for.

** linkffn(12562072) Harry is supposedly really good at cooking (or as he calls it "cheffing") in this one (and sinyk's other stories too to some extent).
