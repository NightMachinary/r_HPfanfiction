:END:
Dumbledore tries to portkey Harry back to the office, but accidentally holds onto it too long is portkeyed back himself and this gives Harry the time to have a meeting with Fudge.

I remember that Harry predicts one of the lies Dumbledore attempts on Fudge, and Fudge just pulls out a note signed by Harry proving Dumbledore wrong and comments about how it was "very interesting, very interesting indeed" that Harry was able to predict Dumbledore's tactics.

******* I'm reading the same fic and it depends on your definition of dark. He's definitely powerful. I'll mark this spoilers just in case, but it's the first chapter: he's an emperor that's conquered all of Europe, and the whole story is a history leading up to that written by his daughter.

Definitely agree it's very good.

I actually work in the nuclear power industry, after spending 12 years doing it in the navy, so some of the stuff that they're going over in the chapter I'm reading now (24/48), is actually very interesting considering what I remember from my time floating around the ocean at the behest of the government... lol

  During the summer before his sixth year, Harry reflects on the death of his Godfather, Sirius Black, and decides that it's time to fight back. If it's war Voldemort wants, it's war he will get! (Assuming Harry's raging teenage hormones don't distract him, that is.) A novel-length re-write of Half-Blood Prince. Independent!Harry. Proactive!Harry. Honks.
