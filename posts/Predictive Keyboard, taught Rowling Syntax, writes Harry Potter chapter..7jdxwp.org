*** By the end Harry is a blind ghost, Hermione's family has been eaten, and Hermione herself would have been eaten if not for the fact that Harry was a ghost. And Ron lost his handsomeness, possibly due to being spiders.

And Harry fell down the stairs for the rest of the summer. And Hagrid has been replaced by the pig of Hufflepuff. /And Hermione forgot how to dance/.

** Brilliant. Strangely, this is more comprehensible than /My Immortal/.

I'm visualising this scene and it's marvellous:

#+begin_quote
  The Great Hall was filled with incredible moaning chandeliers and a large librarian who had decorated the sinks with books about masonry. Mountains of mice exploded. Several long pumpkins fell out of McGonagall. Dumbledore's hair scooted next to Hermione as Dumbledore arrived at school.

** lol this is so strange and yet amazing.

"Ron was standing there and doing a kind of frenzied tap dance. He saw Harry and immediately began to eat Hermione's family." Um what? I seriously hope that was some kind of typo because otherwise what?

Ron's Ron shirt was just as bad as Ron himself, made me laugh harder than I should have.

Ron was going to be spiders. He just was. He wasn't proud of that, but it was going to be hard to not have spiders all over his body after all is said and done. Again what? Why would Ron of all people have spiders all over his body? And then it said that Ron was going to be spiders, I just don't know what to think about it lol.

Harry tore his eyes from his head and threw them into the forest. What! What! This made me have two reactions, the first was to laugh and the other was to want to bang my head against the wall.

The tall Death Eater was wearing a shirt that said "Hermione has forgotten how to dance." lmao I just, can't stop laughing at the ridiculousness of this, it's great.

Harry dipped Hermione in hot sauce. The Death Eaters were dead now and Harry was hungrier than he had ever been. Can't stop quoting these! These lines are just what in the world.

Dumbledore's hair scooted next to Hermione.... um I don't even know what to say sbout this,

The pig of Hufflepuff pulsed like a bullfrog. Dumbledore smiled at it, and placed his hand on its head: You are Hagrid now. Sounds like Dumbledore has gone senile lol. And the pig of Hufflepuff pulsed like a large bullfrog? Um again what?!

Harry looked around and then fell down the spiral staircase for the rest of the summer. lmao again I laughed way harder at this then I should have, he'll be needing St. Mungo's after spending all Summer falling down the staircase lol.

*** He's already a ghost since the first page, so the fall won't hurt him too badly. I'm more worried about him having torn his eyes from his head and thrown them into the forest.

I think Ron eating Hermione's family may have been an early sign that he was going to be spiders. (He just was.)
