Hey there,

I recently read /The Art of Self-Fashioning/ and was reminded of a fic I came across once. In it James Potter was (of course) a transfiguration prodigy. However, instead of just using it to tranfigure shields, animals, or stuff to throw at his opponents, he actually transfigured his enemies' organs into ice blocks (or something like that).

So first off, I'd really like to know which fic this is from, and secondly I wanted to know if there were any fics out there in which Harry uses transfiguration like that.

Thanks in advance!


** Don't know about that fic but battle transfiguration features in linkffn(The Lie Ive Lived).

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** linkffn(Wind Shear) is a pretty new fic. I'm not sure it's exactly what you're looking for, but in it Harry creates constructs out of magic and uses them to absorb curses and dark magic and use the dark magic against the casters. For example, a Death Eater casts a rotting curse and Harry's stone lion eats the ground the curse hits, and uses it to make the caster rot. The transfiguration is quite creative but also mostly uses constructs.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** Ah, that's exactly what I'm /not/ looking for.

It sounds interesting though, so I'll give it a read. Thanks. :)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
