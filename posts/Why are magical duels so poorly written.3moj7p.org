Obviously in school yard fights the combatants aren't trying to seriously harm each other but in a war why would someone ever use rictusempra/tarantallegra/locomotor mortis/etc. If you can hit your opponent with a spell there is no need to distract them so that is not a viable strategy.


** Well, minor jinxes and curses probably take less power/time to cast, so pelting your enemy with them (to keep them on the move/defensive) is a viable strategie (particularly if you are a student and don't know any real combat magic yet...and let's be honest: A stunner is singularily unhelpful if it's so easily countered...) because somebody can't attack you if they have to dodge/shield all the time (till you either wear them down or have time to really cast something to take them out!)

ps: There's enough fanfictions with amazing fighting/duelling scenes :) (the more AU you get, the better they seem to become IMHO)

So, as I don't know how to use the bot to post links, I'll just give you the author's if that's ok?

You might try:

- Shezza (with his/her Denarian-Series, which starts with Denarian Renegade...it's a crossover with Dresden Files (though it's not necessary to have read that - I never did, I don't like that it brings up religion so much...don't even like that on TV (the new Battlestar Galactica for example...-.-))

- joe6991 (Wastelands of Time (don't know about the rest of his fics, some other people seem to like "Harry Potter and the sword of the Hero" though)...hope you don't mind the ship (Harry/Fleur))

- Starfox5 (Patron...though I think the really good scenes will come later (the war is about to heat up...can't have that many great fights before fourth year, can you now? - Unless you have Voldy return early or give the hero other enemies!))

- I - myself - am currently reading "A Cadmean Victory" by DarknessEnthroned (it has some fighting, but not much - still, there's more to come IMHO and it's pretty good otherwise (partly because of the ship...I am a sucker for Harry/Fleur after all (don't like Harry/Ginny that much, as I don't like her!)...but also because Harry gets great advice, hell, he even finds a way to get rid of the Horcrux (and the kicker: He's a little selfish at times - I dislike the always selfless hero a little, as such a character is so unrealistic - which is good, unless you turn into Draco Malfoy :( ))

- ... (well, I am tapped out for now...sadly my browser history is gone (that would have been a treasure trove -.-) but I had damned malware/viruses/rootkits etc. on my computer and anti-virus software was only doing more damage than good when trying to remove it (couldn't use any browser anymore and reinstalling them didn't work either!), so I have clean installed windows (and so nothing is there anymore :(

** Why? Challenge accepted! :D

Rictusempra: Tickle someone hard enough and you can make them puke, faint, and probably even stop their heart. Needless to say, they won't be able to utter an incantation.

Tarantallegra: If you have no balance, how can you even aim?

Locomotor Mortis: See above.

HP magic is conceptual, with the strength and function of a spell varying widely based on a number of (sometimes arbitrary) factors. So for duellists who aren't on the level of Hogwarts professors in terms of skill, you might expect to see a lot of this. Fanfics do handle it poorly, but Sturgeon's Law and whatnot.

**** But a lot of these fights, depending on what genre you're reading, are done by young people. Often students or recent graduates. The focus in canon when it comes to spellcasting is minor/non harmful, or self defense. We don't see them learning many jinxes/hexes/curses. Spells that could be used like one, sure.

If you've got students fighting, they're greatly limited by what the school, and possibly their family, chose to teach. The only way for them to win just might be multiple spells to weaken someone. If you've got a young graduate, think about the quality of defense instructors at Hogwarts for the last few decades.

These spells aren't necessarily to distract them. It's to cripple them. Cast jelly legs by a ledge or stairs. Ticking jinx in water, or if your opponent is only verbally casting. Can't cast if you can't speak (if you're not proficient at silent casting). Hell a well done /lumos/ can blind your opponent, then go in Muggle fighting.

Many of the fights I've read with an older crowd are much better done. Blasting and severing, binding, entrails expelling... And often it's the name of the spell, or only the effect described, not some incantation. Fights with adults shouldn't be half yelling incantations- they should know better by then. Not /all/ will be able to do it silently, but shouting your plan only informs your enemies of when to duck.

It's a good point. If you compare these with the MoM fight between Voldemort and Dumbledore their is no comparison. No one is trying to make the other cluck like a chicken for a tactical advantage. It's like if you have heavy artillery on your side you don't bother trying to trip your opponent. Dumbledore and Voldemort don't throw around "conceptual magic" but forceful magic, kinetic magic, raging fire, banished shrapnel, crushing torrents of water. It's not to wear the enemy down but overwhelm and overpower them. Many AU fics are enjoyable because they give us this sort of fight again and again, instead of once through 7 looong books.

****** Absolutely. People either have to have that time or reason, or even access, to train to have those lovely battles, otherwise they're going to be stuck at their school level with stuff. Someone with "dark" family is almost certain to know more than just some regular school kid, but we can't assume all of them have that advantage.

AUs take advantage of that, sometimes to outstanding results. And I love when they show that difference- putting the character with the training on the same battlefield as those without. You get minor things and stunners in the same battle when blasting spells are aimed at the chest.

***** It seems to me that silent casting isn't a skill on its own so much as the indication of mastery in that particular spell. You might have Diffindo down to a grunt but you still need to enunciate Engorgio- because cutting something is an everyday matter versus the rare need to make something swell to three times its original size. Dolohov was an experienced duelist and overall horrible person, but his purple flame spell on Hermione was effectively 'blunted' by him being forced to cast it silently.

For a few spells, I think the incantation is a form of intimidation- using the Killing curse wouldn't require it being spoken for casters familiar with its use (Bellatrix killed a fox with it using nothing but a quick-drawn wand), but there may be some shock value of hearing your opponent go to that extreme.

****** I see it as a mix of both. You have to have basically perfected the spell in question, but silent casting being a skill itself. They play off each other. If you can already silently cast /lumos/, it'll be easier for you to be able to silently cast /aguamenti/. Like a magical muscle? If that makes any sense. (I see silent casting itself being like a focus and channeling, instead of words being a crutch?)

So an excellent duelist or fighter should have the spell perfection and the silent casting, but some regular Joe might only be able to for a few. But these battles typically aren't some stranger from Diagon.

I imagine going further in silent casting could be a big part of some classes 7th year, since it's introduced in, what, 6th? But since we don't see that, it's stuck in 7th year AUs.

**** But... but...

Okay, I'll put it this way. You know how several of the duels in canon are just too funny to take seriously? People growing antlers, heads inflating or turning into pumpkins, etc. ? Why kill someone when you can do that instead?

Because of the whimsical, conceptual nature of the HP magic system (and it not being much of a system in the first place is what makes it brilliant IMO), you can do so much with a Tickling Charm, as I said earlier. Want to use the Jelly-Legs Jinx on someone's arms? Just change the incantation to something like "*Manu*-motor Wibbly" (this specifically would likely end in disaster) and Robert's your mother's brother.

Seriously - unless you're a terrible person overall, why use a a Blood-Boiling Curse or AK or something worse to end a fight?

** I assume that some of the lesser spells are used as distractions - make the other side guess which are the nasty spells and which are the thrown-away jinxes when half a dozen red spells are fying at you. I also assume that those can be cast faster and more easily, generally.

Though I usually limit those kind of spells to such that do immobilize a target if they hit, or have a similar effect. It's harder to dodge a Killing Curse if you are dancing against your will.

** I like the way that spell chaining handles this issue. It explains why you would use a non-life threatening jinx in the middle of combat; it flows with the last spell into another dangerous spell. Easier spells are also easier to cast non-verbally/wandlessly - see Harry casting a Lumos wandlessly when he drops his wand in cannon. This means they can cast the jinx extremely quick and the opponent doesn't know what's coming.

I agree with you though that combat is severely lacking in many fics, mainly because combat is hard to write. They also aren't focused on the combat; a lot of writers write fanfiction because they enjoy the characters and interactions, not necessarily the barely explained magical combat system. I've read some fics that are otherwise great, but the combat is pathetic and not thought out at all. Order members using rictusempra is inexcusable, unless it's that member's best spell (how Ginny's bat-bogey hex is significantly stronger and better than most people's). Stupefy and expelliarmus logically would have stronger equivalents in the Auror force. They learn those spells in school, so logically if school is a foundation, the Auror's training program would have the 'better' versions of those spells. Perhaps the spell slips the person into a coma, or password locks the revival. People have an opportunity to be very creative, but for most, they don't care enough about the combat to make sure the spells and tactics used are sensible.

*** While I agree with the point you were making- that simple spells are easier to learn wordlessly or wandlessly- the case of Harry during the Dementor attack was him invoking his wand from a distance; not exactly wandless, since the light wasn't issuing from his fingertips.

Also, I'm not convinced that the Aurors use anything 'better' than the spells Harry learned at Hogwarts. In a sense, a drill makes holes and a saw cuts wood- the tools don't change much, though the skill applied will.

Which is why I've mentioned just how frightening Harry might be as a Head Auror when you consider his proficiency with the Disarming Charm by the end of the series. Though it would almost certainly be reversible, it's probable that he could literally /remove/ someone's arm with it by the Epilogue. It would also be nice to read this.

**** I'd not be convinced, except for the fact that Auror Training takes 3 years. They are also trained in 'extensive magical combat.' Logically, it would make sense that each Auror trained would have spells passed down by their mentor that may not be public. Considering law, enforcement of law, infiltration, poison remedies, along with combat are the minimum things that you learn as an Auror trainee, it makes sense that you don't use schoolyard hexes and defense in training. We also never even see NEWT level defensive work outside of the Patronus, which is actually considered beyond NEWT level. As far as I can recall, no other spell was mentioned as specifically being beyond the NEWT level, although from the defensive magic Dumbledore uses in his duels with Voldemort, there is obviously advanced defensive magic that is not necessarily dark. While this doesn't confirm that Aurors use this advanced defensive magic, it would make sense to me that if it is available then it would be used. At the same time, Aurors not trained by Moody are shown to be pretty incompetent when it comes to magical combat. This says to me that not all Aurors are created equal. It could be that Voldemort's supporters in the Ministry have been actively working for a long time to try to keep the Auror force as incompetent as possible, in order to make their criminal activities easier. When the main ring of crime is mostly in control of the government, and that government is also corrupt, it only makes sense that people would revere Moody, as he is probably one of the only old-school Aurors (read competently trained) left.

** The straightforward answer to your question, if we're talking about duels to the death, is bad writing, or writing for the sake of drama at the expense of being sensible. However, most duels are not to the death. In such a traditional, class conscious society like the British wizarding world dueling is rarely actually about killing your opponent. It's about honor, and codes of behavior, and perhaps reinforcing hierarchies of power. Browse through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel][Wikipedia article on dueling]] to get some perspective on this.

There's not much canon basis for the rest of what I say, even if you delve into Pottermore, because Rowling deliberately keeps the history of her world pretty sketchy, but it doesn't seem too crazy to assume that after the implementation of the statue of secrecy the wizarding world essentially doesn't have any history of state-level violent conflict or of "war" in the 20th century "total war" sense.

Grindelwald seems to have been mostly a side show to the muggle WWII that was handled as a personal matter by Dumbledore and a handful of other wizards and witches. Most "dark wizards" seem to be handled in the same manner of pre-9/11 terrorism: essentially as a police matter. Canon Voldemort never seeks open warfare, preferring a strategy of terrorism followed by a coup d'état (the existence of mind control in the Potterverse makes this an even more attractive option).

All of this means it makes sense that wizards don't practice tactics suited to efficient killing. Keep in mind also that the population of the wizarding world is small; large scale killing would threaten the sustainability of the population as a whole.

** Well, the first and most obvious reason would be that Rowling might not have planned the spells/duels to be "balanced" for fighting.

Most strategy games like Starcraft spend months and months tweaking unit weapons/powers for balance in a rock-paper-scissor style so that no single weapon/power is overwhelmingly strong, and every weapon/power has its weaknesses and strengths.

If authors were to take their time to work around this, they would need to balance each spell using levers such as skill required for casting, time to cast, damage caused, energy/power used, single target vs multiple target, "impact to casters soul", detectable vs silent etc.

This would mean that duels would have some low damage but quick spells, high damage but slow spells, draining spells that are used only against multiple opponents.

The second reason would be to have a standard flow to the fight. I'd compare a duel to something like a typical boxing match. No decent boxer facing another good boxer would try to go for a knockout punch on their first shot.

Typically, a lot of time would be spent on feints, quick jabs, moving around looking for weaknesses or obvious tells and getting into a rhythm trying to understand the opponents patterns (he always returns a left jab with a right dodge etc...), while conserving energy and waiting for an opportunity to knock the opponent out.

Applied to a decent magical duel, it would mean using a few "bread-and-butter" favorite, easy but distracting spells again and again to keep the opponent on their toes while waiting for an opening. The knockout or heavy spells would also be signature spells that the caster favors and are used only once in a while.

I'd say these two factors could be combined into making a fairly competent spell/dueling system, however I don't know of anyone who has taken the time to focus on this and make a complete, logically consistent system, magical system.

A few authors have taken the time to plan out their duels a lot better than the typical poorly written ones. One of my recent favorites is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi)

** - There are very few people in Rowling's magical world.
- If fights were fought as decisively as they could easily be given canon spells, every skirmish would be a national tragedy and rather soon there wouldn't be anybody left to snark over the dead bodies.
- Hence, you have to impose some limitation - either magic-wise, or some honor code type thing - to keep the fatalities down.

** I agree completely. But a stupefy is also not that effective if the others have ennervate. So you'd have to kill or maim to be really effective.

*** In a 1 on 1 fight a stupify is stronger than most anything, its instant disable.

**** Yep 1on1. But we don't know anything more than its red color. Maybe it's slow moving? Maybe it's more magically taxing? Maybe the movements are hard to do on the move whereas others are easier to. Maybe other spells don't have a bolt but are more or less instantaneous if you aim right like with transfiguration of things.
