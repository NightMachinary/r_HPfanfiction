Not one where purebloods get to choose muggleborns and all that, but rather that the Ministry just wants people to reproduce in general.

Example: Harry travels the world after Voldemort's defeat. The Ministry stays corrupt as hell, and create a marriage law. Harry comes back, goes "what the fuck guys" and decides he can't leave the Ministry alone for a week without everything going to hell, so he, along with many others, just bring the Ministry down.

Or, a different example: Fudge and Umbridge want to pass a law to control Harry, so they pass one that only applies to those who are the last of their line. Like Harry. They try to get him to marry some woman of their choosing.


** If they passed the law before Voldemort's defeat, before our heroes really got strong, the most likely outcome would be an exodus, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/][Escape]], linkffn(11916243).

But if they tried to pull the same crap on the Vanquisher of Voldemort, then violent revolution would be most likely. Maybe Harry wouldn't go as far as in "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", but significant bloodshed should be expected.

Good guys could only be pushed so far.

--------------

The author of NOFP wrote an (anti) marriage law fic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901). Basically, Harry was badly hurt after his win over Voldemort and was in no shape to fight the Ministry. So, he hired some super assassin (SI) from America to take out those responsible for the marriage law.

Bobmin356 wrote the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]], linkffn(4960536), in which a super!Harry took out those responsible by himself.

Another [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5802874/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][fic with the same title]], linkffn(5802874), has him going full serial killer mode on prospective brides. (I disagree very much with this approach. I mean if he was willing to kill, why choose potentially innocent girls over CERTAINLY GUILTY politicians?)

Honestly, the 'marriage law trope' was an utterly brain dead idea cooked up by delusional shippers who wanted to force their favorite characters together. They had no sense of how real world people would respond to that kind of shit. As for governments wanting to stimulate population growth, tax incentives, child credits, and other privileges are the way to go.

*** To be honest, if managed correctly Ã  population will accept almost anything. The WW in particular is ripe for the development of a 1984 type of situation. They have a state that already pries into the private lives of citizens, and nobody seems to object to this. They have a badly corrupt legal system and a police force that has shown itself willing to make use of terror tactics in the pursuit of justice (Aurors in VW1, Sirius Black imprisoned without trial for 12 years). They have a small and insular community with a credible outside threat.

To top it off they have had two devastating wars in eighteen years, one of which included a total ministry coup. During which time, it has to be said, there is no sign that the community as a whole resisted in any meaningful way when measures such as the Muggleborn Registration Committee was implemented. Not to mention that the media is under the control of the government (witness the stories printed about HP during OotP)

To sum up: the population is small, already used to restrictive government, scared, and apparently unwilling to stand up to the government.

In addition, if we take into account what Sirius said about pureblood families being interrelated, there might actually /be/ a noticeable problem with fertility and other issues associated with inbreeding among pureblood families.

If the Ministry hit the right note (and I can see a number of plausible hooks - losses in war, building up the population, a duty to breed) I don't think it's unlikely that laws regulating or mandating marriage might not only pass, but be widely embraced by a population with a 'Ministry Knows Best' attitude.

**** As I said before, if they tried that when Voldemort was still around and heroes were weak, then exodus was indeed the most likely option.

But forcing couples together after the War, do you really believe the Muggleborns would put up with that shit so soon after surviving a genocide? Do you really believe that the DA, the Weasleys, the Longbottoms, and Hogwarts students who had just suffered and bled so much would let cowardly and corrupt Ministry rule over their fates?

******* Harry and his friends might not be but the rest of the population most certainly /is/.

And one of the dangers that dystopian fiction makes clear is the /insidious/ nature of many of these governments. In a succesful scenario ending in a totalitarian dystopia, the government will take a frog in a pot approach, eroding small freedoms one by one, testing their control of the population, until eventually, all unnoticed, the private lives of ordinary citizens are in the hands of the creeping bureaucracy of an authoritarian state. By which time it is generally too late - by the time the general population becomes aware that they are essentially prisoners of a police state, they have been so conditioned to obey, and had so many freedoms, rights, and powers stripped from them that effective resistance is difficult if not impossible.

As I said in my first comment, the WW has many of the ingredients necessary for a dystopian regime to occur already in place - one might actually say that the WW already /is/ a dystopia, considering the human rights abuses that we are explicitly informed of by the canon.

And bringing this back to the MLC, one of the primary features of any dystopian government is that it brings citizens' private lives under the control of the state. As a real-world example, consider the laws against racial intermarriage in Apartheid South Africa, which prohibited certain forms of marriage and breeding. If /those/ laws could be passed in a real world country with a nodding acquaintance with democracy, is there any reason to say that a law compelling certain forms of marriage /could never pass/ in the WW?

I'm not saying that a Marriage Law would be the first step, but once you've got a population that is used to having certain freedoms curtailed, fed on government propaganda and properly paranoid against the inimical Other (in the WW, that would be Muggles obviously) as well as recidivists in their own midst, a Marriage Law of the type specified by the challenge would definitely be viable.

..

Fuck, now I want to write a properly dystopian MLC fic. Dammit. Why do I do this to myself?

******** You are assuming that the British Ministry of Magic was competent and powerful.

But if that were the case, it would have crushed Voldemort's uprising long time ago with Dumbledore's help. In a position of strength, it could actually pass some very controversial legislations.

The situation after Voldemort's fall was however exactly the opposite. Voldemort, even with the full might of a Ministry under his control, was crushed at Battle of Hogwarts. The center of power had already shifted to the DA and the Order, who both answered to Harry Potter. If the Ministry was still stupid and insane enough to push through something like a marriage law, it would have signed its own death warrant.

You gotta be kidding me! If the Ministry was willing to go that far, then it would be the /destabilizing/ factor of Magical Britain, and it would be the Problem. Burning it down and rebuilding it from the scratch was the /best/ option.

Even in the Books, this Ministry fell to two coups/revolutions within 10 months. What legitimacy would this piece of shit have in any society? It was already exposed as a paper tiger and laughing stock. And suppose this piece of shit still hadn't learnt its lessons and dared to push through something as insane as a marriage law, what do you think the Vanquisher of Voldemort was going to do?
