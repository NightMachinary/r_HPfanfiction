"You dumped me with a man and woman who hated me for being born. Then you only let me leave so I could fight in a war you're too lazy to win!"

"Harry-"

"You have a man on the inside, and all you need is a two word spell. Honestly, anyone could do it, if it's too beneath you to kill him."

Harry's accusatory tone dripped with condescension, flared nostrils and a venomous sneer twisting his features as Dumbledore's own lips thinned to a pencil line,

"It is not that simple Harry, and you know it. The Prophecy-"

"If you think about it-"

"Stop interrupting me, Harry." It was firm, a steely response that slashed through the air. Accompanied by the icy glare of the Hogwarts headmaster, glaring down at the teen with a gaze as solid as sapphire. Harry wasn't remotely perturbed,

"I've already completed the Prophecy. 14 years ago after the man murdered my mum in front of me. He claimed I was his equal, and he flung that curse at me. But something he wasn't aware of flung that curse back at him and killed him." The smirk that lifted the corner of Harry's lips again was cold, accompanied by a hollow bark of laughter, "A power he knew not, don't you think?"

That laugh came again, ignorant and uncaring of the cold sweat and heavy stomach of the elderly man across from it. An elderly man who had, more than once, considered this possibility, dismissing it out of hand.

"Let's be frank, Professor. Placing your bets on me is stupid. I'm an average students at best, he was a prodigy at my age and has only got more skilled and powerful." Hands balled into fists on both sides of the desk, "In a duel I'd never win, but you would. He ran away from you in the Ministry, and I'm sure you're not exactly in your prime. What's stopping you from sprinkling in that one curse he can't block? Who on the planet would blame you? Would penalise you? You're Albus bloody Dumbledore!"

The boy received no response, the gentle singing of Fawkes and the soft mutters of the portraits the only noise in the Headmasters office until the scraping of chair legs on the hard floor.

"I'm leaving."

"Harry..."

Harry waited, halfway to the door and part turned back to the man, half moon spectacles removed and firmly on the tabletop he was glaring a hole through. When nothing was said Harry sighed, leaving without further comment or eye contact.

Albus Dumbledore tugged at his beard for a moment that lasted three hours, tugging and thinking and praying. Praying for a forgiveness he knew he had not earned, yet decided he would work towards with the next steps he took.

Fawkes trilled a tune that inspired confidence, weary bones moving to the draw to retrieve implements for writing. A few minutes later , the fruits of his labour left the room in a burst of flame.

The first to the young man who'd just left; an apology, a promise for transparency and a request to borrow his invisibility cloak.

The second to another young man, older and far less likely to forgive an old man who'd both under AND overestimated his abilities over the years. Enclosed instructions for his next assignment, one that would end this war before any more blood would be spilled.

He'd spent far too much time locked away in the castle when he could have been doing something. When Gellert marched on Europe and Albus had been late in his response, he'd sworn (like many did after thay evil time in human history) "never again."

Now he HAD to stick by that vow...


** The place was a nondescript hangar, spacious, yet unimportant, but Albus guessed it wouldn't remain so after today, one way or another.

He heard the telltale pops of apparition and saw Severus appear on the side, followed by twenty other Death Eaters around the room and finally Tom himself and Nagini, on the center there was a moment of confusion as they looked around, before turning to Severus.

"Well, Severus, now guide us to Potter, you said he was hiding nearby"

Severus looked back, his face blank.

"You are already where you should be, /my Lord"/

There was a beat, before Voldemort guided by instinct raised his wand to block blasting spell coming his way from in front of him. There was a crack and the shockwave staggered all.

Dumbledore removed the Cloak, he knew he should've used another spell, but old habits die hard.

The old wizard looked around the room, and steeled himself, the memory of Fabian and Gideon coming to the forefront of his mind, both laughing around the table, and then Molly's crying face upon receiving the news, no more.

With a flick of his wand, Avery exploded in a shower of ash and blood.

He remembered sweet Marlene who looked at Sirius with fondness and didn't care if he was disowned, and then Sirius eyes moistening and deadening when the report came, his smile never the same. No more.

A swish and Goyle Sr. paled unnaturally and cracked, turning to salt.

The Elder Wand sang to him, finally accepting him as it's master, the prospect of fulfilling its purpose filling it with dark eagerness and him with unholy power.

They tried to retaliate, but an upward slash and the ground broke, blocks of concrete becoming floating barriers who intercepted two Killing Curses, a barely visible flick raising a silvery blue shield to stop the twelve other spells launched against him.

Dumbledore twirled his wand, one of the wooden boxes turning into a lion in the blink of an eye, jumping at two unsuspecting Death Eaters from behind, killing one before the other could banish it to the wall. Five spells of different colors came out of Albus's wand while he swung it in an arc in front of himself, the maroon one hit Mulciber making him choke and fall, the yellow one was barely blocked by Bellatrix, the blue and acqua ones hit two others, going through their shields and blasting them to the wall, they didn't get up.

Severus had downed two others and was dueling other three.

Voldemort finally gathered his wits and started casting at Albus with all he had, realizing Dumbledore was no longer fighting to capture.

"Ha! Finally cracked old man! I knew one day I would break you!" he laughed, but the apprehension in his eyes was clear.

Dumbledore swished and flicked, slashed and twirled his wand, blocking the spells with magic and concrete, three other death eaters fell, fist-sized holes in their chests. The hangar was filled with multicolored lights.

Albus focused Tom Riddle in his vision, the blocking of the attacks of others being done almost on reflex.

"Yes, Tom, after all these years, you /broke ME!"/

He remembered Frank and Alice, always solicitous, always kind, he remembered their now vacant stares, he remembered young Neville, always afraid until Harry helped him find himself, no more.

There was a slash and Bellatrix Lestrange barely had time to register her shield was cut like paper before /she/ was cut in half at the stomach.

"You broke me Tom" he remembered Harry, too thin Harry, too afraid to be touched Harry, too young and innocent Harry, having to find his way through the world alone, he remembered bright and gentle Lily, and brave James, courageous Sirius, and his insides burned in anger, hatred.

He could almost hear the Wand now, it whispered, content in the destruction caused, and eager for more, and it offered him one of its many dark gifts, it remembered every spell cast through itself, it offered one, tailored for revenge, and oddly ironic. And Dumbledore grinned.

Tom Riddle almost recoiled at the sight, the pure hatred in Dumbledore's eyes, the cruelness in his face almost inappropriate in their place, never he could relate those things to Albus Dumbledore, and yet here they were. For the first time in many years, he felt fear.

"And now you stupid /child,/ you shall /burn"/

Albus remembered that spell, he had seen it, he had read about, but he had never learned how to cast it, only how to counter it, for it was a favorite of Gellert, but now, thanks to the Wand he knew.

"Protego Diabolica" it was a whisper, but it carried to all.

The blue fire came with a spin of his wand above himself, already in the moment of its creation tendrils snaked out and vaporized five Death Eaters, stopping most in their tracks, many tried to apparate, or use portkeys but found they couldn't.

"Wards! There's wards!"

"Break them! break them!"

Some ran for the doors, but Albus did an upwards slash, and a screeching Phoenix, with red eyes and made of blue fire came out of the circle and burned them too.

Snape merely nodded, his face pale and eyes wide, before he touched a necklace and disappeared.

Nagini was dead at his feet, the Killing Curse having done its job.

More and more tendrils came, the circle expanding and consuming boxes and wizards alike, Voldemort was bewildered, seeing his most powerful followers turned to ashes as if they were nothing, he hastily blocked a Phoenix made of blue fire, still feeling the heat blistering his skin, closing his eyes during the flash, until he heard Dumbledore utter two words he never thought would come out of him.

***** It baffles me that this wasn't an option on the table. Unless they were under a Fidelius, I don't understand why they couldn't blow Malfoy Manor sky high and then hunt the Horcruxes at their leisure.

Hell, get Snape to tell them when Voldemort is there and boom assassins. Or just strap a some sort of explosives in there and kill them all, there's got to be someone fanatical enough to do it.

With Voldemort gone, they could remove his soul anchors without the threat of Voldemort himself.
