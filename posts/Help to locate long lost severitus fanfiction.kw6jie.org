I realy need some help to locate a fanfiction I read on fanfiction.net a few years ago but can't find it again. Did not get to bookmark it as the tablet I read it on quite litterally died (was not currently logged in as I read it). Not sure if it has been removed or it it is just me that is blind in my search.

The story was a severitus. Petunia and Lucuis Malfoy were good. Severus adopted Harry after Vernon had tried to kill Petunia. Petunia managed to send/give dirctions to Harry amd Dudley about how to get to Severus in order to seek sanctuary there when Vernon attacked Petunia. Petunia raised Dudley after that in Spinners End which had been bought and developed by Lucius. Petunia was a squib. To protect Harry, Severus moved to a dragon preserve. Severus was in a relationship with Rosmerta. Lucius and Severus ressurected Tom Riddle jr. from the Diary with the voulenteered soul of a dragon. Said dragon left a part in Tom to help guide him and not turn into Voldemort 2.0. Tom, Lucius and Severus worked together to deal with the other Horcuxes that Voldemort left. Lucius and Narcissa had split (due to confliction view on the Dark Lord, Lucius denouncing him, Narcissa supporting the Dark Lord). Lucius ended up in a relationship with Petunia. Tom ended up in a relationship with Nymphedora Tonks.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
