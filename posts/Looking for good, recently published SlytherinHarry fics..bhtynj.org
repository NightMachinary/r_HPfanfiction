No romance, no gender bender, Focused on Harry, and hopefully has a lot of dark arts in it.

By recently published I mean in the past 6 months, after October 26, 2018, not before.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

Why did the ao3 query "sarcasm and Slytherin"' return 'Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes?'

**** it's on Ao3, so each book's worth of chapters is its own 'work'. That, I believe, is the first of them.
