I'm looking for the best Harry/Gabrielle fics out there! Preferably no harem.

Thank you in advance!


** linkffn(11326267) Back to the World is probably the best Harry/Gabrielle i've read recently and I loved it, Harry basically doesn't know what to do with his life and travels the world until he meets Gabby

Harry Potter and The Power He Knows not is also good though it is still updating, Gabby is i think two years older than Harry in this fic linkffn(13160344)

Potters Against the World linkffn(12200475): be warned this is story has incest though the story handles it suprisingly well, its a three way relationship between Harry/His twin sister and gabby.

You Meet in Paris: linkffn(13328397) is sad and don't read unless you want to cry.

*** The Reluctant Champion has been alright so far. It features a severely... False modest? I don't know how to describe it, downplaying his obvious achievements Harry. It's annoying, but hopefully he grows out of it as the story goes on. I hate that trope. Its realistic for abused children but fuck its super super fucking annoying to read

**** I hope he grows out of it but from what I understand of harry at least during his early years at Hogwarts at least until year 5 he WAS very modest. Not nearly as modest as he is in Reluctant Champion, but Modest. He didn't want to participate in the goblet of fire because he didn't want anymore fame etc, he does grow out of it though.

  Seven years after the fall of Voldemort Harry doesn't know what to do with his life. His love life, and everything else, is an absolute mess. Everyone around him seems to be moving ahead with their lives but he isn't moving. Eventually he finds someone to remind him of things he has forgotten and things he treasures. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

******* Gabbie is so happy at being rescued she forms an non reversable veela bond with Harry without asking him. It means they can't get more than a few dozen feet from each other without extricating pain. Harry resents it because he was looking forward to being free after being caged at the Dursleys for so long. Also, he can never do Quidditch again. They try to find a path that works but fail and eventually commit suicide/die of sadness

So basically, it is a forced bonding fic where the participants do not get a happily ever after

*** You have a space between linkffn and the title, that's probably the problem. I have no idea why you bolded the title, either. Sometimes it does take the bot awhile to get to you, though, so just chill if it doesn't work right away.

I actually really disagree with this rec, though.

Harry and Gabrielle /are/ the two main characters, and it /is/ a good read if you want a friendship/hurt/comfort fic. If you're reading it for Harry/Gabrielle romance, though, you're probably reading the wrong thing. Small spoiler: there's no romance until the last chapter, iirc. Then you've got the epilogue. Considering it's more than 200k words I was a little annoyed.

  Harriet Potter woke up in the cupboard under the stairs again. She isn't surprised. Hasn't been surprised by that in a very long time, actually. Fem!Harry, Time-travel, Femslash.

  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.
