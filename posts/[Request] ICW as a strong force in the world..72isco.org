Example: voldemort is scared of bringing the ICW into Britain.......>

Dumbledore and voldemort are scared ....etc.


** At that point, the question becomes a characterizaiton of Dumbledore as well. if the ICW is so strong, and Dumbledore is a major player there, does that mean Dumbledore doesn't mind power as much?

If Albus doesn't care about power as much, how does that mean he will accept the Minister of Magic position when offered? And if that is the case, what changes?

If the ICW is strong, it would have to be the strongest entity in the Magical World, holding /the/ standing army. We are talking War Wizards out the ass here. We are talking a standing army with enough participants that it dwarfs some countries' wizarding populations.

An ICW that not only has military might, but also economical might. Either way, you would have to specify which you mean.

*** That sounds like an awesome premise.

Imagine Voldemort standing over Harry's smoking corpse, rolling up his sleeves and telling the Death Eaters, "Right, that was the easy bit. Let's go legitimise everything on the surface before the Warlocks turn up, then we can go about fighting the ICW."

Then the story goes on about Voldemort trying to convince the suspicious ICW inspectors that yes, everything is going all right in Magical Britain, and no, there are no human rights violations (please ignore some of the more overzealous Death Eaters - /damn you MacNair, this is the last fucking time-/), while he secretly builds up his might to try and weaken and take down the vastly more militarily powerful ICW.
