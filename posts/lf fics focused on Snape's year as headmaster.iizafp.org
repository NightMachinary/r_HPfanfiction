I'm looking for anything that centers on Snape during his year as headmaster. I've seen things from the students' perspectives, but very little from his, and I think it'd be fascinating. Anything out there from his POV? I don't care about pairings, but I do prefer completed.


** The only one that I can recall from his perspective is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841][I Know Not, and I Cannot Know; Yet I Live and I Love]]. There's no pairing, and the story starts in Harry's second year but it does thoroughly include his time as headmaster.

** Oh, this sounds interesting. I feel like it will be filled with snarky comments about looking over dunderheads. I wonder how Snape will feel if he realized Harry wasn't coming back to Hogwarts.

*** He'd be more stressed over trying to balance appeasing the Death Eaters and protecting the students as much as possible without blowing his cover.

** Idk if this counts but this is the scene where Snape dies from his perspective. Made me tear up a little (or maybe a lot. you'll never know)
