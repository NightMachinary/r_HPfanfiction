Not looking for any characters/tropes/pairings in particular. It doesn't matter to me if it's abandoned/incomplete. Just curious to see if any writers have decided to write a fic during that time period, since that's something I haven't seen yet. Thanks!


** linkao3(Vanishing Act by nockout)

Mine isn't finished yet, but it thoroughly explores this time period. Deals a lot with the after affects of the war and the build up to the next one. I plan on finishing it by summer. It's already pretty long.

I can never get it to link correctly but yeah Vanishing Act by nockout on AO3. Let me know if you check it out!

** “The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader” linkao3(495672) and despite yet another unfortunate name it has nothing to do with “Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue” ;). It is really about innocence of children (Harry and Hermione mainly, Dean is also present).

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
