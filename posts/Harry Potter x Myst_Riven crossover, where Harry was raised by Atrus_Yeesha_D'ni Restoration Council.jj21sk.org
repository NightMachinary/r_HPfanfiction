Marked spoilers in case someone doesn't know Myst yet knows Harry Potter somehow.

At December 2020, Myst will be rereleased as a remake for VR and Non-VR Platforms, and I wanted someone to try this simple prompt.

This Harry can be an archeaologist or a simple geologist. Dursleys can either be part of the DRC or Atrus/Yeesha takes Harry from the Dursleys. Timeline is based on Uru lore, which will mean that 1993, Cyan makes Myst, Riven etc.

Bonus points for making something funny based on some of the theory/possible lore I have made from this post in Cyan's discord: * Atrus's Family + Stranger's Family * D'ni meets Internet * D'ni learns about World History past D'ni-fall (and gets scared/inspired) * Dr. Watson and Yeesha silently probably not telling Atrus about the Myst series * Karma hits Atrus hard * pro-MLG gamer Atrus * gamer Atrus learns and complains about the Myst games * Yeesha + Stranger's Kid adventures * Yeesha has existential crisis and must suffer * Yeesha is a tired Grower and has her own private Age but people keep Summoning her

(And yes, we were busy having fun when we made this, and someone actually went and did some small omakes on gamer Atrus and tired Yeesha one-liners).
