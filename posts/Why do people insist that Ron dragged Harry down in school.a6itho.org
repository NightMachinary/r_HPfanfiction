I have seen it many times that Harry is actually top student material and that he was only average because of Ron's bad influence. I don't see how it's supported by canon at all. Harry was not a better student than Ron, except in DADA. Two things:

a)Harry and Ron got almost the same OWL results.

b)During his inner monologue when Ron became prefect instead of him, Harry himself admitted that he was NOT a better student than Ron.

I never saw Ron telling Harry to not study or something like that. Why do people insist that Ron was holding him back? Maybe Harry was just not an intellectual type, there's nothing wrong with that. I always thought that Harry was happier playing sports instead of studying and that's fine. Not everyone has to be a top student.


** Because Ron is generally depicted by JKR as a borderline anti-intellectual slacker, whereas Harry is generally depicted as fairly diligent but easily led around by his friends. If Hermione could make him spend hours in the library in spite of his boredom during 4th year, it's reasonable to imagine that Ron would have made him waste his time playing games in the common room.

Honestly, I don't think Ron was in any way meant to be seen as keeping Harry down, but I can see why people trying to reimagine Harry's character for their fic would use Ron as a scapegoat.

The problem is that people try to read far more into the books than actually is there. JKR wrote a magnificent setting, but she's a very superficial author that gave very little consideration to the implications of much of what she wrote so long as it didn't get in the way of her artistic vision. This gives us plenty of hooks for fanfiction, but also plenty of bait for flame wars and character bashing.

I wouldn't call Harry diligent. I think that it only looks this way because Ron is generally more gregarious, while Harry is more introverted. Harry enjoys Quiddich, Exploding Snap, and hanging around with Ron. He never enjoys studying, though he does it when he has to---as does Ron.

Is that when Harry was preparing for Triwizard tasks? IIRC, Ron was there too, after they made up after the first task.

Yes, that's diligence, doing your job regardless of what you'd rather do. Harry is frequently shown to at least try to complete his homeworks promptly, get up on time without complaints, complain minimally, etc. Ron generally has to be bullied by Hermione to do his work at the last minute, is always whining, etc. Again, Ron is clearly not meant to come up as badly as most readers and fic authors actually interpret him, but JKR's descriptions (especially as they're juxtaposed to Harry and Hermione's)do him no favours.

***** I think that this apparent difference is less about diligence and more about introversion and extroversion. When given too much homework, Harry seethes in silence and does it, while Ron complains loudly and does it.

Also, while I haven't counted, I am pretty sure Hermione has done Harry's homework more often than Ron's, because Harry tends to have other demands on his time more often.

On the other hand Ron is always doing his work at the last moment, whereas Harry tries to do it as early as he can, canon wise. You can see this by comparing Harry's attempts to do his summer homeworks while still at the Dursleys in spite of all the problems it causes him versus Ron finishing his summer assignments on the fucking express.

Also mind that Harry seething in silence is headcanon (or at least I don't remember any instance of it), whereas Ron whining is canon. Now, you're free to interpret the books as you like, but you're not on any firmer ground than people who have different interpretations from yours.

Harry can study, and even show some initiative, when it's a matter of life or death. His dementor allergy is close enough. However, the sort of consistent, continuous, day-to-day investment, working towards a long-term goal without specific endpoint or even criterion for success that Hermione makes, is really not Harry's thing.

  Her "superficial" writing is precisely what allows the setting to be so magnificent in tickling the imagination.

  The level of detail and thought displayed in her writing fits perfectly with the kind of story she wanted to tell with the characters she made in the world she created.
#+end_quote

I actually fully agree with this. A fully coherent setting as a concept is necessarily at odds with the introduction of fantastic elements. After all, suspension of disbelief means that you're taken enough by what you're reading that you're willing to ignore the fallacies. I wasn't trying to call JKR an incompetent author because her job as such was to make a fascinating setting, not a realistic one. I mean it's fucking fantasy. On the other hand defending everything she wrote as perfectly sound is silly, because the series has fridge horrors galore and cringeworthy messages that I damn fucking hope were fruit of JKR's superficiality, because the alternative is worse.

#+begin_quote
  The characters are teenagers and I think it was actually quite prescient of her to portray their actions as somewhat thoughtless, rather than detailed in reasoning, because as we all know, teenagers largely act without much calculated thought.
#+end_quote

On the other hand I don't agree with this often repeated justification, because it's a criticism you can make of every single character in the series regardless of age. Again, it's excusable in light of the type of work she wanted to write and the overall quality of the series, but that doesn't mean it's actually a strength, it's still a fucking flaw.

** I don't think either are bad students. They seem pretty average to me. They both get their work done, and despite the trouble that finds them, they don't really skip classes. Compared to Hermione though, I guess Ron does seem like a worse student (even if he's not).

***** That's my opinion of the series and especially the last two books exactly. The description of JKR as a superficial author is probably the most accurate one-word summary of her works that I've seen.

I detested the last two books because they were such a massive letdown. (Order of the Phoenix was the warning sign, but I still had hope after finishing that one, at least.) I remember forcing myself to read them because I already had so much time invested in the series, but being disappointed to the point of anger with them.

Personally, I think so many people feeling like this is why there is such a massive fanfiction community for HP. Many other series and stories with larger fan bases don't have 10% of the fanfiction that HP does.

In hindsight, I am completely baffled by the rediculous level of success of this series. At the time the first couple of books were out, they weren't particularly unique or exceptional by comparison to other YA novels. Yet they took off, and we're still talking about them 20 years later (which might mostly because everyone who reads them feels the need to vent, or find an actually satisfying conclusion to the story.)

**** Indeed! Compared the generation of Harry's parents they are all kind of dim-witted! Seriously, the Marauders were probably not all that serious about class, but they were easily at Hermione's level (especially Remus, James and Sirius! We don't know much about Peter, but he probably was way above average, too!) - probably better!

I seriously would like to know how Harry and company can know this and be ok with being worse than their parents (I mean I had on average slightly worse grades than my dad, but I had my own subjects where I beat him hands down!)...don't orphans want to live up to their parents (especially if said parents died for the said orphan? Hell, wouldn't it be the worst thing for Harry if someone told him that he'd rather have his parents back because Harry was never worth their sacrifice?), don't they want to believe that their parents would be proud of them?

***** I think the Marauders and Snape had a significantly different school experience. They didn't get involved in yearly school-wide conspiracies with potentially fatal results that changed the fate of the country!

Think about it, Harry and his friends defended the Philosopher's Stone as first years, defeated a basilisk in second year with polyjuice potion brewing thrown in, travelled through time and repelled hundreds of dementors in third year using a NEWT level spell, survived a Triwizard tournament that was previously abandoned due to a high body count and duelled Voldemort to a draw in fourth year. 5th and 6th years they get less amazing results, in-universe I suppose the adults they're opposing start taking them more seriously, and out-universe I'd say the tone of the series shifts from childrens lit to YA lit.

Harry and many of his friends grew up with the scars of the previous war badly affecting them and still managed to pull off quite amazing exploits. While the Marauders and Snape achieved more magically speaking, they did not put their talents to use quite the way the next generation did.

***** Fred and George are clearly on a similar level as the Marauders as well. So at least the general level of magical talent hasn't necessarily suffered across generations.

It's kind of interesting that their skills aren't directed more obviously to the fight against Voldemort. Then again, it's not really clear whether the Marauders' skills mattered all that much in the first war against Voldemort either.

As for Harry comparing himself with his parents... Well, in OotP he clearly has a problem with his dad being a bully, so he's not exactly keen to imitate him anymore. In HBP, Slughorn raves about Lily's potions prowess, but then Harry is doing exceptionally in Potions during that year as well...

********* *GCE Ordinary Level*

The O Level (Ordinary Level; official title: General Certificate of Education: Ordinary Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred as part of the General Certificate of Education. It was introduced as part of British educational reform alongside the more in-depth and academically rigorous A-level (official title of qualification: General Certificate of Education -- Advanced Level) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those three jurisdictions replaced O Levels gradually with General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) exams over time. The Scottish equivalent was the O-grade (replaced by the Standard Grade).

However, it's mostly due to the fact that Harry just isn't studious. He's curious at first. But in the first 12 or so chapters, only about half of them at Hogwarts, he breaks at least 3 or 4 rules. He's not curious in the way Hermione is in the first book. He's an adventurer. He flies way above what he was suppose to in the first flying lesson, breaks curfew to duel Draco, and enters the forbidden corridor. Ron is just much more willing to follow Harry in ways Hermione wouldn't until the troll incident.

  It is odd. Hermione could've had just as big of impact if they think Harry is so susceptible. Hermione was quite boisterous in the first book and she rubbed Harry and Ron the wrong way on a few occasions.

Harry clearly has some deep seated developmental issues that make it difficult for him to relate to girls (see his reactions when girls cry in front of him and require emotional intimacy, Cho, Hermione).

I'm not a pscyhologist, but I think behavioral psychology would argue that this is rooted in a lack of fundamental trust and a loving maternal figure in his upbringing.

**** I don't disagree with you here. But from September 1 to October 31, Hermione makes no significant friends at all. She stuck out like a sore thumb in classes practically jumping out of her seat to answer questions.

She's also just very quick to try to stop Harry from doing something. Whether it'd be chasing Draco on the broom or going out after curfew, she's very quick voice her displeasure. There's nothing wrong with that, Harry (and Ron for that matter) have a tendency toward recklessness, but Harry never liked being told what to do. Especially from someone who wasn't his friend yet.

** Harry's clearly pretty clever. All three of them are, in different ways. He *could* if he wanted to probably get better marks than he canonically does.

However, Harry's been trained almost by accident in “trying not to draw attention to himself”.

When he was at a Muggle school, he probably deliberately got things wrong. Can you imagine what would happen to him if he came home with a school report card that was *obviously* better than Dudley's? A little bit better is okay, because Vernon and Petunia will just grumble and make excuses to explain away Dudley's bad marks, but if there's a huge gap between them then Harry's in trouble.

/You must have cheated, you horrible boy!/

/What did you do?/

Then he gets to Hogwarts, and we see there that he very rarely puts his hand up. He'll answer a question if he's called on and he'll usually get it right, so he clearly understands the material...but he won't usually volunteer. The sole exception to this is when he's baiting Umbridge, and that's a unique situation where there are clearly bigger issues at stake.

It's not Ron holding Harry back. Ron and Hermione are both *good* for Harry. What's holding him back is mostly behaviour he's learned on his own, because when he draws too much attention it normally ends badly for him. At best he finds being the centre of attention a bit uncomfortable, and at worst he gets hurt.

In most schools, the passing grade for a subject is between 40-55 percent - getting a grade in that category does not, in any way, imply that you understood the material. I'm assuming there are minor tests and mid term exams, not just the end of the year exams here.

For what it's worth, I don't think Harry's “passing grade” is just barely scraping through. I think he's passing comfortably. Not excelling (McGonagall is likely pretty harsh in her marking...not nasty, as Snape is, but holding high standards and expecting a lot before she'll tell a student that what they've done is “good enough work”) but passing well.

She wants him to outright excel because she remembers his absurdly gifted father, because Harry himself has just said he wants something ambitious (so “good enough” won't cut it; Auror training must be really competitive) and to shut Umbridge right the fuck up.

Plus, you know, she thinks he can, so she nudges him to work harder. Harry has years of *not* working to his full potential (he wouldn't have wanted to make Dudley look too stupid by comparison; making Dudley look stupid would mean that the Dursleys accused him of cheating and Dudley beat him up) to unlearn.

I think Harry was just more excited about finally having a friend. I don't think it's Ron exactly, but I do think Ron is a contributing factor as to why Harry put off his studies. We can see that he actually becomes well-accustomed to the magical world, BWL aside, and starts to disregard his schoolwork as any normal child does. He gripes about homework and his problems with teachers like everyone else, and I don't think Ron is the main reason behind that.

He's definitely a bright kid (and I do buy in to him deliberately doing worse in Muggle school...can you imagine what would happen to him if he made Dudley look stupid?) but part of the reason he tears through his Hogwarts books is because he *knows* the Dursleys hate and fear it.

The textbooks become more appealing to him specifically because they're forbidden to him. If he could get to them whenever he wanted to, like Ron can, he wouldn't be studying at midnight.

  “Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, *he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret*, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard."
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, *he'd probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.*
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, *because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work*. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), *Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books*, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn't leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night.”

Harry defies the abusive Dursleys in order to get to his books.

Here's Ron's vocal opinion in regards to studying over the summer holidiays, when reading a letter by Hermione:

Right, but until that point, they'd both be fine.

Also, I don't believe that the blood protection nonsense extends beyond the Dursleys' house, seeing as the Death Eaters are waiting for them just outside the boundary when they make their retarded escape in Book 7 - this would mean that the Death Eaters could have drunk the luck potion, and waited till Harry was outside the house, like when he went to primary school, or when he was with the Weasleys. The Weasleys won't have been able to hold off a truly coordinated attack from multiple Death Eaters in the summer before their second year, for example. In the summer before third year, Harry was staying at a pub which many people pass through - it wouldn't be difficult for a single Death Eater to notice, and disillusion and silence himself, and stab Harry as he sleeps at night - doesn't even need Felix for that.

Also, from Harry's or Sirius' perspective, the idea of a Death Eater getting Felix Felicis doesn't really arise. Until Voldemort's return, they mostly carry on with their lives as normal.

Besides, Felix Felicis takes roughly 6 months to brew and is heavily regulated according to what Slughorn says - I don't think any run of the mill Death Eater could brew it. Certainly not Crouch Jr when he's supposed to be dead, and has no way of getting those ingredients to make the potion.

Don't forget about the Dementor attack. The blood protections clearly aren't as important to Harry's security as Dumbledore makes them out to be. If they were Harry wouldn't be allowed to leave the house. They are just an excuse to keep Harry totally under Dumbledore's control and ignorant of magical society.

  Right, but until that point, they'd both be fine.

  Also, I don't believe that the blood protection nonsense extends beyond the Dursleys' house, seeing as the Death Eaters are waiting for them just outside the boundary when they make their retarded escape in Book 7 - this would mean that the Death Eaters could have drunk the luck potion, and waited till Harry was outside the house, like when he went to primary school, or when he was with the Weasleys.
#+end_quote

You are looking at it too mechanistically, I think. The idea, as I understand it, is that Lily's sacrifice protects Harry in Lily's stead, and it protects him from Voldemort and his agents: while Harry lives under the same roof as Lily's sister, it takes care of him. It's stronger when he's there day-to-day, but even when he goes to a boarding school, for groceries, or to a friend's house, 4 Privet Drive is still a home, so he is protected. For example, it burned up Quirrlemort in PS. And, epic magic like this trumps more mundane ones like Felix Felicis.

The protection expires when Harry becomes an adult in the eyes of his society---by turning 17---at which point he becomes responsible for himself; or when Harry leaves 4 Privet drive for the last time, not intending to come back. Notice that Voldemort attacked the moment Harry left 4 Privet Drive for the last time, and not a moment sooner, despite Dumbledore being dead.

#+begin_quote
  Also, from Harry's or Sirius' perspective, the idea of a Death Eater getting Felix Felicis doesn't really arise. Until Voldemort's return, they mostly carry on with their lives as normal.
#+end_quote

They don't, but Dumbledore does.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, Felix Felicis takes roughly 6 months to brew and is heavily regulated according to what Slughorn says - I don't think any run of the mill Death Eater could brew it. Certainly not Crouch Jr when he's supposed to be dead, and has no way of getting those ingredients to make the potion.

Well, we'll probably have to agree to disagree here. I'm convinced after the war the ministry would have literally taken anyone who isn't a death eater, especially someone with combat experience. Harry and Ron didn't even get their NEWTs. (*)

(*) Edit: I've actually been considering writing a one-shot where they both meet a grizzly end during a mission because of their extremely spotty / non-existent education in DADA, potions and history.

I'm deadly serious. Magical spells are in pseudo-Latin and not children's rhymes. Ron is from a family with 7 older witches and wizards living in the same house as him.

I do, but the whole "special school" thing was a bit of a rhetoric device aka hyperbole. I genuinely wonder though how he'd do in a muggle school enrollment test, where they might check for typical developmental issues.

It's all in good fun for me anyways. Clearly JKR wrote this sequence as a funny bit and didn't really consider how borderline retarded it makes Ron appear if you think about his background for 5 seconds (it gets worse when we learn that the twins have been pranking him for years).

They probably do react like that, initially. But then, when we see them in the story, they are eleven-year-olds in a overwhelmingly unfamiliar world. Every step of the way, there's something new, not just in the coursework. You really need to have Hermione-like levels of thirst for knowledge to actively look for more.

As the time goes on, they get used to the new reality, which makes them less overwhelmed, but also less in wonder. So while getting better equipped to delve deeper into magic, they are also getting less motivated to do so.

  Why do people insist that Ron dragged Harry down in school?
#+end_quote

It depends on what you mean by "why". There's the

#+begin_quote
  *On what canonical basis* do people insist that Ron dragged Harry down in school?
#+end_quote

question about justification, and there's the

#+begin_quote
  *For what purpose* do people insist that Ron dragged Harry down in school?
#+end_quote

question about motivation of readers and fanfic authors.

I don't think there's much canon evidence at all that Ron dragged Harry down. Others have made this point better than I could. In fact, one could just as easily make a case that /Harry/ dragged /Ron/ down.

However, there are two major reasons (as far as I can infer) that people /want/ to make the case.

1. Many fanfic authors want to make Harry in their fics smarter and/or more powerful. However, since most authors are reluctant to admit outright that they are rewriting their protagonist to be smarter and/or more powerful than in canon, they are motivated to come up with reasons why his potential in canon was suppressed. Ron dragging him down makes for one such reason. Others include grand conspiracy theories around Dumbledore and Molly Weasley, as well as a Hermione who worship authority.

2. For many Harmonians, Ron is an obstacle to their 'ship, and they want reasons to degrade Ron and show him as a bad friend to Harry.

If you want to be ridiculous about it, you can make a Powerful!Ron argument and argue that having a needy friend who kept dragging him on his adventures kept him from fulfilling his potential. (His first year, Ron had a poorly-matched wand, and he still did almost as well as Harry. In fact, when his classmates were levitating feathers, he was levitating mountain trolls' clubs. His second year, he had a /broken/ wand all year, and he still passed all his classes, which suggests a talent for wandless magic. And so on.)

** In the other comment, there's clear evidence that Harry liked studying enough to defy his relatives, and do it after everyone else had gone to sleep. If he wasn't interested at all, he wouldn't be doing that, because then he would just go to sleep and not bother with it. You need to have motivation and a bit of interest in the subject to wake up in the middle of the night to study/do homework on that subject. If he wasn't interested at all, he'd wait until the last minute and do it on the train ride, like Ron does during year 4.

At the same time, he's not particularly studious in school either, seeing as he chooses his electives for easy grades, and makes up homework for one of them. Care of Magical Creatures never had a proper professor (no matter how nice Hagrid is, he's clearly not a teacher) and no real homework involved, and Divination was something Harry had no interest in. A good student wouldn't keep an elective that he has no interest in, he'd choose one that he found was interesting. Harry does no research on the electives, and bases his decsions off of what Ron and Percy tell him.

People say that Ron holds Harry back because had Harry been part of a circle that looked at studying as something not a chore, he'd have been motivated into more studying, even if it was out of peer pressure. Having one friend who does too much work and one friend who does too little will make a mediocre student remain mediocre.

Having said all this, I don't think it's fair to say that Ron held Harry back. It's more a case of they held each other back. Neither of them are good students, and while Ron doesn't push Harry academically, Harry doesn't do it for Ron either, to return the favour. They're both content in their mediocrity.

If he could have got to his books whenever he wanted, would he have been so keen? We know Hermione would, she'd do her homework straight off. Ron probably wouldn't, unless it was a subject he really liked, because he'd get distracted by everything else at the Burrow. The work would always get done, but it probably wouldn't be his first priority.

Harry loves the wizarding world, which feels more like home to him than Privet Drive ever could. When he's trapped with the Dursleys, he does everything he can to still feel like he's part of it. That includes doing stuff that Hogwarts sets him. He's a pretty smart kid anyway, and he's not lazy, so he'd always get the homework *done*...but pulling out the Hogwarts textbooks late at night says more about Harry the rebel than Harry the bookworm.

I think he's a bit cautious about drawing attention to himself. When he's too visible, it usually ends badly, and it always has done. Before going to Hogwarts, he would have been beaten up by Dudley or accused of cheating by Vernon and Petunia every time he made Dudley look stupid. After going to Hogwarts, being put on the spot puts him in Snape's firing line, or Lockhart's, or Moody/Crouch where he's the centre of attention because he survived a killing curse...

He won't volunteer to answer questions or do extra work like Hermione does, because that would put him in the spotlight in a way that makes him uncomfortable.

The sole exception to this is Umbridge, and Umbridge is different because there are so clearly bigger issues at stake.

He's not stupid, and his friends aren't noticeably holding him back - if anything they might be dragging him forward, because Hermione is Hermione and Ron provides context to the wizarding world's traditions and norms that Harry otherwise wouldn't have a way to figure out.

************ Now I want a fic where one of the characters has Deadpool-esque 4th wall awareness and they comment on plot holes and convoluted plot points left by JKR. Maybe have Harry take on the role, and make him immortal as well, either via the prophecy or through being a horcrux and being linked to Voldy via the blood ritual, or by being the Master of Death. If JKR can make a bunch of random circumstances turn into Harry not dying, we can use them to turn him into Deadpool.

********* He enjoys Defence under Moody and Lupin /because he likes Defence/. Even so, when Moody teaches the unforgiveables and calls attention to Harry for surviving the Killing Curse...Harry feels uncomfortable there. It's openly discussed that he can feel the whole room staring at him and he doesn't like it.

Of course Ron doesn't know where other schools are except in general terms. The schools deliberately hide themselves. That's canonically stated, they're very cagey about where they are and how to get there. Hogwarts is the same.

Asking “can the guests apparate on to school grounds” wasn't asking if it was possible. It was asking /if an exception would/could be made/

And Snape WASN'T asking first year questions, or at least not early first year questions. Like he does in PoA with the werewolf thing, he was asking questions that were deliberately too advanced for a first year class in their first term, to trip students up. Canonically, they don't cover bezoars or the Draught of Living Death until a later book. Hermione can answer the questions because she's read way further ahead than anyone would reasonably expect - of course she has, she's Hermione - but she's an exception rather than a reliable guideline for “what a first year should be able to do/understand”.

Lol. I specifically talked about the monkshood-wolfsbane question, and you ignored that. That is a legit first year topic.

Besides, Hermione knew the answers to all three questions, and despite what HG fans think, she didn't read up to sixth year Potions before her first year started. That's more or less an indication that those questions were in fact within the first year syllabus.

He doesn't feel uncomfortable, he wonders if that was how his parents died, and stops paying attention for a bit. Just because he feels the eyes of the room on him in one day does not mean that he feels awkward like a loon throughout the year.

  . It was asking if an exception would/could be made

He was asking if people were allowed to apparate under the age of 17 in other countries. That's what he was asking, not if it was possible for exceptions to be made.

Imagine a 14 year old wondering if other countries had a different age for voting rights. It's ridiculous.

*********** No it's not ridiculous, because some countries *do* have different rules about the age for voting or driving.

In the US, you vote when you turn 18. Other countries have different rules - the lowest I know of is 16 (including in Scotland and crown dependencies like the Channel Islands...the UK as a whole says eighteen, but specific situations allow younger) and the oldest I know of is 25.

It's not a stupid question.

*********** Hermione wouldn't have needed to read a sixth year textbook in her first year, either. That's not what I meant

When Snape asks these questions, it's their /first lesson/. Asking something in a late chapter or at the very back of the first year textbook is still asking unreasonably tough questions to trip them up. Most first years would *not* have read the whole thing cover to cover. They'd be expected to have read some of it, enough for the first term, but not to have the whole thing.

If Snape's asking questions on the first day about stuff they won't start to cover until Easter, he's pushing it.

Hermione read the whole textbook, front to back. She's exceptional for doing so. What she does is not in any way a good guideline for what would normally be expected of a first year at the start of the first term.

Hell, I'd look into the last war after learning that Voldemort is still around! - But Harry? "Nah...I'd rather play chess with my friend (Mo-)Ron!

Yeah that kind of shit is really ridiculous once you think about it. This is after three years of History of Magic education too! Hogwarts is such a terrible school. Harry not learning a single practical thing about his new world and the world of his parents is one thing, Hogwarts not teaching anything to him as well is another.

I really need to write a plot-outline for that one-shot idea where Harry and Ron as Aurors are totally slaughtered during a mission, because they can't recognize common curses, historical cult symbolism, runes or common potions. To describe their education as spotty is very generous. Maybe it should be a crack fic where Harry just yells /Expelliarmus!/ or /Expecto Patronum!/ at all his problems.

Not to mention that Britain seems biased against her kind (muggleborns!)) and takes Harry with her (if at all possible!)

** Hrm, this is a complicated one. It's certainly not fair to lay the blame for Harry's bad grades at Ron's door - Harry is responsible for his own choices after all, and there are a number of reasons at play why Harry does as badly as he does, and how he might have done better, as indicated in the other comments here. Ron is a factor, but not the only or defining one.

It seems to be true though, that Ron is somewhat less intelligent than Harry. He appears to have been relegated to that best friend who always makes you feel better about yourself for always being that one step behind. And Ron isn't far behind Harry - as you said their OWL results were very similar, but Harry also notices that Ron doesn't get any O's on his report card. In addition, Harry has a pretty good excuse for failing History of Magic - he had a Voldemort mind attack in the middle of his exam. However Ron also failed that exam without the same excuse. We also know that Harry mastered DADA and apparition before Ron did.

There are numerous examples throughout the series where Harry and Ron did equally as badly at things, but none that I can think of in which Ron ever out-performed Harry academically. Ron is either equal to or less than Harry in every subject, and this never changes. Part of this is down to their bad study habits - Harry and Ron are serial procrastinators (something I can definitely relate to), and they're happy to take shortcuts and easy outs instead of putting in the hard yards if there is an opportunity to do so. I do however, think that Ron tends to be the greater influence on these behavioral habits. Ron suggests a fun game instead of work and Harry takes the out - essentially he encourages Harry's lazier habits and they enable each other to avoid being studious. So I'd say there's canonical basis to assume that Harry could have performed better with a different best friend, but not enough to say that Ron single-handedly prevented Harry from answering his calling as a secret genius.

** Because Harry showed more potential then what he actually used! He could do a Patronus Charm (something most adults can't do supposedly!) during third year! He taught older students in defense in fifth year (including teaching the Patronus!) etc. etc.

We all know that Hermione was pushing both boys to study more etc. - Ron however did the opposite! He always complained about studying, got Harry to chose DIVINATION ("...an easy OWL!") instead of any other elective (even Muggle-Studies would be more beneficial to Harry - why? Because he'd learn how wizards see muggles, while the divination professor is as much a fraud as Lockhart!), took quidditch too seriously (without wanting to go pro!), always wants to play chess rather than do homework early etc. etc.

Ron might not have been a total idiot, but he's like a ball and chain for Harry! Without him there he either might have studied more on his own accord or because Hermione pushes him to!

*** There's one problem with this: half the time when Ron and Harry sack off studying to play a game, it's at Harry's suggestion. So yes, Ron brings Harry down in the sense that he exists to play games with. But it's Harry's free choice to do those things, and if Ron weren't there, likely Harry would have a different friend to do things with instead.
