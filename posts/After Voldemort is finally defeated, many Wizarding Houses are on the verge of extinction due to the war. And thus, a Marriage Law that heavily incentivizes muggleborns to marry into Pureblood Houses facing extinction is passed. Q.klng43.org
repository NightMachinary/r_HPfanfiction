Basically, asshole gold-digger Ravenclaw bullies wanna marry the pushover Luna for her money. Harry and his friends oppose.

(About the law - rather than pro-pureblood, the law is pro-muggleborn, giving them incentive to integrate into the Wizarding Society by giving new blood to dying houses. Yeah, 'incentive'. This isn't a dystopia where the government controls the marriage of their citizenship.)
