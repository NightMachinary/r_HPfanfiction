A random idea came to my mind after seeing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b6lq4s/instead_of_hermionea_side_character_in_ron_and/][this post]]

If Hermione hadn't been saved by Harry (and Ron but as he's the cause of the problem... meh), she would most likely have died just like Myrtle.

A muggleborn killed by a magical beast controlled by Voldemort (even if by proxy here) in the toilets in which the said which was crying after some mean comments from a classmate. Another in the wrong place at the wrong time. Would another set of toilets have been haunted by yet another innocent one?

And if Harry had been there in Tom's time, would he have saved Myrtle in one way or another? Is there a fic about this?


** Now I want to see this. A Hermione who became a ghost because she could not stand the thought of not getting to learn what Hogwarts taught.

- Ghost Hermione attending all of the classes.\\
- Ghost Hermione following the Bloody Baron around bugging him for his history.\\
- Ghost Hermione haunting the library.\\
- Ghost Hermione looking out for Luna.

*** - Ghost Hermione may get on your case about studying for those upcoming exams.. but she's also perfectly willing to spend time reviewing with someone who's nice to her and, after a few decades at Hogwarts, she's absurdly helpful.

*** There's a fic where Hermione dies in front of a library and later haunted it. I think it's one of Dimension Travel fic, I'm pretty sure HarryRonHermione goes to the alternate universe and found out that Hermione is dead.

I just can't remember the title...

There's this one but it's Hermione/Snape, so I don't know if you'll like it. I personally really enjoyed it ! Hermione learning to exist as a ghost is well described and pretty original.

** Being a Gryffindor, and shown to quite deserve the name, I think Hermione would have been brave enough not to decide to become a ghost, though it's imaginable that 11-year-old Hermione might not have been mature enough to dare move on.

And it makes me think, who told Myrtle's parents and how. What did they became. Had she any siblings? Did the Ministry erased her from their mind as they're muggles?

Woah now. Ron delivered the knockout blow. call it a draw at worst.

#+end_quote

I don't think so. The victims in Harry's time got incredibly lucky. Puddles, cameras, armor, mirrors, it's all too convenient. Myrtle got killed in the girl's bathroom. A place Harry wouldn't dare go in there without reason, a reason such as an abandoned one with a ghost with incredibly useful and relevant information.

**** This really isn't in Harry's nature. If she was in immediate danger, Harry is the first one out the door, but what you're describing is beyond his capabilities. Harry is usually way too far into his own head to notice other's (non life threatening) plights, even with his close friends. Even if he did, he's not socially or emotionally mature enough to carry out the plan effectively enough.
