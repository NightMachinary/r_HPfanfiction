I was reading the terrible tropes thread just now, and saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4ez5ku/you_know_the_unwritten_rules_that_govern_the/d24qb9o][this comment]] by [[/u/bigfatno]], and it got me thinking. Every now and then, often in one of the "bad clich√©" threads, someone writes a short scene into their comments; now there's no easy way to find them all.

If anyone can remember any particular examples, and especially if you can find a link, I'd appreciate your help. Maybe we could even use this post to track them in the future if people are interested.

Edit: if you could include sufficient context in your links by adding ?context=X to the end that would be great.


** My contribution to the fandom:

- From a thread about parseltongue: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3l7jyf/is_parseltongueharry_boring_to_read/cv4fz5t?context=3][Harry uses the power of 1337 speak to defeat the Dark Lord.]]
- From a thread about suspension of disbelief: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3qujjb/what_are_words_or_phrases_that_break_your/cwjdp2h?context=2][Harry whips out his phone to send a quick selfie to Ron.]]

** I wrote a clever parody of Harmony tropes, which in reality wasn't that clever, if you're interested.
