:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok years and years ago I read a fic I'm desperately trying to find again because it was phenomenal.

Here's what I remember: Harry, who went by either a different name or nickname was extremely powerful and did at the least bloodmagic but maybe other esoteric magics as well. Remus was heavily featured and potentially in a relationship with Harry. Harry was, due to maybe time travel the same age as Remus. I THINK he had gone for some special training through time. There are multiple OC characters some of which I think were vampires.

The phrase that I remember best, god only knows why, is something being ten shades of batshit crazy. There's a battle scene on a farm/plot of land where there's rolling hills they'd set traps behind etc.

If any of you recognize this fic or know where I can find it I will be forever grateful!!!! Edit:words are effing hard when you're tired...


** Ummm This sounds like you somehow gotten your fanfic mixed up? Because some of the plot line you mentioned is from a second chance at life, where Harry goes to a different school after 6th year under the name of Rahkesh.

The reason i think you got it mixed up, is that line was mentioned describing Tristan Namach, and the bloodmagic is heavily featured.

A lot of vampires for sure. Battle scene matches up A lot of OC characters But Remus wasn't heavily featured, he gave a few filler show but now that much

And Harry didn't really have any pairing.

So it could be if you read it long ago you got it mixed up or I'm wrong and it's a different fic

Won't hurt if you give it a try and see if it's what you're looking for, I'll link it and see
