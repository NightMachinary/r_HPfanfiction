For example, after Harry is freed of the Horcrux he is able to think more clearly.


** I really like the direction of this story. I've never seen anything quite like it before. They seem to update every Saturday and plan to make it into, I think, 3 books.

Firebird's Son

By Darth Marrs

Think you know what the magical world is like? You're wrong. A completely AU story of Harry Potter in a world with four times more women than men. But will a world run by women, in which wizards are commodities to be controlled and threats to be contained, actually be any better?

** It's an old story, but I'd have to say that the most original concept of Hogwarts is the one portrayed by Japanese Jew in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][Wit of the Raven]]. It's a massively AU treatment of Hogwarts in a manner that I've never seen before or since.

#+begin_quote
  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

I've been told by readers that [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4403728/1/Harry-James-Potter-Anagram][Harry James Potter: Anagram]] may qualify as well.

#+begin_quote
  The Harry Potter saga told in a form where every word in the story is composed from the letters “Harry James Potter.” It's slightly harder than it looks.

** I've got a couple. The first has to be Magical Relations. It was recommended by someone here in another thread. I really like the fleshing out of Vernon's character.

Second would have to be an old story on HPFF.com. It was a what if story about how Harry dies and the Death Eaters take over. There's still a Hogwarts like school but the houses are based on skills for the war. It was and still is one of the better Voldemort Won Whoo stories I've read. Now if only I could find it again.

** mine would still have to be the concept of tribunal/council. all magic masteries are taught/administered by the tribunal/council. their laws for lack of a better understanding are respect for ALL masters/apprentices/hopefuls. HP gains said apprenticeship summer Before the tournament. goes to snape. snape has to treat HP with respect. LV/headmaster go crazy ;-)

** I've read these ideas that haven't been done:

- Harry dies when he defeats voldemort because he had been a horcrux
- Umbridge is nice. (Need I say more?)
