Basically, I've been thinking about rewriting a short fic that i wrote like 6 years ago at least. However, i posted it on mugglenet fanfiction, which is currently not really accessible. I would be posting the rewritten story on ao3. I want to make sure that there's never a chance that people would think I'm stealing my own story, even though it's not popular or anything. I know i can put the information in the AN, but would that be enough?


** Put it in the summary also, "Rewrite of my story xxxxx."

** Ao3 allows you to add Pseuds so you can add your mugglenet user name and add it to the author of the story.
