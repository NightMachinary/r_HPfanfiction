I can't remember if they are both the same fic or two different ones but it's two key moments that I remember.

Harry uses family magic whilst inside the womb and takes control over Lily to save Sirius, Arcturus Black amd Charlus Potter swear that he will get the magic back one day and everybody that sees it is obliviated. Harry does it again later in the story.

Harry does a ritual and it ends up bringing forwards the spirit if his mother and Morgana Le Fey. They help him when the goblet tries to bind him to the contract and takes a corporal form. He accepts the contract because if he didn't everyone entered would be killed.

Like I said, they could be apart if the same fic but I think they are two different ones.
