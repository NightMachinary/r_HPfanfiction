I know there are so many, but it is ALWAYS Snape who helps Harry, /I want something different/, that someone else finds out about the abuse, /someone like/:

*/Amelia Bones/*

*/Daphne/*

*/Susan/*

*/Fleur/*

*/Hermione/*

‚Äã

Or it could also be one where Amelia Bones, Narcissa M, Andromeda or the Greengrass adopt Harry, that Amelia, Cissy or Andy is a mother to Harry. Or simply a mother figure for Harry (Other than Molly, as it practically occurs in the canon)

**** It's called Drarry in a Tournament (trying to figure out a better name, thinking 'Butterfly Lovers') and it starts in year 4 and will hopefully end at either the end of the war or year 8. My OC is the one that helps Harry but she gets Hermione to help her without 'Mione realising it's for Harry.

** I wish I could remember the name but I'll describe it and maybe someone here knows it. Basically Hermione figures it out and she and her parents help him get away and live with them then she and harry start a support group for abused students with mcg and snape as faculty advisers. Ends up with them making friends with a couple slytherins and a few other students like Neville and luna. Also has harry/Katie bell(I think) and hermione/fred/krum.

** There is the Accidental Animagus story, where Harry gets away from Dursleys, and he basically ends up with Granger. Can't give you any details since I didn't find the story particularly interesting, but I know it exists.
