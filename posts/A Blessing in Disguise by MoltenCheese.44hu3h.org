** u/MacsenWledig:
#+begin_quote
  "And so, Harry did."
#+end_quote

I'm not the biggest fan of beginning a sentence with a conjunction... but I only notice it because my betas regularly hound me about my own bad habit with doing this. The rules for dialogue are quite a bit more relaxed because people tend to use a lot of um's, er's and don't generally plan out what they're going to say. In this case, starting a sentence with 'and or 'but' is probably okay.

#+begin_quote
  muggles
#+end_quote

AFAIK, this word is usually capitalised. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Also, there are no beats in the dialogue. A 'beat' is a bit of narration peppered throughout dialogue heavy passages that give the speakers something to do. E.g. Dumbledore could stroke his beard, Harry could run a hand through his hair, etc. It's an excellent way to "show, not tell" the emotional state of the conversation's participants. Particularly during [[/spoiler][Voldemort's final monologue]], he's just talking and the reader has no idea as to his emotional state.

Dumbledore's speech patterns feel pretty close to canon (for example, he doesn't use contractions) but there is a liberal use of commas that borders on gratuitous. This is more of a personal preference so make of it what you will.

I also noticed a few instances where it might be more appropriate to refer to Harry or Dumbledore by something other than their name. The 'Headaster,' the 'young wizard,' etc. It can feel a bit jarring to the reader to read two sentences where 'Harry' and 'Dumbledore' are repeated three times each.

These flaws are /very/ minor and I offer my congratulations on your story. [[/spoiler][Even though I genuinely dislike Dark!wank]] I enjoyed it and hope you'll continue to share your writing with us.

*** Writing dialogue is one of my main weaknesses. Even when I read it, it sounds fake and too formal half the time. Hopefully, as I write more, this will be something that I will improve. I'll also try to use beats more in dialogue. Once I catch up with my school work, I'll edit my story a bit and try to develop the characters more in dialogue, especially at the end scene (which was a bit rushed with school coming up).

You're correct when it comes to Muggles. Didn't catch that while going through my document. I'll go ahead and correct them.

As for commas, I recently developed a huge love for commas and often use it superfluously. I'll look through my document again and see if there are unnecessary commas that I should remove.

Actually, the funny thing is, in my very first draft, I almost never called Harry or Dumbledore by name, always referring them with descriptions. So, in my proofreading stage, I replaced many of them to their names. I probably did that a bit too much though. I'll fix that as well.

Thank you so much for your feedback. It was very helpful, and I truly appreciate the effort you put into this.

** This is an AU GoF oneshot of a plot bunny that I've had for ages. It's my take on what could have happened in the events of the Goblet of Fire. Instead of Voldemort's complicated, nonsense plan, I'm introducing an even more complicated, nonsense plan. Saying any more about the plot would be telling.

This is my first oneshot I've written, and I'm not a very good writer, one that is mediocre at best. Hopefully it won't be a complete waste of your time and not be so bad that you nope out before the end, where there is an interesting turnabout of events, if I may say so myself.

Also, if you could provide feedback on what I could improve, that would be awesome! Hope you enjoy!

*** Definitely not a waste of time. And you made good on your promise of using an /even more complicated, nonsense plan"/ :) It didn't come across as overly tropish either. The instance of 'Constant Vigilance!' was the only annoying hpfanfiction trope that stood out to me. From how you wrote it though I interpreted it as poking fun at the trope, whether that was intentional or not.

I am curious as to what condition Harry ends up in...

**** Thank you for your words of encouragement.

As for 'Constant Vigilance', as you said, I was making fun at the trope. But if it bothered you, it'll probably bother others as well, so I'll go ahead and remove it.

Funny you mention about Harry. My initial plan was to have Voldemort kill Harry, and have Harry wake up at the very end, leaving the oneshot open-ended. However, one of my pre-readers said that readers might not appreciate that very much, so I ended up having Voldemort save Harry. As for what condition he'll be in, he'll actually be well fed, and somewhat well treated, which will likely pain him more, thinking that he doesn't deserve good treatment when others are dying because of him. Voldemort would try to break Harry as much as he could, both physically and psychologically, before finishing him.

Thank you for reading, and thanks for sharing your opinion!

***** Constant Vigilance didn't really bother me, because you we're poking fun at it. Do what you will.

As for Harry, that sounds like a suitably terrible fate.

My own thought, was maybe even more convoluted and cruel. Imagine the nightmare that Voldemort sent Harry going on for 13 years, forcing Harry to see and feel what Voldemort is experiencing. Voldemort petrifies Harry for years, leaving him conscious to see his friends die though Voldemort's eyes, while feeling V's sadistic satisfaction.

** I don't like it. The best I can guess as to my dislike is the telliness of the story and I suppose the narrations word choice feels too pompous. 2.5/5.

*** I completely understand what you mean. Showing, not telling is one of my weaknesses, as well as pompousness. I tend to info dump or go on and on with monologues often, and although I tried to keep it down, there probably were many parts where I could improve. I'll be sure to keep that in mind when/if I write something else. Thank you for the feedback.

** Hey, I liked this. Significantly more convoluted of a plan, but also more planned out than the canon. Very realistic interpretation/AU/what-have-you.
