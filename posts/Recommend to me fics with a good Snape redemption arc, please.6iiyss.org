'Cause in a sucker for redemption arcs.


** I'm reading the unbroken universe series by robin4 on ffn right now. They are old, long, and au, but snape is redeemed by the end. Its really excellently done, and i am not a snape fan. The series focuses on the maurauders, especially sirius, but snape is prominent as well.

linkffn(Had I known)

linkffn(The Professor's Discretion)

linkffn(Pet Project) If you don't mind the HG/SS pairing, although only the last few chapters have any romance and it's easily skippable.

** You have probably read 'The Best Revenge' linkffn(4912291)

It goes AU from just before first year, and shows Snape getting over his old grudges and growing/healing fairly believably. He doesn't just snap into niceness and start liking people like Lupin (possible spoiler?) but he slowly leaves much of his bitterness behind. It also makes Harry much more likeable, for me, without bashing anyone. Overall, it is a well paced fic with well thought out relationships. Harry and Ron often end up either best buds or hating each other, but this takes a refreshing approach.

I can think of a few others, but they vary between pairings (some slash, some not) and tone. I'm not sure what you're into but if you would like, I will dig out the links.
