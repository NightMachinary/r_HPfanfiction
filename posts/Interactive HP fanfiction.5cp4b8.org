Has this ever been done before? I plan on making one of my own and want to know if anyone has seen one before.

And, more importantly, how do you all feel about it? Would you read it?

** Writers do sometimes give their readers a choice at the end of their chapters as a sort of challenge to themselves, but the choice isn't usually huge. Usually, it's something small, like:

#+begin_quote
  "I've gotta eliminate Lockhart from his job at Hogwarts by embarrassing him. How should I do it?"
#+end_quote

Something like that doesn't really change much in terms of the overall plot, but it does allow the readers to suggest a fun little scene while giving the writer a little challenge. I've never seen it done on a bigger scale than that, and it sounds really hard to do.

Good luck if you do plan on making one yourself though.

*** These always make me uncomfortable, if only because it indicates that the author hasn't planned the exact impact it'll have on the story - because of this, you're pretty much assured it's not relevant in the long run.

Maybe with your scenario it's not a big deal, but I've seen some zingers. I don't think it's much the same, since even Choice of Games requires forethought and planning for every eventuality.

Also, with this, now the readers know they don't even have the story written at least a chapter in advance, which I'd recommend to any author. Less stress in the long run when it comes to a stable posting schedule.

(edit) On second thought, though, some authors might have a proclivity for improv. Everyone writes differently. I just can't imagine it!

**** u/Conneron:
#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Isn't that the point though? To give yourself a tiny bit of challenge while not giving up creative control? Maybe I'm looking at it just from a writer's perspective, so I might be wrong.

Not always though. Writers have specific events, character moments, plot points, dialogues, and subplots planned out, but planning out every single bit and piece at the beginning is practically impossible. ESPECIALLY when done as a hobby. Having a reader fuel a muse can be really helpful. I'm sure that every writer has been inspired by a review at some point or the other.

I don't know where you got that from. Most authors(that I know) who do this always ask these type of questions /at least/ 3 chapters in advance. Asking it the chapter before just seems masochistic.

I overall disagreed with you, but maybe that's just me. Your opinion seems to be shared by many others, and there is probably a very good reason behind that.

***** Hmm, you're right about my advance chapter comment - it was a baseless assumption. Wouldn't asking for suggestions three chapters advance be spoiling, though? Also, I think there are a few different reasons why someone might share my viewpoint.

People who normally read novels rather than fanfiction might feel unnerved by the flippant disregard for that author/reader disconnect. On the other hand, avid fanfiction readers are likely disillusioned by the many abandoned fics they've experienced and feel that any lapse in control constitutes a one-way ticket to unresolved tension.

I do see where you're coming from! Fanfiction is a very useful tool for improvement in all aspects of writing, as you're presumably getting intuitive critique if the right reader happens upon your work. I believe my own viewpoint stems from the fact that I myself an anal retentive author when I actually deign to write. I'm probably not suited to writing fanfic. C'est la vie. :'D

** What kind of "interactive" do you mean?

- Quest: readers can influence story as it's written by voting on the choices? The only one I know is Matou Shinji series I often recommend, but there probably are many more. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]]

- Choose your own adventure: the complete story features multiple choices and the reader skips to approbate chapter. I've found quite a few [[http://www.hpcyoa.com/][1]], [[http://chooseyourstory.com/story/hogwarts-student][2]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Harry+Potter&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Choose+Your+Own+Adventure][3...]]

So yes, it was done.

**** So CYOA with many choices. I linked a few like that (Ok, I don't know how many choices they have, but you get the drill), and it seems that AO3 has system to facilitate doing them without resorting to "Decision X skip to chapter Y".

  It all started with a stupid interrogation. Or: Don't ask a question if you're not prepared to hear the answer. HP/DM or HP/RW, as per reader preference.
