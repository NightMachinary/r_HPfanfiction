He looked to be a man of 25-ish years, at a below-average height with long, raven black hair hidden beneath the sorting hat, piercing green eyes hidden behind a pair of round black rimmed glssses and he was clad in some wicked-looking basilik-hide battle-robes, with the sword of gryffindor at his hip.

Throughout the year, you could see him at various places. He would stand guard on Hogsmead station, to watch over all the students arriving/leaving at the beginning/end of the school year, along with during yule. He would follow the 1st years in and remove the sorting hat from his head, so the children could be assigned their house. After that, he would Don the hat again, and go to his post close to the great door in the Great hall. During the day, you can see him roam the various hallways, and during the night, he walked the grounds. This was all due to his duty to protect the place some say he once called home. Some say he never ages, some say he is a golem. In 'Hogwarts, a history' it is said he defeated an entire colony of acromantula that tried to invade the school. Noone knows, until one day, a curious firstie in the year 2234 walks up to him as he trapezes along the 3rd floor corridor on the right-hand side. "Hello, who exactly are you? I've seen you in the station, and during the sorting and in the hallways, but I've never gotten an explanation. Who are you?", The little 1st year rambles.

"Hello", the man replies, in a pleasantly kind voice. "I'm known as the Guardian of Hogwarts, but I was once upon a time called Harry Potter".


** This is a really interesting idea. I would love to read a fic with this.

** I've always loved futuristic Wizarding world fics with some throwbacks to Harry and his gang.
