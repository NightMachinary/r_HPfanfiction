:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Started reading 1-2 months ago, lost bookmarks. AO3 or FFN. Angry Voldemort gets Narcissa to paint runes on Bellatrix, that will de-age her and send her back in time - with a mission to kill Harry. Narcissa delibriatly fudge a rune so Bella is not forced to kill and tell her to enjoy herself. I think Bella and Harry meets (in the park?), and Bella "hears" Voldemort's voice telling her to kill him, and Narcissa's telling her to not. I also seem to remember Bella being adopted by Mrs Figg, observing Harry, and reading a diary with Mrs Figg's observations... It may be another fic, but if it is, I'm interested in that too...


** I'm not sure but maybe you're referring to this one linkffn(10920321). I could be wrong because I started reading it a while ago and never got pass the first chapters.

  The story begins right after the battle at the Ministry. Voldemort is furious and takes his revenge. In his revenge, he sent a rejuvenated Bellatrix back in time. As a child, she must find Harry Potter. This so she can kill him for her master. Is it possible for Bellatrix to find Harry Potter? Will Voldemort succeed in his plan? Will Bellatrix remain loyal to her Lord or not?

*** Also the suspense created in the description is ruined by the pairing that includes Harry and Bellatrix lmao
