Antithesis was the realization that my work can influence and help people in real life. Antithesis is a really difficult story, but the moments of happiness and the messages I write can help people who need it. Readers like you are the reason I'm now looking into legitimate publication, and hopefully will have a book out someday!

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.
