Hi folks. I was hoping I could get some feedback on my second one-shot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8920125/1/The-Cabinet][The Cabinet]]:

/Harry tracks Draco down to the Room of Requirement and foils a Death Eater attack. However, merely denying them access to Hogwarts isn't enough: he wants to strike back, and the Vanishing Cabinet provides that opportunity./

I think the idea (namely, the manner in which Harry uses the Vanishing cabinet) is pretty original. At least, I haven't seen it used anywhere else. It's the execution that I'm worried about. I've never really written any fiction except for small school assignments years ago.

Originally I wanted to use this idea in a full-length crackfic (I thought it was funny, in a twisted way) but I didn't have enough material for that. In the end, this one-shot turned out a bit more serious than I expected and intended.

(Incidentally, do you think "Adventure" is a fitting genre?)


** I thoroughly enjoyed that. There was a palpable tension at the scene with McGonagall's arrival and a surprising amount of character growth for 4,000 words.
