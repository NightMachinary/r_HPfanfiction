I'd like to read something where Voldemort succeeds in controlling wizarding Britain to the extent he does in Deathly Hallows, but does it during the first rise to power. Obviously this necessitates a lot of things, such as Dumbledore being more out of the way, or Harry never being born/no prophecy being made. Preferably it centers around the Order members at the time.

Does anything like this exist? Thanks all :)


** While it's not Voldemort (Lucius Malfoy steps in) linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) fits this premise to a T otherwise. Dumbledore, Harry, and all their supporters are exiles living in France. Hermione and the rest of the muggleborns are brainwashed jannisaries serving the Dark Lord (again, it's Malfoy). Britain is totally under the thumb of Death Eaters, especially Augustus Rookwood, Malfoy, and their cronies. Then Voldemort ACTUALLY comes back, and all hell breaks lose. It's easily one of the best written stories on the sight and I love it to pieces.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
