Would like to know fics that contain harry goes crazy with lust and anything he wants is to shag. This condition wouldnt necessary need to be constant, but can be just a test, an experiment to know, if the participants like it. The fic "clause 13" has Ginny, that doses Harry with a strong lust Potion and make him go animalistic.

And here im curious if such exist in other fics aswell. I could imagine Fleur flooding him with her allure.

Whether its just one Partner or a Harem (or multiple) doesnt matter.

** Well Harry Potter and the Curse's Cure by Dragon-Raptor is the first story that comes to mind.

Linkffa(689)

Curse of Circumstance by DarkLordRising seems to be an attempt to finish Dragon-Raptor's story

Linkffa(2068)

A Dream to Remember by Red Jacobson has a very similar story line to Curse's Cure

Linkao3(3839785)

It Could Only Happen to Harry by HoosYourDaddy has Harry needed to share his magic or die and the only way to share is via a sex ritual.

  After defeating Voldemort in his final year, Harry requires a rare ritual to save his life. Luckily, he has friends who are willing to help him. H/Hr, H/Parvati, H/Tonks, H/Luna, H/Fleur. Canon personalities. Warning: Smutty comedy. Not for younger audiences.

  It's the end of Fifth Year, just after the debacle of the Department of Mysteries, when Draco places a curse on Harry, one that has never been broken.  Can Hermione save him, with help from her own circle of friends? And what are the consequences of her Cure?  How will what three witches do to save one young man change the course of the Wizarding world?
