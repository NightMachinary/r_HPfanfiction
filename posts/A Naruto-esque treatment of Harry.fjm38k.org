Most of the veterans of the First Wizarding War are aware that Harry carries a part of Voldemort's soul. Not unlike what happens to Naruto Uzumaki in the Naruto Manga/Anime series, this causes Harry to be shunned by most of the Wizarding World and especially those who were affected by Voldemort's menace.


** This is a really interesting idea. I would love to see this.

If he got sorted into Gryffindor those who lost someone might bully him saying he does not deserve to be here. In Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw he would be an outcast and treated with scorn. And let's hope he does not get into Slytherin or someone might try to finish him before he can become a bigger threat.

Dumbledore might be the only one who would treat Harry without scorn. Snape would probably treat him even worse and I can see other teachers being frigid towards him and turn a blind eye towards his treatment. Quirrell might treat him well so Harry would probably trust him and he could then easily use Harry to try to get to the stone and try to convert him. Hagrid would like him either way. It did not matter to him that Harry could speak to snakes and this would not matter to him either.

He would probably get sorted into Gryffindor and try to prove that he is not like Voldemort. He would gradually improve his reputation by saving the school like he did in canon but it might take a long time.

I don't know if Ron would even become his friend. This depends on how his parents see the situation. I don't see him becoming friends with Neville.

Harry's only refuge might be with muggleborns. And even then with those who are outcasts themselves. With Dean it depends, if he was already thick with Seamus by the time they meet; he would not be friends with him either but would probably be far more cordial. It might be interesting watching him become friends with Justin but who knows. The only I see him becoming friends with him would be Hermione because she herself would become an outcast and she is strong-minded enough. Percy would treat him professionally and Weasley twins might prank him a lot or make him a partner in crime. It's a coin flip.

If he get's into the team in second year (McGonagall probably won't get him on the team even if the flying lesson goes the same way which probably would not) it would not matter to Oliver. Moody would treat him with suspicion all the time, Lupin would keep his distance and Lockhart will try to make an example of him especially if him being a parselmouth comes out which would be a unmitigated disaster. It should not matter to Sirius as Harry is his Godson.

This is more or less how I see this scenario playing out. What do you think?

*** Since Dumbledore is one of the few people that are kind to him, Harry quickly decides that he is his role model and becomes a hard worker to try and become just as accomplished. Everyone will accept him once he's headmaster. Also Voldemort's soul interacts with him and amplifies his negative emotions but harry eventually purifies and absorbs the horcrux.

Actually, there's a fic in and of itself: Harry just grows tired of all their shit and moves to Salem.

Or to Hawkins, Indiana for a Stranger Things crossover. Actually, why have I not seen a Stranger Things/Harry Potter crossover before, that sounds like it'd be really easy to do.

***** That's not really an equivalent reveal moment. Nor does that ever happen to Naruto I don't think?

One of Harry's professors, probably Volde-Quirrel, would trick him into stealing the philosopher's stone before gloating and telling him about the horcrux.

Either way, a core part of Naruto's early treatment is that he doesn't know why.

****** I made the death eaters goal similar to Akatsuki but not the same.

That is also a interesting idea of Quirrel telling him like Mizuki did. He would then offer Harry a position on his side.

In canon he decided not to get into Slytherin because of what Hagrid said and what he saw of Draco's behavior. Also there was a desire to not go into the same house as his parent's murderer. So Slytherin is out and is next dominant traits are those of Gryffindor. Plus if he gets into Slytherin any Gryffindor that manged to overhear or knows(since Dumbledore can't silence the secret) would try to off him before he becomes a greater threat.

*** I think I /could/ see a case for Snape not acting out too much vs Harry. In canon, it felt like (to me) a lot of it came from him seeing Harry as James' son - looking so similar, acting cocky, a star quidditch player, etc - but I could see a case for Snape being more protective if he felt sorry for Harry (eg, seeing how the Dursleys treated him, or if he looked more like Lily, or the like).

That's not to say that he'd be /nice/ to Harry from the start, but I could see such a version of Harry being so obviously - and unreasonably - bullied to elicit some more compassion from Snape, as buried in his heart as it might be.

I could see him sorted into either Gryffindor or Slytherin for this, and it'd depend on the angle the author wanted to take on it. Friend wise, I think it'd depend on how much the kids get told of his situation - eg, if they're just told to keep away from him, that'd have a different impact than telling them that he has a piece of voldemort in his soul, and yet another impact than just saying that he's basically voldemort. If it's the former, I could see any character being made into his friend - if contrived enough. If it's one of the latter ones, it'd probably have to rely on more ostracized/misfit characters, or those that Harry would help save - so if going off canon, the former might include Hermione, Neville, and Luna, and the latter might include Ginny - or anyone else, since I could see Ron in that situation as well.

**** You can make a case for most characters. But I think the likelihood of Snape not acting out against Harry is slim.

In canon Snape started acting out against him in the first potions lesson, during the attendance and continued it throughout the years.

Harry was not on quidditch team yet and I don't remember him acting cocky at all.

In this universe Lily's murderer's soul resides in Harry. I can totally see Snape trying to kill him during the Quidditch match while Quirrel tries to save him(assuming he even is on the team)

I am iffy on Neville being his friend. Augusta would not want him to associate with him and Neville is too timid in the earlier books to go against her.

***** Are you sure about Snape trying to kill off Harry? It might just be me but that seems a little too far fetched. As much as Snape despised James Potter, I believe he wouldn't kill his offspring even if a shard of Voldemort's soul is in him. Lily's memory would put a stop to that. He wouldn't want to tarnish her memory.

Snape has common sense too. He would know killing Harry wouldn't be a blessing. Lily would still be dead and Voldemort would still be out there. And we can already tell what Dumbledore would do.

I mean, your idea could still work though, if we stretch it out a bit. Snape could be paranoid to the point where he believes Harry is a ticking time bomb. We all know how anxiety wears down on us and with his unhealthy mentality? Fun. He could start projecting his thoughts and beliefs on Lily. Let himself believe she's speaking to him but in reality, it's himself. "My son's soul is tainted. I won't let him suffer like this any longer."

Maybe Snape attempts to kill Harry out of his warped definition of mercy? I actually can go with this either way. Bad Snape seems pretty interesting :)

****** In canon Snape's ultimate goal was to see Voldemort dead and destroyed and he was willing to do any thing for it to happen. I can see in a scenario in which he finds out that Lily's murderer's soul resides in her son too soon after it happens might break him. In canon he treated Harry with scorn even after almost a decade to grieve. In this scenario he has even more reason to hate him and he knows that /the brat has to die anyway, so it doesn't matter if he dies sooner rather than later./

But really who knows, it all depends on the characterization and how much he has recovered. I admit I can be biased against him even if I try to be fair so usually have to make a big effort to view his actions objectively.
