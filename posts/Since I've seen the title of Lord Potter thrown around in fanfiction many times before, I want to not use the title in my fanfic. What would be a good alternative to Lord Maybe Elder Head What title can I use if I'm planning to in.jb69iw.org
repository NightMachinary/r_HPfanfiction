#+TITLE: Since I've seen the title of Lord Potter thrown around in fanfiction many times before, I want to not use the title in my fanfic. What would be a good alternative to Lord? Maybe Elder? Head? What title can I use if I'm planning to include the Wizengamot?

** I would not follow the advice of Archimedean since all those titles are also known as lords and are commonly called 'your Lordship'. If you want to have a title specific to the Wizengamot then I would suggest 'Warlock' since we already know Dumbledore was the 'Chief Warlock', implying there are other, subordinate Warlocks inside the Wizengamot.

** Personally I like Warlock, given that Dumbledore was the Chief Warlock. But you could also go with any of Magister, Maestro, Praetor, Counsellor, or Consul. Or perhaps dive into Anglo Saxon since thats where the word wizengamot is derived from...Runwit would be wise man/privy counsellor, or turn it to Runwiz to be adjusted the same way wizengamot was.

If you go with that last idea, make the mode of address "Your Wizigness" since witigness is another anglo saxon for sagicity or prudence.

*** "Your Wizigness" is such a delightfully whimsical form of address too; it really fits the sort of non-sensical, lighthearted feel of the earlier books.

** Depends on what you're planning to make these 'Not Lords' like (or if you just want something that sounds cool). What authority do they have, what responsibilities, what privileges? That sort of thing. Most titles linked to at least one of those three things.

And do you have a cultural backstory for your thing at all? (Not that you need one, but if you've decided that British Magicals were Norse Refugees from a Magic Purge or something, suggesting an Arabic-etymology title would be a mite out of place).

And do you want all of your 'Not Lords' to have the same title? You might have multiple kinds of 'Not Lords' serving on the Wizengamot, with different levels of responsibility and different authority for each.

To give an example, if your 'Not Lords' had leadership authority and representative responsibility for a geographic region (eg. Not-Lord of Hogsmeade and Not-Lord of Diagon, etc), then you could go with Reeve. It's an Anglo-saxon title for a local magistrate/representative.

Whereas, if their only responsibility was Law-enforcement and Adjudication (people in their area come to them with a grievance, they listen and give judgement on how the grievance should be resolved), then you could call them Judge or Lawgiver or Lawspeaker or something similar.

If you'd decided British Magical Society was based on Norse society, you could have Fylkir, or Jarl, or elsewise.

EDIT - Oh, I'd forgotten. You could also mark the difference between title and style. They might be titled Lord, but be referred to and addressed differently. Like, The Pope isn't ever really addressed as 'Pope'. They're not sat around in the Vatican going "Buoninsegna, Pope Francis, got any of the good cigars left?", y'know? He's actually addressed as 'His Holiness' or 'Your Holiness'. His Title is still 'Pope', but his Style is different. You could have your Not-Lords be titled one thing but addressed another, if you're tired of just referring to them by rank name.

** Using the two you considered there. I would say Elder. Elder Potter. The Elder of House Potter. Works two ways. Head would only work one way, Head of House Potter. Unless the Potters are secretly a hivemind, I guess. Then it could probably work.

*** I would say both work

the head of house potter, is the guy currently in charge and the elder of house potter, would be an old respected relative who is not in charge but still a valid councilor.

Different wizarding houses could use different names due to the different ancestory

So for the Black family, it might be the based on a term about astronomy

** Warlock, it fits the setting, sounds cool, and doesn't relate with people overusing Lord Potter.

And Warlock Potter sounds badass.

Could also use Magister, but every time I read Magister it reminds of ASOIAF and I expect the person to show up with gaudy clothes, perfume, and slaves.

** Didn't Dumbledore hold the title of chief warlock, or maybe twarlock or Cousilman could be a term for members of the wizengamot. I think the British house of common calls there members the right honorable gentleman or lady.

Perhaps try Magus as an old title for a wizard or witch
