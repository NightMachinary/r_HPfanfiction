I am looking for some stories where characters gender is changed through various means. Preferably Harry getting turned into a girl (perhaps even a girl veela) but other characters are also ok. Hopefully some that explore the change and its consequences and have characters learn to accept their new reality. Little angst is fine but no constant angst filled fanfics plz. Crossovers are also out. Thanks in advance ;)


** I managed to find some. Just want to warn you that it's been a while since I've read most of these so I can't exactly promise that they're good, etc. From what I can remember, To Reach Without is kinda angsty and the ones by Racke as well as Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool sort of gloss over getting turned into a girl but they might be worth a look anyway. Hope some of these have what you're looking for.

  “I think we've got a lot to figure out. But together we'll get it sorted.”Harry kissed her forehead.“Together. Sure.”It didn't sound any less impossible when Harry said it. But then, impossible was their speciality, wasn't it? Or, the one where Harry is a trans woman, and she and Ginny are still in love.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else.

  Being reborn as a daughter of the House of Black was bewildering, but realising they weren't actually evil was another problem entirely.

** 'Good' is a matter of taste. I don't like all of these, but your tastes may differ from mine.

linkffn(Mistaken Identity by BajaB). Fun little crackfic.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Witch by Silverfawkes). Good story.

linkffn(Effects and Side Effects by Pheonix Dawn). A bit over-the-top in places, but not bad.

linkffn(L'Heritier de le Fay by n1ght3lf). A good story.

linkffn(To Walk A Mile in someone else's Shoes by IamMegumi). Harry's bothered by his fame, Luna's bothered by being female.

linkffn(ChChChChanging by LovesChihuahuas). Harry turns female, because that just happens, sometimes.

linkffn(Fool's Consequences by EllandrahSylver). Draco tries to sabotage Harry's potion, but things backfire.

linkffn(Shifted Dreams by HiroJiyuNaka). The Powers-that-be bring Harry back as a shapeshifter; he decides to try being female.

linkffn(The Love Curse by Cibbsoldlady). Magic "rewards" Harry for winning by turning him female.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Descendent Covenant by Jim-ruggeri). An artifact in DADA class turns Harry female.

linkffn(Shadow Mage by SHAWNIE). Harry is framed for Cedric's death; he's turned female by a ghost in Azkaban.

linkffn(2 Girls, 1 Cup by Luan Mao). Crack. The Goblet of Fire turns Harry female because of a misspelling.

linkffn(Changes by malko050987). Even after winning, Halloween is a problem for Harry.

[[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fanfictionfederation/the-wizard-that-never-was-t52.html][The Wizard That Never Was]] by deathdevil. McGonagall's 'finite' to un-ferret Malfoy has other effects.

#+begin_quote
  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."
