Alright people here is my question. What is up with everyone being so obsessed with raping everyone in their fics???? I mean I get it the hp world is pretty dark behind the curtains but for fucks sake I have to stop reading more than 3/4ths of these fanfictions because I don't like reading about vicious and DETAILED rape scenes on school children. Wtf is wrong with some of you people. I can understand SOME fics that have it because some people enjoy the whole grimdark genre but does EVERY story have to have a 14 y/o luna, hermione, Susan, Hanna, Ginny, their mothers and so on be absolutely mutilated and raped until brutalized? God man it's sickening and it completely throughs off the entire story for me. And it's not just me I have this online book club type thing on a messenger group chat with just under a hundred people and all of them agree. Can we PLEASE get some descent human beings in here to write some good fics that don't have people torturing and raping children everyone other chapter because they get off on that sick fantasy? It makes me shiver in disgust quite literally Everytime. And if you are going to do it ATLEAST put some warnings in there preferably in the beginning on the story. Saying "hey I get a hard on when I think of raping children so here is my most recent fantasy."

Edit: So I've been told by some friends that I have apparently the worst luck when it comes to rape in fics. Because when I get bored or think of an idea that I'd like to read about I'll search it up on Google and it will link me to different fics on various websites or like to a similar post on reddit asking for it and apparently I'm doing it wrong I guess but I can't be the only one. I'm serious when I said a good 3/4ths have it and I'm not looking up evil harry or whatever usually like I'll see something from another series like (elemental, blessings, prodigy, some unique ability or way of using magic like in "core threads" or "Blind").

*** Really. I won't deny that rape happens in fics, but in my experience, it's almost always both offscreen and perpetrated by the villains (various Death Eaters having dungeons full of rape victims or using the Imperius and/or obliviation on muggles are relatively common examples).

But if 3/4 of the fics OP is reading include detailed underage rape scenes, then they're doing something wrong.

***** Yes, I read what you asked for in the post. But if you're asking for Dark!Harry stories here, you're probably also searching for and reading some Dark!Harry stories that haven't been pre-filtered to not include rape and the like. And if you're searching for a Dark Harry, you really shouldn't be surprised that you're finding dark stories with dark themes and dark characters being shown doing dark things. Because the people writing those stories are writing them for people who are looking for those sorts of things.

It sounds like what you're really looking for are Grey!Harry stories (or Indie!Harry, which is the same thing 98% of the time). Because in this fandom, "Grey" or "Neutral" means "Obviously dark/evil, but generally against Voldemort, rape, and some forms of genocide." If you fix what you're searching for, you should see a lot less rape.

Also, while I normally hate AO3's tagging system, the one thing it is really good at tagging are the archive warnings (Graphic Depictions Of Violence, Major Character Death, Underage, and Rape/Non-Con), because those are the only tags that are actually enforced. So you can filter Rape/Non-Con out of any search you do there, and then you'll be...mostly guaranteed not to see any. There is also the "Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings" tag, which means that there could still be some surprise rape in there somewhere, but at least you'll be aware of the possibility. And you can always filter out that tag too, just to be completely safe.

** I agree, it's disgusting and it's uncalled for. Firstly, because it's lazy to have your female characters as rape victims - as if there's no other adversity that a woman can overcome. Secondly, it becomes utterly disgusting when the characters being raped are /children./

There should be a checklist here really:

1. Does this female character have to go through some adversity to grow as a person? If yes, go to Q2. If no, /do not write a rape scene about them./

2. Is there any other bad thing that can happen to this character? If no, go to Q3. If yes, /do not write a rape scene about them./

3. No other adversity that they could face? Really? Are you SURE? If you're sure, go to Q4. If you're not sure, /do not write a rape scene about them./

4. Does this rape scene really advance the plot? You're absolutely sure? If yes, go to Q5. If no, /do not write a rape scene./

5. Is this character of age? If yes, go to Q6. If no, PUT YOURSELF IN THE FUCKING BIN. DO NOT PASS GO. DO NOT COLLECT ¬£200. And /do not write a rape scene about them./

6. Are you absolutely sure you still want to write a rape scene? If no, go back to Q1. If yes, you're committing to the rape scene, huh? Ok, fine, I'm judging you but whatever. Just do it tastefully.

And really, lets be honest, only about 5% of stories should get as far as Q6, because most stories /do not need a fucking rape scene./

I do, however, think it can be positive to have character's recovering from that experience, and scenes about the recovery and coping with it. It can be really helpful to survivors to see their favourite characters fight similar personal problems!

**** While I agree that reading about characters recovering from rape can be good for rape victims, I don't think fanfiction is quite the right place for them. Mainly because the recovery is never done correctly. Fanfic authors tend to only have experience with rape in that they read it in another fic. They haven't talked to a psychiatrist, therapist, or even a rape victim about what being raped and the trauma afterwards is like both mentally and physically.

On that note, please don't ask rape victims about their rape and recovery. Let them come to you if you put an inquiry out and only if you're working with a mental health profesional, or try and find resources directly from survivors (books, published interviews, etc.). The recovery seen in fanfiction is fairly stereotypical and is brushed over quite heavily. I can't imagine it would help a recovering rape victim all that much.

EDIT: I'm ONLY talking about fanfic authors who haven't been raped (or have any mental health background). Obviously, writing can be very therapeutic for those who have gone through trauma. I thought this was obvious, but I guess not. Sorry for any confusion!

EDIT: To add to my original comment, I meant recovery stories being written by people who are recovering. I figured that went without saying; as a writer, writing about things you're ignorant of is typically a no-zone.

****** Sorry, I accidentally deleted half a sentence and combined it wrong in my initial reply! I definitely don't mean most fanfic authors, but fanfic authors in general. There definitely are some fanfic authors out there that have been raped and dealt with the trauma from being raped. I think as long as they're being advised by whoever is their mental health professional, it definitely can be a healthy way to go help recover.

My reply was about the fanfic authors who have no personal experience or deep research with mental health professionals about rape. Unfortunately, I've stopped reading quite a few fanfics by authors who clearly have no idea how to deal with rape and the aftermath. Think shying away from every man (either especially the love interest or not at all towards the love interest), nightmares, basically stereotypical rape trauma but only for two chapters and then it's never mentioned again (unless they're raped again). It's the main reason I stopped reading on fanfiction and switched to AO3 because for some reason people who write on fanfiction don't put all of the triggers until it's mentioned in the chapter.

***** Plenty of people who are writing stories about rape recovery are people who are recovering from rape themselves.

I won't argue that there are plenty of poorly written stories about recovery out there, but I don't have anything against people writing them if that's what they feel like they need to do.

In 2012 I was writing a lot of stories about characters who needed to reveal that they'd been assaulted because that's what I was dealing with at the time. It helped me to figure out how to say things and imagine how different people would react. Given that two of those stories are among my most popular, I like to think that resonated with some people and I hope helped them with the same issue.

People will write what they're going to write. That doesn't mean you or anyone else has to read it (and people should definitely should tag things so that the reader knows what they're getting into), but I don't think we should stop or discourage people from writing the things they want to write.

Obviously, anyone can write what they want to write. It's just the lack of tags on fanfiction.net (and some authors refusal to ‚Äúspoil‚Äù the fic) that is the main issue with people who don't have experience with rape writing about it. Otherwise 100% agreed, as long as it's properly tagged and there is warning, write what you want to write.

** Is rape that common in fanfics?

From all the years I have read it, it's not something I see that often. And outside of Smut, I don't think I either found that "detailed" the act. Most of the time, it's something along the lines of "Harry raid the house and found [girl] crying on the bed", or "[Girl] wakes up oblivated, and Mrs Pomfrey/ the Healer tell her she was raped". The most graphic description of rape I found was probably in the "Downward Spiral Saga" where some "prisoners" suffer a lot, and even there it talked more about the torture than the rape.

If anything, the "quasi-rapes" (where Harry blows up a door, fire blazing from his emerald orbs, just in time to save the poor damsel from Draco who was trying to force himself on her) seem more commons. Though both are pretty cheap and disturbing plot devices (outside of some rare cases).

And by vivid detail I mean and this is almost a quote here "(insert name here) comes into the kitchen to see an auror with his pants down furiously thrusting into young miss love good on the table while she is barely gurgling from the crucio...."

** For a /very/ small minority of stories (and honestly, if pressed to name a story like that, I'd probably come up with one name), it's to set the plot. If done in an off-screen manner and done /decently/, it /can/ potentially be a part of the plot. But is it ever necessary or needed? Absolutely not.

The rest of them? I honestly think they just get off to it. Authors use rape /way/ too liberally, and more often then not literally drop it as a /"oh no! anyway..."/ type thing where someone just throws a tantrum over it and nothing even happens. And more often then not as a way to bolster Harry's Good Guy(tm) image by saving someone. I've lost count of how many fics I stopped reading because they had the "Slytherins are rapists but Harry will throw a tantrum so it's all good" cliche.

I've been reading fan fiction since 2001, and out of all the stories I've read that had rape in them, I can name like one or two tops where it couldn't be substituted for something else. And even those probably could, I just can't think of a way to preserve the character's personality otherwise.

All in all, I feel like anyone who writes stories about children getting raped should see a psychiatrist. And with some of the shit I've stumbled upon, on AO3 especially, maybe a police officer.

**** I'd need to find the second one because I don't remember much of it. The other one is the Black Queen series by Silently Watches on FFN. Fem!Harry there is one of the more fucked up characters that, imo, just couldn't be the way she is without it. It's a past event there, mentioned a couple times, zero sexual content in the fic itself, and every time it's brought up the focus is on how fucked up it was and the effect it's had on her, without any hint of sexualizing the whole subject.

The series has its questionable parts - it's definitely got a shitload of shock value - the first fic starts out via a freshly exonerated Sirius retrieving fem!Harry from a /child brothel/, there's a fair bit of explicit gorey ritual stuff and quite a few of the main characters are unrepentantly evil (which is quite enjoyable to read, as there's not even an attempt to convince the readers that the characters are good people, or even 'misunderstood' - unlike most dark!Harry fics). Stuff like human sacrifice, necromancy, demon summoning and so on. Also, there are a few plot points that feel a bit iffy in the first book - although it's pretty much all good by the second half of it.

I'm mostly amazed that he managed to write the full series without any smut whatsoever in it. This sort of fic from most other authors would probably be choke full of it.

** I will stop reading any fic with rape happening in it. This includes statutory rape or a character having some sort of trauma from rape. Even if rape itself doesn't take place in the fic (looking at you authors who explain Luna's oddness due to childhood rape). It's not because I'm triggered by rape, but because I have yet to find one fic that deals with the aftermath as rape correctly.

Most fanfic authors use rape as a plot device to have main character's love interest shy away from his touch, break up with him, flinch at other men, etc. It's all about how the rape effects the main character, not the person who was raped. And if the main character was raped then it's barely addressed after she has two nightmares about it. Trauma from rape lasts more than just two weeks and it can be more than just being afraid of men and having flashbacks.

*Note: I know that rape happens to more than just girls. Just most rapes that happen in fics tend to be to girls that are in relationships with boys and the rapists are almost always men. Or Bellatrix.
