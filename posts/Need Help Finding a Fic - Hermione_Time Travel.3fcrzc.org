*** The second one sounds like linkffn(The Last Marauder by Resa Aureus). I'm fairly certain about that.

** Any chance it was roundabout destiny? I believe that one has her friends with Lucius and Severus, and she ends up with Sirius in the end. Fairly long.

Edit: probably not, beginning doesn't match up. I'll look again tomorrow if it still hasn't been found!

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
