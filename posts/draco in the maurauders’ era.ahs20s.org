looking for marauders' era fics with draco malfoy (time travel or whatever), it can be any pairing


** While I really don't like Draco, I would be curious how this would go. He would see Harry's dad, and the most interesting part, his teacher (Lupin, the one he makes fun of constantly). If he knows that he's a werewolf, what would he do with the information? How about meeting his /own/ father? How popular would he become?

This would be rather fascinating, actually. I may have to dust off my keyboard and give it a go.
