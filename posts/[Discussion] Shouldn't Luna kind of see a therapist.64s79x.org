Hey guys,

I kind of am shocked that so many people - including many fanfiction writers that I like - like Luna and make her view of the world "special", when IMHO she's a child who needs a therapist (same for her father!) because her dad kind of dragged her into his delusions after he couldn't work through the death of her mother (Luna herself hasn't either of course because the person who should have helped her, her father, was unable to!)! I mean if somebody has an invisible friend or is hearing voices you'd recommend a therapist, too - right?

So please, tell me why is Luna special instead of delusional/deranged/crazy and in need of help?

Thanks, I'd really like to know the answer to that question!

*** On that note, is there any indication that specialized "mind healers"/magical therapists on are actually a thing in canon?

It is kind of implied by having the Janus Thickey ward, but given that the treatment of Lockhart and the Longbottoms doesn't seem to go much farther as locking them up so they can't hurt themselves and feeding them chicken soup...

**** Nope, not in canon. Some of the better stories i've read have them going to muggles who know about the masquerade or have to carefully edit their stories to tell them though a few stories have some good mindhealer stuff edit: though a lot of stories have absolutely horrible mindhealers who can do anything. I have a mindhealer in darkness ascendant, your choice if she's good or not. At the moment she's a throwaway chara kinda but in a few years she'll be harry's mindhealer potentially.

** We know (or can take an educated guess) that Luna uses her creatures to cope. That in itself is not necessarily a bad thing. Everybody copes with stress differently and Luna does it by giving things names and backstories to explain the world around her. Thats one thing.

Then I would assume that mental health isn't really a /thing/ in the wizarding world. Ginny didn't get treatment. Children were just sent back to their dorms after life threatening situations. There seems to be no such thing as psychological healthcare in the magical world.

And for my last statement, I'd guess that being odd is normal enough in the wizarding world to not warrant special attention. Its still perceived as a weakness, and therefore an easy target for bullies, but i'd go out on a limb here and say that in terms of mental health, no one seriously thinks Luna needs help.

As to the stuff like the Rotfang Conspiracy... I mean... Its really not that far off the mark of your everyday normal conspiracy theory.

** I couldn't agree more. Luna is a very broken little girl. She watched her mother die, helpless and unable to do anything and probably blames herself for that. Her father seems to love her, but also completely incapable of helping her properly either because of his own grief or the fact that he is, you know, nuts.

I think the imaginary creatures and obsession with unreality are coping mechanisms for Luna. I think she's probably naturally spacey and a bit odd, but the lack of nuturing and trauma made it far worse. Then of course, there is the complete lack of friends. She was in her FOURTH year before she made even ONE friend, and for crying out loud Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not exactly close with her! The girl needs help, and is not a crazy awesome seer or genki girl. She's a broken bird who needs some love and affection and a better grounding in reality.

Yeah, Ravenclaw wasn't good for her - IMHO Hufflepuff might have helped her more (hell, even Gryffindor might have because the insensitive lions would have probably - rather rudly - told her to "snap out of it"!) - the bullying there made things worse (but what would you expect from a group of people who think they are better than everybody else because they are bookish and intelligent (note: Not all of them, but most Ravenclaws seem kind of arrogant...kind of like most Slytherins, but without the blood-purity crap and the snobbishness that many rich folks have!)

I mean, I'm aware that lots of people argue that the characters /should/ have more emotional problems, given the experiences they have been through.

In a world with Billywigs [tiny electric blue wasps that cause people to float when they're stung], those two are remarkably plausible). Luna is not delusional.

There's no indication that Xenophilius is delusional or deranged either.

We have no notion that Luna didn't get some sort of treatment. She's clearly far more at peace with the idea of death, and the possibility of an afterlife, than anyone else in the canon, except perhaps Dumbledore or Nicholas Flamel.

There is nothing to indicate that Luna suffers from delusions, which are neurological in order. Conspiracy theorist and amateur cryptozoologist she may be, but the fact of the matter is she is *not* delusional.

At only a very few points in the canon do we actually see that Luna is factually wrong about the various conspiracies. [Sirius is not a musician. The Rotfang Conspiracy is most likely bogus. Fudge is not baking goblins into pies {though I wouldn't be surprised if he's killed a couple; we know he was trying to steal away control of the banks).

And similarly, Xenophilius does not appear to suffer from delusions either.

I disagree--I think there is quite a bit of evidence for a deity. Entire branches of some denominations (the Jesuits from the Roman Catholic Church) have made huge efforts for scientific discovery. Some extremely prominent scientists agree that a Creator quite possibly

And in any case, absence of evidence is */NOT/* evidence of absence.

While it is not bigoted to assume that there isn't a God, treating people with disdain for having faith most certainly is--especially since you equate it with schizophrenia, and have suggested similar treatment as such.

First, religious doctrine in Christianity demands evangelism. The Great Commission that Jesus told his Apostles was to "go forth and make disciples of all nations." Thus, many believe it is a sin to keep their faith completely behind closed doors. Secondly, in regards to the law: Religious faith of government officials have shaped the laws of the Western World for the last three thousand years. Laws against murder and theft have their foundation in religious law.

If one believes something is wrong, do they not have the responsibility to put a stop to it? And before you say "It's not their body, so it's not their choice" most pro-lifers say that the unborn child, the third party in the situation, is not getting a choice.

Impressive, but not unknown. Everyone reacts to negative experiences differently, and there's been a lot of research into the psychological quality of "resilience" - the ability to come out of hard circumstances relatively unscathed. It's still not really understood, but recent research suggests that the more one has an internal locus of self - that is to say, the more you believe yourself to be responsible for determining the conditions of your own life - the more resilient you are. And in contrast, the more you attribute external factors as the cause of your life circumstances, the less resilient you are.

Either they were locked up and had their hair sold to the local wig maker, or they were treated as eccentric and kept at home.

I always imagined that everyone knew Luna had issues, but decided to roll with them instead of causing her trouble. Especially Harry who has his own issues and doesn't want people to pitty him or dig into them.

It isn't right, but it explains the "maybe she's just a little different". Doing what they can for her as friends when they do not have the power to do anything else for her.

2. There is at least one half-blood who was raised in the muggle world in the death eaters (Snape) who's to say there isn't more? Admittedly if Snape was truly on the side of the death eaters instead of being a spy then he might not have thought of it, except he might've heard of it from other order members or from Dumbledore. I agree with you on that she could've just sent it the muggle way, or given it to an order guard when she was at Grimmauld and they would give it to Harry next time they were on watch duty.\\
3. It probably would have been better if they had trusted more people, most likely their friends. It would have been interesting to have Luna, Neville, and Ginny along for Deathly Hallows.\\
4. Admittedly you are correct about the last book, it was almost entirely on luck and chance that they were able to do it. An amount of luck is good and acceptable in a story (and bad luck), but it was pushing it to an extreme. Admittedly Harry did get lucky before but it was more believable.\\

I am contesting point 3: Having the three of them have a go at it was hard enough (the Weasleys had to find an excuse to keep Ron out of school, so Luna, Neville and Ginny would have needed an excuse, too and it's suspicious if such a large group of people is missing (Hermione was expected to hide, she was a muggleborn and Harry was of course undesireable number 1, so yeah him being in hiding/on the move was expected, too!))

As for 4: Indeed! As for Hermione lying? She was trying to take the blame (something she considers honorable IMHO), sure she didn't actually need to (Ron would have looked bad if she told the teachers why she was there, but over all I don't think anything would have happened, after all Ron was there to kind of trying to fix his mistake!)

Yeah, Potty (note: Yes, I am mocking Harry here!) got lucky a lot, but this book really blew it out of proportion! That a madman like Voldemort would fall for that setup was convenient, but highly unlikely in reality (hell, Draco lying to protect Harry is unlikely, too - you don't just forgive a guy you have hated for 6 years to save him from being killed, especially if you aren't a good person...someone like James Potter (who was an asshole, but still a good person inside!) might lie to save somebody - Draco?

True. Though honestly the Weasley's should have gone into hiding anyway. (Voldemort taking over the ministry, and you are in the order, so send your children to the school that is under his complete control). Neville should've gone into hiding, since he was a prophecy child and his parents were in the order. Admittedly he didn't know he was a prophecy child. (At least I don't think he did?). Luna could have come up with the excuse of searching for <creature here> in the newspaper. Her father could have come with or headed away. Such a large group isn't too suspicious, and also what does it matter if it's suspicious? Several students who are known friends of Undesirable Number #1 and friends.

Lying because you think it's honorable is still lying.

I can easily assume you are mocking Harry when you call Him Potty. I can see Draco not wanting Harry to be killed (Draco just doesn't have the hatred needed). Even if you hate someone for 6 years that doesn't mean you're fine with them being killed, or tortured. It's harder to see him going directly against the death eaters though.

Harry can talk to snakes, Prof Trelaeny(sp is wrong i know) has "the sight" and can on rare occasions see the future. Who is to say that Luna and her father both have a weird personality, but also something.... Something more. And that something lets them see MAGICAL creaturrs that use their magic, like the threshals, to be invisable. Only with these creatures the way to see them is not by watching someone die, but having some MAGICAL ABILITY. Or even being exposed to some sort of event in the same way threshals require. But that event wasnt mentioned or anything because Luna was just a side character.

Perhaps, some magics can be radioactive, of sorts, and alternate a person's psyche. And if we assume that magic is everywhere, some moments especially emotional or traumatic ones can be charged with this "radiation" and lead to PTSD, for example.

Schizophrenia can be an openness to the world, ability to see things that are normally concealed, inner workings of the world and a subsequent struggle to comprehend them. Probably, what Luna has.
