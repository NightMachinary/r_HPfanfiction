Awhile ago a read a fairly long Hermione/Charlie that took place in what was basically a dystopian world (might have had zombies?). They find each other by accident and end up travelling to Hogwarts to find other survivors. I think there were spots of dead magic, too, spots that were essentially dead and everything and everyone was losing their magic. I know they make it to Hogwarts and that there is more story after that. I can't remember where I read it or what rating it had as I'm pretty sure they were sleeping together, but that wasn't the focus of the story. I've tried looking for it with no luck, so any help would be appreciated. Thanks.


** I remember this fic! Can't remember the title off the top of my head, though. It was posted to Granger Enchanted, which is now dead. I don't know if it can be found anywhere else. I will be home in a few hours and I can do some investigation if you're still looking.

** Ahh, I actually found it! It's /Whom the Gods Would Destroy/ by ianthe_waiting. Luckily the author posted it to their LiveJournal in addition to Granger Enchanted. [[http://ianthe-waiting.livejournal.com/91745.html][Here]] is the link to part one.
