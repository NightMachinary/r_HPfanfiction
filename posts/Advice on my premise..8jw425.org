I'm thinking of writing my first fic. It will be heavy AU, starting year 6, and sort of a crossover, but with only one crossover character that happens to heavily influence the wizarding world in a way that it begins to resemble their home. Not geographically, but abilities wise. I'll post the description below, and my question would be is this something you'd be interested in, or do you generally draw the line when it stops feeling like the good old wizarding world?

Harry Potter and the Scarlet Witch "Like a pebble in water, a new student arrives at Hogwarts and the ripples she creates will change the wizarding world forever. For better or for worse."


** I'm a sucker for steamrolling the universe, like the Game of Thrones industrialisation SI fics. That being said, if you are writing that sort of fic, don't come up with artificial difficulties or limitations to have tension when it is entirely obvious that any confrontation would be incredibly one sided. If I drop Shepard, Tali and Wrex or the Master Chief in the Battle of Hogwarts, it should not be a close fight. The expectation is that Voldemort gets a good paddlin, not the ability to block projectiles at 0.2 c or a 2000 pound alien charging with his alien magic.

Having OP characters dropped into a world is supposed to be the ultimate "feel good" fic where the "bad guys" get fucked harder than an "18 year old" in her "first" gangbang movie. When Darth Vader becomes Harry's drinking buddy because his TIE Advanced was thrown through time and space, it is expected that he slaughters his way through the Death Eater ranks and the only question should be the order of deaths and who dies fighting and who tries to run.

Tl;dr: If you want tension, don't make crossovers with overpowered characters. Those are supposed to be a turkey shoot. It's like playing Civilization on easy and using nukes to wipe out medieval societies. You are not in it because it is challenging.

Be careful when doing this. Because you are starting Year 6, there has already been significant feats of magic. I'd recommend against alteration of power through the introduction of magical cores being a power indicator. That trope can be done well, but personally, I think a AU Year 6 would be way too late to introduce it because of how Year 4 played out.

The summary is really short and doesn't say much. That can affect what type of crowd you're trying to draw in, so give that some thought.

If you're bringing in Scarlet Witch from Marvel, I'd make it clear within the first chapter which version she is. Reason is from what I know of her, it just seems like she doesn't need to influence the world at all, she can literally re-write reality in the comics. So instead of influencing the world, she can just straight up changes it outright and no one can stop her.

In-Name-Only trope, should be careful that you don't alter the characters so much that you reach that imo. For me personally, I don't mind some changes to the character, but there is a point in which it becomes an In-Name-Only trope and at that point is it even in the Harry Potter world or is it more or less a fanfiction for Scarlet Witch.

***** Thank you for the detailed advice! First, with the description, I think I'll see what kind of stories pull me in, and take note of what they include and why it pulled me in, or how it help up with the story, which is something I hadn't thought of prior to your advice. Second, for your note on magical cores, I plan to take it in a different direction that won't necessarily need to alter anything previously established in the wizarding world, but I will try to remember not to contradict myself or what familiar characters come to expect of their own world. Third, as for the version of scarlet witch, I want to make her my own version, diverging from most storylines where she would have been in-story age, but I'll make sure to establish her origins so that fans of her can get a general idea of what her limitations might be. Lastly, as for the trope, I have thought extensively on what kind of alterations would/should change character personality, so I won't take a character OoC without a large amount of premeditation. Thank you again, as your post was super helpful in getting me to think over my outline a bit!

*** My only thing is... wouldn't Voldemort just Transfigure those obstacles and win pretty handily? I find this almost as annoying as OP characters not steamrolling those they should. So many HP crossovers forget (or the author didn't know) that you can pretty much transfigure anything into anything else (with 5 exceptions) which makes most non-magical foes considerably more killable.

**** At least Mass Effect would still kick Voldemort's arse due to Biotics and the stuff you can do with them, like creating singularities or ripping something apart on a molecular level. Voldemort might be able to counter most spells in existence, but I doubt he even knows what a molecule is, much less how to defend against. Most Death Eaters would also shit themselves when a Krogan charges them (imagine a large, heavily armoured lizard carrying a machine gun with a sword-sized bayonet, a fantasy-sized Warhammer and a 2-inch shotgun.

Halo would also be a challenge since you can use advanced AI to aim a sniper rifle at ranges exceeding a mile and Voldemort won't even know that there is someone hunting him. Or just jump in the middle of the Death Eater camp, spray and prey with two homing explosive projectile launchers (Needlers) and then charge with your ton of power armour.

As for Star Wars, can magic counter a force choke? Can you shield against an Executor-class star destroyer raining plasma from the sky?

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of universes where having Harry Potter magic would enable you to steamroll everything (Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings), but also plenty where it would be a fair fight (Halo) or where the outcome depends entirely on the author (Mass Effect). Although I very much doubt that Voldemort could do much about the Reapers tbh.

***** But that's the thing, giving one side a jump on the other (and the motivation to kill) makes most fights boringly one-sided. If a Krogan happens upon Voldemort, Voldemort wins because he always wants to kill and has an unblockable means of doing so (unclear if this is fair anyway since he's immortal). Weight and mass don't really matter to transfiguration since it alters molecular structure (needles have several times the mass of a matchstick, after all), and from canon Shield Charms stop physical attacks in general (obviously this isn't going to stop star destroyers, I was really talking about ME and Halo).

Don't get me wrong, it's not a stomp if both sides are out to kill. But certain abilities even the playing field in a fight, more so if we give one side the initiative. Oh a sniper? Well maybe Voldemort keeps up a Supersensory Charm so they'll never hit. Force Choke? Apparate to a blindspot and Avada. Like anyone can make a fight easier in their head. :P

****** The Killing curse is blockable by physical objects and I would argue that armour which can withstand missile hits and mass accelerators (which operate at low relativistic speeds) will make it possible for the wearer to continue fighting despite being hit by the killing curse (and that is discounting energy shields). Also, Krogans have a lot of redundant organs so they might need more than one killing curse to kill, similar to giants.

As for the mass, that was more about the psychological effects than the kinetic energy. None of the Death Eaters have seen a Krogan before and suddenly this Hagrid-sized lizard wearing five-inch thick armour is charging them with a very toothy grin... Their ranks will break and their underwear will need a change as well.

******* I think the fact that only Dumbledore blocked the Killing Curse is evidence that you need to have powerful magic, as whatever it hits is still destroyed (it may even have to do with those statues being animated to life). If that's armor well there's a bunch of shrapnel in your body, assuming it stops the curse at all. Otherwise everyone would just conjure some metal in front of them to stop it. I don't think giants were ever indicated to resist the killing curse. They just have high magical resistance so things like stunners are less effective or not at all.

That seems unlikely. Wouldn't the curse it out of fear, if anything? Large, powerful magical creatures exist, so the idea of a giant lizard-man, while odd and scary, probably wouldn't make death Eaters shut themselves before attacking.

******** Krogan armour (or any armour in Mass Effect) is designed to stop projectiles moving with tens of thousands of miles per SECOND. And they have energy shielding around that. Which makes that armour way more resistent than a golden statue. And even if the armour should splinter, Krogans have most of their organs in redundant pairs, so even shredding a heart will not immediately stop one since they have another heart. They were uplifted for the purpose of waging intergalactic war, which should tell you a lot about their resilience. Hell, their home planet makes Tschernobyl look like a holiday resort (it is a nuclear wasteland).

And Wrex has been fighting since gunpowder made it to Europe, and having access to Space Magic (Biotics) himself, he would be a formidable foe, even for Voldemort. And that is not even taking his shotgun (larger than a two pounder cannon) into account.

********* Note: I have played the ME series, lol. But I don't see what non-magical defenses are really going to do against magical attacks. The difference with the statues is that they were magically animated, probably created magically as well since, well, why would wizards bother doing it the muggle way. The physical material is irrelevant, otherwise anyone could stop the curse, which Crouch Jr. made clear was not possible (with the obvious exception). Speed isnt really a factor, the curse kills magically not through physical trauma.

But my original question: If any of these were trouble, couldn't Voldemort just transfigure them into something harmless and defenseless? Armor is great unless it's turned into rubber, and redundant organs are a good fallback unless your transformed into a chicken. :(

********** Yes, and no. Biotic barriers are a thing and it is arguable that they would stop magic, as could energy shields. And no, just turning people into animals or straight up vanishing them should not work. According to Mc Gonagall, you need to know what you are transfiguring, and I doubt that Voldemort knows enough about Krogans to transfigure one. Transfiguring others is not once used in combat in the series (the closest we get is the animagus reversal). Also, the more complex, the higher the difficulty. Sapient being ls should not be easily alterable with magic.

Don't get me wrong, someone of the Dark Lord's caliber would not be a pushover. If Voldemort wants to kill a Krogan, Fiendfyre would be his best bet, despite the collateral damage. And transfiguration can be used defensively to great effect. Mass Effect vs Harry Potter is decided by who gets the drop on the other one. I'm just not sold on offensive transfiguration in general.

*********** Magic isn't really an "energy" in HP though (in the generic sci-fi sense of a plasma-looking something), so I'm skeptical the armors and energy shields in ME would be any better than other physical material.

I don't recall that being said about Transfiguration. The closest I can recall is that for Vanishing living things (which I doubt works on anything humanoid anyway) the more complex that they are makes Vanishing harder. Gamp's Law of Transfiguration is (from what we can gather from DH) something like "Anything can be transfigured into anything else" (with the exceptions). I mean, it's not like first years have a physics level understanding of the difference between a needle and a matchstick, they just know "one is metal, the other is wood" yet they can work it. As far as i can tell (again, unless Ive forgotten something) is that you only need to know what you're changing the thing into. And going against other wizards, transfiguration is less useful since they can actively block and deflect it, something a Krogan couldn't.
