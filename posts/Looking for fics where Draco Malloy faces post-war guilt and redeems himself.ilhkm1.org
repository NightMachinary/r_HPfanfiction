Looking for well written fics of draco post war dealing with his own self hatred and guilt, and how it intertwines with his relationship with the golden trio (post war). I want to read about his inner battle and redemption. Not just stories where he donates or just says a one liner, but where we can truly see his real character, bad upbringing, and desire to help the golden trio. Extra points if it mentions parts of the war where he battled doing what the death eaters wanted him to do. Dramione would be a nice touch but not needed.

PLEASE give me suggestions!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]] has Draco working things out after the war due to a time loop.

It's not that long but I love Draco's characterization in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7548181][Slithering]].

And [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6427408][Unseen]] is more about Harry dealing with overly ardent fans after the war but there's this part about Draco's redemption that I adore.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  Draco found the nest down in the Manor's cellars, while he was clearing them out.

  When he wasn't wearing it, he got jumpy, always waiting for someone to come at him wanting something---and now they did it even more urgently, if they ever saw him, because most of the time, nobody did.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  Draco didn't think there was much reason to hope for a better future. Astoria proved him wrong.
