  Also why is it that the source material can do it, but the fanfiction writers must avoid it?

Wild guess: the source material is written for 10 year olds and fanfic is not.

I think it's because the source material is creating the world for fanfiction writers to play in. Generally in fanfiction, you can draw from the source material and the base character is known and you don't need to flesh out the their characteristics if you aren't making them OOC. In source material though you have to create the character and give them life and personality through little ways such as abusing italics or whatever.

** Do we really need to avoid them? Personally I don't mind things like all capitals while reading something. It is a universally accepted way of showing loud speech, and is effective in catching a readers eye and conveying the underlying sentiment. Vernon is a abusive person, and he specifically shouts not just in anger but to intimidate the other person.

"Absolutely not!" he thundered

"ABSOLUTELY NOT!" he thundered

​

I prefer the latter.
