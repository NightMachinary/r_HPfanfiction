I just finished reading Blindness by AngelaStarCat, and I really enjoyed how petunia/vernon/dudley actually cared for harry. looking for other fics of any genre where they don't treat harry like crap


** This is a one shot from one of my favorite series. Probably my most favorite Petunia and Dudley's portrayal. linkao3(3073562)

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

** *A Different Halloween* - linkffn(6439871)\\
Dudley is the BWL. Still a muggle/squib though. Warning, it's RobSt. The premise behind the Dudley being the BWL is interesting though. (TL;DR: Voldemort gets "defeated" on November 1st, which is the first day of the day of the dead, which let Death yoink him irregardless of Horcruxes.)

*Defendat erit scientia* - linkao3(22273192)\\
Harry Potter/Sherlock Holmes crossover.\\
Dudley is magical. Harry/Hermione/Dudley have crack-filled adventures pre-hogwarts. Hermione has a Garden Gnome army with an airborn regiment. The grammar is bad at parts, but bearable compared to other stories I've come across.

** Harry and Dudley get along pretty well in Deathly Hallowed, but it isn't the focus of the story. Very well written, but sadly incomplete. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]]).

Harry and Dudley are actually pretty close in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4608288/chapters/10502271]]). Vernon also tries his very best to do right by him. Vernon-centric. Complete.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

  Harry Potter was introduced to 'magic' and magic wands earlier than canon by his primary schoolteacher Miss Honeybloom. It was also during that class, he was introduced to and became lifelong friends with a certain Miss Hermione Granger.

** I dont know how to link.. but 3 slytherin marauders had this. 10 yo dudley gets confronted by his Classmates about Harry's abuse and turns himself around. Petunia decides to leave abusive Vernon and try to flee with the boys to the only wizard she knows: snape. (Not snape/Petunia) i realy loved the story. It is a feel good story with mentor snape and a lot of adventures for the young boys. The author made a whole Lore thing around the dragons.
