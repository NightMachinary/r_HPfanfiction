So I'm currently wasting away at home during my holidays and I need something to occupy me. My biggest wants in fics are generally organic character and story development which are well written with good grammar. Preferably no bashing unless used well for comedic purposes without overusing it to the point where it's no longer funny. No multi/harems. As in most things longer is better ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡ °) Thanks in advance.

I would encourage anything by Littlebird, Northumbrian, and Annerb. Others like Jenorama, Melindaleo, and FloreatCastellum are aslo excellent at the pairing with long works.

Deadwoodpecker has some great stories too, but tend to be more adult in the themes, particularly in regards to sexuality. Still, wonderful work.
