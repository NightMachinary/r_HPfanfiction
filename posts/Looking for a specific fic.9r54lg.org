Okay so unfortunately I'll be really vague because I remember only a specific thing of this fic so I hope it'll be sufficient.

What I remember : Harry is an adult and people (allies, future allies or enemies I'm not sure but I think it was allies) are wondering why Harry dislike so much slavery and they learn by one of them that it's because Harry was treated as one (or something akin when forced to do all the chores for his relatives) when he was young. It's highly probable that it was a crossover (maybe Star Wars?).

Sorry for the lack of information, I hope someone will still get what fic it was.

Thanks

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

*** Thank you there's that. I unknowingly lied when saying Harry was an adult and as there is also "The Jedi That Would Not Die" linkffn(7459011) where Harry isn't an adult. I think my mind mixed the two but thanks anyway I didn't remember those particular parts.
