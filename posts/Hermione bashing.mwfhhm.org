:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic, I know that it's on FF.net

I think Harry is involved with daphne green grass

All I can remember really distinctly is Harry being confronted by hermiones parents in diagonal alley for “cheating on their daughter” with the girl who's with him, which leads to Harry revealing that not only is he not dating hermione, she's been lying about never getting in trouble (gets in trouble for harassing Harry) and about being top of the year (has average marks)

It's a pretty cliched bashing fic. But I'm really in the mood to reread it


** Afraid I don't know that one. I've read fics where Hermione ended up being not a good person, a few where she's just plain book smart but very naive about people, and some where she got called out on her overachieving nature(particularly in regards to /not/ following instructions), but I don't believe I've read one where Hermione wasn't a top student.

*** I think it was just that she had great book knowledge in this story, but mediocre grades in actually using the spells

**** It's funny how the author says “Weasley bashing” with parentheses excluding every named Weasley except Ron and Molly. Would have taken less space just to say Ron/Molly bashing.
