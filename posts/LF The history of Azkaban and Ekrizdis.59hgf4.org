As the title says I'm looking for a modern fic about Azkaban. Are there any fics about Ekrizdis building it or creating the dementors? Bonus points if Harry and time travel are involved.


** There's some stuff in The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb.

**** I think that is legitimately one of the most exciting fics I've ever read. If that could be a saga like the Cadmean victory......that would really make a good day

*** New info from pottermore: Ekrizdis was a powerful dark wizard who built Azkaban and created dementors. Apparently his experiments were so horrific that the dementors of Azkaban were considerd the least horrific thing he ever did.

**** We don't know if he created Dementors. He just bred lots of them on Azkaban.
