** The Green in the Grey. I honestly can't remember anything about this fic; I read it a long time ago. But I did bookmark it for reading again (which meant I liked it) and it is both complete and very well reviewed.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
