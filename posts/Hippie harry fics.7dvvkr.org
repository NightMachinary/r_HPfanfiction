Sometimes i wonder how funny it would be if Harry turned up september first in 6th year dressed as a hippie, smoking pot, in colourful robes, talking about flower power, and deeming everything to be "groovey" after being told by dumbledore that the "power he knows not" is 'love'.

Any existing fics where Harry desides the power of love is obviously becoming a hippie?


** This request almost demands a Harry/Luna pairing.

** I'm just imagining Harry listening to The Beatles and Elton John's greatest lovesongs trying to find out what love means to him.

** Harry should try to use his potion kit to make drugs, which he can use to better understand the Quibbler.
