*** Daphne ends up snogging him after the game on-pitch, despite losing the match.

At first outraged, the Slytherins quickly come to believe she's doing it to get intel about the Gryffindor quidditch team's tactics and the like, and they congratulate her.

His friends are unsurprised: they know he likes sporty girls, and they tease him for it.

They end up dating, and they both just make up bullshit to appease her team and the rest of her House: Harry makes one or two falsified plays per match to just give them enough breadcrumbs that she's actually getting "intel" (e.g. while she's actually trying to excavate his tonsils with her tongue).

  It might never have happened. In fact, it was a decision she nearly didn't make, and yet she did. See how everything can change when Dumbledore's Army recruits a Slytherin member, Daphne Greengrass, who just wanted to pass her O.W.L's.
