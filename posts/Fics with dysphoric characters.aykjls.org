So, in real life most people probably wouldn't react the way fandom would have you think to waking up spontaneously as the opposite sex. I'm looking for more realistic depictions than "Whoops! I'm a girl now! Time to have sex with Tom Felton!"

What I'm looking for is something more like linkao3(TransFigured [+podfic] by picascribit) or linkao3(270848) where the characters behave more like the way you'd expect real transgender people to. In the first one, having your biological sex forcibly changed is about as psychologically damaging as you'd expect, and in the other one dysphoria and suchlike are treated in an interesting and possibly more realistic way than is normal for fanfic.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** I usually avoid gender swap fics because it's often tastelessly played for laughs à la Freaky Friday, or it's just a prompt for smut when characters get aroused over how sexy their gender-swapped bodies are.

However, I thought the change was handled very well in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11482921/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Danse-Macabre][Harry Potter and the Danse Macabre]]. Refreshingly, the character still focuses on what matters most to them and copes with the changes to their body /without/ devolving into hysterics, feeling like less of a person, or altering their personality just because they have different plumbing.

**** I think the fic author meant it as a joke? It's hard to tell this early in the story, but so far she's acted just like canon Voldemort in the books.

  "Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, pity those who live without love." A Harry Potter from the future travels through time to change his past --- and loses himself. A Harry Potter from the present struggles with his destiny --- and must find himself. No, they can't cheat off each other. (time travel, ewe, badass!fem!harry, tsundere!fem!voldemort)

  “We thought you might be a werewolf," said Sirius."What?" Remus almost laughed at the absurdity."Last year. James and I thought --- but the dates didn't quite match up. With the full moons, I mean.""Well, I'm not.""I know. All I meant was, we thought you might be, and we still wanted to be friends. Whatever you're not telling us --- how much worse can it be?"

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

** Wouldn't it be pretty easy to transition and pass as a wizard?You could just transfigure yourself into your desired gender.Of course this is disregarding muggle au and of course you could just hand wave this as no one would tell them or teach them how to cast the spell.
