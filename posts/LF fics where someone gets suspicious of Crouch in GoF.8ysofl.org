In the movies, Crouch had a tic where he swiped his tongue out of his mouth. I wanted to see if there was a fic utilizing this detail to make someone, at the very least, suspicious.

Inb4 nitpickers, I know that the odds of someone recognizing this tic are very very small. Crouch was believed dead, and only someone super paranoid would have noticed.


** Or his father. Which is what happens in the pictures, for the record.

*** In the film, during the conversation between Crouch Sr and the fake Moody just after the second task, pay close attention to their facial expressions. Crouch has a look of recognition when he sees the tic, and "Moody" quickly realizes he's been made.
