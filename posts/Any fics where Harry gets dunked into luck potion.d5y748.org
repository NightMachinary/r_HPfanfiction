*** The luck potion kind of reminds me of the smart pull from Limitless. If you haven't seen the movie then its about a failing author who suddenly turns successful by taking a smart pill that gives him 100% control of his brain. While the pill makes you super smart for a matter of hours continued use of the pill slowly drove the takers crazy and could kill them even so he had to keep taking it even though it made him sick the more he took it.
