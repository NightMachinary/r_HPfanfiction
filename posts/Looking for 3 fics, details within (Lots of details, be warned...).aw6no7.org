*Fic 1* - Draco is found dead, I believe it's during the middle hogwarts years. Year 3-5, I think. Harry & friends are concerned that he'll be the biggest suspect because everyone knows about how they treated each other. They decide to investigate. Within the first chapter or two, Harry approaches Daphne to ask some questions. The scene was notable to me because she seemed to be pretty tongue-tied over his Boy-Who-Livedness.

 

*Fic 2* - Harry gets adopted by the Malfoys some time after his first year. He is not happy. They're not warm and fuzzy by any means, but he's surprised to find that the Malfoy parents are complete reasonable with him, if a little strict. Draco's still a brat though.

Draco has friends over for a couple nights and they pick on Harry a bit, which somehow leads to Lucius telling him that he is allowed to have guests as well. Harry didn't bother asking because he assumed the answer would be no. Lucius even allow him to invite Hermione, and she does visit. I think the attitude was something like... yeah I don't like her kind, but I can stomach having her in my house for a while and be civil about it.

 

*Fic 3* - Prepare yourself for all the details that I can remember.

Harry gets his letter and goes to Diagon Alley and he's really excited. At Gringotts he somehow gets involved with helping the Goblins solve a riddle to unlock some kind of special door. I think there were some kind of magitech spider things there that Harry was fascinated by. After that I believe Harry goes a little nuts about buying books - he climbs to the top of a tall shelf to reach one that he wants. He falls and the Weasley twins catch him. Narcissa sees them holding him and misinterprets the situation, coming over to scold them. Not really sure how that progresses, but Harry ends up buying the twins really expensive clothes as thanks for catching him. Narcissa becomes aware that Harry is alone, or only has Hagrid with him, and she ends up taking him to finish the rest of his shopping.

When they go to Ollivander's, he somehow impresses the man enough that he gets offered an apprenticeship. Which we find out is a big deal because Ollivander is very highly regarded artisan. It seemed like if he wasn't already the Boy-Who-Lived, people would come to know about him from that alone. I feel like Lucius was there and Harry asked him for advice about the offer? Not sure.

On the way to Hogwarts the only thing I can really remember is that he doesn't tell people his name (last name? full name? dunno), and that he meets Tonks when she breaks up some confrontation he gets into. I think he hitches a ride in the carriages with her instead of taking a boat, and he climbs out the window onto the roof for the ride. The others join him up there. They may have ended up locked out of Hogwarts for a bit, and one of the kids Harry meets may have been a vampire. Not sure about those last points.

Hogwarts seemed to be presented as something of a regular magical school and university combined, IIRC. There are more teachers, there are teacher's assistants, there are graduate students getting higher education. One older student tells Harry about helping Snape with potions research, and that he earned access to his own potion lab for projects. I think Harry gets one somehow, but it's more of glorified closet than the full out pseudo-scientific lab that the older student had.

He makes some kind of bet with a rude older student on the night of the sorting, which he wins because of some combination of being Harry Potter (which they didn't know), being Ollivander's apprentice, and maybe his unexpected sorting.

 

Whew. Anybody recognize any of these fics?

*Edit:* Found #3, it's Adventures in Magick by PseudonymousEntity.
