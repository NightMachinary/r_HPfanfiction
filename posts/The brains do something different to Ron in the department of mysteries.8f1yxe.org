** It'd be fun to read a story that has all of the makings of a Ron-bashing fic...only to find out his incredibly OOC behavior was due to the brains.

*** Agree. Haven't pondered this angle before but sounds intriguing. It would be a good read.

*** I remember reading a couple stories where that was the case. It was not good because just knowing that the brain-exposure was causing his shitty behaviour did not make it any more interesting. It felt more like a ready-made excuse for bashing tbh.

  After his adventure in the Department of Mysteries, Harry finds a new power over air which gives him confidence. He's "live and let live" until you come after him, then watch out. This starts just after the revelation of the prophecy at the end of book5.

** I think it would be good point in time to install SI as Ron. SI being a brain who will take control of Ron's body or who will be his advicer or something.
