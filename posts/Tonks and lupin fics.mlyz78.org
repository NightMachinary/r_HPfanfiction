Hi! I've loved Harry Potter but I've just now gotten around to reading the books i finished half blood Prince yesterday and I fell in love with tonks and lupin more then I thought possible.

Only problem is I can't find any good fan fics that stick to cannon ( I don't mind if it strays every once in a while, like if they don't die or stuff like that but I don't want one set in a totally different universe)

If anyone can help and link some I'll be really grateful


** Oh they are my favorite pairing!

** Hmm. I'm not sure what you consider to be "totally different". I don't recall having read any that just explore Remus and Tonks' POV during canon, but their relationship kind of plays out similarly but more on-screen and years earlier in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). The premise is about Sirius escaping five years early and taking Harry in at eight years old, but there's a fair bit about Remus, who encounters Tonks as part of the manhunt for Sirius.

The Debt of Time turns out canon-ish in the end, though with some adjustments like Sirius and Remus and Tonks surviving, and a lot of Hermione interacting with the Marauders along the way. Quite a strong lemon flavour, though.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
