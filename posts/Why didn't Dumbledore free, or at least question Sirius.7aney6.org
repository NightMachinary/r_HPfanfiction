Well that's the question, and I don't mean in POA, although that should be answered too. What I mean is that at the end of the war what reason did Dumbledore have of not finding out why Sirius betrayed the Potter's.

At this point in time he had considerable political weight, and was largely regarded as the most powerful wizard of his time. I'm 100% certain that just about anyone would have bent over backwards to allow what most would consider a small thing, and if nothing else, the potential info the 'right hand man' of Voldemort could give them would have convinced Barty Crouch Sr to set this up as well.

So why didn't he do this? What reason, that doesn't go into bashing, would he have to allow Snape (a known by him death eater) freedom yet he won't at least find out why Sirius betrayed them? I'm sorry, but this seems like it was done purposely.


** Simple: as per canon, Sirius confessed that he was responsible for the deaths of James and Lily. But that's only how Sirius saw it. He wasn't literally responsible for what happened, but Sirius blamed himself and was psychologically broken by the time Fudge found him, so its no wonder Sirius felt it was his fault.

In canon, Sirius basically states that he never actually tried to appeal to Dumbledore. He never told him about the fact the Marauders were Animagus, nor does Sirius tell Dumbledore that the secret keepers were switched. *What fanon forgets is that from Dumbledore's perspective, Sirius was still the secret keeper, and Dumbledore believed that Sirius betrayed the Potters because neither James/Sirius/Lily ever told Dumbledore that Wormtail was the new secret keeper.*

I feel fanon is so obsessed with character bashing that it forgot what happened in canon. Its pretty much spelled out what happened, and the blanks are very easy to fill in:

- James and Lily told Dumbledore that they would make Sirius the secret keeper.

- James and Lily later make Wormtail the secret keeper. Neither of them nor Sirius EVER told Dumbledore about this change, so Dumbledore is under the impression that Sirius was made secret keeper.

- Wormtail betrays the Potters, then kills the 12 muggles and fakes his own death

- Sirius, depressed and broken after Wormtail's betrayal, blames himself for suggesting Wormtail be secret keeper.

- When the Ministry arrest Sirius, as per Fudge's eyewitness account, Sirius was laughing mad and likely confessed to Fudge that it was his fault that James and Lily died (which is only true from Sirius' perspective). Following Sirius' confession, the Ministry arrest Sirius.

- At some point shortly after this, Dumbledore told Fudge the very true fact that James and Lily said Sirius was their secret keeper, being unaware of the secret keeper swap since nobody told him. *Dumbledore testified that Sirius was guilty based on the very words James/Lily/Sirius told to Dumbledore's face, and Dumbledore had no reason to mistrust them.*

- Based on Dumbledore's testimony and Sirius' own confession, the Ministry saw no reason to hold a trial. *If James and Lily had told Dumbledore that they made Wormtail their secret keeper, and also if they told Dumbledore that Wormtail was an Animagus, then Dumbledore would never have gave evidence against Sirius, and would have fought to prove Sirius' innocence. Even in an event that he was unable to prove Sirius' innocence, Dumbledore would have at least made sure Sirius got a fair trial like what he did for Harry at the start of OotP.*

- At some point after Sirius was sent to Azkaban but before the Lestrange's trial, the Ministry was likely pressured into giving the Death Eaters a trial, since the only reason Sirius never got one was because the Ministry/Crouch Sr were showing no mercy.

- After Voldemort's confirmed downfall and the war was over, the Ministry would have returned to allowing criminals to have trials.

*** Yea, the problem with all those valid points is that by not giving Sirius a trial it was violations of the law by the Ministry and Dumbledore. No other argument matters, because everyone else got a trial no matter how despicable or obvious their actions were.

As far as I see it in cannon, Dumbledore is a well meaning man, but he is not a good man. Throughout the books he commits crimes at his leisure because he thinks it is the right thing to do.

One of the things I see in cannon is that while decent laws are indeed in the book, the problem is that the leaders of the British Wizardling World tends to ignore them when convenient.

Sirius never got a trial because at the time of his arrest, the Ministry wasn't giving ANY surviving Death Eaters a trial.

Sirius would have been arrested on October 31st 1981, if not the following day. Bellatrix and Crouch Jr didn't get arrested until sometime after Voldemort's downfall, so around 1982-1983. The implication is that at some point after Sirius was arrested (31st October/1st November, 1981) but before Bellatrix and Crouch Jr were arrested (around 1982-1983), the Ministry decided to give captured Death Eaters a fair trial. Bellatrix and Crouch Jr didn't get special treatment, they just happened to get arrested after the Ministry reverted back to giving the Death Eaters a fair trial.

Remember, the only reason that Sirius didn't get a trial was because of the First Wizarding War. For the duration of the war (1970-1981), Aurors were legally allowed to use the Unforgivable Curses against the Death Eaters. Assuming a Death Eater didn't die fighting the Aurors, they weren't getting a trial if they were arrested during 1970-1981. Bellatrix and Crouch Jr got a trial for the simple fact that by the time they were caught, the war had been over several months. Had Bellatrix and Crouch Jr got themselves arrested BEFORE Sirius did, those two never would have got a trial either.

*TL;DR: If Sirius had been arrested in 1982 or 1983, he would have got a trial like Bellatrix and Crouch Jr. The Ministry went back to giving Death Eaters fair trials at some point between Voldemort's downfall and when the Longbottoms were tortured.*

**** What decent laws are in the book? Where in canon are you seeing that every criminal is entitled to a trail? There is absolutely no evidence of these things.

Even if there was, do you think every criminal in our real-life world gets a trial? Well... no, they don't. If you plead guilty, they don't bother going to the expense of giving a trial, because you've already confessed that you are at fault. That's what Sirius, did, albeit a little less formally than criminals do in our world.

Also supposing there were these "decent laws in the book" (which I really don't think there are) the difference can be explained very simply- everyone else asked for a trial and didn't confess before their trial- Sirius did confess and then never asked for a trial.

****** *Plea bargaining in the United States*

Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the United States are settled by plea bargain rather than by a jury trial. They have also been increasing in frequency---they rose from 84% of federal cases in 1984 to 94% by 2001. Plea bargains are subject to the approval of the court, and different States and jurisdictions have different rules. Game theory has been used to analyze the plea bargaining decision.

** As already mentioned, the popular fan theory is that Dumbledore did it so he could shape and control Harry to be his weapon/tool.

Canon-wise though it's probably a lot simpler. Dumbledore is old. He's probably tired. He just finished fighting another war, this one in his own country, where the opposing side was lead by a former student of his. A former student that he was always slightly suspicious of but that he left mostly unchecked. And the war was not without great cost, taking the the lives of students and friends he'd known for years. I don't know how many people of ever experienced loss or great emotional upheaval, but I can tell you it's fucking draining, and it takes a long time to even feel like a person again and not a machine going through the motions of living.

TL;DR Dumbledore was old and tired and fought a war where a lot of people died. Most likely he just wanted it to all be over and done with to rebuild.

** Assuming Dumbledore isn't the evil mustache-twirling manipulator shitty fanfiction makes him out to be, I always try to look at his character from a perspective of "What could've been his best intention?" always remembering that he is very much human and limited to all the limitations that come with it - [[http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/this-is-true-this-is-truth-square-circle-please-consider-before-talking-typing.jpg][including our incapability to leave our own perspective and therefore our own truth.]]

In this case, I would think that Dumbledore saw the "evidence" right in front of him. Sirius was the secret keeper. There was literally no other possibility than Sirius being the traitor. The others had no possibility to betray them - they couldn't. The mechanics of the Fidelius were "evidence" enough. Plus, for all to see, he ended Peter Pettigrew in a disgusting slaughterfest, in the midst of muggles.

Basically, the plot of the Marauders failed because of something fanfiction authors often name as one of their qualities - sensible intelligence distribution.

Of course, /we the readers/ know Sirius being the traitor isn't true. We have been let into the secret. But Dumbledore, knowing what he knew, probably had all the evidence he needed to leave Sirius to the war-tribunal sentence he received. I would even think that in the process of the sentencing, he was glad that Sirius couldn't benefit from being a Black as much as Lucius benefited from being a Malfoy. In his mind there was nothing that could redeem Sirius. In Dumbledore's mind, Sirius held blood above friendship in the end.

Snape, in comparison, had a - one - redeeming quality. Snape went to Dumbledore, trying to safe Lily. Granted, one could argue that it was a purely selfish action. Snape wanted to safe the woman he loved, not her son and especially not her husband. But Dumbledore probably saw something in him. What it was I don't know, but it at least was /something/, which in Dumbledore's mind was still more than Sirius had.

I'm not arguing that Dumbledore made no mistake here. He did, in hindsight. Many, many people did. But I'll argue that he made an understandable mistake by not using up political capital and favors for something he thought was a clear cut case.

*** James and Lily Potter were also in the Order of the Phoenix, meaning Dumbledore probably saw them as a friends or at least friendly acquaintances (At the very least strong allies), he might not have wanted Sirius to get a trial because he could have weaseled out of a conviction (somehow) and Dumbledore saw that there was clear proof (in his eyes) of his crimes. (Even with clear proof however it isn't hard to see why he doesn't trust the government throughout the HP books we see Wizards are easily misled by the Daily Prophet and in general aren't very bright.)

So best case scenario in Dumbledore getting Sirius a trial is him going to Azkaban (Where he already is) or dying via the kiss, worst case is him walking free.

** Well you said it yourself. He had considerable political weight, and the vast majority of the wizarding population considered him to be the strongest wizard of his time. After the war, in the post voldemort world, he was the one everyone looked to to make things better. To set things right. He was working three ridiculously important jobs, the Headmaster of the ONLY SCHOOL IN BRITAIN, the judge of the entire court of law in the wizarding world, and the head of the internation confederation of wizards, which is basically the UN of the magical world. He probably had zero time to do anything, even before Voldemort appeared. Not to mention the fact that he was fucking 99 years old when Voldemort died the first time. He was old and tired.

***** Most criticism of Dumbledore is based on cherry picking the times at which you expect him to obey they law (how dare Dumbledore unilaterally decide to leave Harry with the Dursleys?) and the times where you expect Dumbledore to work outside it (how dare Dumbledore fail to take it upon himself to subvert the Ministry's justice system?).

Ultimately I feel that the balancing act of when to exercise the discretion to break the law is very easy to judge with hindsight.

In English law there is a process called judicial review, where the decision of an executive official can be challenged and taken to the courts. It's a fundamental principle of judicial review that the courts do not review the merits of the decision made, but rather the quality of the decision-making process. This principle exists because it is recognised that the courts should not second guess, with the benefit of hindsight, a decision made "on the ground" in the midst of an ongoing situation. It is deemed that those closest to the decision are best placed to make it as they have the greatest appreciation for the realities of the situation. So long as they make the decision properly, the decision cannot be challenged.

I feel like a good number of HP commentators could take the principles of judicial review to heart when second guessing Dumbledore's decisions a) with the benefit of hindsight and b) without knowing what Dumbledore knows in terms of the details of the political situation or the capabilities of magic. Especially on point b, a lot of people seem intent on deliberately interpreting ambiguous aspects of the HP world so as to make Dumbledore look as bad as possible, even to the extent of ignoring a likely logical deduction which would be favourable to Dumbledore, preferring instead to deliberately blinker their view of what is heavily implied in canon.
