It's one I read a few years ago, and I can't remember the name. It starts it with Hermione starting an apprenticeship under Madam Pomfrey in her last year at Hogwarts. She ends up having to treat Snape a lot as he's coming back injured from his interactions with Voldemort while he's doing his double agent thing. The two of them get closer. Eventually Snape teaches her occlumency. Also, the end is changed a lot from the way the books end. Snape comes up with a sneaky plan that lets them kill Voldemort without having an all out battle. Snape and Hermione end up married at the end. Lots of smut, but the smuttiness doesn't start till after Hermione comes of age.

I know this isn't the best description, hopefully someone here knows what I'm taking about!

**** If you haven't read it yet, Loten's other long story, "Post Tenebras, Lux", is really good.
