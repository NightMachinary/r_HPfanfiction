I'd love to see something like this when just after Harry gets there Mr black joins him so even harry doesn't completly understand what's going on .Or just Mr Black in the Marvel universe , that could be pretty nice too .


** linkffn(terminal justice by overkill aka irrational intelligence) is mr black in the marvel universe.

Its kind of a boring story, and not much stands out in it to me as particularly funny, but its there all the same.

  The unofficial fourth of the Make a Wish series by Rorschach's Blot, it was originally written by Overkill aka Irrational Intelligence and removed for some reason. EDIT: Have separated the chapters now.
