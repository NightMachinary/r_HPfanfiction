I remember that they spent a holiday at dumbledores place, and that harry convinces dumbledore to reignite his relationship with grindlewald, and Riddle lost a toe at the orphanage, but repressed the memory for a while. I think its also later HP/TMR, and dumbledore uses a localised time rewind after a friendly duel gets out of hand at albus' place between Grindlewald and Potter.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.
