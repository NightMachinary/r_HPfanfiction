  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

****** Interesting I was thinking more that harry would pick up that philosophy based on how albus treats him (raising to go do a death walk) but instead of being mad he just gets it and becomes equally if not more so utilitarian minded
