** Oho, Bellatrix was obsessed with him before what would she do if she met him when he was considered hot? I guess though after she confirmed that he was the real Dark lord she would serve him and try to prevent him from ever being defeated by Harry Potter. If he was a teen I guess Voldemort would actually be impressed by her since she is actually a super capable mage
