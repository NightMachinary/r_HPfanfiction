Something that I've been working on is chapter structuring.

What I mean by that is actually taking an effort to write a chapter so that it's closed ended. Since I almost exclusively write novel-length stories, my chapters have a sort of rambling feel to them sometimes. There are tangents that seem out of place I'm guilty of throwing in other POV's that could have been better served in another area.

As easy as it is to think of a chapter with a beginning/middle/end, it sometimes gets in the way of expanding on the larger story. Falling into the trap of simply pushing the story sequentially has been a bad habit of mine. Regardless, I've been working on having a structure to my chapters so that they can be read individually instead of having to combine several to understand what's going on in the plot.

Anyone else have some tips or thoughts about chapter structuring?


** Maybe check into the [[http://chandlerbaker.com/2011/01/31/cheat-sheet-7-point-story-structure/][seven point plot structure]]? It's meant to be used to outline entire stories, but I find it helps with making chapters self-contained while also feeling fulfilled.

** Early on I decided not to default on naming chapters 'Chapter One', 'Chapter Two', etc., instead having a chapter have it's own theme. During the planning, if I found that some related activity might fit within a chapter's theme, I might try and rearrange the timing of events so that their recounting would fit together. In several cases this ended up working better than if I'd left the events to occur as originally planned, and in some cases changed how important a character became in the later story.

A pitfall I've run into is where an event /has/ to happen at a point when the rest of the chapter is on a different vibe. At times I would have to rethink the plan, but it typically added to story rather than detract. Aside from that, I find that you have to make potpourri chapters to collect a mess of unrelated but necessary plot elements, usually just when approaching a major conflict- it helps if the messy chapter is quickly forgotten (style-wise) by the awesomeness of the big event chapter.
