I've written three stories for Harry Potter. One features Harry being raised by muggles to be a soldier and a hero, and Harry is currently twelve. Sometimes I get questions like "are you going to strap an AA gun to a dragon" but a lot of the time I get questions like "H/Hg?" or "plz ship with /insert character here/. Let me be clear, at this point, Harry is 12, and learning how to be a leader and fight.

The second is "Harry is bitten by a werewolf and has to face the prejudices that come with that." Sure, sometimes I get interesting questions like "can a werewolf bit destroy a horcrux" or "will the Order of the Phoenix reject Harry because he's dark" but usually its "Harry/Daphne plz" or "Draco/Ginny please." Again, Harry is a kid, not a teen.

The last is a comedy, so whenever I get pairing questions I just say "Harry/Dobby" and hope people leave me alone.

But seriously, this preoccupation with ships, especially for preteens, is a bit worrisome. None of my stories have romance tags. None of my stories (currently) feature any romance. I don't even plan out the romance ahead of time, because I don't want to shoehorn in my personal favorite ship just because I can if it would cause the story to suffer. Has anyone else had this happen or have a reason why they ask about things like this with non-shipping stories?


** First of all, if you have an opportunity to strap an AA gun to a dragon in your story, I recommend you do it.

But more importantly, I've never expected an 11 year old Harry to get paired up with anyone. I'm not sure how much of it is people actually wanting Harry to get paired up at 11, or if it's people wanting to know what pairing will happen in the future. If someone hates H/G, like hates it with a passion, then I think they might want to know if that's what they're putting effort into reading. Either that, or they really love a specific pairing and finding out that's in the story might make them more interested.

Sidenote, could you PM me the links to those stories, cause they both sound amazing.

** I'm writing a trilogy, and the first story takes place when Harry is 6 years old.

Every single person who's read the first story has asked me about eventual pairings. I'm writing about a kid learning to read, and they're asking about his love life. Wtf.

In their defense, maybe they're reading your work but they don't want to get too invested because they're afraid of being disappointed by any eventual pairings?

*** I don't see the issue. Why get invested in a story if you're going to hate the eventual pairing? They aren't asking for 11 or even 6 year old Harry to have an adult sexual relationship /right now/. They are asking "/will/ this be pairing x" so eventually, in the /future/. Also if a romance is age appropriate what's wrong with it? Draco's Boy starts out as children but leads to romance in their teens. Everything in that story is very age appropriate. A large part of Fanfiction is pairings. Get over it.

Other than that: You know what Harry would do with a Bodyguard? Ditch him whenever he really "needs" to get in danger.

For example, take canon CoS. Harry is clearly instructed to "Stay in the common room", but he goes into the CoS to rescue Ginny. Do you really think Harry wouldn't go just because he had a bodyguard? He'd try to save Ginny anyways.

And Harry is rather crafty - a few hours later he frees Dobby, and thus out-slytherins Lucious Malfoy.

******* The sad thing is that fucked up things happen in the world, and with enough desperation and a touch of sociopath-ism [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children][child soldiers]] happen. And I think we can see both in the Potterverse.

#+begin_quote
  In World War II, the youngest member of the United States Military was 12-year-old Calvin Graham.
#+end_quote

In the end it's the decision of the author on how he takes on the world. While it's morally wrong to use child soldiers I find some things in your fics morally wrong, too. One example is the liberal use of Veritaserum in the first few chapters of "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution" - I think this is a huge deal, especially after a while and upon students. If you can't protect the leader from students and have to resort to Veritaserum you have other problems. However, that is your decision and your story, so you can decide that it is that way. Just because something is wrong it doesn't mean you can't write about it.

We actually have a different take on the whole world in Harry Potter, especially on the status of Muggleborns between 1945 and 1970 and 1980-1995 - I think that the purebloods have some advantages, but muggleborn are the ones innovating and getting away with it - which is what made the purebloods angry in the first place (People need a reason to be mad, and seeing someone 'inferior' do well would be enough to mobilize)

Anyways, child soldiers happen in the real world, so I can't see why there can't be an AU where the adults are desperate enough to train Harry. I mean look at how helpless the ministry was when confronted with Voldemort.

And depending on when Harry starts training he'd definitely suck it up, he always considers his life worth less than that of others (See: He goes through the flames in PS, was willing to die for Ginny in CS, goes back to the Dementor Lake in PoA, ...) - he'd definitely be up for it.

That kind of reaction is what you get when you send kids to war - every problem ends up looking like a target. The two only realised how messed up they were when they heard about Neville being asked to run as Minister, and their first thought was "should we kill him?"

I simply find the idea that kids shouldn't kiss, but should train for war fucked up.

I'm sorry to say that I actually didn't read your story to the end. I'm not sure what it is, because it's quality writing, actually has plot and raises moral questions - all of which I usually like, and I recognize you're a talented author in that regard.

** Its true that a large part of the story is completely unrelated to the romance or arrangement or whatever. It should be about what happens next in this scenario thats important.

But, after reading tons of fanfics, people form strong opinions about things, specially characters. So while an author would not want to give the pairing away, or the fic may not be about romance(Harry could be incapable of love after all) but if they don't want to risk committing to a story, reading thousands of words and then finding that a character they detest is a major pairing or a major fixture i the story. I wouldn't want to read, lets say...your first story, and find out 250,000 words in that Harry is paired with Hermione, because I wont be able to continue reading further, which would mean that all the investment i made in the story would be a waste. Because regardless of the excellent premise, that particular issue would be a deal breaker.

Of course the above is why I would imagine a pairing declaration to be important, can't say what goes on in the minds of all the teenage slash shipping fans out there.

Also, for a lot of the Pureblood fics, considering the point that Magical Britain as a whole is described as antiquated and ...ahem...barbaric, it is entirely possible that families arrange marriages for their children for political purposes.

** No, I wouldn't expect it and tbh I wouldn't enjoy reading about a hook up or "romance" between 2 11 year olds. I know times have changed but I was playing manhunt with boys at 11, not kissing them.

That being said, I also don't understand the obsession with pairings. Those who said they'd stop reading a fic if they didn't like the pairing, would you have stopped reading canon if that were the case? That would be insane.

Then again, I read fics for the plot and couldn't care less who is boinking who or even if there is no boinking at all.

If I see a lot of Draco/Harry, Harry/Hermione, or other non-canon pairings, I'll end up not reading the story. Fics rarely stay gen, especially those that cover all seven years, and I don't want to read a fic and become invested if I end up quitting it halfway through when the characters are older. Non-canon ships ruins an otherwise good story for me, even if the story isn't about romance.

So to sum it up: I don't want to see Harry (or his friends) paired with anyone at 11, but I want to know who he'll end up with so I know whether to bother with the fic or not.

** Personally, there are some fairly popular pairings that I just can't stand. If your story currently is taking place when they're 11 years old, then there's a very good chance that it will run through all the Hogwarts years and span hundreds of thousands of words. I'd rather not read 300k words only to be massively disappointed by your choice of pairing come 5th year. If you're going to have /any/ romance in your story then I think it's good manners to reveal the pairing at the start.

So I can't declare that at the start, because if I just shoe horn that in after adding a lot of character development that would indicate otherwise, I'd be sabotaging my own story.

**** That's fine, but I'm not going to read such a story unless it comes with amazing reviews. And judging from the fact that this thread even exists I suspect that there are a lot of people who are of the same mind as I.

***** In response, I would simply say: Don't read unfinished stories if you might not like the way the plot develops.

You also have no right to expect an author to ship a certain way, or at all in fact. You have the right to not read any story you want, and on FFN there are 800k other stories to choose from (including crossovers).

Authors owe you nothing. It is good manners to take what you're offered, and if you don't enjoy it, don't ask for it again. I liken it to eating greenbean casserole at Thanksgiving. No one WANTS it, but some relative seems to make it every year.

** So a couple things to point out.

--------------

OK so... scientifically:

Puberty begins for most kids between 9 and 12. Masturbation begins, and group dating often starts between 11-12 with even some sexual sharing happening (kissing, petting, body exploration). By 13, many begin to pair off (first boyfriends/girlfriends). By 14-15 sexual intercourse comes into play, or at least oral or manual stimulation. So...while 11 and 12 might seem a bit young, some kids are even sexually active by that age (at least in terms of manual acts). 11-15 is an era of HUGE change in terms of sexual awakening.

This information is not interpretation or invention, but direct scientifically proven information based on data about the human body, physiological studies, and polls/interviews.

It does of course depend upon how quickly the child is maturing, but it has been shown that children in a dangerous world (such as one filled with war) are actually MORE LIKELY to be pairing up and sexually active.

--------------

In terms of the Harry Potter universe itself, I want to point out a couple things.

First... I always go back to the point that its implied the Wizarding world is sorta stuck somewhat in the past, and a bit old fashioned and that marriages, pairings, and romances began at MUCH younger ages in the past. So it would kinda make sense already for pairing up to be encouraged, or at least accepted.

Secondly, the wizarding world in HP has been asailed by several dark lords and wars. It would make sense if children felt the need to find significant others earlier and earlier, based upon such an environment.

Finally, the actual magical aspect of the world make romances or sex much more interesting. Think about things such as protective charms and similar things, likely meaning that having a child early on is much less likely, and the overall experience being much more fluid and easy. Or the ability to bond oneself with another. Or love potions. And so on and so fourth.

--------------

At the end of the day, Harry Potter isnt the real world, and the objections to early pairings or interest in pairings are somewhat silly, especially because even IN the real world, that is an age of sexual awakening and pairing up.

But to each author their own, and if the author doesnt want to pair them up, or is waiting on pairings thats perfectly fine. Just expect the idea to be debated and asked about because people get curious and everyone has their pairing preferences.

I know I have read amazing stories and then been dismayed at the eventual pairings and it somewhat ruined the complete experience for me, and made me wish i knew the eventual pairing/s from the start so i wouldnt get my hopes up.

One of these stories is the Harry Potter Series by JK Rowling.

Just saying...

**** Yea thats a very close minded view. A FICTION story is a FICTION story, and plenty of best sellers have teenage romance in them (even as young as 12-13). Plenty of movies deal with this. Plenty of TV shows have it. Oh and lets not forget its COMMON IN REAL LIFE.

Are you that closed off from the world that you cant see that?

No one is saying it has to be graphic or anything. Thats up to the author. But if you are an author (not saying you personally) and are ignoring any sort of pairings or romance in your story because of the excuse that the kids are underage... well lets just say thats the stupidest excuse ever.

**** Yeah, the key thing here is that the reviewers aren't asking for anything in terms of sexual relationships or even romance at this point. All they want is an assurance that a certain pairing will happen in the future, at the discretion of the author. That's not too much to ask for, and it's good to be planning that far in advance (assuming you do intend romance to blossom at all).

Is writing about sexually active kids bad? Well, that's subject to debate, but generally speaking, as long as there is no actual intercourse below a reasonable age (~ 16/17 or so seems to be the line for most people), you shouldn't run into much trouble. Go over that and yeah, you can get the fic removed. That's not, however, what the people appear to be asking for.

** As others have said people want to see a certain pairing, usually later in the stories. At least for me I always envision the character older anyway, since no story I've seen has an accurate 11 year old. They either have them act like a 6 year old, and a 14 year old.
