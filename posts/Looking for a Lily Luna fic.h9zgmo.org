:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi!

I'm looking for this Lily Luna Potter fic that I read ages ago where she goes back in time to the Marauders era. She's only like 3 or 4ish, I think, and it featured pretty much all of the post canon Weasley/Potter families.

From memory, I don't think it was completed at the time I read it but I recently remembered it and thought I would check to see if it was ever finished.

Does anyone know what this fic is? Thank you!

*Edit: I found it, it was this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305046/1/The-Loss-of-Lily-Luna-Potter]]. I asked around my Tumblr friends too and they found it, unfortunately it hasn't been updated though.*


** The only Lily Luna [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8624601/1/The-Time-Spiral][/fic/]] I know of is that one where a teenage or young adult Lily Luna goes back in time and falls in love with Sirius.

** Not to self promote but could this be my (very) old time travel fic. She goes back to Harry's 6th?? Year.

Edit: it's abandoned. I remember I did have an ending somewhat planned out then ffn stole my account.

  Time travel. Harry's baby girl got him wrapped around her finger. On Teddy's 13th birthday, a bit of accidental magic from 3 year old Lily wound the Potter kids sometime else. How can Harry get them back? How far will he go to see his kids again? R&R!

*** Thank you! I might check it out regardless although I had a quick read of the first chapter and I don't think it's the one I was thinking about.

**** Ah too bad.

Although full disclosure, I wrote this when I was 14/15 so I'm not sure how cringey it is!
