I've read both many a time, but only made the connection now after seeing a post on [[/r/writingprompts]]. Does such a thing exist?


** My favourite is linkffn(Awaken Sleeper). Unfortunately it's seemingly abandoned. A lot of people rec linkffn(Denarien Renegade) and its sequels. The series is pretty good, but Harry's attitude (him constant being a prick to everyone around him) does eventually get very tiring and irritating.

*** While I really like the Renegade series, Harry's personality here is essentially a shittier version of a combination of Hat's and Harry's personalities from The Lie I've Lived.

The stuff he said in the first story was pretty funny. It got boring after that. Still highly recommend it though.

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.

****** Well yeah I said it was good, but Harry's attitude and how it never changes to anyone in the span of years get's kinda annoying. That doesn't mean it's not a well written series in other aspects.

******* Oh I actually respectfully disagree that it doesn't change. I think that, yeah, he's still crass, but what he /e:/ means with what he says changes for sure. Take for example [[/spoiler][the way he uses the word brat. In the beginning it's in annoyance, and later it's with affection of a kind.]] He's never really overtly nice, but that doesn't mean the way he feels about things doesn't evolve throughout the story.
