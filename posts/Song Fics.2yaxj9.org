As a writer, some of my inspiration comes from song lyrics. I don't, however, write song fics in the way that most authors do. I simply assume the reader knows the song or can Google the lyrics, and just tell the story like any other fic. IMO, putting the lyrics in between paragraphs is rarely done tastefully and really jolts me out of the story when I'm reading.

With that said, here's my request: Are there any well written song fics out there that do not share the lyrics or at least put them at the beginning or very end? Bonus points if it's slash or femslash, but not required.


** I've actually been writing a few like this. Songs often tell well thought out and meaningful stories that are vague enough to adapt to a fanfic without the awkwardness of breaking the story up with lyrics in the middle of them. None of the ones I've written are published though because of the extreme lack of polish.

*** If you ever polish and publish I'd love to check them out!
