Is there any story where the entire point of it is that Harry is literally a Self-insert of the author, aka an 11 year old boy with the memories of an adult man, including memories of reading the books? Can't be any more crazy than most time travel fics.


** There was one where Harry is a reincarnation of Regulus Black, but it's abandoned.

  What would I do if I woke up as Harry Potter on the day he receives his Hogwarts letter? What changes would I make? What areas of the "Wizarding World" would I explore that the books never showed us? What if Ron was possessed by Tom Riddle's diary instead of Ginny? What friends would I make? What new characters would I meet? WORK IN PROGRESS, 7 Years Planned

  This is the story of a person who died. It's OK though, he got better. Through some kind of cosmic coincidence he wakes up in the body of an 11 year old Severus Snape. What would someone in his position, with knowledge of the future and what can be accomplished with magic do? Liberally abuse it and live like a king of course! Snape!Harem SI-OC as Snape NO SLASH.

*** Looks nice, although I don't really know how your character is so comfortable being in the same castle as Voldemort and Pettigrew. I'd probably have sent an anonymous letter to Mad-Eye over the holidays to get him to investigate the Weasleys harboring an illegal Animagus to get Sirius free ASAP. Access to Grimmauld place is kinda essential since there's a Horcrux there.

**** Well, my character is pretty paranoid about revealing that he is essentially possessing the Boy-Who-Lived, and he doesn't want to end up in Azkaban or having tests run on him in the Department of Mysteries. He also doesn't want to make too many significant moves too early on, or his foreknowledge won't be useful.

​

An anonymous letter to Mad-Eye isn't a terrible idea, but what are the odds he'll follow up on a pretty outlandish anonymous tip? Non-zero, but also probably not 100%. If Aurors are anything like Muggle law enforcement they get tons of whacky anonymous tips. Even if Mad-Eye went for it, Pettigrew could escape - he has proven himself to be quite slippery. Which could lead to Sirius remaining in Azkaban for good.

​

My plan was for the really significant divergences (with regard to the Voldemort plotline) to start in second year, because my character is definitely not eager to fight a Basilisk with a sword.
