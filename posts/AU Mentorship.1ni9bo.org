I just read Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived. I thought it was awesome and am wondering if there are more stories where Harry after the war travels to an AU where he finds and mentors himself. Basically, stories like Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived.


** Where can I find that story, the title is appealing.
