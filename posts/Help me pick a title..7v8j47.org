Titles either come to me very easily and instantaneously or they are very difficult. I want to write a One-Shot about what happens when/after Snape dies, from Snape's pov and a small glimpse of his afterlife.

I have a few titles but I'm not sure. Some options are:

My regrets follow me beyond the grave

Never-ever land

Bellflower and Cypress (Due to the meanings of the flowers, Bellflower is Unwavering love and Cypress is despair, sorrow, death)


** I would write it first. You might even find it's a different story to the one you envisage. You'll likely find a suitable phrase or word jumps out from your prose.
