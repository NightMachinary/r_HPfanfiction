** Draco was raised under a specific mindset. Raised to a particular set of standards. Raised to hold his head high under any circumstance.

But he could not help but flinch under the eyes of every person, portrait and ghost that stared at him as he followed Professor--no, *Headmistress*--McGonagall to the--*her*--office.

She, at least, did not look at him as if she wanted to wring his neck. She thought about it, no doubt, wished for it, but she had too much composure to allow him to see her innermost thoughts.

She was like his mother in that regard. Why had he never liked her when he went to Hogwarts?

"Godric," she said at a statue, which sank into the wall to reveal a set of stairs leading upwards.

Ah, right. Gryffindor.

She stepped aside, pinning him down with an impassive stare. "I shall not disturb you, Mr. Malfoy, but do bear in mind that I shall need my office back before sundown."

He nodded, beating down the urge to wet his lips. "I am aware. Thank you." She stared at him for another moment, before turning away, green cloak billowing after her.

Draco kept his eyes on the staircase, waiting. What...What the hell was he doing? He'd burned all his bridges. He wasn't wanted here. He could feel it. Not just from the people and things that inhabited the castle. Even the castle itself felt cold to him. Unwelcoming. Accusatory. So why--

Acid green light lit up in his mind. A kindly old man that only ever wanted to help others crashing into the ground below.

Gulping down a needy gasp, Draco hurried up the stairs.

Unlike what Potter--*Harry*--and his followers--*friends*--believed, Draco was a model student. He'd never spent much time in the Headmaster's--*Headmistress's*--office. So he didn't really have any expectations when he crossed the threshold.

But he could still see. The place was in disarray. The only parts of the room that were familiar to him was the lone bookshelf at the far end of the room halfway filled with the deceased Profess--*Headmaster*--Snape's favorite books from his old office. Everything else was...unknown to him.

"Ah, Mr. Malfoy." Draco jumped at the old and wizened voice, turning around to see that which he'd forced himself to come back for.

Hanging on the wall to his left, a sizable portrait of Headmaster Dumbledore smiled down at him. As if nothing was wrong. As if Draco hadn't--

"Are you well?" the portrait leaned forward, and Draco willed himself to stay still (it couldn't touch him. Couldn't plead with him to stop what he was doing). "You look rather pale."

He gulped, "I-I am fine, H-Headmaster."

The portrait smiled, "Good. And your family? Minvera's been appraising me as to the well-being of my former students, but she is only one woman, and is so terribly busy now."

Draco held back a sob--was he doing this on purpose? His own twisted form of vengeance? But, ever dutiful, Draco answered, "They are well. My mother is well. My father..." he trailed off, clenching his fists. Though they'd escaped Hogwarts unscathed thanks to Potter--*Harry*--the Wizarding World was not so quick as to forget his father's crimes (or his own). "...He is adjusting." He gulped, feeling the need to defend his parents, "But they are together. Happy."

"I am glad," the portrait smiled. "Your parents made a lovely couple during their final years at Hogwarts. It does me well to know their love still endures after these trying times." Draco waited for the former Headmaster to say something else, but he was content to just smile down at him.

Finally, it became too much. "How can you do it?!" he cried.

Dumbledore blinked, "Do what, Mr. Malfoy?"

"This!" he hissed, stepping forward and swiping at the air, "This..this farce?! How can you act so kind?! Act like you care after I...I..."

"Mr. Malfoy," the Headmaster whispered, "why have you come here?"

Draco sobbed, curling in on himself. "I *killed* you!"

"As I recall, that was Professor Sna--"

"He wouldn't have done it if not for me!" Draco cut him off, tears streaming down his face. "I bore the Dark Mark, I fixed the Vanishing Cabinet, I cursed innocent students, I led an army to destroy Hogwarts!" The Headmaster made to say something, but he barreled on, "I might not have cast the curse, but I as good as kill you! I see it clear enough in my dreams! My nightmares!" He fell down onto his knees, clutching his head. His fault.

"Mr. Malfoy."

It was all his fault.

"Mr. Malfoy."

Everything that happened.

"Mr. Malfoy."

All that blood was on his hands.

"Draco!"

He lifted his head up at the shout. But instead of righteous, just anger marring the Headmaster's face, he saw sadness, pity and...understanding.

"Oh, you poor boy." The Headmaster shook his head, "Well no, you're not a boy, are you? You're a man. Voldemort," Draco flinched, "did many terrible things, but he did not mark children. He saw no need in them. No, you were a man when you joined him."

Draco nodded jerkily, shivers running down his spine.

"Yes, you do bear blame for what has happened." Draco gasped, nodding once more. "But not all."

"What, no! No, it's all my--"

"I am not absolving you," Headmaster Dumbledore's stern voice froze him in place, "I cannot." Draco suspected as much, but he needed to hear it. "But I don't believe you are beyond redemption."

The young man stilled.

"You don't believe me. You think that your crime is so terrible, so horrific, that it shall haunt you forever." The Headmaster nodded, "Perhaps it shall. The consequences, I imagine, are ever present." They were. God above they were. "But you were just a small part of that dreadful equation. There were things beyond your grasp, beyond your understanding. Things you could not hope to understand, things you were thrust into with no care for your well-being. But there is one thing, I think, that speaks of a brighter future."

"What?" Draco begged.

"Guilt," the Headmaster intoned. "The knowledge that, in the end, you were wrong, and the consequences were not worth their price."

Draco was silent for a long moment. Then, he laughed. A bitter, mockery of laughter. "'Guilt'?" he sneered, "*That's* your parting wisdom? I have guilt?!"

"Yes," the Headmaster said, unimpressed with his rage. "Otherwise, why come to me, the portrait of the man you killed?" Draco froze once more, his jeers dying on his lips.

The Headmaster sighed, lines being drawn on his face. "You are still young, Draco. There is still hope for you. Do not wallow in your guilt. Embrace it! Let it guide you to a more just path."

Draco sniffled, eyes pleading as he said, "I..I don't know if I can."

The Headmaster smiled once more--a genial, accepting thing--and said, "We never do. And yet, we must."

** "Ah, there you are Mr.Malfoy." He looked up from the from floor immersed in his own thoughts and stood up from the small bench near the great hall. He bowed shortly to Headmistress McGonagall - that would need some getting used to. "Thank you Headmistress for allowing my request."

She eyed him like a cat would look at a rather interesting mouse - well some things would never change.

"Indeed, and what a strange request it is." Her eyes meet his and it seemed to him as if she was trying to discern a deeper reason for his request. It was an intense stare, yet he thought about this particular day for nigh a year so he did his best to keep eye contact without flinching - a more difficult task than he had thought.

Finally after what felt like an eternity she clicked her tounge and turned around "If you would follow me Mr.Malfoy, I do have a board meeting in 15 minutes so we best be on our way."

He followed her quickly his thoughts again turning again to the upcoming task. He thought about it for so long and now it was almost there, it seemed surreal. The regret, the shame, the realization it haunted him almost every minute and then seeped into his dreams like thick heavy tar suffocating him slowly but surely.

So caught up in his own train of thought he missed McGonagall's voice as he followed her up the stairs to the Headmistress office.

"I'm sorry Headmistress I must have been lost in thought."

"Quiet" She threw him a quick glance.

"I was saying that I nearly didn't accept your request if it weren't for Mr.Potter's insitance."

That did threw him of the loop so without really wanting to his suprise did escape him. "Potter's insitance?"

McGonagall threw a another ponited look a him "Yes, Mr.Potter was very much favorable of your request when I mentioned it to him recently."

She sniffed "He said few people get the chance to talk to those whose death lays like a heavy burden upon us and it is not our right to judge who is allowed that opportunity and who isn't"

He was suprised - no shocked would be the better word. He a had little contact with Potter unsuprisingly giving his family statues and history and Potter being - rightly - hailed as the defeater of the Dark Lord. He had always mocked his saving people thing, his rushing head first into the most dangerous situation but back then in that horrible fateful night he saved him from that room becoming his grave.

He had understood since than that Potter wasn't all that stupid, that he had known most of the time what kind of danger had layn in front of him yet he still did it not out of pride or false bravado but simply because it was the right thing to do instead of the essy one.

Again McGonagall's voice brought him out of his trance and just like that he was faced with a heavy oak door and a strict looking McGonagall. "As I was saying, you have until sunset as I expect the meeting with the board to last long."

With that she turned around and left him before the still closed door. He breathed in and out and steeled himself for whats to come.

He opened the door and went inside, marvelling in quite admiration at the office in front of him. He had never really been in here for long and at the times he was busy looking at the floor.

"Quite the sight isn't it." said a smooth voice behind the large desk and for a moment he almost expected Dumbledore to sit right there at his desk vut as he looked towards the source of the voice it was not so.

The potrait of Dumbledore.looked at him, his eyes still having the kind of mirth in them as in life. He swallowed - hard - no matter how much he had prepared himself for today nothing was like being here right now looking the man inthe eyes whose death you were responsible for.

He wanted to say something but his voice betrayed him and nothing but a croak escaped him.

Dumbledore seemed to ignore his guest discomfort and continued "I would offer you a lemon sherbet but Minerva does not seem to be as fond of them as I was - alas such is the passing of time."

He could do nothing but simply look at Dumbeldore, completly frozen. This was nothing as he expected or maybe the blow would only come when he didn't expect it. This was so much harder than he had thought.

Dumbledores expression softend "I know why you are here Mr.Malfoy, Harry mentioned your request the last time we were talking. To think of such a meeting is one thing but to see through it, is another."

"How you can you be so calm?" he suddenly shouted his emotions overtaking him.

Dumbledore simply eyed him calmly which enerved him even more. "How you can you just sit there and talk with me when it was I who...who...ho... " his voice broke the end clenching his fist to keep the tremors from shaking up his whole body.

When he was able to look up the only difference in Dumbledore was the slight sadness which had crept into his eyes.

"When it was you who killed me? I know you believe because of the promise Severus did you were the cause for my passing, yet my fate was decided long before you were marked as a punishment for your family, by ghost from my past nontheless. It was I who was responsible for my death and no one else."

Dumbeldore looked at Draco clenching and unclenching his hands, while small tremors shook him. How that reminded him of someone else in this office who had also believed to be the cause of someones passing even if it was not so.

"Yet you already heard something similar to this so what is it that you seek Mr.Malfoy?"

He didn't want to but the burning question which consumed him just burst out of him. "Then why does it still feel like I am the cause for your death for the death of all that people who died because you were felled. Why does it feel like this guilt is burning a hole in my heart and there is nothing to fill it and nothing to put it out. Why do I get to live while others don't"

It just all rambled out of him with all that desperation that had built up over all this time.

Now Dumbledores eyes were full of sadness but it was a far away look.

"I can not answer these questions for you my boy." and he almost wanted to challenge that before Dumbledore amodished him with a look "because these things take, they need journey and transformation. Your answers will not be clean cut, they will be the process of your life."

Dumbledore stoped shortly and looked at him with such an understanding that Draco would not have thought possible.

"You read the book about me as a lot of otgers I presume, so you know I was very close with Grindeleald. After I had defeated him the guilt and regret I felt were overwhelming. Even later in life I thought how horrible it is to feel such shame,regret and guilt for loving someone with all your heart who destroyed the lifes of so many. It took many,many years till I came to a certain kind of peace with myself although I've never really came over my regret of Adrianna. Yet it was also my driving force to do better, to do all that I could that others would not have to feel the pain I had felt.

And I did mistakes, many of them. The likes of which were Harry ever to tell them all would make Mrs.Skeeters book quite harmless in comparison."

Dumbledore's answer shook him right to the core, he would have never expected such a personal insight from him.

"But how do I do this, how can I be sure to do better?"

*** "You learn from the past, from the mistakes that both sides did and where they came from. People distanced themselve from Tom thats why they first called him fearfully Voldemort and later on You-Know-Who. To truly understand Tom or Gellert one has to open oneselve to the question:What would need to happen that I would be capable of these horrible things? The answer to that can be quite chilling, how little sometimes would need to happen so we feel justified in doing all sorts of horrible things. Darkness is in everyone of us but it is not in our interest to ignore it - when doing so often leads us into it - but the be aware of it. To integrate that which we do not wamt to acknowledge. Being able to do cruel things and yet never to indulge it takes strenght beyond measure."

He could have never imagined the way this meeting went. "You have given me much to think on Professor...would it perhaps be possible to visit you again?" he finally asked looking up into the eyes of his old Headmaster.

"Certainly my boy, certainly."
