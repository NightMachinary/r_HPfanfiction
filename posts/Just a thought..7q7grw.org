I know Rita Skeeter was the main journalist for the Tournament in canon but do you think there could be room for a rival journalist who actually tells the truth?


** I think the journalism in the world of Harry Potter is massively unexplored.

Go nuts.

** A truth seeking journalist would have to have an appropriate name. Some suggestions:

Ferrita Owte

Verita Teller

Luna Lovegood

Finder Factus

Schola Lee Scources

Vera Fiable

Don't forget the over the top editor, Saffron Scrivener.

*** Nice job sneaking Luna's name in there. I've actually seen a few good fics where she grows up to be a reporter instead of a zoologist. "Crack Investigator" by Luan Mao is the first one that leaps to mind.

**** Luna Lovegood solving "mysteries" at hogwarts would be a hilarious crack fic. I'm pretty sure most of her investigations would end with everyone either thoroughly confused or lifelong Quibbler subscribers.

***** I'm not sure I've ever seen that, but now I want to! A teenaged mystery-solving Xeno would also be pretty fun.

**** Please, this is the Harry Potter universe. The only reason they became a journalist in the first place was because they had a name that was too perfect NOT to be on a byline.
