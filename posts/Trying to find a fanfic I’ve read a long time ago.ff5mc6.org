Hello this is my first time posting on reddit. I was hoping someone knew the name of a fanfic I read awhile back. The story centered around lily surviving the attack but James does not, and it was either Remus or Sirius(pretty sure I spelled his name wrong) taking lily to an American healer where she learns that she is slytherin heir along with Harry. Harry get his horcrux removed by the goblins, lily suspects dumbledore is a manipulator and doesn't take Harry to hogwarts till he is of age and there is a marriage contract between Harry and daphne greengrass. I know this is a bit of a stretch to find but this is all I could remember. If anyone is able to find this I will be grateful for their help.
