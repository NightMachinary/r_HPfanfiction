I had this idea for a fic of Dumbledore getting future Harry's memories in 1981, due to some death magic or due to Dumbledore actually being at Godric's Hollow on Halloween.

Skip to the last meeting of the Order of the Phoenix. Sirius is free (due to the memories) and Pettigrew is either in Azkaban or on the run. At the final meeting, Dumbledore says: ‚ÄúSee you in fourteen years.‚Äù Nobody reacts, thinking it is one of the Headmaster's eccentricities.

Skip fourteen years, after GOBLET, (if the time line has remained largely unchanged) and ‚Äúthe old crowd‚Äù reconvenes once more.

During that first meeting somebody (either Moody, Diggle or someone) remembers Dumbledore saying ‚Äúsee you in 14 years‚Äù and demand an explanation.

*I don't known if you could write a whole fic around this, or a series of one-shots, but it got stuck in my head. If someone else would like write it, you're welcome to.*


** This is a great idea! I'd totally be down to write it but uh... I've got ten fics in the way. So see /you/ in fourteen years? üòÇ

***** Pettigrew could be either in Azkaban (escapes 3rd year?) or on the run. I suppose this Animagus form would be known by the Aurors.

********** Right... but your post says 14 years later. If Dumbledore gets knowledge of the future, and acts on it, as he undoubtedly would, then the time Voldemort comes back would also undoubtedly change. So AU or not, it's fairly unlikely Dumbledore would be able to predict the year Voldemort would come back.

*********** Could be. There's also a strong case to be made for Dumbledore wanting the timeline to stay reasonably the same, or else all his knowledge will become useless.

/Never./

But if Pettigrew is already on the run, wouldn't he find Voldemort sooner? He took less than a month to find him after PoA, after all. What do you have to say about /that,/ the_long_way_round25?!
