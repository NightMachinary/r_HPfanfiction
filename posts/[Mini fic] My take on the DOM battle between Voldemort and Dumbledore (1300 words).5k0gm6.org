Hey,

I've been slowly getting my feet wet with writing fanfiction by writing random scenes as they pop into my head and I'm rather curious to see what people think of my latest one. All feedback is more than welcome, so please let me know both what you think and any advice you have both in terms of this fic but also general writing style.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJyjWJ5L19oQBH1POElFloTLHkBhc1pkSImFP-wztL8/edit?usp=sharing][Link to fic]]

Thanks!

** From what I'm up to. I don't think Tom would ever call Albus Dumbledore Albus. It's too formal and indicates friendliness.

Two, don't use the incantation 'Fiendfyre'. It seems out of place. It would have been better to just describe the spell and state that a large mass of fiery, entwining serpents poured out from Voldemort's wand.

I'll update as I go.

*** Thanks for reading !

Mmmm I've realised that my Voldemort is OOC almost to the extreme (in other short stuff I've written this is more extreme), but frankly I don't find it interesting at all to write a madman that shrieks abuse when it's far more interesting, to me at least, to write him as he could have been. An incredibly smart, charismatic man that has a dark personality and viewpoint.

My point being with all that is that a person of that character would refer to Dumbledore as Albus, at least in my mind anyway.

Hope that explains a bit of my thought process.

As for the whole Fiendfyre thing, I rather enjoyed the fact he answered Dumbledore's question of stepping up the game with an incantation and it's one I knew everyone would know. Though I definitely agree I missed a step by not describing the flames using animals, especially as I go on to do the same with Dumbledore's water spell.

That isn't canon Voldemort. That is a rather shitty fanon take on him.

***** Ah true, it's been far too long since I've read canon and I guess fanon has poisoned my idea of what he originally was

**** :)

Voldemort is actually rather hard to write and keep him competent and the same as canon. I had the issue when I was attempting a one-shot of him awhile ago.

I think we're gonna butt heads here! x) I just can't see Voldemort walking up to Dumbledore and greeting him on a first-name basis. He may actually do it in canon, but I cannot remember it so I may be wrong.

The reason why I suggested hiding the actual spell and showing what happened was that the incantation for 'Fiendfyre' isn't actually 'Fiendfyre.' It's jarring when I see it used.

I did like like what you did with the giant elemental creatures. I do feel bad because I'm point out bad things instead of the good, but I did enjoy your small fic and I can't wait to see if you do anything else with it. :)

***** Ahha no that's what I asked for when I posted it ! If I wanted sweeping praise I would have given it to my mother :P

Oh is it not? Honestly didn't know that, I'll remember that for future works.

I think with relation to the Voldemort / Dumbledore stuff, I was just making him a villain that would act that way rather than staying true to his character. I had an idea about how I wanted the interaction to go and I made him fit. Whether that's true to the character or not isn't something that truly crossed my mind.

I seriously doubt I'll take this further due to the fact that as soon as I start trying to imagine a story past one scene, I panic and nothing comes to mind at all... :P

Thanks for your points and time <3

****** Haha! :)

Again, it could just be me that finds it jarring, but that's the joy of writing for thousands of different people -- someone is bound to disagree.

I do understand what you're trying to do. You're trying to move him back to how he supposedly was during his peak. I know he was made incompetent by J.K on purpose so that the story would have a happy ending.

I'm all for making him a competent enemy. I love fics that push up his power and knowledge and have him a serious threat.

You'd be surprised! I've started a few fics from a single idea.

** Looks pretty good. Good job.

P.S. I just wanted to give a quick message to make sure you know what you're doing. You do realise that people can easily backtrace your Google account if you share a Google doc written by you with them right? You're better off taking screenshots of pages and posting them on Imgur. Sorry if you're already aware of this, but I've had friends get harrassed by their readers who found out their real Google account name, which isn't something I'd wish on anyone.

*** Definitely true and if I write anything much longer I'd have to cut down on that, but at the moment I'm trying to find my own style of how I like to write and so I'm going 110% in the hope of finding something that fits.

I'm also a rather melodramatic person it has to be said
