So, I've been looking for fics like this everywhere. The thing is, I'm not really great at finding things. So, this is my plea to all the good-hearted citizens of [[/r/harrypotterfanfiction][r/harrypotterfanfiction]]. Please please please help me!

I really want a fic where Hermione is this Dark, evil queen who's borderline obssessed with Harry, who is this innocent little being/an auror. She tries to capture him, etc. etc. and so on and so forth. I accept one-shots too!

Something like this has to be out there! I mean, I'm trying and everything, but most fics feature Harry being the evil one, or both of them being evil. Others have GinnyxHarry.

You all are much more experienced with these sites. Please help me out. Thank you for any and all suggestions/upvotes. If any author out there likes this idea, please write about it, and send me the link. That would be very appreciated. I know many people hate Harmony, but please don't downvote. I need people to see this!
