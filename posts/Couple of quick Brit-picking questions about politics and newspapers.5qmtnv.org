1. I have Lupin living almost entirely in the Muggle world after being outed. What newspaper do you think he'd read? I'm guessing he's probably not a /Sun/ man, but beyond that I'm not sure. Is it possible he'd pick up one for the news and one (or as many as he can afford) for the job ads?

2. Which political parties would the Dursleys and Snape support, and what would their general opinions on Thatcher be? (Assuming Snape had any interest in Muggle politics.) I don't need anything in depth, but I have a brief mention of it and I need to make sure I'm not wildly incorrect on where they would vote.

(If I was any kind of proper Englishman I could probably answer these myself, but I don't read the papers [nor does anyone in my immediate family, and they never have] and politics always tends to go over my head.)


** I would think Remus would read the Guardian or the Independent (from 86 onwards). I don't really have any evidence for him being left wing beyond it seems to fit his mild personality and his type of poverty. If he's looking for jobs he would probably pick up others like the times and the telegraph as well.

Rowling has actually given us a lot of hints about the Dursleys and their political beliefs. They love the daily mail and Top Gear, they seem to support capital punishment, and they live in suburban Surrey. They are total Tories. In later years I imagine they went over to UKIP. They would adore Thatcher.

I don't think Snape would care that much about Muggle politics, and I'm finding him hard to place. My gut says he's a conservative but he did grow up in a labour heartland. I can't decide if he would like Thatcher. I've never been good at his character :(

*** That matches most of what I was thinking. I was leaning Labour for Snape, mostly in a "I hate them all, but I hate these guys the least" way. I figure his dad probably got fucked over by Thatcher's union laws, which made their home life worse, and despite Snape's general anti-Muggle attitudes he probably hates some more than others, and would be pro-Labour just because of how difficult the Toris made his childhood.

Also: Top Gear is indicative of our politics? I had no idea.

**** Yeah that would make perfect sense to me.

In the UK Top Gear (and Jeremy clarkson) has a stereotype of appealing to right-wing people due to it's sometimes offensive humour and emphasis on over priced cars. This is not always the case - I like earlier top gear seasons and I am left wing - but it's a short cut to saying someone is like Jeremy clarkson basically. Rowling said that Vernon loved top gear in response to people demanding that they bring back clarkson despite him, you know, assaulting someone.

In Scotland, even the rich blamed the Tories, and voted Lib Dem instead. There have been practically no Tory MPs here since.

Regarding Snape, I just don't see him as a Labour supporter - more like he hates Thatcher, but doesn't support anyone and just moans about them all.

******* I appreciate that, but my experience in the north east, even in so-called Labour safe seats, is that there are a lot of people there who, even if they don't vote Tory, continue to blame the unions. I was rather horrified to work with the daughter of a miner who admired Thatcher. The Scottish are clearly more principled, and good on them.

I get that a few people voted Lib Dem in the 90s, but as far as I'm aware they only got something like 20% of the vote share. The race was always between Labour and Conservative in the rest of the UK, which is where the characters OP is talking about lived.

******** Oh I appreciate that the political scene is totally different south of the border, but I was just clarifying - especially as, ultimately, a huge part of the Labour heartlands was Scotland at the time. They lost 40 seats in Scotland at the last election - and the last time Labour had fewer than 40 seats in Scotland was the early 60's.

Scotland sent 9/10 Dem seats to Westminster every year since the early 80's, too - they took over from the 10 or so seats that used to be Tory up here. There hasn't been more than 1 Tory seats since the '92 election - we really haven't forgiven them.

Yes, I understand that this might not be directly relevant to Snape, but it's worth being aware that not all Labour heartlands are the same, and not everywhere is it between Labour and Tories - even in the 90's.

*** I generally agree. For job ads, it's likely Remus would be looking at local and regional newspapers rather than (or as well as) the nationals. So decide where he's living, and look up the local papers. There used to be loads: a lot went under in the last couple of decades.

*** I have to massively disagree on Remus. In my opinion we see ample evidence of Remus refusing help and wanting to do everything himself, what he prizes and dreams for is freedom over safety which is right over left. He would rather be free of his condition and poor than never have to worry about money. Also would Vernon and Petunia approve of a woman in charge with regards to Thatcher?

**** When does he refuse help? Snape makes him wolfsbane because he can't make it himself. We see him living with Sirius in OOTP and it's implied he's living with Tonks's family in DH. I believe Rowling also says that James supported him financially when he was alive. Remus has a lot of shame and self loathing, but I don't think he refuses help when he needs it or wishes to deny that to anyone else.

Also regarding Thatcher - she seems to be the exception to the rule for most right wing misogynists, probably because she explicitly shunned feminism and deepened her voice. Most misogyny I've seen directed at her has come from the left.

***** It has everything to do with it. It is the fundamental belief that all other ideas are drawn from. They don't oppose each other which is why right vs left is so hard to define. If you take it to the extreme the true hard right is Laisse-faire where by you can do whatever you want so long as doing so doesn't bother anyone else. The idea of safety and security lends itself to the idea of looking after each other, its a question of what are you willing to compromise on. Privacy vs security etc, human beings can never operate in a system where they have to work together because at our core we're all different.

Left Libertarian to me says you're fine with privacy over security but would be willing to compromise on your right to spend your own money, i.e more tax and welfare. Having someone spending your money to help people instead of spending on whatever you want and if that is charity and others so be it? I'm not saying either side is correct but there reaches a point for each person, something personal, an almost inexpiable point where they have a priority that takes precedence over everything else. For a society that has safety for everyone then their freedom has to be compromised, the way they live their lives has to have some person or government that imposes the safety net/welfare that looks after those in need. If you take safety and compromise to give more freedom you'll find the modern labour party. Do it from freedom and you'll find Thatcher's torries.

****** No, you've got it a bit mixed up. left wing and right wing in actuality refers purely to economics, whilst authoritarian to libertarian refers to social issues and state control by government. there's a good diagram here that explains it in quadrants: [[http://commentsfromleftfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-27-at-10.50.25-PM.png]]

and their web page here explains it pretty well: [[https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2]]

In the UK, Both our main parties are authoritarian - the Tories to the right and labour to the left. In the US, both are more libertarian, but actually both right of centre. And the Russians are very left and very authoritarian. For example.

Left and right don't link to social values at all. I don't see how you can claim there's a cause that means suddenly the freedom v safety debate becomes an economic issue.

********* Hitler was never right wing economically. He had huge public work schemes like the autobahns run by the government which by all accounts is economically left. The scales tell you where your ideas fit in with the rest of the world but why do you believe that, where do those beliefs come from? If you pull back layer after layer of where your own beliefs come from you have you have a starting point, a point where you just believe it to be so. Like imagine toddler asking why, each time you get a bit further along until you reach a point where you say because it is. Now politically most people reach that point where they believe either everyone should be free to live their lives or they should be safe and never have to worry. That's just what they believe, now reading and understanding economics and the like give ideas and policies, compromises and such but these are built from their conviction. They aren't mutually exclusive at all but as you move from ideal worlds to the real you have to compromise. Can you have a free economy or does it need some framework and monitoring? Can people be safe without a safety net or welfare if things go wrong. Ask yourself how big of a mistake is a person allowed to make? If somebody invests all his savings into a bakery which goes bust because the other bakery in town is good friends with the miller so gets ingredients cheaper and therefore everyone goes to it what happens? The man now has no money and no form of income, should he be let to rue his mistakes, should he be helped to scrape by on a miserable existence until he finds more work, should he be comfortable or maybe live in conditions equal to the average living conditions of the country? If you want him looked after the money has to come from somewhere which means taking it from someone else, the mans mistakes cost everyone. You are restricting what they can spend their money on because you're taking it for the failed baker to live on. Does that affect how comfortable he should be? Do you interfere with the laws and subsidise the bakery so it never fails, where does that come from. To provide security you compromise freedom and vice versa. Right wing economics is based around freedom and the ability to fail. Left is built around support and security where nothing should go wrong because its monitored. Government interference is against a true free market and it tries to provide security for those who use it. Neither would function without compromising towards the other.

********** He was right of centre, although not a patch on right wing in America. he was an strong anti-communist, and initially believed strongly in free market, although gave that up (obviously) during WWII. He demonised the communist jew, and created an opposing ideology - fascism. His ideas definitely changed over time, and socially he was complex - liberal to Germans but anti-liberal to anyone else. Placing him as mildly right wing and strongly authoritarian is pretty accurate.

You've totally got your ideas mixed up here. You're not describing left and right politics at all. As I said, you can be left and libertarian as much as right and authoritarian - look at the UK right now, where the Tories want to dismantle the NHS and the welfare state and are pro-capitalism and trickle-down economics, but have introduced some of the world's tightest security controls whereby the government can legally store and access ALL citizens' phone and internet use. It's right wing economics but totally pro-security and anti-privacy - right wing authoritarian. then look at left wing economics and libertarianism - generally known as anarchy, the political state not chaos!

You're right, compromise between either end of each scale exists, but the two scales are not linked. That's where you've crossed your wires totally.

With regards to the authoritarian stuff the question is why. Like Armys as an idea are they there to keep you safe or to protect your freedom or in this case are they the same thing. Times like this they serve the same purpose. Its a compromise put together due to the screwy situation the world is in right now.

************ Yes, but you claimed that right wing/left wing was the same thing as authoritarian/libertarian, which is simply not true. The privacy v security is a social argument not an economic one, so it isn't linked to being right or left wing. Let's be honest, wizards seem socially authoritarian, and economically right wing.

Why are some people libertarian? Because the idea of freedom and private property is important to them. For example, Americans are generally more libertarian than Brits - the strong belief in private property, right to privacy, right to carry guns in order to oppose the government if necessary? Yet we are happy with banned guns, constant legal surveillance and here in Scotland there are literally no trespass laws in rural areas.

I completely understand you feeling like that - I've read a bit about social anarchism/left libertarianism, eg Rothbard and Hess, and it's an interesting idea - that all natural resources are owned by the collective and shared equally, but that we become stateless and ruled entirely by private judgement, with organisation done by voluntary committee. Proudhon talks about 'property as liberty' and how private property is what keeps us free of the state and able to use our own judgement. It's interesting - I don't personally think it would ever work, my own left wing views are mildly authoritarian, however the position definitely exists, and much more so in America where libertarianism is almost constitutional than here in the UK, where we're used to ancient totalitarianism!

The Dursleys are Daily Mail through and through and Tory voters. They would have voted for Maggie and reluctantly voted for Major, probably on the basis that they couldnt bring themselves to vote for Kinnock. I can't see Snape being bothered by Muggle politics or even reading a paper.

** In the 90s in Britain it was strange John Major was thought of as rather weak and the whole no referendum on Maastricht thing. In 97 came new labour, now the series normally ends around then but they got a landslide win due to the charisma of Blair compared to Major. They had been growing support for years, how? New Labour could be the fhought of as the first modern political parties that put votes over policies, they offered what the most people wanted. An example was a leaked memo where the New Labour lot were told to support football teams because that's what the 'little people' do. The question then is would they appeal more to Vernon than a weak leader?

Remus is a man who never wants help he wants to do things himself, that or I read too much fanfic where he's like that. This is right wing some either telegraph or pre-Murdoch times I think.

My grandma for instance would always say she vote Tory, because she prided herself of being above needing any help, which is what labour represented. Even though she was fucked over time and time again by the actual policies they implemented. I imagine Vernon would be much the same, voting Tory just because he's not part of the "riff raff".

** Brit here. Here's a general comment you didn't ask for.

Remus would not work in the Muggle world. Very, VERY few magical people would. They are "in" on the secret. If you have to work with strangers who know nothing of magic then you are /pretending/ to be someone else around them. Having to live a lie would grate against any person and become intolerable.

J.K. Rowling's world building gives you a lot of leeway in determining magical careers. What we do know is that Werewolves are effectively lepers and not trusted in Magical society.

But Remus was also a very intelligent and knowledgeable enough to teach at a premier magical school. His temperament endeared students to him, he seemed to know a lot about magical creatures; I think the likely job he would find is something to do with magical creatures. Perhaps care of them or study of them. We know bugger all about adult life in JKR's world. I imagine you could write a very decent story following Remus as he's used by people to capture or care for dangerous animals. I assume his werewolf side allows him to heal quicker and lends his body a robustness and preternatural strength.

If anyone could write a story about Remus learning to live with lycanthropy and just straight-up owning it I would be so happy.

But I definitely agree it'd be good to see happy-as-a-werewolf Remus wrangling dangerous creatures. I'm not sure I could do it justice, but who knows, maybe in future I'll give it a go.
