Preferably not paired with Harry- or sexualised whatsoever- but anything's fine. Reading the book, it felt easy to take Ginny's 'side', but as I've gotten older, I've become to really love and empathise with her, but haven't seen many fics where she's written as a person in her own right. Any suggestions?

  She was beautiful, intelligent, talented, successful -- and not very nice about it. Clearly, other women must hate her.7,300 words. PG-13. Written for the 2007 femgenficathon. September 2007.

** I adore the portrayal of Fleur in The Secret Language of Plants series by Endrina, but she isn't the focus, and only enters the story near-ish the end. Fleur is smart and powerful, and continually annoyed that she's patronized and sexualised because of being female, part-veela and French.

*** I don't mind femlash at all.

When I say sexualised I don't mean literal sex scenes, but the way she's never a character in her own right beyond beauty. When she isn't treated as comedy relief, she's a status symbol, the same way that 99% of fics where Harry's the descendant of Salazar Slytherin it isn't because it's a cool concept, but to make it clear to readers just how badass he is. I'm yet to see a FleurxHarry fic written the same way as a harmony or even hinny fic.

**** Alright! I don't know of any good Fleur x Harry fics, but here's a couple of Fleur x Hermione ones where she is a fully realized character in her own right. She isn't a status symbol or comedic relief in any of them.
