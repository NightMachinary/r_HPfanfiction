So years ago (it was likely removed from FF.net, so please help me find it elsewhere!) I read this awesome HP reading the books fanfic where Hogwarts (led by Umbridge) read the books. It started with Book 1, and it was nearly to Book 4 (maybe starting it?), but I haven't been able to find it since. I remember the book at one point was read out loud via a spell, and that any pain Harry experienced in the book (such as the venom from the Basilisk in Book 2) he also experienced during the reading. I found this to be a refreshing take on the reading, and want to read it again. Please help me? I cannot remember the title or the author, but I'm fairly sure they were divided up into different fics per book, though I could be wrong. Thank you in advance. (I'm sure books 1-3 were complete).


** Perhaps it was the series by shopaholic1369 which can be found with fictionhunt.\\
I haven't read it myself so not sure if it's the right one but it's Hogwarts reads with books 1-3 complete and GOF a couple chapters in.

*** It seems like a good fic (Thanks!), but not the one I'm looking for. There's no pain factor in this one (skimmed CoS). But thank you anyways. ^{^}

** It's only the first book, the sequels were written by someone else (with permission from original author), but I don't know who...

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
