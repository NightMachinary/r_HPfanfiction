** You could give the Sacrifices arc by Lightning on the Wave. Its a full series rewrite, about 3 million words all told, and all 7 books are complete.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** You Complete Me [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1804747]] Incomplete but pretty long

Save Yourself [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9710798]] Complete

These two are sort of part of the same story line A Single Change [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/427321]] This is a bit more a shorter part

Consequences of A Binding Ritual [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/293936]] This is long though unfinished. It's still really good though.

Hadrian Peverell and the Darkness That Reigns [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19966147]] I think it counts?

Damning the Damned [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14330838]] Haven't read this in a while but it was in my library and had the tag so it counts

Paradoxical Parallels [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15720600]] I mean it had the tag

The Snake in the Lion's Den [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15298281]]

Shadow Fire [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7285600]]

I just realized most of these are Harry x Tom

*** I'll see your Harry x Tom and raise you Harry x Snape:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle series]] by (dead cat with a) flamethrower: 1.4 million words so far, nearing the end of part 8, with parts 9 and 10 still to come. This story is so awesome I'm reccing it any time it fits.

The rest of these are complete. (And I've learned I have to cross many stories off the list by making that distinction.)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7876387][Death Eater Takes a Holiday]] by Lee Lee Potter
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4241040][Apple Tree]] by Philo

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1825321][Until Proven]] by Tira Nog (despite the open chapter count, it says "Finis" at the end, so I'm calling it complete)

One lonely little Harry/Draco: Per Solum Lacuna (By Words Alone) by Azhure and Wintermoon ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1671476][toned-down but still "mature" version on ffn]], [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11966][nsfw version on skyhawke]])

Several mentor Snape, but if you're looking for pairings they may not be what you want.

** This one isn't dark Harry, but linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin) is really good and over 900k words. It's a WIP, but it updates every few weeks with a long chapter.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I'm gonna fight the urge to recommend that one MegaMatt09 fic that's 2.3 million words long. Not worth your time in reading unless you like a type of story that the automod is currently looking for to ban posts, even if it's legal.

I don't know of any Dark!Harry ones but if you like crossovers I can suggest a bunch.
