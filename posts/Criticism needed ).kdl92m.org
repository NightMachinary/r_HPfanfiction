** Three things I noticed from a brief skim:

1) Learn how to write speech (quotation marks) grammatically correctly. This happens to be a big pet peeve of mine, and often causes me to click out of a story if I see it done incorrectly throughout the fic.

One thing that seems to trip a lot of people up is using commas to offset speech when it takes place in the context of a larger sentence.

For example:

“I would like bacon and eggs for breakfast,” Sirius said.

-not-

“I would like bacon and eggs for breakfast” Sirius said.

There are not too many rules involving use of quotation marks in direct speech, and they are fairly simple to learn. Seriously, if you read a quick lesson on it, it should only take you about 15 minutes to read the basic rules, and those basic rules should cover about 99% of cases.

2) Watch your comma splicing. This is another big pet peeve of mine. Comma splicing happens when you try to join two independent clauses with only a comma. Everyone does it from time to time; however, I noticed a comma splice in your first sentence. (And I saw a couple of others in my brief skim.)

How can you tell if you have an independent clause? Read the clause. Could it be a sentence by itself? If so, it's an independent clause. It can't be separated from another independent clause by a comma. You can use a semi-colon, a conjunction (and, but, etc.), or you can split the clauses up into two separate sentences.

3) Watch the excessive description. I hasten to say that this is more of a stylistic critique, and not something “wrong” per se.

IMHO, description/details should be in service of providing relevant information about the characters or the plot, or for setting the scene and providing some atmosphere for the story (description as a method of eliciting emotion from the reader that helps the writer paint a picture.)

There should never be description for the sake of description. I think this stylistic flaw is the result of English teachers screeching: “Add more detail! Describe the scene!” This is good advice in a vacuum, as most beginning writers do tend to stick to a dry recitation of facts that have their stories sounding like a news report. But description needs to /add/ to the story and not just stand alongside it, if that makes any sense.

Here's a “good” example vs. a “bad” example (and forgive me for not being the best creative writer myself!):

“Andromeda could have been Bellatrix's twin in features. They shared the same curly black hair, the same dark eyes, and the same bone structure. And yet, people almost never confused the two. Where Bellatrix's life had sharpened already harsh features into the mein of a predator, Andromeda's face was creased with laugh and smile lines, badges of a life well-lived.”

“Andromeda Tonks had curly, shoulder-length black hair, which had a tendency to frizz in the humidity. Her eyes were so brown as to be almost black, and she had pale skin that tended to blush easily. She was not tall, nor was she short, but rather of average height.”

I would say that, in general, description should be more like the first example, in that the description exists to show us something about the /personality/ of our characters. It's description, but it's description with a purpose.

The second example is description for the sake of description. Not that this is /always/ wrong, but too much of it can feel immersion-breaking, IMHO. I want to care about your story, about your characters, what they're doing, who they are, etc. Description for those purposes is almost always a good thing. But a detailed description of, say, what the characters had for lunch, is unnecessary and even annoying when it isn't relevant to the plot or doesn't otherwise illuminate their characters.

Again, that's just a stylistic critique. There's not a matter of a “right” way and a “wrong” way. There have been writers that have been successful with extremely minimal description (Hemingway) or excessive description (Dickens) so there isn't a hard and fast rule. But, I would say that /in general/ if you keep most description more like our first example, and less like our second, your story will be more readable and immersive.

Best of luck to you.

*** Thank you so much! These are actually flaws that I have noticed myself but now that I know how to fix them I certainly will :)

**** No problem!

Writing is difficult, for sure, and it takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there and ask for help.

We all have things we struggle with. I never really struggled too much with grammar (I'm old enough that I went to school when grammar was a separate subject) but I struggled (and still do) at conveying the depth and motivations I want my character to have. But I know the more I wrote, the better I got at it.

And don't forget, the more you read (critically), the better you will get. When you read other fics, pay attention to what other authors do that you like and dislike and see if you can integrate that into your writing. We all learn from each other, and it's a constant process.

** Look up rules of punctuation and dialogue usage. It's almost never correct through the four or so chapters I looked at. Most notably, dialogue starting mid rather large paragraphs that then continue on around the dialogue for an eternity.

Also read up on fragments and run-on sentences. Specifically comma splices. They make up the majority of the story.

And Passive Voice is not your friend.

There's a lot of frivolous text as well. It seems like you're trying to be overly poetic or romantic with the opening but it doesn't work because there is absolutely no flow. Which, is largely due to the sentence structure errors. But there's repeated concepts and language that make it excessive. The entire thing can be rewritten into one sentence and lose nothing.

There were multiple times where the scene setup was literally 'it was X, it was silent, and then NOISE!' always in three fragmented sentences.

There's a great deal of anachronism as well. The depiction of Grimmauld Place as....suburban...rings false given that your target audience knows its in a posh London locale. There's probably not a lawn, almost certainly not enough foliage for the ground to be littered with leaves, and its very unlikely people passed out in front of a neighboring house. The local constabulary would have almost certainly found them better accommodations for the evening.

That may seem nitpicky, but it makes the entire opening ring rather false.

You describe a path as 'lantern lit' to end one paragraph only to start the next by describing it as extremely dark.

And the sorting that we've seen has always been alphabetical. While I suppose it's possible that 'Snape' would be the last name called in a small class, Sirius should not be waiting an eternity to be sorted, and would certainly be sorted before Remus Lupin,

There's a lot I wouldn't have bothered including as well. Your audience is aware of Harry Potter, they don't need a run down of how houses and the point system works, nor do they need a mostly plagiarized Sorting Hat song. More of Sirius experiencing things rather than an adult just stating things would be better.

All-in-all it feels very minimalist at this point. There's not a lot of substance to the plot and the chapters are all very short and deal with, more or less, one brief scene. For example, there's almost no legitimate reason for the trip to the castle from the station and the sorting to be two separate entities.

It never answers the 'why' question. As in 'why am I reading this?' There doesn't feel like there is any overarching plot yet. What threads are teased are then not referenced for three for four chapters and a lot of the character interactions ring false. There's more time devoted in one chapter to an alarm clock than there is to anything resembling an overarching plot in that chapter. And while I certainly shouldn't be one to criticize slice-of-life with little plot, the blatant lack of proper grammar and structure makes it hard to enjoy.

So if you want feedback on improving your writing, learn and utilize proper rules of grammar.

More sanity feedback would be get rid of: "I try to update it weekly" because, well, the entire thing feels like you publish whatever you did and move on. Which contributes to the plot-less feel of it. Plan it and write it. If it takes a week it takes a week, if it takes six months it takes six months. Don't cave to an arbitrary deadline and put something up that feels incomplete. That will only frustrate you in the long run.
