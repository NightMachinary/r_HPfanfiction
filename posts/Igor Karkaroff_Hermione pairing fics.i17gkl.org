*** Seriously. Is it just misogyny, where authors want to pair her with just the worst possible characters?

Or is it some perverse desire to 'redeem' shit-awful characters by forcing them on the /only/ female character with any depth in the whole series?

****** In the name of being inclusive we shall of course also have Hermione/Umbridge/Fudge as a paring the next day. And we better make her also have a BDSM lustful flinging with Dumbledore (cannon age) while we are at it! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

And of course, we can't forget all those awesome crossovers with GOT that have yet to be made with Hermione/Ramsay Bolton as paring! As soon as such a thing is invented I am sure that all the fandom's unfounded hate on that unlovable psychotic sadistic shall fall apart!🤞👍😁😂

**** I mean, yes, the redemption bit is a huge factor. At first I was like ooo here's a pairing I haven't seen that could be a post-war thing between the studious Hermione and the Headmaster of Durmstrang...

But wasn't he killed for trying to hide from Voldemort?

I always thought that was a really good death to include in the series, because it showed that even the Headmaster of one of the greatest magical schools in the world couldn't escape get away from Voldemort.
