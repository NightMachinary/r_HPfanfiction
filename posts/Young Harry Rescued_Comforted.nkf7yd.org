Edit: For clarity, I'm open to anyone rescuing Harry, Hermione was just a nice example. :)

Hi All,

I just read the first few chapters of linkffn(The Accidental Animagus), and really liked the scenes where young Harry is taken in by the Grangers. The combination of how messed up he is, how accepting they are, and how he is caught off-guard by simple things like being offered a sandwich or an apology appealed a lot.

I know there are probably lots of fics where harry gets taken away from the Dursleys in some fashion, but I'd love to find particularly heart-warming or comforting examples. If there's more to the fic than this, of course, that's wonderful. I just appreciate the virtual milk and cookies tonight.


** Linkffn(Full Circle by Crazy Mishka) Hermione adopts Harry. Very heartwarming. Bonus kid Hermione.

Linkffn(Ghost Of Privet Drive) One of the only fics that gets Kid!Harry's characterization and dialogue right.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

** Those scenes in The Accidental Animagus moved me too! Harry isn't adopted and he's older but Snape acts as a mentor and rescues him from the Dursleys in linkffn(The Best Revenge). Also, I haven't read linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) myself but I see it recced a lot. Sirius takes Harry from the Dursleys.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** linkao3(to leap and love the fall by stranglerfig) is where young Harry follows a snake into the wilderness, the snake then takes him to the Basilisk because Harry is too big to fit in it's den. The whole series is heartwarming and Harry gets â€˜adopted' by multiple beings e.g. he makes friends with the House Elves, Myrtle, and becomes a member of a mermaid family. It sounds kind of unrealistic but it isn't, somehow. Harry earns his place with each of them, so it's not like those fics where Harry remembers a Goblins name and they declare him a Goblin Friend and grant him loads of privileges.

  Living with the basilisk is going to take some adjusting, like learning to navigate hidden tunnels, keep himself secret, and figure out how to use magic (easier said than done). The castle and forest are full of dangers, and as Harry tries to fit into a world of elves, ghosts, and talking portraits, he'll find out if he's up to the challenge.
