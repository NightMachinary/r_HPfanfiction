You can literally turn into an animal if you work hard enough on it! That's one of the coolest concepts in the books, and one that the main characters don't really ever consider in the OG series. I'd love to hear about any fics that utilize Animagi, though preference would be if it involved at least one of the OG trio.


** I mean it's not very useful besides escape and surprise. If you're a bird you can spy on people easily, but a predator would get annihilated by a wizard unless they were surprised. Like you're running at someone as a tiger and you get hit by a blasting curse you'll be tiger bits all over the ground cuz you have no defense besides agility.

Unless you want something like woah he's a dragon, basilisk, and Phoenix animagi but i generally avoid stories like that.

*** You are MASSIVELY underestimating tigers. Those things are much much larger than you think, are very fast, and extremely agile. The mass they have alone, coupled with the innate magical resistance wizards seem to have would be a lethal combination.

*** Personally I see most people who do it do so as an accomplishment thing. So few people do it so it does make you more special.

*** There could be some uses outside of that, judging by how easily sirious was able to evade aurors and the fact that rita was able to sneak into so many private areas it could be assumed that animagus in thier animal forms dont trip magical detection systems. With this any small animal type animagus could be extremely good at anything from sabatoge to espionage and even assassination is the movies are to be belives about how fast an animagus can transform back.

*** Yes, being an aniagus is exciting, but most forms aren't very useful, especially in a fight. Even if you have an element of surprise, wouldn't it be better to just use your wand from a distance?

I have a fic where a character becomes an animagus in hopes that it would help her with spying, but then her form turns out to be a shark, which is cool and fearsome and all, but isn't of much use to her in her job. She gets to use her abilities in the story, though, but in a very specific circumstances.

** The whole animagi thing is ruined for me due to all the edgy harry stories in which he gains several animagus forms or he just takes a potion. It is just annoying.

It doesnt seem very usefull except for the suprise element.

** Linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has Harry being a cat Animagus from the beginning. Pretty interesting, although he doesn't use it to his full potential in my opinion.

** Linkffn(For Love Of Magic) is a fic that's really rightfully hated here because of the terrible ending but in between the raven Animagus Harry does use his talent to pretty much recruit all the ravens in the world to spy for him.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Not animagi per se but this one uses different magic to turn into animals for a certain amount of time and it's a key part of the strategy (maybe not quite what you're looking for though)

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.
