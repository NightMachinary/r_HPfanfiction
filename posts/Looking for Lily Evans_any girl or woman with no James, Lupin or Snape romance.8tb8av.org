Are there any stories where Lily is paired with another woman/one of her fellow students which are more than porn? Any lesbian pairing is fine, as long as there is no infidelity or Death Eater revisionism (so no Voldemort was right or pureblood Lily AUs).


** There's a pairing where Lily goes back in time and falls in love with Merope Gaunt. It's practically a one-shot I think it's called A Mother's Love.

Also, there's a Lily/Bellatrix one I read a year ago that's pretty good. I'll have to see if I can find it

*** Wasn't the metrope one with Harry as time traveller?

I'd be very interested in the Bellatrix one however.

  Lily has a crush on Black, but it's not the Black that Marlene thinks it is.

  Bellatrix reflects on the death of Lily Evans and wonders why everything had to happen the way it did. Did she make the right choice by becoming a Death Eater to protect her? Or should she have gone after Lily instead? Written for Stupid Cupid Unusual Pairings challenge. AU where Bellatrix is one year older than Lily, unrequited Bellatrix/Lily. One shot, rated for character death.

  "Would your mother have died for you?" Instead of dying at Voldemort's hand, Lily is thrown back to 1926, when Merope Gaunt, pregnant and alone, is trying to survive. Lily/Merope

***** I read the damn story three times so I am pretty sure it is not what I am looking for. Maybe if it was just Lily, Shiva and Harry, but that story has a different focus and was pretty much ruined by the inclusion of Daphne Greengrass and/or how that was handled.

  Lily came home with rainbow-striped hair her last year of Hogwarts.“I suppose you're trying to be special again,” Petunia said, raising an eyebrow. “Or are you trying to tell us something with that ridiculous hairstyle?”“Well, actually,” Lily said.
