In order for Harry to infiltrate the Death Eaters and Voldemort's inner circle, he needs to convince Voldemort that he's gone dark, studying spells with Snape that definitely aren't in the curriculum, distancing himself from Gryffindor and befriending Slytherins, and finally, with Dumbledore on death's door, the old man asks...

"I can't kill you!" Harry screamed, looking between the two men he called mentors, teachers, confidants.

"I'm already dying, Harry." Dumbledore reasoned.

"And if you don't Draco will. He has to, or I have to to save him." Severus said, pointing out things they already learned, but /still/..

"I just- I don't think I can?" Harry was on the verge of tears, from frustration or from the weight of the Headmaster's approaching death, he didn't know.

â€‹

Just an idea I had, but I suck at the dark!Harry fics, even if it's fake!dark!Harry.


** "Join me, Potter. Together, we could---"

"Okay, sure."

Voldemort froze as his brain processed what he was hearing. "Did you just agree to join me? This isn't some sort of amusing miscommunication in the making?"

"Nope. I totally and completely one hundred percent want to work with you now," Harry said with a wide grin. "So what do we do first? Murder? Torture? Maybe a little destruction of property? I'm particularly good at arson, you know."

"I, umm...I was actually planning to kill you now," Voldemort replied sheepishly. "I was really only asking you to join because it seemed like the thing to do. It never occurred to me that you might actually accept."

"Don't worry, even the best Dark Lords make mistakes. Why, just half an hour ago, I was having so much fun turning an acromantula inside out that I didn't notice Cedric catching up to me. Luckily, I was able to distract him with some silly idea of sharing the glory of victory before he remembered proper spider anatomy. Otherwise, he might have told Dumbledore that I was using dark magic."

Harry paused and stared at the cooling corpse that was once Cedric Diggory. "Well, I guess murder works too."

** Not this exactly but the ladies black has something of this. Voldy tricks harry into using a curse that enslaves women to him on bellatrix and narcissus trying to corrupt him. It doesnt work but they try to convince Voldemort that it's working through using various willing slaves in public. Everything is consensual but indont remember much beyond that

***** Dumbledore has a certain amount of hilarity to him in that. Once he figures out what curse was used, he asks to interrogate them, then basically tells Harry to have fun with ladies.
