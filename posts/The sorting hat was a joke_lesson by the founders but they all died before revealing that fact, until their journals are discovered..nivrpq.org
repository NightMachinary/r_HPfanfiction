Originally Hogwarts didn't have houses as much as it just had 4 powerful folk who basically had 4 apprentices. But after seeing their apprentices keep fighting, the founder announced a new "house" system where a magic hat will tell an 11 year old their only personality trait. Syltherin even pretended to be super into pureblood stuff, again to prove a point. At the end of the year, they were gonna reveal if was all a lesson, about how people are multi faced and how 11 year Olds are growing folks and change, and everyone should be brave, smart, loyal and cunning to suceed. However that year Gyrffindor choked on a chicken bone, Raveclaw died due to her experiments with drinking mercury, Hufflepuff died of chlamydia and Syltherin died while working on the control room of the hogwarts sewage system (aka the chamber of secrets). The hat just figures out where a student wants to go and gives them quick dialog to feel better. It's minorly sentient but is bound to never reveal its a joke.

**** If there is anything I hate, it's a non-blood purist Salazar Slytherin. Even if it is present in small amounts, there should be a bit of that present in Slytherin's character.
