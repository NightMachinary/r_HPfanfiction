Could you recommend me some fics?

I know there's a lot, but those I found mainly are about Harry fully committing to the Dark side, or at least becoming a heavily gray character, with Voldie mainly staying his dark manipulative self.

What I am trying to find though are fics where Harry helps Voldemort to become "good" again, to learn to love again (because seeing a lonely angry and hateful 11 year old kid in an orphanage should not immediately make you think he is EVIL this is such bullshit, that he is incapable of love cause his parents didn't want him and didnt love him is even bigger bullshit, Dumbledore can go fk himself I was so disappointed in him when I first read that)

Time travel to little Tom to raise him.

Or gluing back together Tom's soul in present time.

Plus I'm pretty sure Tom was just as irremediable as a child, he killed animals and hurt other children at the orphanage. Signs of a psychopath.

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

  Harry didn't understand why Voldemort had suggested their marriage as a solution to the war. He didn't understand why his friends were supporting the suggestion. But he goes into it, trying to be as numb as possible, trying to retreat into his mind and just let the world play out around him---no matter how difficult that is.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
