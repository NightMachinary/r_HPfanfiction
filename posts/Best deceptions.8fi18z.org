I have Voldemort specifically in mind, but any good ones by any characters will do.

Voldemort is supposedly extremely charismatic and clever, but we don't get to see much of this side of him in canon. We see a very straightforward attempt at persuading Harry to join him in first year, as well as his charming of the Smith woman who owned Hufflepuff's cup, and that's pretty much it. There's also Slughorn and the horcruxes, which wasn't particularly impressive, and the scene where he frames Hagrid, I suppose. Still, he mostly comes across as blatantly evil.

I'd like to see a fic where it genuinely looks like Voldemort is one of the good guys, or misunderstood somehow, and then it turns out that he was expertly playing a role the entire time. To be clear, I'm not just looking for a charismatic Voldemort, who tells lies that people believe. I'm also looking for a clever Voldemort, who takes certain actions to manipulate other people's perceptions.

This thread will probably require some spoilers, but if you can word your recommendation in a way that it's still appealing but avoids spoilers, that'd be awesome.


** A lot of people around here hate it, but HPMOR does all of this and more:

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Ah...but wouldn't any fic recommended here be spoilery? If it turns out that a big twist is that so-and-so character is secretly on the other side?

Well, I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9268425/1/Honey][this one and its sequel]] featuring a...well, yeah.

** I will give no details, but there is at least one deception similar to your description in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)
