It came out in December of 1994 in Japan and mid 1995 in Europe.

Edit: I can't believe I have to say this, but this is a prompt. Take this plothole and make up a story around it.

  In the beginning of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry tells Sirius in a letter that Dudley was so angry at his diet that he threw his new Playstation out of the window. If you know your Harry Potter, you'll know that this part takes place in the summer of 1994. Problem is, the Playstation wasn't released in Europe until 1995. This story attempts to explain said anomaly.

  The PlayStation was not commercially released until December 1994 in Japan and September 1995 in Europe.[1] However, prototypes were made available to game developers before December 1994, some of which ended up being sold to private consumers.[2] It is possible that Vernon and Petunia Dursley, as indulgent parents, bought one of these prototypes for Dudley. Alternatively, the Harry Potter novels may take place in a universe in which the PlayStation was released earlier than in our own, or Harry, due to his lack of interest in Muggle technology, might have confused the PlayStation with a similar console.

*** Yes, this happens all the time with Engineering Samples or Development kits.

But nitpicking is not the purpose of a prompt.
