I finally found a ship that stirred me enough to actually dedicate myself to write a story about it. That being said, I've been jumping from creating a story to story because ideas keep flowing but I'm having a hard time putting it into words and such. I've actually completed a chapter on of the stories I've come up with and decided to focus now and I guess I just need some general and specific advice on how I should approach it. Should I keep writing until I reach a dead end and have someone read it? Or should I just keep writing and publish it anyways? Should I write one long story or divide it into multiple ‚Äúbooks‚Äù? I'm not sure. Questions like that come to me all the time.

Also I'm trying to wrack my brain for a realistic way to actually separate Harry and Ginny. In my head I feel like Ginny is capable of cheating on Harry given the way she jumped from men to men but I don't know maybe that's just me.

Happy Lunar New Year! üòÅ


** Didn't Ginny date only two blokes before Harry, and she never overlapped or cheated on either of them? I don't buy the slut!Ginny trope.

Anyway, do you want your story to be about their separation, or do you simply want to write Harry post Hogwarts in a relationship with someone else? I think it's safe to just ignore the epilogue or just make it clear that they never got back together if your goal is to have Harry available to date someone else.

Adding something like "Canon compliant up to the epilogue" or "AU post Hogwarts; epilogue never happened" can save you a lot of trouble trying to break H/G apart and just let you jump into the story you want to tell. Of course, if you do want to write a story about a marriage falling apart then go for it.

Other than that, I would personally recommend trying to write a one-shot first, and if/when you do go for a longer story, put together some sort of outline first. It doesn't have to be super detailed, but even a vague chain of events can help get things line up in your head.

*** I think I was just never a big fan of her arc or her purpose so I'm more inclined to give her a standout flaw. But I understand ahaha

Hmm, no I just wanted to find a way to get them to separate at the beginning of my story that is reasonable and believable enough as a catalyst for Harry to pursue feelings for someone else that are not just out of pure convenience. I'll be thinking about it and I hope whichever I choose works out the best.

Alright. I'll heed every advice ahahaha. I've never been a big fan of outlines but this time I'll do it so I won't get lost. Thanks for the advice!

**** Outlines are by no means required but it's so easy to write yourself into a corner that you can't get out of.

George RR Martin is pretty famous for being a writer who just sorts of writes and sees where the characters take him, and look how that's turned out for him. A Song of Ice and Fire may well never be finished.

So yeah, outlines are in general recommended, especially for your first time, but if you just feel the spark and want to get some words down on paper then go for it!

** For the love of all things Harry Potter, please, please, whatever you do, try to find a way without bashing or using random Out of Character behavior to justify your ship. You've got to find a good, solid reason why the canon ship isn't working/won't happen.

Nothing irritates me more than seeing a fic make Ron an openly spiteful bigot against all Slytherins or wanna-be tag along, or making Harry and Ginny break up because of Ginny's old celebrity crush on him, making her just a fangirl or a golddigger.

It just doesn't do justice to the original characters, and it's lazy writing, making the whole thing contrived and forced.

Listen, I'm down for some different ships, but not if it's at the cost of other person in the original relationship. If someone doesn't like Hermione/Ron, that's fine, but using the fic as a platform blast Ron just drives me nuts.

There was a fic recommended here a while back. It was a Sirius/Hermione time travel story, and it worked extremely well, all without making Ron a loud, brash bigoted asshole.

In fact, in the fic Hermione went back in time, partially to reclaim the parts of Ron that she fell in love with, as the strain of the war and grief of losing his brother took it's toll on Ron and made him lose his humorous, fun side, as he used all his time and energy to try to keep his family together. He didn't change into someone unlikeable and unlovable. He just changed.

And soon, the circumstances around Hermione changed, and she herself changed, and she still wished all the best for Ron and loved the man that he was, but she also loved Sirius.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that breaking up the original ship shouldn't be some cut-and-dry,"that other person is to blame because they're bad and they should feel bad but they won't feel bad because they're too stupid and dumb" story.

If you're going to have a break up come up with an argument they might have about something, like if it's post Hogwarts, and Harry's an Auror, and he's still obsessed with catching Dark wizards. He could be spending too much time working overtime, or he's getting injured too many times, and Ginny can't bear to see him get hurt over and over, or Harry's gotten too brutal with how he's taking down Dark Wizards because they kept on hurting Innocents or killed one of his friends.

Maybe they just lost their romantic spark along the way. Maybe the Montser in Harry's chest isn't pining for Ginny like it once did, and now they're two people living together and figuring out that they just aren't compatible.

Maybe without the constant threat of a Dark Lord over their heads and teenage hormones going wild, they realize it just wasn't meant to be.

You could even go the magic sinister route with that, and say that the remnants of Tom Riddle's soul that was latched onto Harry recognized Ginny as prey, or manipulatable, and influenced Harry to become attracted to her in the first place, and now that the Horcrux is gone, Harry's attraction to her receded somewhat as well.

Or it could be the Horcrux has the opposite effect. . Ginny had a crush on Harry, and when she wrote to Tom she she might have saw what she wanted from Harry in Tom in the Diary, and soon she began to associated Harry with Tom and Tom with Harry, and after her first year, she's still utterly terrified by Tom and has night terrors, and now she can't find comfort in Harry's arms, because she unconsciously feels Tom's presence in Harry because of the Horcrux or the remnants of the Horcrux.

Anything better than making her a slut or golddigger just for the sake of another ship.

It just doesn't feel right to me and I feel like I might as well have created new characters. That being said I'll make sure I won't trash any of the characters.

**** Awesome! I feel like I'm making the fanfic community better already.

Just remember that in whatever story you tell, whether it's fanfiction or original, every character is a person. They're not just a plot device or a scapegoat for you to use. They may serve that purpose in a story, and it's important to think about their purpose in the story, but ultimately, they are people who have their own agenda, their own experiences, their own thoughts and feelings and aspirations that defines who they are and what they do. They have a reason for doing things even if it's not something they consciously think about. Like Ron getting in fights with Slytherins; it almost always happens in canon because those Slytherins insulted Ron's friends or family, and Ron's loyalty to those he cares about are second to none.

If you establish to yourself who that character is, and why they are doing what they're doing, then you'll become a better writer for it. No matter how complex or simple your plot may be, as long as you get the characters right and can build upon what you write about them, it can be a compelling story. Writing fanfiction is both a blessing and a curse in this regard, since you have the characters established already, but need a valid reason to deviate that character's arc away from canon, all while still keeping it close to the character already established, which can be hard to do.

Anyways, I'm glad I was able to help you brainstorm a bit. Good luck with the fic!

I'm going to keep that in mind. My story might end up longer and/or might take me longer to write because now I feel like I have to visualize and put myself in their shoes. I just hope by the end of it I find a path where my style suits the characters enough to justify the changes and new plot I'll be making. Hahaha I think its blessing always because there are these amazing characters that I'll never get to imagine if it werent for the original book. I hope I don't botch it too hard hahaha.

Thanks once again! I scrapped the beginning of my fic now in order to make way for a cleaner break from the two. :)

I had to look it up, but this is it. Lots of great characterization for the Marauders in there as well, and the author had a really clever method for doing that characterization.

** I'm not a writer myself, but some advice based on bad fics I've read is to limit your ideas. These will be your first steps into fanfictions and you are probably brimming with ideas that are cool. And while original storylines are very much appreciated they very quickly end up convoluted. I much rather have one or two ideas worked out to a satisfying conclusion than ten different ideas all ending up half finished.

Second advice I'd give you is to check your grammar and spelling. Writing in an interesting way is not a talent that is given to everybody, and even those that do it well have to work hard at it. However proper grammar and spelling is far less difficult to achieve. Authors constantly misspelling things like canon names (which are only a google search away) can really ruin my reading experience.

Third advice is to roughly plan out your stories. It can be cool to just start writing chapters as they come to you, but after the initial plot bunny runs out the quality usually plummets. I'm of the opinion that in general, most fanfic authors are very adept at writing from a prompt, but once that prompt is done and the story isn't finished you can see the struggles. By roughly planning the direction you want the story to go in you have some more guidance while writing.

*** Thank you! I'm trying to tune down my ideas and jotting them all down now so that I don't put too much on one story. I'm thinking of starting slow and slowly build it up. I'll make sure to not throw too much in it to avoid ruining it ahaha.

I'm brushing up on my grammar and spelling ahahaha. I've never been the best grammar student but my spelling's pretty okay and it does irk me as well whenever I see fics that have misspelled things. Even though my brain corrects it, I still wish it was bit more polished so I'm hoping I wont make the same mistake.

Thank you! I'm trying to plan out my story now as we speak because after everyone's advice I have a feeling I will run out of things to say in the middle and forget how and where I want to go. Thank you again for all your advice! Hope you stumble in my work sometime in the future! :D

OP, relationships end all the time, you don't even need to spend that much time on it. They've drifted apart, too much had changed between them, they were in love with the idea of being in love, so on. Don't pull out excuses like her looking like Lily or love potions or anything like that.

****** If you do, wait and go back after a long while, and often inspiration arrives, and while you remind yourself what it was you were writing, you can polish as you go.

First drafts are always terrible, so ideally, keep the first draft, finish the story, then fix and polish and publish the second. Thus, if you hit a dead end, no readers are left hanging, and if you decide foreshadowing is needed for a chapter near the end, you can go and stick it right in there and look really clever.

*** Also, find something that gets you in the groove to write, then use it every time you write. It can be music, a tv show, silence, white noise, anything, really. I use a specific set of live concerts, the main one being about 2 hours long. You can eventually use this when you're not really in the mood to write (this does not mean forcing yourself when you're unwell) to help you get in the mood. You can also use it to limit your time so you don't disrupt your sleep too much, and so you don't get carried away going in a direction that you will look back and go, ‚ÄòThis is really not what I wanted it to turn out like.' Stopping for the day is good. I, for example, use the end of a specific concert, so if I feel like I'm going to need more time, I'll start one or two back in the playlist. If I go over my set limit, I will carefully read and evaluate what I'm writing, then decide whether to continue (and set a second, absolute last limit.)

I would also recommend setting your minimum chapter length, and also a maximum chapter length. This way, you have manageable goals and can make sure you're giving your (eventual) readers the best quality product you can. If your chapter goes over significantly, enough to form, or almost form, two chapters, then split it and reread. Often, you'll find the ‚Äòunder' chapter is lacking some detail where it could really use it. Other times, you'll find yourself rambling on about something that, while interesting, is not relevant enough to have so many words dedicated to it. Always write the chapter first, then split it and flesh out, or edit down. Don't stress too much about length. Personally, my minimum chapter preference is 2,500 words. This is the minimum to keep the pace of the story that I'm trying to achieve, and my average maximum is 3,500, which is roughly what my chapter lengths are now that the story has become more intense and busy. My absolute upper limit, with no exceptions if it can be helped, is 4,000 words.

The next step is to get an editor. I have a lovely British editor, who checks me on my Australianisms and who has a similar, but slightly different, writing style. He is also a he and I am also a she. In the context of my particular story, it also comes in handy that he is older (not significantly) and I am younger and that he is a Dom type and I am a sub type (I am the more experienced of us both in that area.) I will just mention that I was about 18 when I met him online and he was in his 20s. You don't have to, but we both edit and fact-check for each other as we are both active (ish, in his case) writers and it works well for us. If you can't, or don't want to, get an editor, I suggest you write your story without looking back too much, then leave it a few months to a year+ and edit once or twice, rinse and repeat. That last was a suggestion from either Andy Griffiths or Kate Forsyth. Can't remember which exactly. Or maybe Richard Harland. I don't know. Anyway, you may edit it up a couple of times on your own, then decide to bring in an editor of some kind, or you may edit once or twice and find it ready to publish. The problem with the ‚Äòno editor' route is you can't really publish chapter-by-chapter as you write. If you do choose to write, edit and publish chapter-by-chapter, you do seriously risk getting caught in eternal editing, where you will over-edit, never write any new content, and never publish past that point. I know I'm prone to this, which is why my editor, great help that he is, will often say, ‚ÄúIt's done. Time for you to comb through for any grammatical, spelling, etc. errors that we might have missed and send it out.‚Äù At which point I do just that. But, it really is up to you how you go about it. Just never publish anything in-edited. Please, for the love of my brain cells and yours.

This turned out longer than I expected. I just want to finally say, I have over 100,000 words to my name on my sole work. I will, occasionally, write spin-offs of it, playing with scenarios in the distant future and toying with the dynamic of certain characters, but I don't allow these to become more than 3 chapter works. In fact, the one I do have published became 3-4 chapters and I aced everything beyond the first. I had several false starts, I think 2 in total that I actually wrote content for, and I still have that content, but as I got further and further in, my ideas changed and suddenly these initial ideas became more-or-less part of a bigger story. There was a backstory that had to be told first, but now it didn't start until late 1996; suddenly a side-character, occasional play partner, was part of the full-time relationship, taking it from a D/s dynamic to a complex and interesting D/D/s with more to it than meets the eye. I still have all the unused, unedited chapters from those two major false starts, I even have the notebook I used for one of them, and I refer to them for scenes that I want to use and for ideas that I don't want to let go. So think about your multiple ideas, because maybe they're all part of a bigger story, and believe me, the bigger story is so worth the effort of writing.

That got away from me again. Enjoy writing, have fun, and take care. -Silver

**** I"m currently listening to classical music mostly and some gaming soundtracks particularly the FFXV piano collection. It just evokes so much emotion from me. I'll try to look for more things to listen to! :) Is it better to set a time limit for myself whenever I'm writing? I usually have my word document open and I jump into writing even just a few sentences whenever my attention is on it. I've never been a person that can keep doing something for 2 hours straight but I think I can do it for this assuming I have enough motivation ahaha.

I really like your advice about the chapter and word count. I'll keep that in mind. I think its practical and thats a part that I'm unsure with. Right now I just hit 4k words on a single chapter but I'm highlighting a bunch of stuff that I want to edit out or change and I'm not sure if its healthy for me to write 4k words every chapter. I'll set a upper and lower limit for myself when I eventually find out if I can maintain the quality of longer chapters.

Okay, I guess I'll have to stop being a lurker and find online friends to help edit. I'm not comfortable with telling any of my actual friends that I want to write because I'd like to keep this part of my life separate I guess. That kind of scared me though (being in a never ending loop of editing) ahahaha and I don't think I'd want that. You're lucky you found someone that compliments(?) and edits your writing! Don't worry I won't ever post anything unedited. I don't think I'll ever allow myself to open anything off the internet if I do that ahaha.

Don't worry I appreciate it! Wow. You write a lot! That's really encouraging and I will keep all those in mind. I tend to have so many ideas I never know where to start but it could be better to write smaller things first that could diverge somewhere in the future when I decide its time to write big? I'd like to write a big story one day. It doesnt even have to be the coolest thing. I just want to get it out there and get it out of my head.

Thanks for all the advice! I appreciate it all. Its gonna help alot. Take care as well.

P.S. Not sure if I've read your work yet (I'm not too active here and I'm not very interactive with people etc etc but hopefully you can link me your works/profile so I can read! ahahaha thanks again!)

***** The advice I gave is for my writing style, so you may not write for hours straight like I do, and you may not need a time limit. I do encourage you, however, to set yourself ‚Äòwork/school' and ‚Äòsleep' times. Make notes in your notebook during these times, by all means, but I would err away from getting out your computer or opening the doc during these times. I used to write during classes in school. I know. The paranoia will get you and you'll learn to read 0.3pt. /shudder/

For your word count, it is whatever you feel comfortable and confident in doing without compromising on quality either way. The pace of your story over-all will also have a bearing on your chapter length; I find shorter chapters lend themselves to a fast-paced story, or portion of the story, while long or multi-part chapters are for slower stories, or slower parts of a story.

I got lucky with my editor, really. It was a chance meeting on whisper and we've never actually met - as I said, he's British, I'm Australian. My real life friends know I write, and they hear about major achievements, but I keep it otherwise separate from them. This is partly because only about 3 out of the group know about my life in BDSM. The editing loop is terrifying and really hard to get out of, hence why I was eager to warn you about it. Luckily, I've never fallen too deeply into it. My editor and I compliment each other in personality and writing style, but that doesn't mean we only praise each other's writing. Having an editor will be hard. You must set boundaries with them, and let them know when they're being too harsh. Don't be afraid to say no to them, just be aware that they may ask you why you've done this, why you want to keep that. If your first editor, even your second, third and so on, can't give constructive criticism without being rude and mean, ditch them and look for another. An editor is there to help you improve your work, pick out mistakes and fine-tune the product, not to bring you down, and you need to be aware of this and make sure you don't let them do so.

I do tend to write a lot when I'm giving writing advice because I want to thoroughly cover every base, although I try not to go on too much because I don't want to bore you. Writing a lot of smaller things first is good. Bound is not my first fanfic, but it or it's sequels may well be my last. I started when I was 14 and I was BAD. I didn't write for HP, I wrote for a cult-like musician-centred fanfiction site and I never finished a story. They were lewd and poorly written, pumped out at 1,000 word chapters, one or two a day. I still have those, but I will likely never go back to them. What I'm saying is, all of us who write, we do it to get the story out of our heads, though not necessarily out there for others to read. Take your time, learn your craft, and figure out your style. I started with first person, and within that story, I had moved to third person, and there I have stayed. Your one-shots are your ‚Äòback-story', your writing history. That said, I always started off being in it for the long game, then fizzled. You have to find the story for you, the one that won't fizzle, and that can be a long journey. You can do something with those fizzled stories if you like, but bear in mind how disappointing it can be to get into a story, then it ends suddenly with the author rushing to tie off loose ends and not doing a great job. You're better off taking scenes, or bits and pieces from that story and turning them into one-shots, or letting them feed into your main work.

I've written 10 pages again üôÑ Anyway, thank you, I will take care (once I get rid of this stupid flu) and happy writing, always.

****** I'll take the advice of setting time for writing and sleeping and work ahaha. I'm finally going to be able to use all the notebooks I bought for some writing that I never got around to. Hopefully I'll actually manage to write down several ideas and not get too bored.

Okay, I'll keep the word count quality in mind. I'm going to have to figure how I do things and hopefully I'll get to adjust chapters based on what my story needs.

That actually sounds fantastic and extremely lucky! I'm half wishing I meet/befriend a British person I can personally ask about all things Brit because frankly I think it'll be hard for me to write about new locations, or behaviors or language without committing errors. I can only read so much about it. I'm glad you found an editor that compliments you! Is this editor first one or did you also look for new ones along the way to finding this one? I'm grateful for all the advice about editing. I've never thought about that part of the writing but I'm going to make it a priority to not be stuck in a loop and find an editor to compliment my style as well and give me them critiques. Ahaha.

Its okay, I don't actually mind all these advise. It doesn't bore me at all. It took me days to think about submitting a post here because I get anxious and feel like I won't get any substantial responses at all but here you are giving me crucial ones and rest assured I'm taking good note of it. I'm going to read Bound! I can't say I've looked for things like this because I mostly read for my ships but I will give this a shot because you wrote it! :) Thank you for giving me all these advice to help me not fizzle out. I'm hoping this time I won't run away from trying to write again.

Like I said I appreciate the advice! You can make it 10 pages and I'd still read it HAHA. Oh get well soon! :) Drink lots of water and rest.

Its currently tabbed on my browser. I'll get to it don't worry. A million thanks!

******* Well, it looks like you've got everything sorted, or you're aware of all the important stuff I can think of. To answer your question, my current editor was my second. I had a go with someone over on ffn and that just didn't work out. They didn't want to do the work and they were a poor critique. I intend to keep my current editor because he is brilliant. I really hit the jackpot with him. Good luck in your editor search. Never be afraid to say no, or ask why. As for Bound, it is NOT everyone's cup of tea. It's a story written mostly for me, so it's for a very specific type of audience. I do try to educate through my writing, though, unlike some other authors (E.L. James springs to mind..) If you do end up enjoying it, don't forget to leave me a comment to let me know you're there, but don't feel pressured to read it if you don't like it.

Anyway, I'm sort of getting better. I have to get up for work now, so I'll be off. Have a good one!

I don't really mind if I flop or anything, this is just for myself and I'm only going to publish it to share and not really to fulfill anyone's idea of how they want a story to turn out.

**** Not really.

Lily's hair is consistently described as dark red and her eyes are emerald green.

Ginny, like all the Weasleys, has flaming red hair. In short, her hair is lighter and brighter. If anything, she's a carrot-top.

Ginny's also consistently described as short and small. At first, this may just be because she's the youngest of the Weasleys but it continues up into /Order of the Phoenix/ when Bellatrix taunts Harry about the Death Eaters torturing "the little girl," (despite Luna and Hermione being present) and /Half-Blood Prince,/ where a vendor offers a medallion to Molly to "[her] little girl" and when Ginny comforts Harry after the battle "a much smaller and warmer hand enclosed his."

We're never given much attention to Lily's height but given that she's never described as much shorter than Severus or James whenever we get a glimpse of them as teenagers, we can reasonably assume she's at least of average height, if not slightly tall.

Then there's their personalities. Ginny takes after Fred and George in appreciating a practical joke and defying authority--though Umbridge being Umbridge, the scale may not be entirely fair. Lily despises the pranks the Marauders and pseudo-Death Eaters pull alike, though she does note that the Marauders don't use Dark Magic.

Ginny is also of a much quicker temper--when she sees someone she cares about get picked on, she's much quicker to intervene and she's not afraid to fight back. She has a well-earned reputation for the Bat-Bogey Hex. Lily threatens to intervene when James attacks Severus, but we don't see her do so.

So, in short Lily Evans and Ginny Weasley no more resemble each other than, say, Seamus Finnigan and Draco Malfoy, as they both have blonde hair in the books.

**** I see no reason why Ginny should look like Lily. It's a weird fanon trope and method for people to say Ginny is wrong for Harry.

Ginny doesn't share Lily's most defining feature--the green eyes--and yes, while she is redhead, people with red hair are perfectly capable of looking different.

And anyway, my mom's a brunette. Is it creepy if I date brunettes? Hair color is just a small part of how someone looks.

** Write and re write as many times as you can.

I abandoned two fics before I published my first, very sweet, little thing I did for a friend, so it was not a serious effort, but my second one, I was determined to have a good time and that is important- writing for fun SHOULD be fun!

So, yes,I started with a small fic and then, I set myself a challenge to keep me going: daily updates. Nowadays I look down at my around 2000 words posts, but it was importnat to get a flow and because the ship I was writing was a niche, I had constant support in form of reviews, kudos etc, so it was very inspiring.

‚Äã

My practical advices:

1. start small, one shots of ficlets are great places to start;
2. do not overdo it with writer notes : keep it simple and direct, if you feel the need to clarify something...you have to trust the audience to come to their own conclusions and, if not clear in the text, the beuaty of a fanfic is that you can always re write. (better re work your text than to have to explain it with a note.)
3. stay aware of your expectations and of your readers: if you are writing but are not, in your opinion, receiving as many reviews or kudos as you thought you should, keep going. Remember that most readers do not leave reviews. Also, if your summary is selling a romance, but you are writing am action comedy, you are bound to hear some discontent. So do not promise something just because you think it will bring readers and then not do it for whatever reason.
4. try to stick for an update schedule: this should keep you and your readers motivated with the story. Trust me, once you miss a schedule and keep pushing it forward, is quite hard to get back on the horse.
5. have fun.

‚Äã

As for breaking up Harry and Ginny- you can either add an unexpected element to justify the departure from Canon that would fit their personalities ( I don¬¥t know, like Harry deciding that he should accept a mission last minute and missing one of Ginny¬¥s games? Then they realize they are not each other¬¥s priorities at that moment in time?) or you can simply have them on a break due to their schedules and having gone somewhat apart, break up amicabily?

Why did you abandon the two fics? I'm glad you found something you liked to write about. Right now I'm having fun writing about the ship I like so I'm taking note of every little idea that comes into my head. I just wish I started sooner hahaha but thank you for reminding me that it should be fun for my part :D

I'm going to try and do away with writer's note because frankly I don't read those myself whenever I read and I only generally look back on it when I feel like I'm missing something. Hopefully I won't need it.

As for reviews, I'm not really expecting anything since I probably won't even bother to share my work. I'd be glad to share anything for anyone willing to read it ahahaha. This is just so I can satisfy my need for a story that revolves my favorite characters ahaha.

I'll try to get a schedule for myself so I don't feel lazy. I have a feeling I'll get lazy if I do miss it so thanks for that.

Hmm, that is actually very likely as well. I might consider using that for my story! I think its a realistic view and it doesn't paint either of them in a bad picture which is great.

** Start of writing what you feel like at the moment. Helps to prevent burnout. Keep it off FFN for the time being if you're just trying to find your style and you're unsure what you want to stick with (unless they're one/two shots, in which case they're good for documenting your progress).

If something really lights a fire under you, try to have a general idea what you want the story to be about from start to finish and some of the major themes. Something I like to do, especially when I'm just starting a new story that will be long, is to write everything I feel like for the first chapter. Then, when I'm editing it I cut out like 10-ish% of what I've written, especially if the chapter is 4K words or more. This forces me to prioritize what really matters to the content and motivates me to learn how to write more concisely in general.

A big thing most people fail at in writing is just getting to the point. As someone who reads a ton of fanfic from a number of fandoms, it can be so annoying to see clear dancing around for the sake of padding or else because the author wasn't sure how they wanted to write their way to the end. A nice trim makes so many problems less likely to happen.

** You should never have to explicitly explain something in a story. It breaks the flow. Just drop us enough breadcrumbs and we'll follow. When you write Harry's POV you're telling us Harry's thoughts on stuff, Harry's feelings and showing us the rest. Harry doesn't have to be objective. Harry talking about Dudley being a pig in a wig isn't. You can just have Harry not want to talk about it. To avoid the bad feelings. Have Harry and Ginny split as an event in the past with no details just some negative feelings. The reader can fill in the details themselves.
