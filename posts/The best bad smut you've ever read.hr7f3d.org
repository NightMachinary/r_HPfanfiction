Other than the like, giant squid nonsense, what are the so-bad-its-hilarious smut stories you've read?

I just put down a terrible one that didn't even have the decency to be funny and now I'm wondering - where's the hilariously bad stuff? I haven't found one in ages and I don't care what the pairing is.

  Draco's at school, and Narcissa is delivered some unfortunate news about Lucius and his fellow Death Eaters. It is a trembling Dobby who has to face her wrath and take her anger, will he live to tell the tale? N/D, Dr/Pansy, implied Dr/Hr.

** Fancy a Fuck? by IIBNF (AKA Bernice) linkao3(289348)

To clarify, the writing isn't bad, but the situation is pretty laughable. Bonus for rare pair: Snape/Hooch. Both prefer their own gender but haven't gotten any in a while.
