I read a story where Harry was adopted by Madam Pomfrey's house elf and was raised at Hogwarts. It was pretty good, but my biggest issue was wondering how the house elves were able to keep secrets from their masters knowing their masters might not approve for that long without punishing themselves. The Potter house elves on the other hand would be loyal to Harry and no one else and would have every reason to steal Harry from the doorstep that night.

  Halloween 1981 and the Potter family has been attacked. But when Sirius arrives, the crib is empty. Harry is missing, presumed dead, but Mipsy knows the truth. She takes care of little master just as Lord Potter's portrait commands her to.

**** I was reading this, but noped out when Harry and Hermione meet pre-hogwarts. Can we just have a fic where Harry and Hermione don't always live in the same district every single time!

I didn't spoiler because I don't believe the part I mentioned had a big part of the plot. Maybe it did, but I didn't read through this

***** It becomes a plot point because they become boyfriend and girlfriend, which is where I got too disgusted to continue. In my mind this is even worse than Harry always living in the same school district as Hermione.

Being childhood friends makes is LESS likely they'd have romantic feelings for one another, not more. I recently learned the term for this: the Westermarck effect. This is strongest for children who spend a lot of time together before the age of six---but UK kids start school at 4.

** Standing Orders (and the Lack Thereof) by shineyma linkao3(23839834)

A Magical Childhood by Kendra James linkffn(5926057)

Somebody put a prompt up here (didn't save the post link but it was [[/u/jaybluefyre][u/jaybluefyre]]'s idea) that Harry hears the names of the Pacman ghosts (Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde) and is whispering them in his cupboard at night, accidentally calling a Potter house elf named Blinky. I haven't seen that actually done in a fic, but I liked the idea.

** I suppose it's possible for House Elf to keep secrets from their masters if they are either order to by a different master (Kreacher never told Walburga what happened to Regulus) or if they hate their master enough (Kreacher doesn't really tell Sirius that he's been in touch with the Black sisters and Dobby doesn't tell the Malfoys that he's been in touch with Harry).

Still point made. They can keep secrets if they want to.

** The Potter family elves play a huge part in Harry's life, which only briefly includes the Dursleys, in this story

[[https://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/]]

Harry Potter the Soulmate Bond - Harry/Hermione

This matches your prompt most because>! Harry is thought to rescue himself from the Dursleys with accidental magic but in fact it was the head Potter elf who does it; they hide that so the elf is not killed!<

But the elves play large roles in other parts of the story and I love them in it.
