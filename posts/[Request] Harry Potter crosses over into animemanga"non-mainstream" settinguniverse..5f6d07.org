Please take note to "crosses over" part. Harry Potters Wizarding world are completely separated from wherever is he turned out. Not an amalgamation of two worlds.\\
Requirements:\\
* No fem!Harry(but if story is truly amazing, you can ignore this one).\\
* Harry not a wuss. Neither in personality nor in magical strength\knowledge. So it probably have to be AU or highly OOC Harry.\\
* Minimum amounts of angst.\\
* No slash as a main pairing.

  A good month before Harry gets back from Hogwarts, Dudley is bored, and stuck for things to do. His friends are still in their term, and boxing practice can only take up so many hours in a day... So when he finds an opportunity to pick up some big money, he wastes no times landing himself in a game of time travel, psychic powers, and a possible death with an unmarked grave.

**** I can't think of many non-mainstream crossovers in which Harry is completely separated from the magical world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817][Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes]] linkffn(5501817) is the most memorable fic I've read that involves a non-mainstream anime universe character being involved into the Potter universe. It's actually the fic that introduced me to Disgaea in the first place. It's finished and a good read.

There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8006548][Stepping-Into-The-Sky]] linkffn(8006548) , which is a Firefly crossover. Couldn't care less about that show but Harry is technically in a whole different universe that takes place in a time a while after canon, even if there is still a magical community.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327][A-Third-Path-to-the-Future]] linkffn(9443327) is an example of an AU Harry leaving the canon universe and going into Marvel's universe. If you ask me x-men and fantastic four aren't that mainstream, or at the very least aren't that commonly used in crossovers with HP.

Sorry if these aren't what you're looking for.

***** "A Third Path to the Future" partially fits, but being a Marvel crossover, it is hardly could be named "non-mainstream".\\
"Something Wicked This Way Comes" not exactly what i was looking for, but i give it a try.\\
As for "Stepping Into The Sky", i don't really know, it premise feels like it would be full of - "oh no! everyone i loved is dead! i failed everybody!". Am i wrong in my assumption?\\
Anyway, thanks for pitching in!

  Some stories start in the most average ways, and this was no exception. How would things change if a certain Devil shared a bench with a certain green-eyed wizard after a hard day of school? Rated M for safety and mature content in second part.

"Awaken Sleeper" summary sounds weird, can you give me little more detail on it?\\

**** You should have been more specific in your request then as these meet everything you listed except the one you said you were flexible on. What are your actual requirements?

If you only wanted an adult Harry, post canon, where the Canon events still happened basically the same as in canon, and no reincarnation effect so Harry is still an adult Harry, then you should have specified such, as you specified none of those things.
