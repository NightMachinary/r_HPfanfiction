If the blood wards on Harry's house were supposed to protect him from anyone wishing harm, how was Vernon able to get into his own house? I understand that Petunia and Dudley were actually blood-related to Harry and therefore exempt from the wards because they were what kept them going in the first place, but Vernon's just an in-law. By that logic, he shouldn't even be able to get in, what with the fact that he seems to be threatening Harry every other second.

Also, am I putting this in the wrong subreddit?


** You'll get different answers here than in the main [[/r/HarryPotter]] section, but it's still valid to ask.

The 'blood wards' or Lily's protection, extended by Dumbledore to be valid so long as Lily's sister accepted Harry into her house, operated to keep Harry from being captured or killed by Voldemort or his forces. It offered no protection against non-Voldemort enemies, as shown by the Dementors finding and attacking Harry and Dudley at the behest of Dolores Umbridge. The protection also did not extend to preventing Harry from being found by other wizards, as Harry had seen a few very grateful old people waving to him as he grew up.

One might say that the protection extended to anyone trying to /kill/ Harry, in that Vernon received a severe shock when he tried to choke Harry at the beginning of Order of the Phoenix. That could also be attributed to accidental magic on Harry's part, though.

I think that's an important point in itself. It protected Harry while he's in *Petunia's* house, not his own house. Vernon lived there before Harry, so when the protections went up he was automatically included as an accepted resident (or he was added by Dumbledore or however it works).

Also I would argue about the lack of protection against non-Voldemort enemies; the dementors attacked outside the house (on a different street, even) and all the wizards Harry met as a child were met out on the street. The protection seems to be limited directly to the house itself, and doesn't appear to prevent anyone /finding/ it, just from gaining unlawful entry. On the other hand, Voldemort and the Death Eaters never try hiding in Little Whinging and attacking Harry when he leaves Privet Drive, which you think they would if they could, but the Order is standing guard in OotP and presumably HBP (and by DH Voldemort's probably just gone "fuck it, I'll wait for his birthday") so maybe that's enough to deter them.

** I'd say that you've hit upon one of the weakest plot devices used by JKR. The "blood protections" are very poorly defined. Many fanfic writers have taken the apparent weaknesses to fuel Dumbledore bashing.

Maybe you'll soon wonder why Harry had to go back after his fourth year, when Voldemort had overcome the blood protections.

*** This last part really bothered me while reading the books. Voldemorts new body contains four things and is hold together by the magic of the ritual: His fathers bones, Wormtails flesh, Harrys Blood and his soul (fragment). Either those protections are not blood but intent based, and only blood powered, or Voldemort could've walked through the door.

It is however implied (through book 7) that the protection the blood protection stems from is the same protection Harry gives everyone with his almost-sacrifice. Which again is directed only against the effect of Voldemorts magic...

- Books 1-3.8: Works
- Books 3.9-7.9: Doesn't Work with the info we got thus far
- Rest of Book 7: Kinda works with what we know now

Meh.

I'll just put it down to bad planing - and poor choosing/planing of the term "blood protection" (that in itself is canon, right?) to create a plot device to force him to stay with his relatives.

/shrugh/ By far not the first messed-up plot device.

**** Now hang on just a second. I read tht and realised something.

Lily's blood protection is active as long as Harry considers his home as the same place where another with Lily's blood lives an so therefore; if Harry decided to live in Voldemort's house then none of the death eaters would be able to harm him because Voldemort used Harry's blood.

Or sm I missing something?

**** Nonjon's theory in A Black Comedy was that Voldemort's rite negated the negative effects of the protection, not the protection effect. So he didn't get burned from touching Harry, but he still can't kill him.

Makes sense to me.

** I seem to recall reading a story in which Dumbledore says the Dursleys /would have/ done harm to Harry without the wards, but the wards stopped the Dursleys from ever /actually/ doing any lasting damage to him, regardless of threats.
