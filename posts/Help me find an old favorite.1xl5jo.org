Hey, guys - long-time lurker on another account, but I figured I'd use a secret username for this one.

I'm having trouble finding an old favorite fanfic of mine - it was Hermione/Snape centered, but with hints of Harry/Pansy in the background. Hermione, in light of a dare issued to her by her friends, snogs Snape in front of the entire Great Hall - and is subsequently ushered into his quarters for "detention." I don't remember just how heavy the bdsm scenes get between them, but I know Snape insinuates even kinkier ones between Hermione and Krum. If I had to guess, it would have been written after the seventh book - because Snape's inner dialogue shows just the tiniest bit of guilt over being able to get over Lily so easily.

I'd love to find the bdsm hp fanfic website I originally found this story on - one with not just full-length fictions, but also framed one-shots between unlikely pairings (no more than a couple sentences each), but I'll be perfectly happy if I can just access the story above once again. It's been years since I've read it...

So - help a fellow potterhead out? Anyone have any leads?
