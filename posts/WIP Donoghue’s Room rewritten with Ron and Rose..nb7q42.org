So I've just recently got back in the fanfic scene and I really want to get some feedback on my idea, since it's been a passion project of mine for the past couple weeks and I've already written the first chapter. Room is one of my favorite books. Combine that with my other favorite books, and my favorite character, Ron. Boom. So here's my plan: it's told from Rose's point of view. Ron was abducted at age 17 after he ditched Harry and Hermione and went to visit Shell Cottage. He is now imprisoned with his daughter Rose is a tiny room with only a television as their window to the outside world. Thing is... it's only muggle tv. Likewise, their captors only bring them muggle stuff (clothes, food, Ron has to learn to cook, etc.) Ron's magic is restricted via him having his wand taken and an enchantment put on their prison. For those who have read Room: it would pretty much follow the basic plot, with Ron telling Rosie the truth, her faking her death to escape, etc. But I'm not gonna just rewrite it word for word, I'm doing my own thing. It's a very loose adaption, mainly focusing on Ron and Rose coping with their freedom after rescue. Ron eventually ends up with Hermione.

Like in Room, Ron leads Rose to believe that everything in Room is “real” and everything on Telly is “pretend”. Yes there would be a reference to sexual assault and Mpreg but /nothing explicit,/ it's written from 5-year old Rose's POV. I can't think of any way around it other than Ron's captors giving him drugs (potions) to weaken him, and having pregnancy as the side effect. This ain't supposed to be some kind of kink, it's supposed to be horrifying and sad and tragic, like it is in the original novel. I've been told that writing disturbing and sad shit is my speciality, and I also read a fic on ao3 that was a short adaption of Room, but with Draco and Scorpius. I loved it, however, I did have an issue in it being too short, too similiar to Room to be its own thing, and it really didn't have as much magic if that makes sense (it was very obviously adapted from a muggle story.)

So what do you think? Any suggestions? I do have quite a bit written already, so if anyone's curious I can post some. I'm very excited about what I've done so far, but I want to be sure that A. It's something people will read and like and B. I make it realistically magical /and/ realistically English (If anyone could beta and britpick for me I'd love that!)

**** You're allowed to write whatever you like. "Whatever rocks your boat" is the saying. However, MPreg is one of the infamous tropes here and personally I clear away from it.

Surely there might be some weird justifiable plot that requires it (which I have not encountered yet), but your setting is not it. For me even before the trope scares me away, the unrealistic setting of it does it. A potion that has a side-effect of getting you pregnant by who knows who? Yeah, there goes the suspension of belief, which is to say usually quite permissible in a HP universe.

The Room has an interesting plot, but I do advice you 2 things. The first one is to really keep it different, and not just a rehash with different character names, which you are in major risk of falling here considering you are forcing everything to stay "muggle". The second advice is to truly ask yourself if the MPreg is really necessary. You want to attract people who liked the Room and, as a second group, Romione or canon shippers. By trying to attract MPreg lovers, you might alienate people in your target audience who do not read MPregs.

I have Rose very attached in my mind to Ron and Hermione, and many people have as well. That's why usually people shipping Hermione with someone else seldom use Rose as a name for a child of Hermione whose father is not Ron. The first question is... Would it be possible to pull this with Hermione as Rose's daughter? Like Ron being kidnapped with baby Rose.

If you really want to go angst and have Ron's daughter not having Hermione as mother, you could actually do it with one of the attackers being a woman.

If you really want it to be a man to man thing... Well... Go on with your MPreg, but if you want to do so, well, at least find a more plausible path than some potion's side-effect. It has to be a clear magic that does this where it is at least explained who is the other biological parent.

***** Thank you for your input! Tbh I'm a bit hesitant to include it, it's just not really my thing. But the Draco one which brought about the idea in the first place did it quite well. I'm just not sure how else to have Ron wind up with a kid in his situation. Along with the idea I had earlier of Hermione being Rose's stepmom.

As for the other parent. It would be Fenrir. With Rose only referring to him as “the wolf.” I've also thought about there being two kidnappers, Fenrir and Peter Pettigrew.

****** As I said, if you really want to go that way, nothing is stopping you. In that case though, I would honestly consider a female attacker who just throws the baby at Ron the moment she is born as a more straightforward approach. Or even Ron being kidnapped with a baby who is not his child but grows fond of and actually adopts once they escape.

Just imagine how do you want the readers to remember your story... "That adaptation of the Room with Ron and Rose" or "That MPreg with Ron trapped in a room."

******* A female attacker, is an interesting idea. Who do you think it would be tho? I also wondered if maybe I should have the kidnapper be a muggle but I don't think that's the way to go.

******** Not Bellatrix, doesn't seem like the type. I would go with OC, closer to Ron's age.

A muggle can work, but you would need to add other stuff. She would need a gun or a big muscle man as accomplice to subdue Ron. And, if you want to keep her as muggle and ignorant of magic, you would have to break Ron's wand by accident.

Using muggles actually makes it easier to hide from the wizarding world, as they rarely pay attention to muggles.

You will also need a solid reason for them to kidnap Ron and keeping them for that long. Even if it's just the woman having a sexual fixation with Ron to sick levels, it would have to be shown in there.

If you going for a non sexual reason to kidnap Ron, and sex just being a game of her. Then, maybe you do need to make them wizards. Like they kidnap him for being associated to Harry, or for being a blood traitor. Or maybe it's just a crazy muggleborn who was abused by purebloods in her youth and wants revenge on the first pureblood she finds.

******** For a female attacker, I'd consider someone that you don't really expect it to be.

Consider the impact that making Marietta Edgecombe a Death Eater could have. She's young, she's bitter about what she considers to be a curse that struck her, thanks to Hermione. She's an outsider, so she has a lot to prove if she joins the Death Eaters, and seperating the Golden Trio could be her way of proving that she has something to offer. You could also twist it, so that she gets satisfaction from fulfilling a personal vendetta against Hermione, by taking her best friend and making him her own, and hurting Harry, who she's still bitter towards.

For a slow-crawling horror effect, you could have Ron starting off with no idea who has him, and slowly realizing. Then for added complication afterwards, there's an enmity between Marietta and Hermione so Hermione could struggle for a while to see this kid as just a kid, and not a symbol of something she can barely even think about.
