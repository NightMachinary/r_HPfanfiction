:END:
I remember starting reading this fanfiction a while ago, but sadly I lost it. I hope someone recognizes it: - In the night James and Lily die to Death decides to spare Harry - Harry goes to live with the Dursleys and often talks to death in his dreams - Death makes Harry immortal

-Harry is not sorted into Gryffindor

Thanks so much!
