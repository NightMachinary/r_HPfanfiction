** I could honestly see the medical use for this spell- a fix for bone shattering curses for example, where it's easier to vanish and regrow the bone than it is to fix it

*** Ehhh. It makes sense until you really think about it.

It's not like there's a rigid “bone hole” between your muscle and fatty tissues for the bone to grow into. It'd be pushing and/or piercing through your arm/hand as it grows from your upper arm down to the tips of your fingers.

That sounds much less painful than just repairing the bones in place and dealing with the minor damage caused from it. Even muggles can do that.

The only obvious rebuttal is “but magic,” but that can be used to hand wave both positions.

If I had to choose the path of least resistance to figure out what's magically possible, I'd assume that using existing but damaged structure would be better than starting from scratch.

**** Like Madam Pomfret said in CoS, she can fix a break in moments, regrowing bones is another story. That other story is apparently a foul tasting potion and a nights rest. Not ideal, but not really a big deal either.

Or just like your first set of bones the replacement bone is rather soft as it grows and only hardens once in place.

**** Well we don't really know how hard ti is to repair a bone that is shattered into thousands of little pieces, it might be a single spell or it might be a spell for each piece. We do know that regrowing a bone is a mostly passive thing where you just drink some skele-grow and be in pain for a day or so while it regrows.

Especially when you're embroiled in a war and have very few actual healers it might make sense to use the solution that uses up as little time of your healers as possible.

Also, I'm not sure if that's fanon or canon but I think there are curse scars that can't be healed, so a bone shattered by a curse might resist direct healing but not vanishing and regrowing. Unless the curse somehow works on the conceptual level and forces the new bone to regrow into the shattered state.

******* If you didn't know the magic behind repairing shattered bones versus regrowing a vanished bone in its entirety, you'd naturally assume that repairing shattered bones would be easier because they both, on the surface, have the exact same problems, but shattered bones are, at least, already there and, relatively, in place.

"But magic," or speculating on the possibly difficulty of a certain type of magic is a non-starter because we simply don't know.

Yes, we know how regrowing bones works. There's no canonical reason to think that repairing shattered bones would be a more difficult process, and common sense seems to indicate that it /shouldn't/ be.

To which my response would be, "But magic." There's no reason to think repairing shattered bones isn't an instantaneous process. There's no reason to think that it /would/ be, either, but this is exactly why these types of arguments are useless.

***** I seriously doubt it's something dumb like "Ossus Reparo", but you never know. Does the repairing charm actually restore something to fully functional condition, no magic remaining, no integrity lost; or does it just glue the object together using magic, which remains in the object?

*** I read a fic where Harry did this. His leg got crushed in a fight with Nagini. Not knowing the right healing spells he got the idea to vanish the bones like Lockhart and regrow them. It 'mostly' worked.

** I've actually read one where Harry vanishes his opponents rib cages. They couldn't breathe cause their lungs would collapse then slowly die. Not sure if that's medically accurate, but I thought it was a cool application of a joke from canon.

*** I think it is medically accurate, for what it's worth. Without ribs the chest wall couldn't support itself, and so would collapse. In turn, this means that our mechanism for breathing- where we create an pressure gradient between the air outside and the air in our chest - would be lost as the chest can't expand to create that negative pressure, and so air couldn't get inside. You would certainly die from the lack of oxygen, probably within a few minutes at most.

** Sometimes, magic is just laughable. It was such a temperamental thing. One incorrect movement could create a disastrous result. If your intent was off just slightly, the power of a spell could cut in half. There were spells that movement and intent didn't affect it. There were spells that if preformed just a little incorrectly, an opposite result occurred.

Harry had learned the lesson the hard way in his second year. /Brackium Emendo/ was a healing spell, one that nurses and healers have used for years to help mend broken bones. When the spell was spoken by Lockhart, combined with his use of jab his wand instead of swirling, it vanished bones instantly. Gifting a painful adventure for the victim.

The idea came to him in his fifth year. He had a nightmare one night of him trying to crawl to the castle with legs made of rubber behind him. The first thought after he bolted upright in his bed was to decrease his intake of dairy. Hermione did mention eating cheese before bed gave nightmares, he wasn't sure if it was a myth or not but it was worth a try. The second thought was of the time he lost his entire arm because of an idiot.

If anyone deserved to have rubber arms it was Umbridge, he tired mind thought as he tried to fall back asleep. After the thought of that, he blinked several times before grabbing the notebook he left on his table and scribbled down a note for him in the morning. He quickly fell back asleep, dreaming of his Defense Professor bouncing down the stairs on Hogwarts.

He didn't tell anyone what he was doing. Hermione had given him a questioning eyebrow raised but never asked. He was sure that Ron didn't notice the difference between the Healer's book and his Transfiguration one. Luna had hummed when she saw him searching for the spell but never said anything. Neville figured he was going to teach the rest of the Defense group healing spells. Which he did, they may come in handy down the road.

It took him two weeks to find the spell. He had snuck into Madam Pomphrey's office while she was tending to a moaning Hufflepuff who had walked into one of the twins' pranks. He had randomly grabbed a few loose books that were sitting on a chair. He tucked them under his cloak and darted out of the wing and to the Room of Requirement. The spell was in the second book of his stolen stash.

He mastered the spell in a week. The room had provided him with dummies that needed healing. Once he mastered the spell correctly, he attempted working on it incorrectly. He found if you used the spell with a slashing motion, it shatters the bones into tiny pieces. If you jab it, it makes the bones vanish. When he combined some of the actions he got interesting results. If you started the spell with a swirl and ended it with a slash, the bone break in half and start growing the wrong way, causing the bones to grow tree-like limbs that broke through the muscle and skin. If you jabbed then swirled, the bones would vanish before starting to grow in different spots of the body. If the spell was spoken with a crisscrossing motion, all the bones would start to form together until all the bones in the body were a single one.

The first time he used it on a living being was when he Faced Lucius Malfoy in the Department of Mysteries. He had vanished the man's leg when started chasing him for the orb. The man went to step on the limb only for it crumble into a pile beneath his weight. He had howled in pain. That, in turn, had Ginny looking to see what happened. She started to dry heavy when she saw his leg underneath his body. It was distorted and stretched in the wrong way.

He had used it again when Bellatrix went to fire a spell towards Sirius and himself. Harry had thrown the spell with a crisscross. Her body instantly froze as her joints fused together. He could hear her attempting to scream as her jaw locked. Though he was sure, he guessed that she died when her ribs no longer moved, causing her to suffocate within her body. Sirius had given him a strange look when he saw what he had done, it turned to a horrified one when he explained it.

It had its perks, Harry mused. It was entertaining to watch how Voldermort crumbled in on himself when he vanished his ribs and vertebrae. Yes, he had nightmares of a flopping Voldermort running towards him for the next few weeks, but the laughter he got from Tonks seemed worth it. Both Tonks and Harry had a strict talking to by Remus and Arthur. Tonks was told off for being childish. Harry was told off for the demented use of magic. Both seemed to ignore the scolding.

Harry taught Ginny and Tonks the spell. They were the only ones who had an interest. Sirius had admitted its usefulness but had turned down the teachings. He mentioned already having too many nightmares, he really didn't want to add to them. Ron had attempted it, but Harry refused to let him learn the offensive version of the spell until he mastered the healing version. Hermione had straight out refused, as did Luna, Neville and the rest of the Defense group.

When they had gone on the hunt for Horcruxes, Harry would simply vanish or toy with the bones of whoever came after them. Soon Voldermort's men refused to give chase after seeing their fellow men solidified and distorted. Voldermort's threats had lost some of their effects after many of his followers saw him in a makeshift brace that kept him upright.

When the final battle at Hogwarts happened, there weren't as many dead members on Harry's side. There were plenty of Death Eaters with bones growing painfully out of their skulls. Many laid dead as the bones that grew off their splinter skulls went inward, penetrating the brain. Several had bones that grew inward piercing their lungs and other vital organs. Many had missing ribcages and pelvis. Those who were still alive after being hit with a misused spell were laying uselessly waiting for death.

After the victory, the use of the spell was banned unless you had a license. Harry, being one of the holders, was the main teacher for the spell. Ginny and Tonks were also holders of the license. Tonk's rose to head Aurour as Harry split his time between the Aurour's office and his research. Ginny became a field medic, typically waiting behind the lines until she flew out to her patient. She used the spell both for healing and cursing.

And to think, it was all because of an idiot.
