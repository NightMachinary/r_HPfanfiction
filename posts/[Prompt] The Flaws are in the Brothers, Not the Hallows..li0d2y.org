The Eldest Brother, who was a combative man, demanded Death's own Cloak of Invisibility, that he might bring his wrath upon his enemies in secret. The Bother traveled on for a week more, before coming to a village wherein resided a fellow wizard with whom he had often disagreed. Shrouded in his cloak, the Eldest Brother fell upon his rival in the middle of the street, striking him dead without warning. He proceeded to an inn where he drunkenly boasted, spreading the tale of his ability to strike from any shadow and divine any secret.

That night, while he slept in his bed, a thief came upon him in his room and slit his throat, and then, taking the Cloak of Invisibility, vanished.

And so Death claimed the first Brother.

I was thinking about how the problems of the Deathly Hallows aren't in the artifacts, but in the Brothers, and started contemplating different arrangements of the Hallows and Brothers. If the Cloak of Invisibility was the blood-soaked artifact rather than the Elder Wand, what sort of legends might it inspire? What figures would have claimed it over the centuries. What names might it go by? The Death Shroud, The Cloak of Destiny? Would the wand chosen by the youngest Brother that he might defend his family, fade from memory, long thought lost?


** I think the wand would go to the second brother, so that he can revive his lost love. It's known as the wand of false life or similar and he used it to revive his lost love's corpse, but could not return the soul, so was stuck with basically an unrotting inferi. Disgusted and heartbroken with the horrendous act that he'd committed, he put the corpse back to rest and soon joined it. And so death claimed the second brother.

The third brother decided differently. He wanted merely knowledge lost to time. So he asked for a way to speak to the dead. And so death gave him his ring, and upon turning it three times he could speak to a dead person for a time, and learn from their mistakes. With the wisdom it provided he built up a large library of knowledge before, being too old and tired to carry on his work, he passed it on to his son to continue the work.

Something like that, anyway. I think with this change the potters would be solid Ravenclaws and the Gaunts may even have a respect for keeping graveyards undisturbed due to their ancestors actions. The cloak would be the assassins cloak, and would have a history of betraying its master at the worst possible time. Dumbledore would be much more of a spymaster than in canon, and the duel with Voldemort (if it took place) would be much more of a duel of wits than power, with Dumbledore disappearing and constantly striking from strange angles, bouncing spells off mirrored surfaces to make it seem like they came from different directions etc.

*** That sounds amazing. Canon clearly favors Gryffindors and focuses on bravery as the good ideal to aspire to. Major plot points, struggles between people, etc are decided through bravery and physical ability or might.

But a Ravenclaw-focused world would be a more knowledge-based fight, with maybe people using obscure protection spells or the solutions to problems relying on secrets found in history books. Obviously it's not believable or necessary for everyone in this universe to be nerdy geniuses, but maybe the ones who are get to achieve great things in history like how some owners of the canon Elder Wand were famous and powerful Dark Lords. Hermione, as the smart one, gets to contribute in canon through getting the trio through school work and with her spells/bag/plan when they are on the run. I'd like a world where that kind of focus on Ravenclaw ideals is a thing more than one person does.

Similarly, with a Slytherin-focused world, I could see more of a convoluted politics, or strategy being more than Ron's quirk at chess. Like, it's weird that in canon Ron is described at being a genius at chess and strategy, but in the whole story he doesn't come up with a winning plan to defeat Voldemort or trick the Death Eaters in some way. There is strategy and deception in canon, and Albus arguably exhibits this the most, but nowhere in canon do they say oh yeah being Slytherin would be highly useful in this war and maybe we should cultivate this in our students so our society doesn't fall prey to another Dark Lord. Yoon Ha Lee's Ninefox Gambit is a book series where there's that focus on complicated deception/strategy.

A Hufflepuff-based world doesn't come easy to my mind, just bc it seems like it'd be hard to get good conflict out of a world that has always prioritized harmony, loyalty, and hardwork. But I guess something like Game of Thrones, where intense loyalty to Houses is a thing, as well as dedication to hard work like being on the Wall or any number of the professions like Magister/Priestess of the Flame/knighthood/Faceless assassin. That still has too much Gryffindor might-make-right to be considered a Hufflepuff world. But maybe the Hallows would reward families that managed to take care of all its members. Like the Black family would be just as numerous and powerful, but maybe healthier, and there would be many magical families like it. It could just be a happy story where nothing happens because everyone is friends. Or maybe the world is mostly like canon except the few times a Hallow let someone use cooperation to keep them safe or build their power base.

But yeah, I'd like to see a variation on the Hallows where they do different things and maybe downstream effects create an AU where some other Hogwarts House has the hero/heroine.

  i mean in a huffelpuff world you could have it so magic is super hard, so only the hardest working actually becomes proficient at magic.

**** A Hufflepuff centric world would essentially be the same as Gryffindor, but with more people valuing loyalty. So Regulus would've alerted Dumbledore after Kreacher told him about what Voldemort did. Snape would be the most interesting, however, as would he value his life long friendship with Lily over the Dark Arts? Or would his hatred of James Potter drive him to become a new Dark Lord after Voldemort's downfall?

As for Dumbledore, does he go to Grindelwald for help in fighting Voldemort during the first war or does he decide to found the Order of the Phoenix like in canon? Would that be Grindelwald's way to achieve redemption for his mistakes he made when trying to create a Wizard dominated world? There's a lot of potential there, but it's just a case of choosing where it would start

*** the potters could still be doors of the griff.

they are bold enough to push magic forward no matter the risk.

Or perhaps they use the wand with the wand being completely loyal to the family.

** It would be interesting for the third brother to have the wand and thus have the Potters pass the wand down. It would make sense then for the Potters to be known for their powerful battlemages or duelists.

It would also give reason for James being very arrogant in his youth, understandly as he comes from a long line of powerful mages.

Perhaps when Harry Potter is introduced to the Wizarding World he hears a voice leading him to a dark dingy wand shop or old artifact shop in Nocturne alley, where Harry finds a wand that has never allowed anyone else to even touch it for 10 years (Maybe James did not go down with a curse and instead caused the whole town of Godrics Hollow to go down in battle as Voldemort attempted to defeat his vanquisher before he could even come of age. Or maybe the wand just transported itself to a random location after its previous master failed to defend himself from his attacker).

It would make for some interesting years at Hogwarts for Harry, having a wand that could possibly make his magic stronger and the basic spells alot easier. He would live up to the publics expectation of the Boy Who Lived being the next Merlin. His early years at Hogwarts would certainly be different, he would get use to the power of the wand and in being superior than all his peers in most aspects of magic. And perhaps in his later years he has to go through some trial that leaves him without the Wand. Having to get used to the power of a normal wand, causing him to get all sad and angsty until he gets the wand back (or maybe just realizing that the power was inside him the whole time)

** I think there's a super Carlin brother video that theorizes that death was always trying to killl the brothers for best his bridge or whatever that's why the elder wand doesn't really work and keeps losing. And the only brother who lived was the one hiding from death. The hallows are trying to kill its owners. I thought it was a neat theory
