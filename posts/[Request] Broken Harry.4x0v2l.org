  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

** There is a fanfic that is literally called linkffn(Broken Harry). I personally think it is a terrible fanfic, and I don't recommend it, but it also fits your description.

Edit: Sorry, I got confused. That is not the fanfic I was trying to link, and I got confused about it's name. It was actually Brutal Harry.
