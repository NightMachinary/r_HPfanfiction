Gen or shippy, I don't mind, but no Snily because ick.

And when I say IC, I mean IC. Snape isn't some tragic, all-around victim, and nor is he a glorious hero: I want him sharp and bitter and his generally terrible, not-a-good-person self, with all the numerous flaws that comes with. Also please, God, nothing where he was deeply in love with Lily.

I can think of literally two writers out of hundreds who can do Snape well, so I know it's a tall order, but thanks in advance.


** I love bitter, complicated Snape as a character, so here are some of my favorites:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/][I Know Not, And Cannot Know, Yet I Live and I Love]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles]]

I have also written a number of stories about him, so here are some of my most Snape-centric stories with minimal shipping:

*** I second linkffn(I Know Not, And Cannot Know, Yet I Live and I Love). It's just brilliant and one of my favorite fanfics now. The author doesn't shy away from portraying Snapes flaws, and at the same time makes him out to be really human and gives an insight into why he behaves the way he does. The interactions between Luna and Snape are just hilarious (at least in the beginning) and sweet and emotional. Can't recommend it enough.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I think you're already familiar with Delphi's work, yes? Because Delphi is my go-to writer for a very human and three-dimensional and even sympathetic Snape, one whose attitudes and sense of self are inextricable from his working class Muggle upbringing. Her version of him pushes all my characterization buttons, in part because she's absolutely unblinking and unapologetic about his flaws. She doesn't try to apologize or make excuses for him, nor does she minimize his capacity for cruelty or his emotional stuntedness. Her stories about him are brilliant.

Moving on: here's an interesting gen fic by Caecelia, in which the prose and descriptive passages mirror Snape's diseased soul and dwell on his obsessive, neurotic side:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/342011][The Azote Principle]] linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/342011]])

Here's a disturbing fic about Severus' home life in the Easter hols during his last year at school. It's more about what shaped and twisted him than his own innate awfulness, if that matters. Warning for incest.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5713][Playing for Keeps]] by vissy linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5713]])

What's your tolerance level for Snape/Harry? Does it break your suspension of disbelief or repel you the way it does most of the regulars here? Because I have a few fics I could recommend, but I won't post links if you'd find them distasteful.

**** Delphi's one of the best writers in fandom, IMO, so I can't promise quality on the same level. But here are some Snape/Harry fics with the kind of dynamics that most appealed to me:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13439][In Between Days]] by atrata. This Snape is intelligent, ruthless, cruel, amoral, angry, and intensely sexual without being prettied up. He kidnaps Harry under a plausible pretext and proceeds to bully and seduce him out of his post-Sirius depression and into a kind of dependence. It's disturbing and fascinating, and Snape is like a force of nature. Harry is 16 in this fic, so YMMV.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/752763][Kestrel]] by lomonaaeren Epilogue-compliant. Harry's son James seriously damages his hand, and Harry approaches Snape to create a prosthetic limb for him. Snape is brilliant, cold, suspicious, and unwilling, and he drives a hard bargain.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2590][Reconciling Lily's Eyes]] by persepolis130. This one is slightly bonkers and may be an acquired taste. Snape is a basket case, Harry is a stubborn dingbat, and the sex scenes (and physical descriptions of Snape) are the most hilariously grotesque I've ever come across in fandom. The first chapter takes a while to get up to speed, but the deadpan humor and sheer batshittery are unique. Obviously a comedy but of a very sardonic kind.

You might also try [[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion series]] by alchemia and bugland. It's an abandoned WiP and another acquired taste, but it's inventive, complex, fascinating, amusing, and intense. The characters diverge from canon early on, although they remain recognizable. You can try the first "book" of the series to get a sense of it, but be aware it gets progressively darker after that. The chapters alternate between first-person Harry and Snape, and Harry is underage in this fic (15, I think).

Now I'll stop spamming you with recs and hope for the best.

****** That's one of the fics that yanked me into Snarry fandom, lo these many years ago. It's pretty fantastic, although it left me with unrealistic expectations most other Snape fics couldn't quite meet. The majority of writers can't commit to such a fierce, clever, morally grey version of Snape, and after canon made his story all about Lily, it buggered up the characterization even more.

You're welcome for the recs. If you ever get a hankering for more, there are a few others I can add to the list.

** First, I'd like to point out that Snily is canon, and that there exists good Snily fics where Snape is IC and non-sappy. That said... well, it's probable that you've read most of these already but I recommend:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2027554/1/In-Blood-Only][In Blood Only]] by E.M. Snape. Snape is Harry's biological father. Snape and Harry come to terms with this while both staying in-character; Snape in particular is satisfyingly nasty. This fic came out before HBP, so Snape here is very far from deeply in love with Harry's mother.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/160996][In Infinite Remorse of Soul]] and its sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/161012][And Mine the Gall]] by perverse_idyll. The relationship between Dumbledore and Snape is darker than simply mentor and prodigal son or commander and follower - and their story continues into the afterlife, into rebirth...

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5535125][His Servant's Return]] by terri_testing. Snape's return to Lord Voldemort and the arguments he spins to convince his old master of his loyalty.

Finally, [[http://deeply-horrible.livejournal.com/][Deeply Horrible]] is a site specifically dedicated to Nasty Snape recs. Here are two aggregated fic rec posts there: [[http://deeply-horrible.livejournal.com/19985.html][BBB Master list]] and [[http://deeply-horrible.livejournal.com/1080.html][Bastard Snape recs]]
