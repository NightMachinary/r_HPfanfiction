** I dont know why, but sometimes i just want a good WBWL fic, where Dumbledore isn't a dick, the potters are their canon good selves. Harry and his brother are close. MC is Harry, and in the end Harry kills voldemort because he is his brothers right hand man, thus forfilling the prophercy.

Why cant Wbwl fics not be good happy stories where Harry still wins, just have Potters against the world, instead of everyone against Harry?

** The best of what you're going for is, of course, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

#+begin_quote
  let's say Harry befriends a Suspected Death Eater's Kid. Harry wants to bring this kid home, and his parents are adamantly against it. Even if they did think Death Eater's Kid was a good kid, they might be concerned about the parent using the kid to slip an attack in. So Harry's friends get blocked at the door, but WBWL's friends get to come right on in.
#+end_quote

This is plausible, but only slightly. The actions of Peter (and Snape) in addition to the war /should/ make them more paranoid, but they should also be wiser. During the war, they trusted Peter implicitly /because/ the saw him as weak. They distrusted Remus because he spent his days surrounded by werewolves. As such, they should either trust their judgment or trust only a few people, which excludes the brother's friends as well. It's also pretty hypocritical and, if you do go this route, Sirius (or Remus) should point this out.

Maybe let the DE kid come over after a chat with Sirius, but have the seeds of favoritism be planted in Harry's mind still?

#+begin_quote
  bigger head than normal who can be pompous and bratty but has their heart in the right place. Think of a Duddly who isn't a bully but actually has a strong sense of justice
#+end_quote

So, like a mix of canon Harry and Cormac/Percy? This is fine.

**** Oh, no, what I meant by Snape and Peter wasn't necessarily about the prophecy. It was more about James and Lily trusting people who turned out to be untrustworthy while not trusting those they should have been.

And you're welcome. Happy to help.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** I enjoy WBWL trope a lot too. I've yet to find a perfect WBWL story though hah. Most of the things that I hate when reading you have listed already.

One more thing that annoys me in these stories is when Harry gets overpowered and infallible. The sibling-who-lived gets lazy and complacent but Harry gets super focused on his studies and eventually becomes crazily skilled. Up to a certain degree it is plausible but when he is a master occlumentist, a potioneer and an animagus, all at once and and in addition to being few years ahead of his peers, it becomes ridiculous. It is also tiring if Harry never fails, all his plans work as intended and he always wins over his opponents.

** Hi there, so, just a general word of advice from someone who has written a WBWL story that got some attention. The fans/readers you get for WBWL are a new sort, mostly because the concept and trope for WBWL is so heavily known. There will be absolutely savage flames, and you will likely (despite your best efforts) distress or infuriate a lot of your readers. I'm not trying to throw you off your game or discourage you, but it's best to mentally prepare for the rapid response and reception while writing. Aim for a percentage of reviews (60% positive) or a ratio of kudos to chapter counts if you're on AO3. Focus on the positive reviews, and ignore the flames. Accept the analytical help from people who will always emerge from the woodwork. Don't shift your plot or timeline based on how impatient people are, or no matter how much fans demand.

WBWL is a vicious genre to work in, as is most dark fics. I've talked with a few other authors of darker Harry Potter works, ones that are popular for good or bad; it's always a similar story. It's a rough start, but once you start writing and posting, remember that you're writing for yourself, not a nameless face who will always say that you are writing crap.

** Wow, This sounds really good.

I usually despise WBWL fics but this sounds really good especially this part:

#+begin_quote
  One example, though--let's say Harry befriends a Suspected Death Eater's Kid. Harry wants to bring this kid home, and his parents are adamantly against it. Even if they did think Death Eater's Kid was a good kid, they might be concerned about the parent using the kid to slip an attack in. So Harry's friends get blocked at the door, but WBWL's friends get to come right on in. At a young age, Harry would see it as his parent's favoritism of his sibling. On James' and Lily's end, they have a tough time explaining to a young kid about these types of dangers and stuff--also, /perhaps/ they are paranoid.

** linkao3(14603382)

linkao3(A Tale of Two Brothers)

This is a relatively new fic that caught my attention. It's WIP.. The reason I'm linking this fic is because it has a genuinely nice twin. Slight James Potter Bashing..

This is SLASH later on, though I must confess, I started reading the fic for WBWL trope and not because of Harry/Tom Riddle.. There hasn't been any relationship up until now.. (IDK what the author is planning later on, so I must warn you in advance.. )

  Harry Potter was not the boy-who-lived and therefore he was not the favored child. No, his twin brother Nathan Potter was, and Nathan was easily loved by all, including by the supposedly emotionless Harry Potter himself. Harry had no time for jealousy, nor was he jealous of the brother whom he loved dearly. He would have no time for such emotions, nor would he be given the time to simply enjoy his childhood as his early youth as heir to an ancient and most noble house was spent under the guidance of cold and strict tutors whose lessons forced him to become a rather emotionally detached young man. However, perhaps his friends could help him learn what it meant to have friends that weren't his brother. And maybe, just maybe, guidance from professor Snape, and upperclassmen could help Harry become the empathetic Healer that he knew he could be.That is if he can learn to navigate and cope with his visions as a seer and not fall victim to Voldemort's ever growing obsession with him that may very well lead him to insanity.

** linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) has a very interesting premise. It does feature a manipulative Dumbledore, but it doesn't come out of nowhere. And it introduces a lot of different magics. I don't think it really fits into what you want to write, but at the same time it could be worth a read for inspiration.

** u/StarDolph:
#+begin_quote
  The concept of Harry Potter's parents being alive and him having a twin who is the "important one" has always snatched my interest.
#+end_quote

Why the hell is this WBWL? "Wrong Boy Who Lived" should apply to the prophecy applies to Neville.

Maybe it is because I honestly never got the appeal of giving Harry a sibling or somehow making him alive alive parents and still suffer his relative abuse, but how the hell did that become the WBWL trope? Was there just a story that did that and everyone copied?
