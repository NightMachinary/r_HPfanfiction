Thats why they run Gringrotts. From what we know of Canon, we've never seen the goblins do anything with the gold, like most banks do. They just collect it, which gives them power.

It was a well-known fact that goblins loved gold.

It was less well-known that goblins were the best metalsmiths in the magical world.

It was a well-known fact that goblins were bitter towards wizards.

It was less well-known that magical power used to be dictated by the amount of goblin blood in a family.

It was a well-known fact that goblins used wandless magic.

It was less well-known that goblin magic was stored within precious metals. Merlin, their life force was tied to the first precious artifact they grabbed outside their egg.

-------------------------------

Gringotts bank was safely secured, that much the wizards knew. The wizards did not know, however, that security was issued even before they walked through the doors. Every goblin, from the lowest teller to highest officer, was connected to the store of power within the safes of Gringotts.

Goblin magic was stored within precious metals. They were capable because their magic seeped through every inch of earth, enabling raw power and wandless magic. Anywhere they walked, magic reached up in strands, ready at a moment's notice. There was never enough. But that's why every goblin carried a priceless artifact from birth on their person. Without it, they would disappear from the tangible plane.

This secret was freely passed from goblin to wizard, allowing for co-existance. Half-goblins would be praised for the raw magical power of their parents. When paired with the persion of a wand half-goblins were well-sought.

But the wizards became greedy. They stole their artifacts. Kidnapped their blacksmiths. Wizards knew goblins loved their gold but failed to reason how essential it was to their life. Their population became scarce and half-goblins became de-valued due to poverty. Goblins became slaves soon after the birth of Jesus Christ.

Wizards' re-creations of goblin metalwork failed to slay the beasts of the Arthurian era as they did. Merlin Emrys died in the 6th century because wizards failed to understand that a goblin's magical core was only used consenually.

There was a war. The wizards wanted the goblins' power. The goblins wanted freedom from slavery. Neither won.

But the goblins did become free, at a price. They were confinded to municipal locations were the gold was flowing and the ground was dug upon. Their magic was to be stored in galleons and sickles rather than ducts beneath the ground. Wizards hated them because of their selfishness, but what were they to expect when wizards had taken their benevolence for granted?

Very few goblins could yonder to countrysides because their was little gold there. Poverty in a village would mean illness because all the valuables had been dug up when wizards tried to re-create the goblins' metal works.

But maybe, someday, they'll forgive each other.
