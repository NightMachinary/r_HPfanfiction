I had an idea for an angsty Star Wars/Harry Potter crossover. Basically, the idea is that Obi-Wan Kenobi (right before Phantom Menace) went through a wormhole and found Earth. He somehow met Lord Voldemort and became interested in his philosophies. Obi-Wan had a lot of self-loathing for being a Muggle himself, so he fell in line with the Death Eaters and started killing Muggles, Muggleborns, blood traitors, etc. Voldemort didn't allow him to be a Death Eater with status, but he allowed him to work with Greyback as a lower tier grunt (mostly because he was interested in Obi's force powers).

Anyway, Snape and Lily are still friends, but Snape is starting to drift toward Voldemort's radical beliefs. One day, Obi-Wan tries to kill Lily, but he saw the future and saw how her love for Harry would defeat Voldemort. He kidnaps her and takes her to Voldemort. Now, Snape needs to get her back.

But here're my questions.

1. Would Snape directly confront Voldemort?

2. Since Snape is sympathizing with Voldemort's beliefs, is it still in-character for him to try to rescue Lily? Or would this be a struggle between his feelings for Lily and his views on Muggle borns?

Thanks for your help.

Okay, there's potential there.

#+begin_quote
  met Lord Voldemort and became interested in his philosophies
#+end_quote

Maybe academically I can see it?

#+begin_quote
  Obi-Wan had a lot of self-loathing for being a Muggle
#+end_quote

Uh

#+begin_quote
  so he fell in line with the Death Eaters and started killing Muggles, Muggleborns, blood traitors, etc
#+end_quote

I'm going to stop here.

This makes no sense for an actual plot. Obi-Wan at this point is a /25 year old Jedi Padawan who is either ready or near-ready for the Jedi Trials. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for him to be infatuated with Voldemort's ideology or be filled with self-loathing for being a Muggle/ (by the way, being Jedi > being wizard). There is no situation possible for /the canon Obi-Wan Kenobi to begin killing people due to their parentage or lack of bigotr/y.

EDIT: Where did all those asterisks come from?

EDIT 2: Why did my quotes formatting fall away?

*** I don't think being a Jedi trumps having magic (more versatile and can mimic most kinds of force abilities). That aside, this is spot on. I mean, there's nothing in Obi-Wan's history (much less at this point) that would make him vulnerable to this.

And if we're going to insist on him being a Muggle... why on earth would he be drawn to the Death Eaters? They hate muggles, not accept them in their ranks...

Telekinetically break the wizard/witch's wand. Real-time battle precognition. Just to name two things.

***** It all depends on how you make the crossover works, as with all fantasy vs. fantasy crossover, but these problems are easily nerfed if you don't want all Jedi vs. wizard battles to be a curbstomp.

The most obvious way to go about a /Star Wars///Harry Potter/ crossover not involving dimensional travel is to assume the Force and magic are /the same thing/ --- except Jedi use it wandlessly to a degree barely approached by the likes of Dumbledore. Obviously this requires a bit of blurring the lines on either side, but it works well enough.

And if you assume that, then Jedi precognition is something wizards /can/ achieve if they study Divination (though this demands that we ignore the "only Seers can do Divination" HP thing), though far fewer wizards have a good grasp of it than Jedi. Similarly, you never see /spells/ targeted at the opponent's wand in HP aiming to damage it, so presumably wands are immune to harmful spells to an extent; hence you could easily say this is also true of any Force-based attacks at the wand short of really powerful Dark Side stuff.

Overall, in this scheme of things, Jedi are more resilient if you drop both the Jedi and the Wizard in a locked room naked, but a wanded wizard has versatility to make up for a Jedi's deeper understanding of his powers. A competent Legilimens can read minds more efficiently than a Jedi, the Imperius Curse trumps the Mind Trick any day, Jedi can't Transfigure stuff, etc.

***** Kill the Jedi with a Killing Curse. Or cast a Blasting Curse at the level Pettigrew did (levelling a street). Precognition doesn't matter if you can't physically avoid what you forsee coming. :)

Anyway, I wasn't really talking about combat. Just that practically speaking, magic let's you do a lot more things.

Force helps with that too.

Even with everything magic can do, I'd chose the Force every time. To paraphrase Master Skywalker says during /TLJ/, it is so much more than moving things with your mind or controlling other people.

EDIT: Also, I just plain like Star Wars more than Harry Potter, haha. HP fanfiction is just utterly superior to Star Wars fanfiction any day of the week.

******** Yeah.

Have to say, the Star Wars fanfiction scene depresses me so much. I can think of maybe 10 fics that could fit in amongst the best of the HP fandom.

Then again, there are actual Star Wars books, so I guess it works out.

** I echo yargle's concerns about how in-character this all is for /Obi-Wan/; if I were you I'd find a different Jedi for this story. Perhaps a young Dooku? Though the obvious choice is, of course, Anakin himself.

To answer your question though, it is definitely in-character for Snape to try to save her, since he was in pretty much the same situation in canon when he begged for her to be spared and whatnot. It is key that you understand that much like Voldemort, Snape didn't /really/ care about blood-purity very much. He cared about power, about subjugating the "lesser" Muggles, and about getting opportunities to let loose and have fun using Dark Magic. So Lily's Muggle-born-ness doesn't matter to him in his heart of hearts; he just parroted "mudblood" to be "in with the crowd".

I don't believe he would directly confront Voldemort, however, because that's suicide. Snape may be a competent battle wizard, but he wasn't yet quite so good in his youth, for a start, and at any rate he always remained orders of magnitude below Voldemort. Not to mention Voldemort was the one who /trained/ Snape in Dark Duelling to an extent; he knows the tricks.

It would be much more in-character for Snape to attempt /assassination/. Try to secretly feed him a poisonous potion, that sort of thing. Or else, try to get Lily out without letting on to Lord Voldemort; sneak a Portkey to Java into her cell? Fake her death with Draught of Living Death, request to be the one to bury her, actually wake her up and send her on her way to New-Zealand?
