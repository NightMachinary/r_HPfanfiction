So I've been reading fanfiction for a few years now, and one of the few pairings I cannot fathom or comprehend is "Snarry". In my opinion I find Snapes obsession with Lily and hatred of James makes the pairing a little sick and twisted, discounting all the other incompatibilites. I was hoping people who are part of that ship could explain to me the appeal.

I have done a bit of research on the subject and I understand that the power dynamic can be very interesting to delve into as well as the endless similiarities, but I am interested into what other people think.


** As someone who love to read Snarry (and who has started writing Snarry, lol) I would just like to say that I actually don't picture Alan Rickman... Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the man. But I had an image in my head of Severus long before the movies came out. Tall and thin, lean muscle, hooked nose, high cheekbones, narrow face, all hard edges... I wish I could draw. [[http://spinners--end.deviantart.com/art/My-version-of-Severus-Snape-582985469][I found this on deviant art]] and it's pretty close to what I picture, but with stringy hair. I do imagine Rickman's voice though lol.

I'll pretty much ship Severus with anyone. One thing I just love about his character is how little we know about him. He could have been legitimately in love with Lily, or he could have been obsessed with her, or he could have loved her like a sister. We know he hated James Potter, but why exactly? Was James jealous of the relationship Sev and Lily had? Did he treat all Slytherins that badly? Was it solely based on looks? Or maybe Severus was openly gay and Potter was a phobe. We know Sev treated Harry horribly, but again, why? Was it because of how much he hates his father, like Sev said? Or was that just a cover? Was it guilt over Lily's death? An act to keep up appearances for the Dark Lord? You can literally do /anything you want/ with Severus, and if it's written well enough and explained well enough, it can still fit with his character.

** Well, there's a ton of Snarry fan fiction, which also go in different direction. "I have to protect Harry because of Lily, so I do the thing" was popular trop, where "the thing" can be anything from hiding Harry in his own house to marry Harry. I try to remember my fav snarry fics, and yeah, a lot of them go from hate to love, where they spend time together, and understand each other more, and develope a relationship. And "Snape loves Lily" thing is often like "yeah, I did, but it's in past" or "I loved her like a friend". You also can find adult!Harry and Snape fan fiction, and Harry travels to past and starts relationship with young Snape fan fiction. Full sadist and evil Snape, who purely hates Harry and wants to torture him is pretty rare I would say. Bottom!Snape is also exist, so their relationship dynamics are different in these ones.

I love Snarry, because they have so much variations in it. I still search for new stories and discover new trops and plots. A lot of people also interpret Snape in their own way, there's almost no "canon fan fiction" Snape (in comparation, for ex. with Voldemort). But I also like Snape in Harry dynamics in general, so I'm open for any Severitus stories.

TL;DR So much variations, hate-to-love development is interesting

nah, there really doesn't. fandom loves to take one little idea and spin it into a popular ship (see kylux in the new star wars fandom, where hux is /barely/ a character, and yet the ship is incredibly popular) (not that there's anything inherently wrong with this, but it's just a common fandom habit)

** I'm not here to criticize the ship, but I'm not quite sure, why people like a pairing of a teen with an adult 20 years older. Also considering, that Snape practically despised Harry and abused him in the potion class, as well as the fact, that Snape generally was a twisted person, please tell me WHY. Even if we give him a point for following Dumbledore's orders, he is a very cruel person, not just because he lets a teenage grudge hold for decades (Sirius, Remus) as well as transfering that grudge to the son of a dead man, but for letting Death Eaters crucio kids in the school. I never understood his usefulness as a spy, if the Order couldn't use that information (or Voldemort would know about a spy) as well as Snape had to offer as much info in return.

Now people might argue, "ahhh, he was so in love with Lily Evans, that was so brave and romantic", i call bullshit. If he really loved her, he wouldn't have acted like he had around Harry. He wouldn't have mind raped him also. And about his looks due to Rickman or his description in the books, character comes first. Ships can't be based on looks if his character sucks, right? Plus why with Harry?

Because canon has children as the most important characters and a large adult supporting cast. If you insist on shipping the protagonist of the series with someone their own age who had adequate characterization in canon, you can pair Harry with Hermione, Ron, Neville, or Draco. Give it a couple years of wiggle room and you have three more Weasleys and Colin Creevey. At 3-4 years of age gap you get Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour, Victor Krum, and another Weasley, and that's already a questionable age gap.

Between four years and twenty, you get Marcus Flint, Tonks, and two more Weasleys.

You also need to engineer situations where these people regularly interact. With professors, this is easy, and Snape more than most.

*** I'm not much of a Snarry reader so I can't give examples, but I think a big part of the appeal is working around the differences he and Harry have. In personality, age, life experiences, opinions... They're contrasting characters.

We've seen so many brave and noble love interests that it might start to feel stale. A cruel, grudge-holding bully shakes that cliche up. Bad people can be interesting people.

As for Harry, I think it's about Snape's history with his parents, and the bullying he subjected Harry to in school. Moving from that to genuine affection, making amends, etc.

*** Apparently. We're doing well though, the weekly Harry/Fleur request seems delayed and I haven't seen a Harry/Daphne in a while. There have been a lot of generic Dark!Harry requests though. Win some, lose some.
