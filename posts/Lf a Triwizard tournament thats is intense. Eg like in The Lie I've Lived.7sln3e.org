*** This has femslash, [[/u/thecuriouscat18]], in case you count femslash as slash too; some do, some don't. Well, there's not any real romance as of now, so technically there's no femslash, but there are frequent enough mentions of Iris's sexuality.

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Five unique tasks. Eventual Animagus, morally ambiguous, and reasonably powerful fem!Harry. No bashing.

** In my story "Patron", the tournament has four tasks, all of them with an elemental theme. In between the tasks - which are more spectator-friendly as well as safer than canon tasks - there are competitions for the the students who didn't get chosen as champions: Quidditch Tournament, Duelling and Curse-Breaking Competition.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

******* Ah, yep. I have stopped reading stories where Hermione was just arm candy for the great Harry myself, so I get your issue. Harry has his awesome moments in the story, but since he's not a researcher, and since the adults aren't useless and keep the kids safer than in canon, those aren't as common as in other stories. Harry does get to save the day several times, but having him do much more wouldn't have made sense.

** If I remember right, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]], Harry and Hermione manage to derail one of the loops enough that the Triwizard Tournament is changed significantly. It's been a while since I read it and I dropped for reasons I can't remember, so I can't vouch for it's quality. Looks like it's unfinished too.
