This was by far the best fanfic I ever read. I don't remember too much but I'll describe what I can for you. First of all it is a Trilogy. Sirius breaks out of prison when Harry is 8 or so. Sirius and Harry go on the run together. First to Japan then to Africa, then to Brazil. Harry has magical tutors throughout this time including learning jui jitsu in Brazil. They eventually go back to England in disguise (i think). Sirius's name is eventually cleared. Harry ends up with Hermione. Harry defeats Voldemort in battle at Hogwarts then runs away. He get's a masters degree in history in America. He eventually returns to England and has a child with Hermione, eventually marrying her. Sirius marries the sister of the guy who taught them jui jitsu in Brazil.

I loved this story. Anyone remember it's title or know what happened to it and where I can find it?


** God damn I've read this before. I can't remember the title. Hopefully some hero comes through :)
