I'm looking for any fics where things are decisively different in year 2. Maybe the Diary drop goes awry, to the wrong person, or Ginny is discovered too early to open the Chamber. Perhaps the Chamber is opened, but neither Harry (and possibly nobody else) can gain entrance. Maybe the Chamber/basilisk remains entirely undiscovered and things lead elsewhere. What's out there?


** Hmmm, my first thought is Forging the Sword, linkffn(3557725) . Year 2 happens the same, but ends in decidedly different manner.

*Applied Cultural Anthropology, or*, linkffn(9238861): [[/spoiler][Hermione stole the Diary from Draco, Tom liked her and decided to find another sacrifice, and Neville got it as result]]

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463): [[/spoiler][Diary confiscated by Ginny's head of house Snape]]

*Unspeakable Things*, linkffn(6473434): [[/spoiler][Since Lockhard was a DoM special agent, he confiscated the Diary from Ginny right away]]

*When In Doubt, Obliviate!*, linkffn(6635363): [[/spoiler][Lucius tried to plant it on Harry, but Draco somehow got it in the end.]]

*Yes, I am Harry's Brother*, linkffn(8192853): [[/spoiler][Lucius gave it to Percy when the latter tried to suck up to the former, but Voldemort found out soon and reintegrated the horcrux]]

**** The title turned me off initially because I thought it's just another 'Lord Potter' drivel, but the story greatly exceeds my expectation.

Years 2-3 are already very different, the author clearly follows a logical progression of the story instead of slavishly adhering to canon stations, which I greatly appreciate.

** Maybe this isn't what you're looking for, but in my fic, The Serpent's Gaze, canon events are pretty changed up: the diary isn't involved at all, and while the Chamber of Secrets does end up open, it's not done in the same way or for the same reason.

linkffn(11896247) The specifics of it are [[/s][spoilers...]]

This isn't actually what you asked for, but if you generally just want different and more creative ideas where the Chamber of Secrets is concerned, I'd recommend linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300]]). It's focused on Ginny's perspective during the CoS events, and focuses on her and Riddle's twisting of her mind and actions.

***** For what it's worth I would argue that this story has the makings of what could be a very interesting plot line. I would concede that it can be cliché at times, but I think the author at least has an idea about where they want to take it. I personally like how it doesn't just follow the books. You also have to look at it from the perspective in the books themselves they go and try to get Lockhart to help. I've read so many fanfiction over the years that to be honest it is stories like this that I find the most refreshing. They don't just follow the books. Yes it has cheesy moments. I still defend that it should at least be given a shot.

******* I think that it just depends on the author. I don't know how much you have read, but so far there is a redemption of sorts for Ron. If you haven't read this story then don't drag on it. Personally I have problems with Ron, but that is not to say I don't like him. He very much is a real person. This story sort of talks about how he is a real person. No it's not point blank said, but I don't think it needs to be.

I think it is fair to be tired of authors getting rid of Ron to bring in their own characters, but I don't really think that is happening here. I think that it could use some work and that it has its moments, but overall I think it has promise.
