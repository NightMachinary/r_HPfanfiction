I subscribe to the idea/headcanon that Hermione just never got along with Luna and never really liked her. Despite, I'm sure, her best efforts.

I'm not saying she openly disliked or hated her, and I think she learned to tolerate and (in some way) respect her.

*/But they were never friends./*

Hermione never got over Luna's oddities (particularly her belief in things she couldn't prove) thus making friendship impossible.

Ron obviously thought she was a loon too, but he didn't mind her (Ron's just chill like that). Harry obviously adored her, and I'm sure Ginny did too (named their only daughter after her). Then the rest of their friends likely falling in a spectrum between Ron and Harry's perspectives.

But Hermione never liked her and maybe (if she became a politician, you'd hope so) she got better at hiding her disdain. However, by then Luna would have of course picked up on the older womans disapproval of her, her mentality, her beliefs and how she lived her life.

And the only reason this was never an issue was because Hermione never crossed the line AND that Luna Lovegood doesn't give a flying **** what you think of her.

Discuss.

《▪︎》

Basing this idea on the very real fact that Hermione is a surprisingly closed minded and stubborn individual, one who makes up her mind very quickly and commits to those actions and thought patterns until their bitter end.

*E.g: when she off-handly referred to Firenze as a horse when talking to Lavender and Parvati and doubled down on her dismissal of him AND the subject of Divination when challenged. Even though her issue with the subject was arguably more to do with Trelawney (and her stress in third year) than the material, and she didn't even know Firenze (the centaur who'd saved her best friends life).*


** Yes, and did you notice how much hate there was for Fleur? When I was reading the books I was shocked by the nasty comments being made by Hermione, Ginny and Molly! And they were just included in the narrative like they were no big deal.

I never understood why Hermione was generally seen as open minded when there have been several instances that showed her disdain for those different from her, like her dorm mates, Firenze, Luna and Fleur.

Hermione is a great character, but she has her flaws, and I wouldn't label her as open minded considering her tendency for intellectual elitism.

*** Possibly unpopular opinion but JK Rowling doesn't know how to write well rounded women/girl characters there is very little nuance and such disdain for anyone who likes something that Hermione considers beneath herself (makeup/divination/magical creatures). I mean you've got a whole magical world and you can't accept that maybe there are magical creatures that you don't know about?

**** Yeah. I am re reading (listening actually) all of the books for the first time in years, and most if not all female characters are lacking. I hate how all the mothers in the story (Molly, Aunt Petunia, Narcissa Malfoy, Alice Longbottom, and even Lily Evans) are mainly /only/ mothers. Molly doesn't go to the Quidditch world cup, and is always in charge of anything to do with the kids before than the Order of the Phoenix; Aunt Petunia always defers to Vernon to decide things that involve Harry even though he is actually /her/ nephew and not his; Narcissa isn't a Death Eater, only Lucius is (the only female Death Eater is Bellatrix); it is never stated that Alice Longbottom is an Auror, Frank most certainly is and is called that during Barty Crouch Jr.'s trial, but Alice is only refered to as his wife; and when Lily and James' spirits come out of Voldemort's wand, it is James that tells Harry what to do and how to escape, Lily is just a comfort for Harry (typical motherly presence) but it doesn't say or so much really.

Jk Rowling's view of women and their part and role in society is very narrow indeed.

******* If you recall your Greek mythology, Alecto is one of the Erinyes (Furies), which you would then recognise right away as feminine. Amycus is apparently another Greek name (Amykos), though Latinised. He was a king that according to Wikipedia was brave and challenged men to box against him so he could kill him. Not sure how that's brave and not rather bloodthirsty, but so it's written. There's not much about him though.

She pprtrays the male-female friendship very well and gives several of them an important role, but she seems to think women can't be good friends to each other. The treatment of Fleur (by her classmates during the Tri Wizard Tournament and Molly, Ginny and Hermione later) is appalling and unnecessary.

***** I completely agree, but I wanted to mention that Neville's grandmother says Alice was an auror. When the kids visited Arthur in the hospital and they ran into Lockhart.

But yeah.

With Molly, we only see her in action against Bellatrix. In the final battle. I think it would've been cooler though if Molly stayed behind with Teddy and Andromeda Tonks was the one to kill Bellatrix! Like the Molly, stay at home mother, couldn't even cover Tonks' night shift of prophecy watching? Arthur went and did it after his full day of work.

The only real time Narcissa did much was lie to Voldemort about Harry. So that's gotta take some serious oclumency skills, but still. We do see in Half-Blood Prince that Bellatrix doesn't want to mess with her too much.

Aunt Petunia does leave things to Vernon, but I think that's more to show a different between Lily and Petunia. Lily stood up to James as a teen, and we can assume she would do it as an adult too. And while we know that Vernon didn't want to upset Petunia by mentioning Harry in the beginning of book 1, it seems that Petunia becomes very submissive to Vernon as the years went by. She even seemed frightened when she mentioned know what Dementors are.

Alice, we know nothing about, except that she was an auror, in the Order, defied Voldemort three times, didn't tell Bellatrix and co. anything while being tortured (it's not like they even had much information to give, but still), and that she's now incapable of doing much. And yet, she's a comfort to Neville when she gives him a gum wrapper.

And again, Lily. Shown standing up to James in 5th year, but then she fell in love with him. She was an Order member, and also defied Voldemort three times. We know that she was okay being left with Harry alone (she said that the only reason James couldn't go out was that Dumbledore had the cloak. So she's not exactly against it.) And she refuses to let Voldemort kill Harry before her. But in her mind, she must've known that once she was dead, Harry would be too.

****** I loved that scene when Molly kills Bella, and I was super happy about. But from a literary stand point it seems forced, there is no build up to it. There is no indication what so ever that Molly is a good enough dueler (ok, thia might not be an actual word) to fight someone like Bellatrix. Either Molly was able to fight her so well because she was defending her daughter (once again being a mother more than anything else), or she is actually a really good witch, with special talent, that she chooses to completely ignore for years and years to take care of her family. The last option is valid as long as that sacrifice is explored in the story, but the character is never shown to have any conflicting thoughts or feelings about it, which reinforces that whole stereotype of a woman giving up everything to be a wife and mother and loving it too!

I don't mind Molly being a stay at home mom (I am one), but she shows no interests or activities or indeed friendships outside of it. That's just awful. For me it was the Quidditch World Cup the thing that stood out the most. Why doesn't Molly attend as well? She doesn't like Quidditch even? Her whole family plays it, and is a fan and she has no interest in going to the World Cup?! Come on! Hermione goes and is invited and she is always remarked to be uninterested in Quidditch. Arthur got the tickets as a favor from Bagman and he didn't count his wife? Instead Molly goes to Diagon Alley to buy everyone's books for Hogwarts. Was that really necessary? She stays home even in a case like this? Rubbish, as Ron would say.

********* When I look at fanfic Mollys I notice, I guess, three things (not necessarily/usually in the same fic):

1. she's presented as having wanted a girly daughter... which Ginny isn't
2. she's an ex-chaser herself... I want to say she got badly injured, but I don't think that's in there
3. she's either a complete prude who hates closed doors or is best described as "moar grandchildren"

I'm not sure where the first part of 3 comes from but it's so common (even in highly canon compliant fics) that I must have forgotten something important. But either way, we're given an interpretation for Molly's actions. On one hand, she spends the time trying to ensure no hanky-panky happens and, on the other, she convinces Ron to have Hermione come along as some sort of grandplan. Not very compelling arguments, I think you'll agree.

With the second point... I guess watching Quidditch is too emotionally painful if we go with the injury thing.

With the first point... under this interpretation, Molly actively disagrees that Quidditch is for girls (whereas Hermione merely is not into Quidditch) and encourages the boys to /not/ let Ginny play with them. She lets Ginny go because while she has this incredibly sexist opinion, she also doesn't want to stifle her children (given their limited opportunities due to the family's financial means).

The only other argument I can propose is that money was especially tight that year due to the whole dress robes problem and finding the money/stretching it out was an even bigger issue than buying all the Lockhart books.

I'm not saying I agree with these ideas... although I'm pretty sure Rowling was tired of Diagon Alley scenes and just used Molly's not attending to avoid writing one/create Ron's surprise at the Dress Robes... but, yeah. I guess the last explanation is pretty much exactly [[/u/Amata69][u/Amata69]]'s point about the barbecue.

Most people attack her intelligence, which is disingenuous - or they say that she's a mary sue, which doesn't even make sense. No, she is the archetype of "factual intelligence, but no emotional or social intelligence". The only reason she became friends with R and H was because they battled a troll together, which most likely shocked her out of the carefully controlled cocoon she was constructing around herself to keep away from others.

If you ignore JKRs plot-slavery, her character is very well rounded with a few strengths and a few weaknesses.

If written well, she requires a lot of development or an event like the troll to become friends with anyone.

How Fleur was treated, though, is really sickening. Especially because we learn that the whole "bitchiness" was a front to protect herself from weird propositions.

I think that visual stimulus like movies sticks out more in a person's memory than say lines from a book. So some people over time begin to merge book characters and the actors who played them. And I think Emma Watson is some kind of an activist and feminist and people still associate her with Hermione.

As to your original point- some women are just jealous of prettier/ better dressed women. Nothing you can do about it. It's pretty realistic that teenage girls would dislike an older, prettier and foreign woman. As for Molly- no one is ever going to be good enough for her boys. And she did come to accept Fleur after Bill was wounded.

*** My absolute pet peeves about Fleur's portrayal are that:

a) She, like Lavender, disappears from the narrative after accepting Bill in HBP. Of course, it's fantastic that she does accept Bill and I actually like that they showed her unconditional love for him. However, Lupin has a prominent role in books 5-7 and is an Ascended Extra. Not only does he get away with not taking his Wolfsbane, he's actually included in important missions.

Granted, this might be due to length constraints because Bill himself barely appears in DH.

b) Snape's near-obsessive love for Lily is fundamentally unrealistic, but the narrative paints it as not only ‘noble' but fairytale. It would have us believe Snape's redemption springs from his love for a childhood friend, rather than, say, from any internal conviction that the DEs and their methods are heinous. A more realistic Snape might still be a bully (and this too is something I've seen contested in some corners of the fandom). But he wouldn't be the antisocial, ‘mad scientist' stereotype, pining over Lily.

My point is, male characters are /allowed/ to show negative emotions (anger, fear, sadness), and they are often seen as ‘broken birds'. If Bill had died and Fleur had pulled a Snape or if Snape and Lily's genders had been reversed - I can guarantee you we would have heard about how so-and-so ‘has gone mad, and now she's a recluse'. For a female Snape, there would have been no redemptive arc.

I really like how Tamora Pierce portrays Alan of Trebond (Alanna and Thom's father) as grieving his wife. Even in the few pages we glimpse of him, he's shown as being utterly indifferent to his children, to the point of not realising that one of them is masquerading as the opposite gender.

Although a bit exaggerated, that's a much more realistic portrayal of what that sort of grief does to you.

***** Sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent about Snape there.

But I meant that if a female character had an extreme reaction like pining for fifteen years, the narrative would be more likely to portray her as negative rather than a hero or a ‘broken bird' character. Whereas JKR clearly wants us to see Snape as this redeemed figure, purely because of his love for Lily. In some sense, I can understand fandom's reaction to Snape as a ‘stalker', because his degree of obsession is not a healthy one. In real life, only serial killers and stalkers obsess over people as long and as hard as he has over an ex. I am not saying he /is/ a stalker, but that his obsessing over L. is at odds both with his tenacity as a double agent and with the idea that such a love is ‘pure and redemptive' (as opposed to creepy).

/Either/ Snape should be a well-adjusted man (sure, maybe with some tendencies towards favouritism, if you like) and the redemptive hero and double agent. /Or/ JKR should have gone the whole hog and made him absolutely, creepily, memento-collectingly obsessed over Lily. Instead she's trying to have her cake and eat it too. She's trying to say obsession = redemption = true pure love.

Another tangent about Snape, sorry. But my point is, a female equivalent of Snape would never have this push-pull. She would simply not be in the narrative at all due to her gender.

I'm just using Snape as an example. To quote myself from another comment elsewhere:

#+begin_quote
  It's true in most pop culture. Men's anger, sadness and suffering (in fiction!) can be imposing, intimidating and atmospheric in a way women's is not necessarily allowed to be. This is why I love Alan Rickman's Snape - he pulls off a dark, brooding, even melancholy sort of character that is very compelling. And... there is a romantic, gothic quality about these male characters that is consistently absent in female characters. I feel that particularly because of the female readership of some of these books, there is a strong desire to love, fix or comfort a man who acts in such a way; the character is admired, held up as an Iron Woobie or Broken Bird character. There may be an element of identification with the character in their loneliness/pain/misery.

  I can think of several male characters the fandom perceives like this. There's Snape, for one, and Lupin for another (from the first introduction, he's quiet, soft-spoken, obviously poor, obviously suffering). Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is another example, and John Watson from the same series is probably a third. Tobias from the Animorphs also qualifies (yes, let's ignore the fact that he's thirteen in the books: he still has Woobie elements for me, at least).

  Male characters are allowed the space for vulnerability (anger counts). For me, at least, there is a sense that these male characters are justified in their suffering, that it ennobles them. In contrast, the female characters are rarely allowed to indulge emotions that tend towards the romantic-tragic/Keatsian. Lupin's outward softness masks a horrific monster, and yet readers feel sympathy for him.

  Snape is all crunchy shell and gooey interior (Aww, look, he and Lily really did love each other), as is Sirius. In PoA the latter is almost skeletal and more than a little mentally unstable; by OotP he is the lovable prankster and quasi-father figure whom Harry grieves so much. He's not father of the year, but he's at least functional. Both James and Neville develop offscreen (in James' case, it isn't known whether he matured at all - as Terri & others have pointed out, for all Lily knew, he could've been a complete pillock behind Lily's back).

  By contrast Millicent, Fleur, Luna and Pansy don't undergo development, not even “pastede on yay” development.

  Imagine if Fleur Delacour had broken down and become a recluse after Bill had been attacked at the end of HBP (or perhaps if Bill had died) --- if she had harboured a quiet, simmering, brooding rage and sought revenge by retreating to France and planning for thirteen years. (Imagine, in other words, if she'd come over all Snape-ish.) I'm quite sure it would've been treated by other characters as irrational: either part of her innate Veela magic, or as a woman refusing to listen to reason. She wouldn't have been a DE spy, she would've vanished from the story.

  Instead JKR has her protest - to Molly! - that she doesn't care about Bill's disability and wants to stay with him. Which is a great testament to her loyalty considering how catty the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione have all been towards her. I actually like that JKR included this scene and it's a fine example of how she really does love Bill, but she isn't, as you say, allowed to show us any aspect of her emotions other than tears and loyalty/acceptance. Perhaps because of Harry's POV, we don't get a full sense of her grieving process. And we don't see her and Bill again until Harry does.

  We aren't even told whether Lavender is alive or dead after being bitten. Yet Lupin is front & centre in PoA, and prominent in HBP and DH.

She's very dismissive of the more traditionally "girly girls" she meets (Lavender, Parvati, Fleur) as though being feminine is an inherently bad trait. In one of her worst moments imo, after everything that went down in HBP she felt the need to have an "I told you so" moment regarding the identity of titular Prince (she thought 'he' might've been a woman, she was partially right because Prince was the maiden name of Snape's mom).

I don't know why but now I'm imagining a humorous fic about a rivalry between Hermione and Luna for the affections of a totally oblivious Ron. It starts out innocent enough with bringing him little snacks and hugging and escalates to outright flirting and maybe even a catfight Ginny has to break up because Ron and Harry are simply staring. Has there ever been a Ron/ Hermione/ Luna fic? Harry seems to get all the girls most of the time, but it would be fun to see Ron in one of those arrangements without him even realising how it happened.

**** Never to her face, but Harry is rather callous towards her throughout the fifth book.

During the incident with the Stinksap, and Cho walks in on the compartment, Harry reflects that he wishes Cho could have seen him with cool people, rather than Loony or Neville.

This makes a nice contrast in the sixth book, when Harry explicitly calls Neville and Luna his friends, and when Luna brings up their unpopularity, Harry retorts that she and Neville are cool, having fought at the Ministry with him.

He calls her Loony one other time, mentioning her reference to Nargles.

And Harry is short with her when debating how to get to London, but everyone was angry in that scene, so I think we can give him a pass.

Not as apparent when the main demographic and the main character's gender match, but when they don't it's obvious, because they choose someone else and boost their relevance and power to absurdity. Hermione for Harry Potter. Sakura for Naruto. Jaune for RWBY. Greg Veder for Worm. I'm sure there's more, but the smaller fandoms I read don't have the critical mass generally. It's actually why I almost always avoid stories tagged, BAMF!Hermione or BAMF!Sakura. So many of them have super geniuses beyond belief, easily dwarfing even the greatest known characters in their canon at a similar age. Hermione consistently is at or better than Merlin.

#+begin_quote
  She was written as the smart, but very impulsive and judgemental character. Most people attack her intelligence, which is disingenuous - or they say that she's a mary sue, which doesn't even make sense. No, she is the archetype of "factual intelligence, but no emotional or social intelligence". The only reason she became friends with R and H was because they battled a troll together, which most likely shocked her out of the carefully controlled cocoon she was constructing around herself to keep away from others.

  If you ignore JKRs plot-slavery, her character is very well rounded with a few strengths and a few weaknesses.

  If written well, she requires a lot of development or an event like the troll to become friends with anyone.

So essentially it's not bad,but understandable. He is also awful to her before that Lavander business even starts. So she comes across as someone who was terribly mistreated. And as she cries in that bird scene, she is bound to get a lot of sympahthy. The person I discussed this with said that as Ron's jealousy was unfounded and Hermione's reaction had a valid reason, her actions are more understandable.

****** I definitely don't think the book is trying to say Hermione is abusive or even just takes a wrong course of action here. In fact, it's the same as almost everything in the books where bad things are unforgivable only if the motivations are bad. This is obviously explicitly articulated with the difference between /crucio/ and /tarantellegra/ or /imperio/ and /confundus/ (two sets of spells that are less different than they first appear) or the killing curse and anything else lethal, but I hold it applies across /everything/: that at the very least it's Harry's main moral lens (and also Ginny's).

Hermione is given a sympathetic motive, usually, and Ron's actions are presented as coming from a wrong place. Consequently, Hermione is hurt and Ron is hurting... not the other way around.

Most people, IRL, are much more consequentialist than this. Bad things are justifiable if they have good outcomes, not if they have good intentions (which, after all, pave the road to hell). And, similarly, since the books were written, these kinds of issues (domestic abuse) are much more politically charged.

The point is... whatever moral interpretation is meant to be attached to Ron and and Hermione's actions in HBP, the contemporary reader (or, in our case, surely re-reader) is quite likely to come to a different and totally justifiable conclusion.

** The Seventh Horcrux's version of Hermione is, when reflected through Harrymort anyway, an amoral rules stickler. I think the explanation is something like "she follows the rules so closely because she has no moral compass, so when she breaks the rules she sees no difference between little lapses of moral judgement and huge ones".

I'm not saying canon Hermione is like this, and I might be confusing the books and movies here (ugh), but the whole Loony versus Luna Lovegood thing does seem to echo this. Which is to say "Loony" is and remains Hermione's perspective on Luna but she also knows that she shouldn't call her that.

That being said, I'm not necessarily convinced Hermione would disagree with Luna's lifestyle. I'm pretty sure Hermione's experience at her muggle primary school was very similar to Luna's at Hogwarts. Whatever else there is to be said about Ron and (especially) Harry, they are both, in quite (very) different ways, just as obsessive as Hermione. Luna's like that too, just without either a Ron or a Harry.

I just don't think that parallel makes them friends. But, then, I don't think Hermione and Harry are good at making friends in general. Harry, who does become friends with Luna, does so mostly because of shared experiences. Luna fits into his ideas about the world much more easily than she does Hermione... Harry's world has moral parameters, Hermione's intellectual ones.

**** Attacking Ron and the McLaggen stuff aren't in the same domain as "gets more open minded".

For example, a toddler will believe almost anything. You tell them that not only is there more than one Dracula but that a whole bunch of Draculas live on your roof, they will believe you. Toddlers are very open minded. Are they intelligent, mature, sensible and rational people? Not at all.

Firenze and Divination? Well, look at SPEW. On one hand Hermione should learn to pay attention to the "truth" of who she's trying to help. Everyone tells her SPEW's a bad idea and she sees the net effect. On the other hand, SPEW also causes her to start questioning what she learns from books... kind of. Her problems with Divination don't come from books... they come from her third year experiences with it. I'm not saying she was primed to believe it because I think she wasn't (despite, you know, being a time traveller that year but whatever), but I am saying it's not exactly an issue of open mindedness. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Hermione had solid practical and some theoretical reasons to rubbish Divination. That puts her in the same place as Darwin (lacking knowledge of genetics but having good practical data) or Newton (lacking modern physics).

Thus... we're left with calling Firenze a horse. Which, again, is not really an open minded sort of problem. It's kind of judgy and it's definitely a "ignoring their truth" sort of thing, but mostly I would put it in the "suspect grasp of morality" basket. We can disagree about this one, though.

(And note... even though we know there are /real/ prophecies in Harry Potter we don't actually know how "real" they are. Dumbledore has a lot of stuff to say about choices and the ones we encounter appear to have nothing to do whatsoever with Divination as a taught subject.)

*** It somehow never felt to me like she became more open-minded. She accepted, very reluctantly, that hallows are a thing. But to me it seemed like she was sort of 'OK, so they do exist.' But when there would come something else she wouldn't believe was true, you'd again have to convince her that it's possible. I think she sticks to her views, gets annoyed when they are challenged, and then relents if she absolutely has to. Harry even told her that she didn't believe hallows were a thing even after she learnt there were true prophecies. I can't remember Hermione shifting her view on this matter in general.

**** Well, I mean, if I found the argument overly convincing I wouldn't stick it as a single line after thought, right?

I'm just saying I think the picture's a bit more complicated than it first appears, but if I were playing devil's advocate and making "Hermione gets more open minded" a hill to die on I honestly don't know how I'd respond to your points.

** Hermione was a surprisingly judgy person to be honest. I find it slightly funny that fics always show Ron being the one who doesn't accept others and Hermione not caring and still being okay, when really it was the other way round. I still like Hermione, but it's definitely a flaw. I still think she was close but a bit distant with Luna.

** Unpopular opinion here: I ship Hermione and Luna. It's weird, I know. Also if I'm not mistaken they only had two scenes in the books together and both were about them arguing about the existence of some made up stuff in the wizarding world.

Those moments were the ones when I felt that Hermione is pretty much the only person who doesn't just adore her for being weird and childish or ignores her completely, but she actually challenges her beliefs and starts arguing even when everyone else thinks it's impossible to change Luna's mind about anything. It's like if she was the only one who counted Luna as a person.

I think if Luna saw Hermione as a friend, she would never get mad at her for being rude at times, since she knows it's part of her nature. I always saw Luna as the queen of emotional inteligence. I think you're right about Hermione not liking her but I always see them as two people who could get along pretty well as they grow older and find the value in each other.

**** I really don't see them as opposites. For me they both are caring and good people in general and both of them has the same problem, which is the fact that they can't easily get along with others, but once they get closer to people they both form really strong bounds.

** That is somewhat true, for being a witch from a muggle family, you'd expect her to be a lot more open-minded, but it's not her fault, because it's natural to see prejudices even when you are prejudiced against.

There comes this girl, she had a crush on my boy, she is smart, she is going to take away my spot of the smart girl, look, Harry is hearing her, Harry ask her questions, and Harry doesn't see how stupid are that ideas, she is going to destroy everything, aaaaaarrrghhh...

*** I'm pretty sure Ron didn't come up with it. If I remember correctly, when the gang first met Luna in book 5, Ginny referred to her as Loony (not to her face) because she was the only one who knew Luna due to being in the same year as her, which implies that the nickname was already well-established. And Ron wasn't even there because he went to the prefects' carriage with Hermione.
