"Potter and Black" is a series of 8 fics, check them all out.

TBH, the one I enjoyed most was Black Bond(didn't list because someeone already did), but the guy either abandoned or is a coma-like hiatus. Black-Rosier was cool, a bit more smutty than the others, I'd think. And since you don't enjoy Harem, I'm not going to suggest "Harry Potter:RE Life" which has Lily, his twin sisters, Sirius Veela Japanese Daughter and Daphne and maybe Astoria. Its a clusterfuck of a shitty story, but with good lemons, at least for my perverted mind.

  Courage and bravery are always needed, but not always shared in her household. When Cassy begins Hogwarts, it comes as a surprise where she ends up. Content to let things lie, she makes friends that would make her ancestors roll in their graves. Then again, Cassy Black was never afraid of a little controversy.

***** Everyone knows why. Harems are only written to make a male character have a dozen sexual toys, also known as "female human beings." They don't have minds, or lives, or agency, or anything. They're just there for one guy to take them in turns and fuck whenever he feels like it. The only things in their heads are "being completely and totally devoted to him." It's objectifying women in the worst degree, all because the author wanted to get their fantasy out of their head.
