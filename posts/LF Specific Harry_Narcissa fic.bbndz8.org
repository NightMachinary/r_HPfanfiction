I think it was a long, postwar one-shot, in which Harry is an auror and Narcissa is running a Ladies' Society Club or something like that. The Club is putting on a play and Harry is assigned to be her bodyguard and they finally get together after weeks of UST and fighting and the usual. Other highlights include an undersecretary Daphne/Minister Kingsley romance and a Pansy/Viktor pairing. Thanks in advance!
