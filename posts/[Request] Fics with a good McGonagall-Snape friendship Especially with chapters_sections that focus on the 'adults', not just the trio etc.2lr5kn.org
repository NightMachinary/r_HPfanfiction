I know DH makes pretty clear that McGonagall and the other teachers never trusted Snape; but up to that point there was potential for a great dynamic between Snape and McGonagall.

Can we avoid romance between these two characters fics though - I don't know if I can see this as a pairing! Just a friendship I think! Thanks for any recs, crew :)
