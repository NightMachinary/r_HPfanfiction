I'm looking for some good next generation fics. I prefer non-angsty ones, can be action/adventure or romance, but I'm not too picky as long as it's written pretty well. I prefer ones that include the cousins in addition to the usual James, Albus, Lily, Rose, and Hugo, even if they are the main focus (such as in Rose/Scorpius fics). I'm open to pretty much anything, I'm just on a nextgen kick right now and wanted to hear your suggestions. Also prefer no slash, but definitely can be done in tasteful way and not the main focus.

She is also writing a [[http://offspringcodeofloyalty.tumblr.com/tagged/inheritance][full story]] and has written some longer one shots about the Next Gen kids: [[http://offspringcodeofloyalty.tumblr.com/post/23984353485/09-the-interview][Lucy]], [[http://offspringcodeofloyalty.tumblr.com/post/18703071622/05-the-things-you-cant-protect-them-from][Roxanne]], and [[http://offspringcodeofloyalty.tumblr.com/post/15917478898/02-from-one-fred-to-another][Fred II]]. I highly recommend this blog.

Side note, I am in the midst of writing a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8156960/1/Whats_In_a_Name][series of one shots]] on how each of the Next Gen children were named, and it does feature some of the older kids.

** Oh yay! My element! All I read is next gen and Post-Hogwarts. Mostly light stories, hope you don't mind.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] This is probably my favorite. It's a family coming-of-age kind of story told through Rose's PoV, and it features practically every next gen kiddie.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][Morning Waffle]] Big ol' comedy about Fred and James and others running a wireless show, also has a bunch of the cousins. Lots of fun, huge humour inspiration for me.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] Rose/Scorpius action. Muggles vs Wizards sort of story. It's very well-written, though somewhat unevenly paced and predictable. Addicting nonetheless.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] Hugo-Scorpius-Neville adventure in the Forbidden forest. Very charming, if a bit slow.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and His Very Epic Plan]] I'm told is very very good crack, and something I'd adore, but haven't got to reading yet.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=278249][I am Man, Hear Me Roar]] Funny little Dominique oneshot, in which he's a guy.

I know some more, but I'm not sure if they'd be to your taste. If you're not opposed to super minor characters/OCs or plotless crack humour I can rec a few more. Hope you find something you'd like!

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=261706][This]] is a great story, quirky, fun, and a little different. It's about Rose Weasley as an unlikely pregnant teen, while the father-to-be is none other then Scorpius Malfoy. Hilarious while still being serious and realistic.

** Please tell me you've read the James Potter trilogy by G. Norman Lippert? When they were first coming out, the production quality was such that people legitimately thought it was J.K. producing works under another name.

**** Ah bummer, I'm looking for the same thing you are then! Making my way through the second JP now, but know I'll be done soon and want more of the same variety. I'm not into all the relationship-y fan-fic, that's just not my jam.

** Read the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380964/1/Albus_Potter_and_the_Dungeon_of_Merlins_Mist][Albus Potter]] series by Vekin87. Currently six books are done of a seven book series, going through each year of Albus' schooling. It does very well at avoiding just making the characters copies of their parents.

Also try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7019253/1/][Don't Panic]] by Mouse and Stupid Productions. It's not the best writing, but I enjoyed it.

*** Thanks! For some reason I'm much more interested in fics with Albus as the main character than James.
