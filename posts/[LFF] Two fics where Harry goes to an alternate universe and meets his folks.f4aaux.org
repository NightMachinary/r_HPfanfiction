So, like the title says. I'm looking for two fics, both of which have Harry going to an alternate universe and meeting his parents.

In the first, he's remarkably ambivalent about Dark Magic and creates a wand because his is missing and resurrects a rooster to kill the Basilisk, both with Dark Magic and both getting his mother pissed off with him.

In the second, I remember him talking about how he wouldn't be able to fulfil the new-Universe's prophecy because it relied on him sacrificing seven 'nexuses' (I think) in a ritual of 'some technical term I forget'. There was a whole paragraph where he laid it all out and talked about this big complicated coincidence went down with seven people sacrificing themselves for him in a specific way. It's not Black Comedy with the 'I sacrificed my mother's eternal soul' thing, but it's a similar vibe only with a formal ritual, a list of complicated criteria, and seven nexuses (again, I think).

I do get the second one a little confused in my head with the one where James freaks out about alternate Universe Harry being very like Snape and Harry's AU brother gets anxious about Harry stealing their parents before embracing him into the family proper. Can't remember the name of that one either right now, though.


** The James freaking out about Harry being like Snape, and his brother being paranoid is actually a one shot. Linkffn(Across the Universe). Can't say I've read the other two before though.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

  Sirius hasn't the first clue who this green eyed stranger is exactly, but he's here now and somehow he's Sirius' problem. AU Rating upgraded due to language and theme.

  Harry Potter is thrown into an alternate universe due to archaic rules of magic. Hiding under the alias of Chris Collins, he tries to find a place among the suspicion of those he knew and some he never did, as Voldemort's power grows.
