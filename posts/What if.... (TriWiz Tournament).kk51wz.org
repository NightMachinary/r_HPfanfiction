This is speculation, and has been zinging around in my head for quite a while. I get reminded of it every time I read a HP fiction that features the Triwizard Tournament....

What would have happened if someone else had written Harry's name on the parchment scrap and threw it in the goblet?

Would the original writer have been made to take part in the tournament, as per the magical signature within the parchment that the cup chose(even though with a name that doesn't match)? Or would Harry still compete, because it's HIS name written? Or would both the signer and the ones whose assumed name was called from the goblet, in this case Harry, have to compete?

What's your thoughts?


** I favour the explanation that the Goblet was originally used to pick /gladiatorial/ champions, so being able to bind someone without their consent is a feature, not a bug.

** What I'm going with in my fics is that the “binding magical contract” wasn't enforceable on the champions at all. Rather, it was the headmaster of each school who was bound by the Goblet. If Harry had refused to complete, then Dumbledore would have been required to (a) expel him from Hogwarts or (b) automatically resign his position at headmaster (or rather, Hogwarts would have thenceforth failed to recognize him as the headmaster, resignation or no).

Harry was pressured into competing in the Tournament because yes, there was obviously a Plot going on, but there were three potential motives:

1. Hurt Harry during the Tournament

2. Get Harry expelled from Hogwarts, meaning he can't benefit from its protections

3. Remove Dumbledore from Hogwarts, which makes the school less safe.

It wasn't clear which of these was the plan (in fact, any one of them would have been pretty good), so Dumbledore decided to make Harry compete in the Tournament because it was actually the least dangerous option.

This preserves “binding magical contracts” without making it possible to force people into a contract against their will or even their knowledge.

** It probably would have changed the name to whoever put it in. The only reason Moody could do it was because he was an incredibly powerful wizard
