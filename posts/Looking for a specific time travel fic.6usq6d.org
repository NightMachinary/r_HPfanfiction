I'm this fic, from what I remember, Harry somehow ends up back in time, probably around the early 80s. I don't remember if it was on purpose or an accident but he then decides to take the Slytherin name and adopts a boy from (I think) his mothers side of the family because the boys last name was Evans.

After taking the boy in he tutors him in magic and things he would need to go to Hogwarts. He also writes potions text books which is how he came into contact with Snape (I don't think this was snarry yet but was probably heading in that direction). He starts a friendship with Snape and loans him Slytherin family books and removes his dark mark at one point.

If this sounds familiar to anyone I'd love to read it again!


** That would be *Crumbling Pedestal* by Shivani.

*** So it is! I totally forgot about the founders stuff, that's probably why I couldn't find it again. Thanks for your help, also I like your flair, witchiepoo. ;)

  Slash, HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.
