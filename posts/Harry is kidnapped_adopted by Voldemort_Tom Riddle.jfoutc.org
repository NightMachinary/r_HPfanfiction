up to you which.

ideas:

-Tom Riddle does not try to kill Harry second year and kidnaps him instead.

-Voldemort kidnaps Harry as a baby

-Voldemort/Tom Riddle finds a loophole in the laws and adopts Harry Potter.

â€‹

prefered no OCs, and no Harrymort/Tomarry (Although I may risk it if its a really good fic.)

If you know any good fics, as well, please link them!


** Read "The Darkness Within" aka the best fanfiction ever. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within]]

This one is tragic and way darker then the one above, but if you're into that then read "A Shattered Prophesy." [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2762511/1/A-Shattered-Prophecy]]

This one's uncompleted, but it was rather good. "Love and Love Again." [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7624618/1/Love-and-Love-Again]]

Ink is marked as slash, but "The relationship is almost mostly non-existent" as the author says.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark...
