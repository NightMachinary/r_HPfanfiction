I'm looking for an old Harry/Luna story. In it, the Order disguises Harry as a boy named Leo and puts him in Luna and Ginny's year to make it less obvious who the new boy is. Harry becomes friends with Luna and Ginny, and Luna figures out who he is.

Remus becomes Harry's father figure and has a wife and two children.

Does anyone recognize this?

Many thanks in advance to anyone who can find it!


** did you ever find the name?

**** was it on fanfiction.net? I looked through the filters with characters Harry, Luna, and Ginny and I didn't see it (there were only 55 stories). Do you know of any other details, or when you first saw it? I think the biggest clue would be what genre it is, but knowing how long it is and how popular it is (reviewed/favorited) would help too. Was the storyline between Harry and Luna romantic?

***** I don't remember when except that it was years ago. I feel like it wasn't on fanfiction.net. For some reason (it was years ago; I can't consider my visual memory that reliable), I feel like the background of the site was blue. It was a romantic Harry/Luna relationship. Random details: Remus left his wife and sons for a while after putting them at risk during a transformation, I think (possibly Harry convinces him to go back?). The Order creates some story to justify Harry's sudden "disappearance" from the wizarding world (possibly faking his death? <--I'm really not sure about that bit.). I think Harry tries to tell Ron and Hermione who he is repeatedly, but the won't listen/acknowledge him? That is all I can remember at the moment.

EDIT: It was quite long. Definitely novel-length.

****** Is this the site? [[http://patronuscharm.net/]] The background is kind of light blue. It might be this site: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/]]

There are a bunch of Harry Potter fanfic sites listed here: [[http://www.squidoo.com/fanfictionsites]]

You can go through them and maybe check if you recognize any of them.
