So I vaguely remember it having to do with there being more to the bloodlines they just familial relationships. Like some bloodlines had different powers that were with them. I remember something about ''black flames" and harry having a bunch of bloodlines. I'm not sure if that is all that helpful. I'll try and remember more.


** Seems a bit generic, like those fic were Harry goes to Gringrotts and does an ability/inheritance test and suddenly realise that he have natural talent for pretty much everything and anything and with enough money to buy half the country without making a dent the piles of gold except that evil Dumbledore wishes him to be weak, stupid and "poor" so he put "blocks" on his magic.\\
.\\
Ensuing this, he take a ritual at Gringrotts (payed by the Goblins, of course) where the Goblins are awed by the fact that he didn't even groan during all the duration of the ritual that destroyed his blocks (destroying the Horcrux in his scar by the way).\\
.\\
Then, he his recognized has an adult by the Ministry, pass his OWLS and NEWTS with flying colours all in one week, take control of the Wizengamot, kill Voldemort and either makes himself King of the Wizarding World or go with his harem to the beaches of [insert author's dream destination] while the rest of the cast is dead/in Azkaban/awed by his manliness.\\
.\\

If what I wrote summarise what you are searching for, than you ain't specific enough.

*** No fair enough. I agree with you that those are not all that specific. In the one I'm thinking of there is a scene where Harry falls off of his broom and uses is inherited family ability from the Blacks called black fire to some how cushion his fall. It was a rather busy plot, but I can't remember the name.

*** I don't think so, but I'll read it. The story I'm thinking of has to do with Harry having abilities tied to his bloodlines and some how Dumbledore locked them away. Things are a bit fuzzy because it's been a while

**** Its a joke. Naruto has a concept called bloodline limits which is similar.
