Sorry if I sound demented, I probably am.

I am looking for a fanfic that has at least a few of the following ideas, preferably all of them:

1. (not required) Isekai-esque, where a genre savvy psyche replaces Harry's (HP's) when he is just a baby.

2. (New improved) HP decides he won't take such abuse from Dursleys (maybe before age 2, certainly by age 4).

3. HP somehow finds out about and contacts the Scar-Horcrux, makes an ally. Maybe by giving it its fill of torture of Dursleys and all other people who treat HP badly, maybe by plotting together to take over the muggle side (at least locally - Imperious for ALL the win), maybe by plotting together to use muggle tech/knowledge to take over the wizarding side.

4. HP either gets trained by or just straight uses Voldemort's magical knowledge/skill.

5. HP goes through all the books 'removing' all the nasties.

--------------------------------------------

I was recently reminiscing about Rorschach Blot's Reunion and realized I want more and that I have never quite seen such a thing (I am probably best considered a HP fanfic newb).

*** This was clever and very humorous, I liked it a lot. I hadn't realized it until now but it was another inspiration for the sort of story I wanted to find.

I guess what I am looking for is Reunion (killing) + Seventh Horcrux (non-traumatizing access to Horcrux).

**** Oh, it's actually one of the most popular (and in my and general public opinion one of the best) fics in the genre of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9om75k/any_crack_fics_with_over_20k_words/e7v5gqt][crack/humor]], which my list of is in my opinion a good starting point at least.

I recommend starting with linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter?; A Black Comedy; Harry the Hufflepuff; Make a Wish), some of my classic favourites. Make a Wish is by the author of Reunion, which I also really like.

***** More good stories.

I have read A Black Comedy and Make A Wish (my fave HP fanfic, up through Russia).

I can check out the other two.

However, the lack of (intentional) killing makes them not fit what I am currently hoping to find. (Although, there was a bit in Make A Wish... but it was much more serious. Not at all the ‘having fun' or ‘just taking out the trash' mood I am looking for.)

****** Hey, sorry that I don't have a recc for you, but I have a question.

Why up to russia? I haven't read "Make a Wish" in probably 10 years, so my memory of the specifics is gone, but I don't remember any major switch ups in the tone or plot of the story. So, seeing as you recently read it and have seemingly made out such a switch up I was wondering what it was.

******* Not your job, no need to be sorry.

I have read it a couple of times over the last 10 years. Most recently, maybe a year ago.

At the start it was very much “The Man Who Knew Too Little”. Super-inventive and a lot of fun in how it played with the idea as well as everyone else's assumptions and reactions.

After Russia... it all changed. The parts I liked mostly disappeared. I'm not saying it stops being good, just not what it was at the beginning.

** *Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux* linkffn(11762850)

The story is about Voldemorts soul piece in Harry becoming sentient when Harry is very young and starts teaching him magic. Harry is kinda evil in this(like anyone raised by Voldemort would be), but it should fulfil all your requirement except the first one.

This story is complete, but the sequel hasn't updated in a while(I dont think its abandoned though).

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

*** I started reading this from your recommendation, up through chapter 29 so far. It got interesting to me ~chapter 15 or so.

The author has an easy to read writing style.

No killing so far, no revenge at all. But it is interesting and I plan to keep reading.
