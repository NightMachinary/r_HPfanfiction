Hi all, I love Harry potter have done since I was 8 and I'm 28 now, must have read the books about 16 times each... I have never read any fan fiction though I would like a Hogwarts story from a normal student maybe Dean thomas/lavender/Parvati maybe even Nevil although that might be too near the main story arch Maybe Oliver wood or pansy Parkinson could be fun? Does anyone know any good stories please? Thanks guys x x


** The author Slide has an entire series through the eyes of 4 Slytherins in the year above Harry. I cannot recommend it enough - it's fantastic. Excellent plot, characterization, and writing. The first is linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba). I also remember reading a series that followed Astoria Greengrass, but I don't remember the name.

  What about the others? What are the stories of the students we never even see named?

  "Astoria's breath caught. That hadn't happened. It was just her imagination. The hat hadn't said...said that" Disappointments, conflicts, and rivalries abound, friendships develop and crumble, family values are challenged, and a mass-murderer causes havoc. The unknown tale of Astoria Greengrass, an in-depth look at her time at Hogwarts, year one. The first in the Of the Stars series
