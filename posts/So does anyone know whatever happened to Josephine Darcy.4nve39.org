I'm really not a Snape/Harry fan, but I had given this story a try (as I know several others who liked it), and I loved it. The changes and additions she made to the Magical World were fascinating, and this story has such an important place in HPfanfiction world that several other people have tried to write their own version of the endings. I think we've all resigned ourselves to never getting the ending from the author herself, but I just wanted to ask -- does anyone actually know what happened to her?


** I think maybe the general consensus is that the author has passed away but I don't think anyone really knows for sure.
