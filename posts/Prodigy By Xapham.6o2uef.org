** I'm reading and reviewing here: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6N0355nkPCKkoprIVRffgDIkSugWFtPUjHbdy3dpbs/edit]] - I'll mainly comment on fluidity and specific plot stuff there.\\
I'll also write a general review afterwards for all the rest.

Others are welcome to comment there too if they want to, might be easier if we have stuff in kinda-one-place.

  Knowing your path in life offers a sense of certainty, a sense of security. Harry Potter knew where he was going in life. He did, at least, until he received a letter.

** I usually refrain from reading OP Harry firs, but this one is quite interesting with its unique (or rarely implemented properly) premise. There are a lot of small flow errors or interruptions. These are points where I have to think about what just happened. Another place where you could improve in your writing is implementing some of the changes in fflai's google doc. Maybe let him be your beta.

Overall this is a well written story till now.

*** I have to ask if till now means that it was good up until now, and now it's bad or it's good right now.

**** It means that I have found your story entertaining and well written as far as you have published. So everything from the beginning till chapter 4's end. So it's good. Just need to fix some minor issues.
