Immortal and bored, Harry Potter lives his days trapped in a cycle of defeating Voldemort and going to Hogwarts.

No, immortal isn't the word. For, like a phoenix, whenever Harry Potter met his end he awakened in his youth to relive his life all over again. No matter when or how his life came to an end... he always found himself returned to Privet Drive...

Oh it drove him mad, the 'Next Great Adventure' denied from him, all the people he met and the relationships he forged reset to zero whenever his life ended. So many repeats, do-overs that ingrained the world into every fibre of his soul like the stabbing of a rusty blade.

He never thought he could be so sick of reliving Hogwarts again and again. Awaken in Privet Drive, be inundated with letters for Hogwarts and study magic until he defeated Voldemort. His life meandering on from there.

However, one life stood out. Piqued his interest even now in the sea of sameness.

The life where he hadn't tried, and he'd lost.

It was a break from the routine, Voldemort left him alive and he'd conquered. It was something new, something... different. He'd underestimated his enemy and paid the price for it, not intending to do anything other than destroy Voldemort and his sycophants schemes but falling hopelessly short in the face of the Dark Lords cunning and power.

Harry hated to admit he wanted some more of that. He needed another "break".

He knew everyone so well now, he could complete the sentences of everyone he encountered at this point. No one was unpredictable in the face of the Boy Who'd Lived a Million Lives. He could pick apart every strength, every flaw, every nuance of the people he held dear AND those he openly despised. There was nothing new to learn.

Thus a sickly thought crept in.

It took him several lifetimes to convince him of the efficacy of it, and even when he'd decided to try out a time where... some of the cast was missing... he'd been the furthest thing from comfortable.

Despite the heady anticipation that settled in the moment he made up his mind...

July of 1992, Harry flipped a coin.

*/And annihilated the Weasley household./*

He'd never felt so alive! Leaving just Ron present at the scene of the massacre after he and the twins had "liberated" him from Number 4.

He was on the run, the full force of the Ministry and Order desperate to bring him down but Harry's focus entirely on the redhead who'd sworn revenge.

Exhilarated, elated, almost proud; Harry teased and taunted away at Ron as the boy desperately sought to gain the strength to overcome him, to surpass him in some way to exact his righteous justice against his psychotic former best friend.

Falling just short at the end.

As expected, despite the detour and the change of pace, Harry still lived a long life and died an old family man. Curtain call, everything went black and he awoke again in the cupboard under the stairs.

A life on the run, fighting off his adversaries and having turned his once friends into his sworn foes really taught him the value of his loved ones and how much he did truly care for them. Thus he swore himself to a lifetime of doing his best by them (as he should) and internally condemned his previous lifes actions. A new leaf turned over with his fresh start.

The only problem arising on the Hogwarts Express in 1991, where he first meets Ron Weasley.

Because he remembers everything...

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** If I were Harry,I will fuck off Britain as soon as I can. It's the only way to experience more possibilities. At least his loop starts from his cupboard and ends with his death. He's not trapped in a single day. You can't get very far from where you are within 24 hours.Repetition is one of the most excruciating torment out there. People need variety more than they realize. Human die without water in 3 days,without air in perhaps a couple of minutes. But how long will one last without variety?Repetition has a power to erode the brightest light and darkest darkness.

  Miscellaneous story ideas and short stories that I felt the urge to write. Varying topics, frequently humorous, occasionally less. I may turn some into full stories. Inspired by Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas.

** You know what, I've seen this before. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops][The Infinite Loops]] is a big crossover fanfic series by multiple authors. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3761766/10/The-Harry-Potter-Omake-Files-Innortal-Style][one of Innortal's Loops]] (some of the first, so a bit of early installment weirdness abounds), Ron and Hermione are Awake (aware of the time loops) but only remember one where Harry was a Dark Lord. Short snippet though.

There's also The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl, linkffn(12141684) . I haven't read the end of it, but one of the plot points is that Time-travelling Harry and Hermione are used to an evil version of Ron rather than the Unspeakable (or whatever he was, I don't remember) that's found their way into their universe.
