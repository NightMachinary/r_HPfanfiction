** MoR was my first HP fanfic and in the beginning, I was quite fond of it - then I started thinking more about it.

It's more preaching than an actual story, and it does that in the stupid manner as we get eleven years old Harry being super-genius and thinking about things nobody else did before.

Additionally, for all his science-talk Yudkowsky screwed up middle school level biology. And then tried to lamely explain his mistake away as intended.

And after preaching about his villains. and characters in general, being rational and intelligent he has Voldemort infodumping his whole plan to Harry at the end of the story.

Most of the characters are barely outlined, despite the fics length, due to it being mostly pointless filler.

Speaking of characters, eleven years olds act, speak, have power-levels, etc. unfitting for their age - this should never be first year story, but I guess LessWrong wanted to prove that his rational Harry could solve everything with the power of the rationality in one year.

Though in the end he solved it with a power of deus ex machina plan that puts canon to shame with its deus ex machinness.

It's a mess, a mess that reads well, a mess with some funny moments, few good ideas, but in the end still a mess and a bad fic.

Don't forget his physics-themed Random Word Generator word salad that Harry spewed when McGonagall transformed into a cat and back.

** I don't like stories that tell me what to think. HPMOR is full of Eliezer Yudkowsky's own personal take on rational thought and it just gets boring very quickly. I felt the same way after a bit of reading Partially Kissed Hero, which ended up with chapter after chapter of Harry and Luna lecturing Hermione, and in effect the reader, about some topic that had bothered the author.

** Well, off the top of my head:

-As has often been rightly pointed it, it comes across very [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]]. It's not even as (another poster suggested) that I simply don't like super intelligent characters going on about their intelligence. The problem is the entire thing makes little sense in universe. If it were possible to "rationalize" magic, wouldn't someone (say, a Muggleborn) have already tried that? I mean hell, since Newton was an alchemist he must have been wizard. But he was also a brilliant mathematician and scientist. He never thought to apply the methods of those fields to magic? I know it's an AU but if my recollections about the MOR universe are correct, the world is just inconsistent for no reason other than to prop up the ascension of the boy wonder who "rationalizes" away the problem of the week.

-It's too fucking long for a first year story (more than half a million words, christ almighty). And that time frame makes the premise even worse in execution since this project takes place in months where it would in reality take years and decades by hundreds of professionals, not an 11-year old and friends. Even though it doesn't quite work, it really wouldn't have worked at all.

-The theme of rationalizing magic felt like it was dropped at the end with no prelude. If there had been the occasional hint every so often, from the beginning, that the endeavor would be mixed or fail, I wouldn't have found it so annoying. But I don't recall any particular elegance in this.

-Harry being friends with Draco who had voiced wanting to rape Hermione. Like seriously, what the fuck?

-A number of just bad science and statistics. It felt very ironic for this to be in a story about rationalizing things. Made worse by the application of atomic theory and chemistry to magic despite it not making any real sense.

-Transfiguration was treated stupidly in the story. For real.

Pretty sure I'd have to be paid to read it again, it just commits too many of my personal list of cardinal sins, plus the objective(-ish) issues of unnecessary length and absurd premise.

**** I can't remember that (it's a long story), but I know Hermione mentions him saying he wanted to rape her in chapter 87:

#+begin_quote
  "/Draco Malfoy/," she said. "Harry, do you have /any idea -/"

  "Yes."

  "- the sort of things Malfoy has been /saying/ about me? What he said he'd /do/ to me, as soon as he got the chance? I don't know what he told to /you,/ but Daphne Greengrass told me what Malfoy says when he's in Slytherin. It's /unspeakable,/ Harry! It's unspeakable in the completely literal sense that I can't say it out loud!"

***** I was thinking about when they met on Platform 3.75 and saw the "BOY WHO LIVED GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT" headline in the quibbler. I haven't read the story in a while though so I forgot about the part you mentioned. Guess we were both right.

**** Yeah it's in chapter, er, 80-something, IIRC. But yeah, the length is the biggest sin for me from the outset. The other stuff (besides being Draco's friend at that point) I could overlook if it were like 100K or around that. But 600K+? It's just too long, especially for the time span in the story.

** It's a long, complete, cohesive story with a better sense of stakes and struggle than the vast majority of fanfics. I personally enjoy the way everyone's intelligence has been scaled up, and though no fic is perfect this one has more scenes that resonate with me than any other I've found.

Yes, it has some minor irritations, and it's very much not for everyone, but it's so well done that generally its detractors are those who don't like what it is. Yes, Harry's a bit pretentious and full of himself, but gets himself into trouble more times than not, and he consistently makes decisions that have consequences rather than just fluffing by on fate.

It would not appeal to people who like canon-compliance or dislike extreme AUs with everyone having different personalities. It would not appeal to those who dislike overly-intelligent characters showing off how clever they are. It would not appeal to anyone unwilling to put up with some moderately heavy-handed rationality advocacy. If one dislikes multiple of those things, they would have every reason to hate the story, the more so because everyone claims it's good and they would find it irksome.

*** I don't care about canon, AU, OOC, like intelligent characters and am into rationality advocacy. But I strongly dislike HPMOR.

The problem is that Eliezer Yudkowsky said he is status-blind and thus unable to recognize that most humans care about status far more than about being right. Which is why most social interaction in HPMOR portrayed wrong - EY assumed incorrect motives (being right instead of being respected) from the start and run with them till the end.

*** See, that's part of why I keep trying again. I have no particular preference for canon-compliance or extreme AUs. I've read both and liked both. Intelligent Harry is one of my favorite types of fanfiction, as a wannabe-Ravenclaw. I haven't read enough of the rationality advocacy to have an opinion. I just have a really difficult time with Harry's character.

** I enjoyed HPMoR because it made me laugh, and think. Didn't make me cry, but eh, two out of three ain't bad.

Objectively, it has a lot of strong points: it's complete. It has very few typos. It has a complex plot. And while aspects of it may be unrealistic, it does at least draw attention to /some/ unrealistic aspects of canon and present those in a more realistic way.

Most criticism that I've seen revolves around the attitudes of the protagonist and the author. Yes, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is often abrasive, proud, condescending, etc. Quite possibly Eliezer Yudkowsky is too. To his credit, a) Harry can actually be a very nice person to his friends, he's just frustrated with most of the world, and b) the story smacks him around for acting that way, sometimes literally, including a physical beating from older students in Battle Magic class, teaching him to accept losing.

Like [[/u/asviloka][u/asviloka]], I'd guess that a lot of the strong hatred would come from people who are frustrated by its popularity; if it were obscure, they might dislike it, but they'd shrug and move on.
