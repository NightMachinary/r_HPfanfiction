:END:
So, I'm looking for what I think is a cracky piece of crackdom, but the only things I can remember about it are that it may have been a crossover, and I almost fell over laughing when it was discovered that banished items all go to (I think) Mark Wahlberg's house. I know it's not much of a detail, but hopefully someone else read it, too.

**Edit**

Found it! It's called "Harry Potter's most excellent adventure" by wolfd890!


** I've read that one, but it was before I started keeping records of the stories I've read. I think the story had everyone's "banish pile" be different, and Hermione used a tracking charm that allowed her to locate hers.

  Harry Potter simply wanted to take a break from being everyone's hero. Who'd have thought that being kidnapped by Jaffa out of some lousy Diner would do the trick? Poor SG1. They have no idea how far down the rabbit hole goes. Harry Potter/Stargate Crossover, eventual AU (COMPLETE, if you can believe it!)
