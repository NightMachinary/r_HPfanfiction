:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction were Loki's punishment for attacking Earth is to live a human life. He doesn't remember much (i think he had some type of dream). He becomes the best lawyer in the world, i think they started calling him Viper and suddenly gets his powers back but with out the memories. He meets Thor before he gets his momories back and Thor recognizes him. I really want to read it again, it was really good and i think it had multiple sequels.


** Linkffn(Tricksters and Gods) maybe? I almost completely confident it is.

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?
