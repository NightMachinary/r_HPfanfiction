I have this guilty pleasure of stories where the protagonist hides his true abilities/identity. This type of stories often suffers from various problems though:

1. Additional powers instead of hiding the already existing ones
2. The disguise is seriously bad, but all characters don't notice a thing for a stupid reason
3. The disguise would work, but the character decides to tell people he barely knows his true identity after only one chapter, and they in return never reveal his secret. That's just stupid.
4. The character often has no real reason to hide his identity, other than 'I felt like it'. 4.a) If he does, the reasons are often bullshit, created for the sole reason of being a reason for him to hide his identity, and not actually a real part of the plot 4.b) Sometimes the reasons are part of the plot, but even more retarded (e.g. Harry has a twin, but for some reason his parents only love this twin and forget about him. Seriously?)

Is there a story, where these things are not a problem?


** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) might count. It never really /emphasizes/ the identity-hiding part, but it's there as part of the basic premise.

Also, linkffn(George Weasley and the Computational Error) has George hiding his identity because of an arbitrary spell requirement, which could arguably fail 4.a, but otherwise fits your criteria.

** I can't remember the name of the story, but there's a story where Harry leaves everyone in England and goes to a school in Canada. 3 part series, but the third is abandoned. Vampires, werewolves, and fae all go to the school with him. Massively AU and a super!Harry. Someone help me out with the name please!

He very much changes his identity and he reveals in only in the latter part of the series, and only to a very select few. The basis of him changing identity is a bit shaky; it was mostly just a reason for the author to transport him to their own little AU "world". But it was a fun series nonetheless.

** I think at least some of these problems will occur in any story. For example, I really enjoyed [[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/chapter.php?storyid=2&chapterid=1][The Mirror of Maybe]] by Midnight Blue [INCOMPLETE], but it suffers from problem 3; the protagonist does not immediately reveal his identity to some others, but it happens and is an important part of the plot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8672943/1/Monster-I-m-A-Hero][Monster? I'm A Hero]] might fit your requirements. It claims to be a fem!Harry/Tom Riddle but in reality it's basically OFC/Tom Riddle, since it's so wildly AU. The protagonist is Grindelwald's adopted daughter, and Grindelwald is still active. Tom Riddle is a professor at Hogwarts. The protagonist goes to Hogwarts in disguise to hide from her adoptive father, whom she is working to undermine.

It's not the most well-written fic ever, and it's a WIP, but it's enjoyable enough.

** Alrighty then, I see /Pureblood Pretense/ is already listed so here's two more;

linkffn(In Love of Quidditch by Secondary Luminescence) In this story, fem!Harry is posing a a boy and can't reveal who she is. There is also an in-progress sequel to this called linkffn(In Fear of Solitude by Secondary Luminescence)

The second story is linkffn(Princess of Blacks by Silently Watches) In which fem!Not-Harry is very secretive about herself although she isn't pretending to be someone else, she's still Jen Black. I call her a Not-Harry basically because she is /technically/ Harry but there's pretty much no similarities.
