Someone besides Voldemort, Grindelwald, Malfoy or one of the good guys gone evil. Can be a crossover character or real person (one fic I like has Putin and the russian government as antagonists). Or someone completely new. Just has to be original.

There are good guys turned evil, but it's more of a consequence (at least in my interpretation) of the ultimate evil bad guy at the end. He makes Voldemort look like a girl scout. Sorry, that's wrong. The good guys turned bad make Voldemort look like a girl scout. The Ultimate Evil Bad guy makes the previous guys look like girl scouts.

Super Harry that turned Dark. Revenge centric. Blood, Gore, Angst, Tearjerker at times. Some of the revenge is downright terrifying, and then the dominos start to fall over and you have to appreciate it. There are a lot of jumping between timelines with flashbacks, but it works well. So I guess you can tack on mystery to it as well, as you aren't told EVERYTHING up front. It's a trickle feed of information.
