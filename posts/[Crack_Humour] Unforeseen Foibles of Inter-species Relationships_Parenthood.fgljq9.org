Harry knew that when he settled down with/dated his significant other, they would have certain issues to overcome.

From behavior to parenthood, the species barrier has led to some... interesting situations.

Idle thoughts:

1. His wife, one of Fleur's full-blooded cousins, gave birth to an ostrich-sized egg. He's expected to keep it warm until his son/daughter hatches.\\
   He's expected to regurgitate food for his son/daughter, like birds do.\\
   Harry ends up reading wildlife books on bird species' mating behaviour to properly court her.
2. Harry's wife is a spider or mantis kin: during dating or romantic adventures, she has to suppress the urge to either bite his head off or wrap him in silk and hide him to keep him safe from predators.\\
   She lays hundreds of eggs. Harry's on the verge of passing out when he realizes he's going to be a father several dozen times over. Baby names!
3. Harry's booty-call is a flighty yet possessive goddess from old mythology -- unfortunately, since pregnancy for deities is pretty non-existent, and many are simply born/fully-created as mature adults, their frequent encounters lead to dozens of new gods/goddesses walking around.\\
   Harry has trouble remembering if some of the new people he ends up talking to on a regular basis are his progeny or not, until they say something like "thanks, dad!/father!".
4. Harry's drow wife expects assassination attempts as a form of courtship. He hilariously ''tries'' to kill her. She finds his bumbling attempts adorkable.
5. His amazon wife is irritated that he's working -- she's supposed to be the breadwinner! She covertly shadows him, fearing for his safety. He finds it exasperatingly cute as she randomly tries to "save the day".
6. Knocking boots with a ditsy yet ''evil'' fallen angel gave "being sinful" new meaning. Unfortunately, she now thinks it's time she introduces the beau she's head over wings for to the rest of her infernal family.

Basically, from canon HP sapients, to any crossover species seen in media, to mythological beings, to any from the Dungeons and Dragons sapient menagerie -- it's all fair game, since the prompt is so open.

** Being birdlike, Harry's half-veela children have to rein in their siblicidal tendencies. Also, fem Harry trying to convince Aragog that she will not eat him. Last but not the least, linkao3(2397965) features Harry x Aragog.

*** Or they act like chicken-raptors... or both.

You know how chickens can peck snakes or foxes to death in large flocks?
