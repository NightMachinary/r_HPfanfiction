I'm struggling to find anything that doesn't include Drarry or some form of Weasley bashing. The only way I can ship it is when Draco had a massive redemption arc early on otherwise it's a no go for me. But I don't particularly ship them anyway, I'm looking for friendship, mutual respect, friendly rivalry, friendly jabs...that sort of thing.

  Never let it be said that a Slytherin doesn't know to take hold of an opportunity when it's presented to him on a silver platter.

  [A Fourth Year AU in which Draco makes the most of Potter and Weasley's fight and takes a second shot at befriending Harry. For the Greater Evil, obviously.]

Abandoned, but it's worth a read. Draco does call Ron 'poor' and things, but that's to be expected- there's no Ron bashing, and this is coming from an avid Ron fan. Trust me.

It's been a while since I've read it, but briefly skimming trough the first chapter made me remember that I liked this quite a bit.

*** This Draco made me smile :). And Harry really did miss out on some valuable lessons that Slytherin could have taught him - although the Hat never did actually tell him that he /should/ be there, only that it would help him become great.

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.

** Draco has turned out rather differently, perhaps due to the absence of any non-purebloods at Hogwarts to set him off, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). Also, his over-the-top self-importance is treated as a private joke that his friends can see through.

That said, he's basically a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledSympatheticBigot][Troubled Sympathetic Bigot]]. He's been raised with bigoted views, which make Harry internally wince when they come up - but they usually don't, in an all-pureblood (or so Draco thinks) environment, and amongst those whom he considers his peers, he's friendly and even generous. On those occasions when he's confronted with people outside his comfort zone in a way that he can't just ignore, he struggles, but does show signs of being redeemable, eg he does genuinely reflect on how he could easily become a werewolf if he were unlucky enough to be bitten. Although he prefers not to think about it. When he meets Harry as herself, he's very uncomfortable at first to be around a half-blood, but he does later make at least some small steps in the right direction, perhaps mostly for Rigel's sake, but it's a positive sign. As of the end of book four, though, there's no Drarry; he did express interest in "Rigel", but she turned him down.

Also, there's definitely no Weasley bashing. Harry doesn't take on the Weasleys as a surrogate family, but gets along well with every one of them.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
