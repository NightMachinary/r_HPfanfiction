There are a lot of things that make me roll my eyes (e.g. the twin speech or the word "Hadrian"), but there is one particular thing that just sets me on fire.

Every time an author says Godric's Hollow meaning the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow instead of the actual village, I get a need to punch my screen. It really pisses me off. It is such an illogical mistake, yet I've seen it in so many fics. It is inexplicable, inexcusable, and frankly, stupid. Why do so many authors do this?

So I wondered, does anyone else here get triggered by such minor things? Does anything piss you off similarly?


** - Timetravel fics where Harry goes back in time, gets sorted into Gryffindor, and the Head Girl is Augusta Longbottom. Augusta married into the family to become a Longbottom. She wasn't born a Longbottom, unless Frank Longbottom is actually an incest baby.

- ...Which extends to timetravel fics where the cast is everyone's grandparents/great aunts, but with the modern day characters' personalities overlaid because of laziness. Septimus Weasley is a poor, Slytherin hating, slacker. Melania McMillan is a pompous showoff. And Irishname Finnegan is an accidental pyromaniac, which makes no sense since Seamus' dad is a muggle.

- Americanisms. "I'm gonna whoop his ass", "She's full of crap", "This place is a shithole", "Don't be such a dick", "I'm just fucking with you". This kind of dialogue hurts my soul.

- Yule Balls and Head Boy/Girl common rooms. Yule Balls are a special event for the Triwizard Tournament. They don't have Yule Balls every single year!

Personally I don't really mind if there are other Yule Balls in 5th and later years as long as there's an explanation something like "This was such a success last year we've decided to have one every year from now on".

Given how inbred the purebloods appear to be, that would not be surprising. But she might have simply been from a different branch of the family (3rd cousin or stuff like that). Granted, I doubt that most authors think that far, but Augusta Longbottom does not require incest to have that name before marriage.

**** It seems very unlikely for a pureblood witch to have a child out of wedlock, and Longbottom is one of Pottermore's Sacred 28 families. And it makes no sense for Augusta to have a child out of wedlock when she's constantly promoting the importance of family, making Neville use his dad's wand and taking him to visit his parents in the hospital.

Checking the wiki, there's semi-canon minor reference to Neville's grandfather in the film short [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Handbag][The Queen's Handbag]], starring the HP cast members.

** I really dislike nicknames. I have a feeling many people won't like this, but 'pete' and 'mione' annoy me, though I have no particular reason for this dislike. I hate pre full moon sexual drive trope. I used to think it was something teenage girls usually enjoyed, but now I know it's not true. Every time I come across it, I'm like,'so you've apparently read quite a few fics with this one, haven't you'. I still have no idea why it is used and what it's supposed to add to the story or the character. I also dislike it when Remus makes jokes that might be more suitable for,say, Sirius. The main thing is that I don't find such jokes funny and Remus just seems like someone who wouldn't do such things, given the kind of jokes he makes in canon. I'm not saying it has to be just the way I see it, but since the thread is about things that set us off, this is one of them. This joking bit maybe doesn't happen very often, but it does make me cringe. It usually becomes rather obvious what kinds of fics the author has read if the fic is full of these tropes. Also, I cannot stand sentences like,'he felt the wolf stirring at the back of his mind' or 'something stirred at the back of his mind in a way he so despised.' It's a good thing the wolf doesn't sniff the air hopefully. I think it's high time we accepted the idea that Remus is unwell before a full moon, that might include all sorts of symptoms, but I doubt there's a wolf living in his mind.

If, say, a fic had Blaise Zabini say it or something, I wouldn't have had much of a problem. Especially if he wasn't portrayed as being in the right.

I'll also make allowances for Veela magic, largely because Veela clearly are magical creatures and we don't get a whole lot about them in the books. Agreed with the mates, though... or "Veela bonds" or whatever. That's just cheap excuses to give Harry a hot girlfriend without him having to do anything about it.

****** Mind, I don't mind if they have talents towards the area. Like Fleur being able to put a dragon to sleep or being skilled with fire.

I really don't like things like Family Magic.

*** Oh yeah, also:

- The UK is the laughingstock of the rest of the magical world. And America is a utopia for some reason.

- Magic is useless; muggles are supreme. Okay, so I haven't read any "supplementary material" for HP, but can't we just assume that the wizarding world has more going on than what we see in the books? What goes on in the DoM? Did we see everything down there, or do they have much better-sealed areas containing weapons of mass destruction that will make nuclear bombs whimper in fear?

- Just... any groups of people being depicted as strawmen. Especially the group of people with fantastic powers.

** Mya, Mia etc I dont read a lot of dramione fanfics but when I do I somehow end up reading ones that include those. Ugh, Mione is fine but the rest are annoying

Unreasonably emotional Harry. I see this a lot whenever Snape is helping him after finding out he's been abused and dont get me wrong, I love emotional Harry but I've read fics where he's in his Hogwarts years and he goes from acting his age to acting like a 5 year old and it's so irritating to read

This isnt just for HP fanfics but fics in general. When I'm reading about a pairing and the this line, or a variation comes up: I haven't known him/her long but it feels like a lifetime. Makes me roll my eyes every time
