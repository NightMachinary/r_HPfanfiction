Anyone willing to share their master HP fan fiction list - if you have one? I would love to know a wide base of recommendations.

Recently with all the time on my hands, I thought about organizing “all” the stories into a master list.


** Here's some of my favorites! Ffnbot!slim Linkffn(Fall through time by Indieblue) Linkffn(Melody of fire by sakurademonalalchemist) Linkffn(To be a Slytherin by Morgana Deryn) Linkffn(Girl in the war by Astridfire) Linkffn(Inevitable by gr8rockstarrox) Linkffn(The perfect girl by Slytherin-nette) Linkffn(the perfect wife by Slytherin-nette) Linkffn(The perfect mother by Slytherin-nette) Linkffn(Green eyed monster by sphinxs-legend) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13232688/chapters/30268506]]) Linkffn(Harriet Potter and the minister of magic by slytherin-nette) Linkffn(The pureblood pretense) Linkffn(The Slytherin subterfuge) Linkffn(The Ambiguous artifice) Linkffn(The futile facade) Linkffn(Teasing, teaching and time travel) Linkffn(Lionheart by NileRivers94) Linkffn(Snakeskin by NileRivers94) Linkffn(Wolfbite by NileRivers94) That's all that I can think of off the top of my head, I'll probably edit this comment later when I think of more!

Edit #1: Some of these are crossovers Linkffn(The Witch Bound by Fate by nyxblack) Linkffn(The With the Time Forgot by nyxblack) Linkffn(Hermione Granger: Agent of SHIELD by Lil Drop of Magic) Linkffn(Hermione Granger: Avenger by Lil Drop of Magic) Linkffn(Hermione Granger: Sorceress by Lil Drop of Magic) Linkffn(Hermione Granger: Guardian of the Galaxy by Lil Drop of Magic) Linkffn(Hermione Granger: Sorceress Returning by Lil Drop of Magic) Linkffn(Sorceress: Civil War by Lil Drop of Magic) Linkffn(Sorceress: Infinity War by Lil Drop of Magic) Linkffn(Second Time Around by Neko-Tenchi) ffnbot!slim ffnbot!refresh

*** Thanks! I love the perfect girl series, re-read it multiple times. I read most of the stories listed, though never read a femHarry/Newt one, will definitely look that one up.

Slytherin-nette is amazing at writing femHarry

**** Yes, she is, isn't she! As you can probably tell from my recs, I read a lot of fem!Harry, and when I found her I was overjoyed. The fem!Harry/Newt one is really well done, one of the better fics that I've read.
