I've read way too many Tomarry fanfics where Tom spends the whole fic just being a complete bitch to Harry. Yes, I understand that Tom as a character is inherently Bitchy. But when I read a Tomarry fanfic I want it to actually feel like they're in love. And not like Tom is barely tolerating Harry. I don't know why there are so many Tomarry fics where it seems like Tom doesn't like Harry at all. Of course there are a place for fics like this, but I would like to read a fanfic where Tom and Harry genuinely seem to like each other and don't spend the whole fic being angry and petty. Something like the fic Pledged in blood by strange soulmates. Where Tom is still a brooding and hate filled child but actually likes Harry and wants him to be happy. I just want to read a fic where Tom isnt just straight up abusive. Any recommendations?

  Tom Riddle finds that he does not like it when Professor Potter doesn't pay him any attention. Something should be done about that.
