So I read this story a few years back and I'm not sure if it was deleted because I can't find it anymore. I read it on fanfiction.net and in the story Harry lives with Lilly and James. Lilly used to work in the ministry (as an Unspeakable?) and one day she took baby Harry in and there was an accident. I believe Harry's power was affected and because of the accident Lilly and James become very poor because they have to pay for the damages and Harry's medical treatement. They move out to an outer village and Harry becomes a big brother to I think 1 younger sister and 1 or 2 younger brothers. Blaise also lives in the village but attends Hogwarts. Harry's family is so poor that only the youngest brother can attend Hogwarts, until Voldemort raids the village and Harry and his siblings take refuge in tge school too.
