Hi there, ive searched around but found nothing that fit what i was looking for, so i thought i give it a try here.

I am looking for a fic where HArry gets an acceptance letter to Salem witches academy or another witches only school (preferably outside britain) and has to live with either pretending to be a girl or take a potion or something to force a change (temporarily or permanent)

the story doenst need romance,.. because in that scenario only f/f would work in my head.. if you find something that is that way.. great!, if not,... no romance is still ok. ;)

id like him to know hermione before he goes to the all girls school.. if only to have an ear to talk to with that specific situation and she can be reasonable.. (sometimes) :)


** Not exactly (BTW, Salem Witches Institute had nothing to do with education, it was meant as a parody on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Institutes][Women's Institutes]]), but in the end Harry wins The Triwizard Championship for them in “Pranking The Tournament by Gardevoir687” linkffn(13132217).

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!
