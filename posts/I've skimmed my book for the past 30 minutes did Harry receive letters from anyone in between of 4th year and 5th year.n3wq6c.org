  If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he'd had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.

  /We can't say much about you-know-what, obviously ... We've been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray ... We're quite busy but I can't give you details here ... There's a fair amount going on, we'll tell you everything when we see you .../

** I just read up on that yesterday! He did get letters but they are very vague (we can't say much) and Harry is quite pissed that he's kept in the dark while Ron and Hermione are apparently having a grand time together.

**** Here's a tip for finding that sort of thing in the future: [[https://www.potter-search.com/]]

Search for 'letter' or whatever it is you're trying to recall and you immediately see all extracts containing that word - it's super useful!

** Yes, that's one of the largest holes in JKR's planning. I always imagined this dialogue between Harry and Hermione at the Grimmauld Place:

#+begin_example
   HERMIONE
#+end_example

Harry, but professor Dumbledore said that we cannot send you any letters, because owls can be intercepted!

#+begin_example
   HARRY
#+end_example

So, Hermione, you are a muggleborn witch. How would you contact your Muggle friends? Would you hire a speedy runner to dispatch you letter written on a parchment? Do you live in the eighteen century or what?

#+begin_example
   HERMIONE
#+end_example

No, of course, not, I would ... Oh gosh, Harry, I am an idiot! Of course, no Death Eater would have any idea how to bug a phone. I am so sorry.

** Maybe 1 or 2 from Hermione and Ron. After that it was the Ministry(Umbridge) BS letters.

** Yeah he received letters, they just didn't really have anything in them and he was upset by the lack of real information in them. I think it was from Hermione, Ron and perhaps Sirius?
