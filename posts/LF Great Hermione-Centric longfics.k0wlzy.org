No character bashing please, and definitely no Dark!Hermione or OP!Hermione. I'd prefer minimal romance and shipping if possible.

Edit: By Overpowered I meant Hermione being a super-genius who can do implausible stuff no one else can. I'm hoping for her intelligence to be more in line with her canon level please.


** Arithmancer, but that was already reccomended.

#+begin_quote
  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] is a popular one, but I don't know whether you'd classify her as dark, since she is much more ruthless and willing to bully and blackmail her classmates (after they bullied her), but since it ends in third year, she's still scared of her dark tendencies and isn't evil at all yet. She's also not OP, since she's only as good as Harry when it ends, but she is more clever than her canon self, even though it's because of her experience in Slytherin.

** My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - she's totally badass and so smart, but I don't think she's overpowered. It is complete and has a sequel.

linkao3(7944847)

I also really like Hermione in this Cedric-centric fic, but it might have too much romance/ smut for you.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/][Finding Himself]] is about Cedric surviving the graveyard battle, but seriously injured. It is very well-written and has sequels.

  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU

** Maybe Lollies and Loki by cheshire_carrol? It's a Harry Potter and Supernatural crossover, and even if Hermione is a little bit OP she trains a lot and you can see her start from nothing and become powerful.

** How Hermione-centric do you like it? She's a main protagonist in almost all my HP stories, but generally as part of the trio. I've written three long stories (longer than 500K words), all completed, and the fourth is on its way to completion as well.
