** There is so much in this vein of fan fiction that you will really need to be more specific for us to be able to direct you to what you want.

However... prepare you body for a wall of information...

I recommend going to [[http://www.fanfiction.net/book/harry-potter/][www.fanfiction.net/book/harry-potter/]] and playing around with the filter to find your thing. (not lots of explicit material but you can get an idea for what you like and how to find it here, IE, what to search for before you branch elsewhere)\\
[[http://www.ficwad.com][www.ficwad.com]] also has a lot of M and NC17 rated material, the downside is that YOU WILL HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IT, as far as i know there is no fast way to find stuff here\\
[[http://www.favoritestracker.org][www.favoritestracker.org]] can be a good place to start also for this. the site has user? generated lists you can search through to generally find some good stuff\\
[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/]] not a lot of stories but lots and lots of NC17 on a wide array of topics\\
[[http://www.restrictedsection.org]] I have not had good luck finding stories here but none the less another source.\\
[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/index.php]] a site you have probably found already but good none the less, it offers a large number of stories and a fairly easy to navigate site.\\
[[http://www.thebroomcupboard.net]] this is not a website i have a lot of familiarity with, but as of the last time i used it i remember it being largely, if not completely dedicated to the sexier side of things (hence the name)\\
[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction]] very paring specific site, but if you like those parings you can find good stories here. From my recollection mostly longer stories with goodish plots.

Things to keep in mind while searching

*Pairings*

Very general parings and keywords to use/lookout for.\\
*Guy on girl* (hetero,heterosexual,m/f,general(this one is rare))\\
--the absence of someone saying it is guy/guy or girl/girl usually means its guy/girl

*Guy on Guy* (Slasy, yaoi,gay,m/m) -- there are probably more keywords, i don't read them myself so i can't give you but a general idea, however if you look for SLASH you will find what you want.

*Girl on Girl* (femslash, yuri, lesbian, f/f) -- may be more keywords i don't know of, as with slash for guy on guy, if you look for FEMSLASH you will get results

*Threesome/Multi/Harem* (threesome, multi, harem, moresome, M/M/M, F/F/F, M/F/F, F/M/M)\\
-- There is quite a bit of this out there if this is your thing. quite a few good romance harem/ multi fictions out there IMO.

*Parings More In Depth* --Overview of what parings I have seen to be popular, and where you are likely to find more well written things. This will be biased pretty heavily based on what i have read so chances are i'll miss some popular parings that i don't read.

*M/F*\\
--Harry/Ginny (canon)\\
--Harry/Hermione (a lot of good stories in this paring, a lot of variety)\\
--Harry/Daphnie Greengrass (popular slytherin paring, usually involve a more independent Harry)\\
--Harry/Pansy (also popular slytherin paring)\\
--Harry/Luna (have not read much, but it seems popular, she is frequent in harem/multi fanfics)\\
--Harry/Susan Bones (Most popular hufflepuff paring, appears in lots of harem/multi fan fics)\\
--Harry/Nymphadora Tonks (Popular in the 1-shot genre, some good longer ones too, stories usually start summer after 4th year)\\
--Harry/Fleur (usually 4th year stories, also usually pretty dirty sex wise)\\
--Harry/Gabrielle ( Lots of M and NC17 involving her, underage kink i guess is what draws people)\\
--Neville/Luna (Not sure what there is in the way of stories, but is a popular paring)\\
--Draco/Ginny (Very popular, have not read much myself)\\
--Draco/Hermione (Semi popular, what i have read has been good)\\
--Ron/Hermione (Canon)\\
--Ron/Luna (popular paring, i see it often in harry/hermione stories, i don't know if there are many stand-alones centered around them)\\
--Snape/Hermione (can you say hot for teacher? Must be the brooding mysterious aura)\\
--Lupin/Nymphadora (canon)\\
--James/Lily (canon)

*M/M*\\
--I don't read these, but these are the parings i see while browsing other stuff, so take it with a grain of salt.\\
--Harry/Draco\\
--Harry/Snape\\
--Sirius/Lupin\\
--Sirius/Snape\\
--Lupin/Snape\\
--Harry/Lord Voldemort

*F/F*\\
--Not much in the way of plot with most of these, that i have noticed.\\
--Fleur/Hermione\\
--Fleur/Ginny\\
--Hermione/Ginny\\
--Hermione/Luna\\
--Fleur/Nymphadora Tonks\\
--Ginny/Luna\\
--Bellatrix/(many) (frequently involve people captured by Voldie and the gang)

*3some*\\
--Harry/Ron/Hermione\\
--Harry/Hermione/Luna\\
--Harry/Hermione/Ginny

*Harem/Multi*\\
--Most of these stories are harry centric, and they vary widely in length and quality.\\
--For a Harem story a common theme is to involve a girl from each house, often Hermione/Daphne/Susan/Luna, or a similar combo of women\\
--For Multi stories, the number of partners can vary widely, but expect a minimum of 2, and frequently its a lot of sex for the sake of sex, with little in the way of relationship development.

*Other keywords* -- A lot of these will be pretty self explanatory, but I'm already 6k in might as well add them in. --PWP or porn without plot (lots of sex for no reason what so ever)\\
--Lemon (not sure on the 'technical definition' but it seems to generally mean a story that involves sex scenes, or just a sex scene)\\
--Smut (If a story is labeled as smut, expect there to be sexy times)\\
--Erotica (Literally an erotic story) --M or Mature (Depending on the site it can mean heavy petting to full blown sex)\\
--NC17 (Usually mean people in the story are doing the nasty, but sometimes it just means really gory, but usually just lots o' sex)\\
--prePos(starts before first year, usually includes some of good old Dudders)\\
--pre Hogwarts (starts before Hogwarts)\\
--postPoS (starts after philosophers stone)(few stories)\\
--PostCS (starts after chamber of secrets)(few stories)\\
--postPoA (starts after prisoner of azkaban)(very popular)\\
--postGoF(Starts after Goblet of Fire)(Very Popular)\\
--postOoP sometimes postOotP (starts after order of the phoenix)(very popular)\\
--postHBP (starts after the half blood prince)(popular)\\
--postDH (starts after Deathly Hallows)(not a lot) --Marauder Era (takes place during lily and James' time at the old Hog)\\
--Founders Era (takes place during olden times)\\
--Next Generation (post epilogue, usually centered around harry's kids adventures)\\
--Post-Hogwarts (after Deathly Hallows)

*What length of story are you looking for?*\\
Do you want a quick read probably without much plot and lots of smut? -- probably 1000-5000 words\\
-- There is a lot of this, it varies widely in quality.\\
-- If this is what you want here are some key words that will help find this length (One-Shot, lemon scene)

Do you want a longer story, maybe not novel length but has more than one scene, is still mostly sex but has some plot? Like a Snape/Hermione fic that plays the student teacher fantasy out or something.\\
--5000-20/30k words\\
--I find that this length story is sometimes the hardest to find, and it is not what i typically read.\\
--Some key words that may help find this length (Novella, novelette)

Do you want a longer more novel length story that has a plot and all the sexy bits? (don't we all?)\\
-- 40k+ (some can run in the 300k word area)\\
-- These are fairly easy to find to be honest. Favorites tracker will have lists ready to go.\\
-- A google search of 'Novel length nc17/M harry potter fan fiction' can go a long way here, just make sure to put what pairings you are looking for.\\
--some keywords to help you find this length (novel length, long, epic, multi-year fic)

*The ROMANCE things/ common ff themes*\\
--Not exactly my area of expertise, but there are a few popular themes that i have noticed amongst the romancie fan fictions(really all harry potter fan fictions) that may let you look for something a bit more specific right away.

*Bonding Fics*\\
--Oh boy this is a popular one, with lots of different flavors. (most of these are from my experience with harry centric stories)\\
--Soul Bonding (#soulmates 4lyfe)\\
--Marriage Contracts (James and Lily signed his hand away)

*Independent Harry*\\
--Rebelling against Dumbledore's plan (usually meaning getting away from ginny)\\
--Founders/Lost Magic (usually involving inheriting special magic and there for having to marry or something of the like)\\
--Smart Harry (harry is smart and does not fall for manipulations, and gets the girl)\\
--Independent Harry (much like smart harry, but usually starts when he learns of a birth right he was not told of, "He is Lord Potter", or PostOOtp, "He is Lord Black", and special things happen)

*Dark Harry* --Dark Harry (Harry is all dangerously sexy and stuff, oh and he is evil or does dark magic)\\
--Team's up with Voldemort( i think this is how the HP/Voldie Slash goes?)\\
--Azkaban (Hard time changes a man)

*Not Dursely's Fics* --Adoption (Harry is not left at the Dursely's and grows up with a normal childhood usually magical but sometimes not.) --Runaway (runs away from home, somehow survives and gets his letter)

*Time Travel* --Using various methods (time turners, complex magic, accidental quantum time rips) people end up in the past/future, usually retaining their knowledge, only sometimes keeping their bodies. (this is an interesting branch of ff)

*Bad-Ass Mega Harry*\\
--Harry is super everything, usually found in PWP fan fictions. (but lets be real sometimes harry needs to be stronger than all the wizards alive combined x1000)

*The Final Bit* --I hope this is more than enough of an intro into not only what is out there, but some ideas about where and how to search for the kind of thing you want. --There is so much amazing stuff out there i wish you the best in what is sure to be a fun, and thrilling journey into the red-light district of Rowling's universe.

No more so than any other corner of the fandom, really. There's just so little of it compared to male slash, you may not have come across many good stories.

** If you're willing to wade through a lot of dross, you can try [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/][HP Adult Fanfiction]]. Also [[http://www.restrictedsection.org/][The Restricted Section]], but if I recall you have to register for that one.

Any particular pairings you're looking for? When it comes to smut, I mostly read slash (that's male/male or gay fanfic, in case you're really new), but even then I haven't in a while. I tend to stick to more gen stories these days. [[http://archiveofourown.org/][Archive of Our Own]] is great for smut, but I think it's mostly slash.

General word of advice -- fanfiction.net doesn't allow explicit works. Some always slip through the cracks, but you're a lot better off looking on other websites.

*** All those poor, quality stories that were destroyed in the great ff.net purge. (Moment of silence)

That was the end of that site really. Plus the newer content has no appreciable depth as opposed to full novels like Sunset/Sunrise Over Brittan and The Refiner's Fire.

** Adult-themed writing of decent quality (generally) can be found at [[http://www.patronuscharm.net/l/][Patronuscharm.net]] (search page linked). (For instance, I believe that this site is the only one hosting Vash's infamous Harry/Lilly/Harry's Sister incest trio, e.g.) To search for exclusively NC-17 stories, go to Ratings, click the "Not" button and NC-17 in the pulldown (this inverts the filter, showing only stories NC-17 and above instead of ones NC-17 and below).

Also, the DarkLordPotter site's [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=35][Restricted Section]] of their Library may be worth a visit.
