I was looking up something about Goblet of Fire and stumbled upon this line. It's at the graveyard, and Voldemort is addressing the Death Eaters - he calls them /his friends/ a couple of times - and I had completely forgotten that.

Now, I admit I have been reading fanfiction for far too long and haven't had read canon in a couple of years, but that line made me pause for a while. Those Death Eaters are supposed to be his inner circle, yes? Is he implying they knew about his quest to immortality? I know he trusted a few of them with his horcruxes - although they didn't know exactly what the objects were - but the wording made me think these pureblood pricks knew exactly what his ultimate goals were. It wasn't about conquering the magical world and killing all the muggleborns and blood traitors, it was about conquering Death.

Did he promised then the same thing? Immortality at his side? Let the low-level people kill themselves while they chase this worthy goal of defeating the true enemy? I have never thought about it from this perspective and now I kind of want a fic exploring that with the '94 inner circle...

Or better yet, a Tom Riddle and his first Death Eaters (classmates) fic where he convices them to join and assist him in pursuing the only goal worth fighting for, conquering Death. Thoughts?


** I think it's pretty clear that the Death Eaters knew about Voldemort's quest for immortality pretty early on, given their name. However, as you point out he didn't trust even Malfoy or Bellatrix with the knowledge of the Horcruxes, which makes me think that he never revealed /how/ he tried to achieve immortality. Your question about whether Voldemort promised immortality to his followers is an interesting one, and I don't think there's evidence one way or the other in the text. But all the Death Eaters we encounter seem to feel that blood purity is a sufficient motivation by itself.

*** "Death Eaters" is actually a hilarious name in the context of immortality. It's now canon that at some point in his life, Voldemort had a sense of humor!

**** Oh he always had a sense of humour, case in point that infamous line to Wormtail at the beginning of book four: ' I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform.'

*** Same. I like to believe that some of them knew about his goal of conquering Death. Surely at some point, Voldemort would've had to explain why he picked things like Death Eaters and a snake eating itself (which has its own meaning, you can google it).

*** Oh yeah, for some reason my brain didn't make the connection about their name as well lol. Perhaps they thought his quest was worthy but as it is an obscure one, they just enjoyed the fact that being one of his most trusted also meant that they could be free to pursue violence against muggleborns and others.

** Sounds like an interesting story to read, it certainly makes for a convincing reason for the purebloods to join him, achieving immortality would be just the right kind of reward that would make them follow Voldemort.

  think the name of the Death Eaters itself implies that mythologization too, yeah. those who eat (& overcome) death.
#+end_quote

Alternatively interpreted as literally meaning "cannon fodder" - as in, "bite the bullet".

** I think they knew, that was his goal. I don't think it was just about blood purity I think it was about being able to do magic freely. In the books there are a lot of restrictions on what spells are legal and aren't. From their point of view it holds them back. Even immortality is possible but illegal. Just imagine what from their point of view they could accomplish under someone's reign were they weren't being held back. I think that is what drew them to Lord Voldemort. The blood purity was a side issue because the same people making all the regulations supported protecting muggles. And the more power these people got the more restrictions and the more dark artifacts that were family heirlooms got taken from raids on their homes and the more power and standing they lost in society and the ministry. They needed a face for their animosity so muggle lovers and muggleborn became that face that they could blame.

** Regarding the "friends" I am pretty sure it's established elsewhere and by use that he has no friends, and only manipulates its use for his benefit.

That said, I am always one for making AU changes that are more interesting. For me Voldemort and Death Eaters are primary among the more boring elements in need.

It would be nice to see a brilliant student fixated on one issue and chase it to his own ruin, and sacrifice everything about living along with it- on its own. (without the overshadowing blood purity, or make that only the issue of a couple of death eaters, while others have their own motives/reasons. "put a stopper in death".

Come to think of it... I read a while ago a fic called "Old Blood" where Voldemort was purported to be an alchemist and his death eaters followers seeking immortality, I think, I'd need to catch up.

*** Yes, but I've grown so used to reading fanfiction Voldemort that I had completely forgotten that he used "friends" and "family" when talking to/about them.

** It would seem out of Voldemort's character for him to offer the other Death Eaters immortality. If he wants to be an immortal dark lord, he certainly doesn't want any competition for that title. Think back to the last movie when he told Snape, "Only I can live forever" (and no, the movies aren't canon like the books are, but I think that moment was a very good addition).

**** I agree. Now I really want to see the charming Tom Riddle giving a speech about how worthy his goal is and how he and only he is capable of not only achieving such a thing and but also seducing the early Death Esthers by offering to share this glory with them. To shape the world in their image after they are all immortal...
