** The author updates frequently. It's only been a month and a half since the last update, so it's a little absurd to already be asking if the fic is dead.

The author is active on this sub as well. [[/u/MTheLoud]]

*** Thanks. I'm working on it, but I'm also giving some attention to my other works in progress, and also recently developed the ambition to write an original novel. Plus I joined a band. I should probably get off Reddit and post an update already, huh?

**** Take whatever time you need! I will love your update(s) regardless of when they get posted, so I hope you never feel pressured to rush.
