Just curious. This seems to be a thing in fan fiction more than original fiction.


** TL;DR: It's difficult to pull off. And it feels unfamiliar.

Take /The Hunger Games/, a first-person present-tense novel that has a similar audience to Harry Potter. Why does its narrative work?

/The Hunger Games/ is a very visceral, fast-paced story that develops a lot of Katniss's character inside her head. First person is very good for capturing the intensity of the fighting; present tense is very good for her rushes of emotion that exclude wider context.

But this has the effect of *flattening the narrative.* The reader is slammed into Katniss's train of thought with very little perspective---something the film tried to add. And so the entire story is reliant on relating to the main character's voice. Fortunately for /The Hunger Games/, Katniss's narrative seems to have appealed to the young adult audience.

(In a similar way, /Twilight/'s first person narrator gives us access to her immediate emotions and reactions, which is critical to a romance novel.)

But this also could explain some of the criticisms of the later two books. As traumatic events pile onto our hero's psyche, her character is increasingly alienated from the average reader. Very few readers understand PTSD and, the flattened narrative gives little chance for them to gather perspective for Katniss's actions.

Thus, first-person stories need to relate to the reader.

Additionally, first-person writing is not native to /Harry Potter/ . A fan of canon is used to a limited third person point of view in the past tense. Why does this point of view work in /Harry Potter/? I think this is due to the dreamy, fairy-tale quality of the story. The story is whimsical, adventurous, and /feels/ like a bedtime story. The limited third person puts us just outside of Harry's head so that we can relate to him... and yet we get a larger perspective, especially for events of which Harry is unaware.

And so the author has two very large issues to tackle when attempting to write in a different style than canon:

1. Appropriate story. The author must have a quality story that benefits from the flattened narrative style. Applying Sturgeon's Law, this will not work 90% of the time.
2. Good writing. The author must hook the reader into an unfamiliar, new style of writing which differs from canon. Applying Sturgeon's Law again, this will not work 90% of the time.

Thus by simple probability, a first-person story will not succeed 99% of the time.

That's not to say it's impossible to write in first-person point of view. linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) is decently popular. But most writers will write with what is comfortable; 3^{rd} person is thus the most common.

**** I would like to add that it is nearly impossible to write a first person Harry in a longer story if you really want to catch the character. The Dursleys alone would (realistically speaking) leave Harry traumatized and damaged. Then a young teen is again and again thrown into life endangering situations while at school, nearly dies a dozen times before he is thrown into a civil war which he has to lead because the magical adults are staggeringly incompetent. The ministry expert on non-magical things has no clue about 95% of the things a ten-year-old could tell him for example.

So writing this character in first person would be really difficult, especially the thoughts of someone who is guaranteed to be traumatized before Hogwarts even starts.

Sure, first person might work for shorter stories or smut but if you try a multi-year story you will find it incredibly difficult to even draft it, much less write the thing.

** There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4mq5ql/do_you_prefer_first_or_third_person_perspective/][a thread with a similar question a while ago]]. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4mq5ql/do_you_prefer_first_or_third_person_perspective/d3xxemx/][My take]] is reproduced below.

*TL;DR:* I think that first-person is harder to do well in HP fanfic in particular, because the lead protagonist's personality doesn't lend itself well to first-person narration.

Whereas a third-person story can have any set of protagonists, the first person' story /requires/ that the point-of-view character be someone inside whose head you are willing to spend the whole story. It doesn't have to be a sympathetic point of view (e.g., Humbert Humbert from /Lolita/), but it has to be interesting. Now, different things are interesting to different people. Those who want to spend several novels inside Bella Swan's head might not want to spend the time inside Taylor Hebert's, and vice versa. They are also situational. Relatively few people would want to spend a slice-of-life story inside the head of a Bella Swan who /doesn't/ meet vampires or a Taylor Hebert who /doesn't/ trigger.

With all that in mind, I don't know whether there are any characters in HP canon that are well suited. Harry Potter --- our everyman hero --- doesn't strike me as someone with a rich inner world; his motivations and plans are simple, and there is little thoughtfulness or hesitancy to him. This is not a strike against his character at all: if he were a character in a Shakespearean play, he might get the part of a decent, solid type like Horatio (from /Hamlet/). But he would get no soliloquies. (One can, of course, go full OOC, but that brings in its own issues.)

Every other canon character with even a vaguely defined personality has the problem that, because /canon/ is from Harry's point of view, and because the Harry--Voldemort conflict is central to the series, unless it's a pretty heavy AU, time-travel, or some other way to break out of the canon setting and general plot, they and the insides of their head aren't going to be central to the A-Plot; but breaking out of the canon setting and general outline ups the difficulty level of writing the fic, so the resulting fic is either not written at all or is written poorly.

** I am not sure why exactly, but I usually can't even get past the first paragraph of almost all first person POV stories that I have read. The writing in these just seems really bad, immature, full of awkward phrases and thought processes that seem completely wrong and cringey for the character or the situation. I can handle bad/okay writing in 3rd person POV if the story interests me, but anything less than amazing for 1st person POV stories is just completely unreadable to me. It makes adults and complex characters sound like teenagers who have no clue what they are doing and drives me completely crazy.

That said, seventh horcrux is one of my favorite fics so maybe it's just the writing quality that bothers me so much.

*** When I first storages writing I always went with 1st person. Idk why. I never got far in my stories either. They all sounded so bad, and so uncreative. Everything I wrote sounded the same, even when I was using drastically different settings.

When I tried 3rd person my writing sounded to much better, almost immediately. I'm not saying that I magically turned into Shakespeare, but still. It was a pretty noticeable difference.

Now, way later, I've realized the problem was when I was writing using first person I was basically writing unintentional self-inserts. Every time I used "I", I couldn't stop myself from writing as if the character was actually me. That was why everything sounded so uncreative and so much the same. And it was also why I couldn't get character voice right if my life depended on it.

I know it /sounds/ ridiculous. Who is so stupid that they can't write in 1st without making a self insert? Well, it turns out a lot of people are. Including me, lol.

That's my theory, anyways.

(I also think the nature of 1st makes even the smallest of character-voice issues stick out like a sore thumb, while 3rd person can disguise them pretty well. So it's a compound issue really.)

** First person is a good technique for creating intimacy between the reader and the character. It also creates a clear perspective for the story - it's not as easy to make mistakes such as slipping from 3rd person limited to 3rd person omniscient. It also grounds the narrative in immediacy if using present tense, and can provide decent character study if [in past tense] the character is being retrospective. When I read something in first person, I want it to sound like the character, not the author, is narrating the story to me, and some people can't capture character voice for that long - it's especially noticeable if the author is switching 1st person POVs and every character sounds the same.

When people read fic, they also want it to somewhat emulate the books, not only in the type of perspective used, but in writing style; for example, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/855528/chapters/1637607][here's]] a popular LOTR fic that has elements of Tolkien's style [but the writing style is more 'modern' than Tolkien's]. I've read plenty of fics for TV/movie fandoms, and I've noticed that most of the fics I've liked [and that are written] are in 3rd person.

** For me it's the fact that if you do FP you only have the emotions and motivations of the one character (sure: This character can observe or guess the emotions and motivations of the other characters (fact is: If done realistically that one character can be WRONG of course!), but with an outside perspective and a kind of all knowing story-teller you get stuff into perspective more IMHO), also:

It's very hard (a lot harder than having a story-teller) to pull off convincingly (I remember only one HP that tried and wasn't too bad, I think it was called "Bungle in the Jungle" (or something like that))

*** Bungle in the Jungle is actually /second/ person pov, which is much more unpopular than first person and is almost insanely difficult to pull off unless you're writing a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book. Bungle in the Jungle does okay, though it takes a few chapters to adjust to it.

** 1st-person POV is easy to write and easy to write poorly.

Basically, the appeal for an author/writer is in its emotional closeness, an extremely character-shaded narrative voice, and accessibility/ease of use as a technique -- after all, what could be easier than writing from the perspective that most people generally think in?

But it has its problems too: self-indulgence; writing in an "empty room" (lack of description); inner thoughts taking over the story; too much exposition/telling; valuing quirkiness/wordplay over substance or plot; /I, I, I/ all over the place; shallow stream-of-consciousness; non-relevant things cluttering the story; lack of characterization for anyone else; and so on.

(It's also a form of constrained writing, but that's as much of a pro as it is a con, so it doesn't really belong in either column.)

Those drawbacks? That's just for published/pro works. Now take those bad parts and add a lack of editing and/or betas, scads of novice writers, and absolutely zero need to worry about the general public buying your shit and you'll have the reason why most fanfic readers avoid 1st-person fanfics:

/They usually suck./

*tl;dr* 1st-person POV is a lot like painting in watercolors -- it's fun to dabble with, especially if you're new, but if you're trying to do anything serious, you'll have to have a lot of practice first.

** 1. It's very hard to get into the mind of these people. Anyone you would choose would be an impossible task unless you are like them yourself. So a Dumbledore first-person would be out of the question. Hermione first persons would be very odd to read, as all we would be reading, is her quoting back to several books she read to find an automatic solution to a problem. I believe that I could write a really good first-person Harry narrative, but it's kind of a hard thing to start, I'll probably try it in the summer.

2. It's unfamiliar territory, thus, easier to get wrong. Rowling's narrative consisted of solely world-building, character-building was a minor priority that wasn't really explored. So you would have to do a lot, and I mean a lot, of guessing or using yourself to make up a character's internal dialogue. Some people just don't have the writing chops for that, so they stick with simply adding more internal dialogue to Rowling's template, something Lev Grossman accomplished very well.

3. Almost all world-building would have to be done through the main character's observations, speaking with other people, or reading books. Once again, a tedious task.

** For the HP fandom, it might just be "the default" as the HP series was written in 3rd person. Similarly, a majority Twilight fics are written in 1st person (same as the books) // a majority of Hunger Games fics are written in 1st present (again, same as the books).

Can't speak to movies or tv shows, but fanfiction has a tendency to follow the tense of the books they're being written for.

***** Misogyny, for one. There are several female characters. Two are not there for sex, and only one of the characters there for sex was not being manipulative. That's the author's fault more than something specifically loathsome about Harry's portrayal. However, it doesn't help that the one female character who was on Harry's side and didn't primarily have sex with him was referred to primarily as "the hag".

*** I think they are better left for “choose your own adventure” stuff, as linear stories are even harder to write well in second person perspective than they are in first person perspective due to the fact that being able to relate to the character on whom the narration centres is even more important there and the lack of choice (and thus a set personality) make that even harder. Additionally, where first person perspective stories can offer us a view inside the character's head (and thoughts) in exchange for a flatter narrative, with second person perspective you do do have the latter but not the former unless the character's thoughts match the thoughts of the reader perfectly (in which case they'll get inserted without being written).
