Seriously. I've read dozens of xover fics and in almost all of them harry gets punted through the veil.

What gives?


** nebulous doorway that already exists in canon makes more sense then making up some kind of arbitrary nebulous doorway

** Because it's a convenient way to get a character into an alternate universe. Sure, you could make something else up, but it doesn't really matter much after the first chapter, so there's not much need to.

And it gives the hope that Sirius might still be alive somewhere.

** How to get character from world X to world Y? (In order of difficulty)

1) No explanation. Magic.

2) Death.

3) Plausible scenario that causes character to travel across universes.

The Veil falls somewhere between all of them. A little bit of magic, a little bit of death, a little bit of plausible reason.

** Easiest way to get straight to the alternate universe instead of looking lazy by not even giving a real reason or wasting time by making some sort of buildup. If it aint broke...
