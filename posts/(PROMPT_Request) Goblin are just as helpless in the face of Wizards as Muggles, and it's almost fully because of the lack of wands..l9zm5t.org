I was thinking about the Goblin rebellions, and how current Goblins have full control over Wizard economy (is that only in Britain, or the whole WW, I never found a good answer to that?). But channeling my inner Vsauce: /Or do they?!/

The main thing here is that they are not allowed to use wands, and as such the only Magic they are able to do is some basic telekinesis, and rituals (which are mostly about making more fertile soil, warding off wild animals, etc; things that would be pretty useless militarily).

Since they deal with the Wizarding world, they can't operate as a regular bank, because people would just apparate into vaults and rob them dry. So, who do they hire to ensure protection? Wizards. Enchanting money pouches and other magical items in the Bank? Wizards. Archeological digs, which the Wizards made it seem like a big concession to Goblins? Well, they gotta unweave spells, so again, it's done by Wizards.

The Gringotts higher-ups and tellers may be Goblin, but the bank actually runs because of the Wizards they employ. And if they ever try another rebellion? Well, the Ministry already has a small task-force in the Bank, ready to turn the whole place into a Goblin prison. It's also why they don't just crash the Wizarding economy out of spite. It would be seen as an act of war, and they just can't win it.

A few more ideas:

1. Besides Goblin law/tradition, another reason they are so adamant in Wizards returning Goblin made objects, is because they were made in a time when they could still use wands, and as such, such objects are impossible to make nowadays. Maybe they want everything they can use as a weapon back to them, or it's simply spite, but such objects can't be made anymore.
2. Using dragons and other beasts as defense was Goblins attempting to loophole Wizards out of Gringotts, but since everything dragon and beast related is heavily regulated by the Ministry, they quietly stopped the commerce of any powerful beast with the Goblins.
3. Blood ancestry tests would never, in a million years, be done by Gringotts. Wizards would never trust Goblins with something as powerful as blood. They're done (if you headcanon them existing in the first place), by the Ministry, and results are send to Gringotts if there is any financial side-effect they need to manage. Or if they are done by Gringotts, it's done by a fully-human office, under strict oaths to the Ministry.
4. /(Pure headcanon)/ House-elves were created by Wizards using Goblin prisoners, on which they performed countless rituals and perhaps even mixed with other, more magically potent, creatures in order to engineer a servant race. This is why *A.* Goblins absolutely loathe the House-elves and want them gone by any means necessary and *B.* Why Wizards don't just make millions of House-elves and gift them to everyone in the country (tho idk why fertility and lust potions wouldn't do this too).
5. The wand ban isn't as explicit as that. It's a ban on Goblins using any sort of conduit for guiding/using/enhancing their Magic. It's why they don't just use staffs, or something new entirely, like rings, bracelets, etc.

Thoughts? And feel free to use these concepts if you want, and also recommend any fic in which they may appear.


** I think Goblins defensive/offensive magic lies in their ability for metalwork. If they can create weapons that can absorb whatever makes them more powerful, what's to say that they cannot forge armors that are impenetrable by magic or shields that would reflect back a spell at the caster. Also they probably can incorporate in their weapons a few curses of their own. My headcanon is that they would probably prefer wands because of convenience... metalwork takes time, knowledge of the craft, proper tools... while with a wand you just say a few silly words and there you go.

I also like to assume the fact that goblins are now tamer is because even though they are not getting their wands, most of their military equipment had been destroyed or taken by wizards and they are bidding their time until they can bring it back to the levels they had it during the rebellions. However most of them don't know how to use Goblin magic (even Hermione only figures out the purpose of the sword of Gryffindor when she overhears the Goblins talking) and probably Gringotts has some magic of its own (like the carts that can only be steered by an authorized Goblin) that wizards cannot penetrate. So rather than destroy the Goblins and lose their gold, wizards preferred to reach some agreements with them instead.

** I think that goblins inherent magic is more along the lines of creating stuff, sort of like the artificer in D&D. Can't do much practical magic without a wand, but can make magical artifacts (although these are expensive and time consuming to create). In addition, I think somewhere (the fantastic beasts book maybe, or I might just be misremembering some fanfiction) it was mentioned that house elves were domesticated from some sort of German forest spirits.

** Could be a good idea, but then it brings the question of why such a supremacist and xenophobic society(on average) as the Britain Wizard one just doesn't take over the bank instead of letting the goblins have it.

Canon implies the Goblins are a threat of such magnitude the Wizards let them take care of their gold, they forge weapons that are indestructible, and have places that not even powerful wizards can enter, they also "tame" dragons.

The way it seems to be in canon is that Gringotts is worldwide, and the British Wizards have to accept them if they want to have a bank, Gringotts predates the Ministry and the Statute of Secrecy, they are the equivalent of the Iron Bank of Braavos.

We also aren't clear on how great an advantage a Wand gives someone, I am pretty sure a gun is better (for an average person) because Wizards can't dodge bullets and only very, very few would be able to block them.

The average wizard is not that good at combat even /with/ a wand.

There seems to be an impression that the average Wizard is good at combat, the truth is, they aren't, Order Members are good at combat, Aurors are the equivalent of SWAT, and people like Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, and Harry Potter are few and far between.

Simply in the situation where Goblins are defenseless against wizards, and not a worldwide backed Bank, it's too much a suspension of disbelief that people like Lucius Malfoy wouldn't manipulate Fudge to take over.

** Because all it takes to mass produce basilisk are toads and eggs and when you're as hateful as a goblin? What's there to lose.

That and it's a numbers thing, I think. There are a LOT more goblins than wizards in canon
