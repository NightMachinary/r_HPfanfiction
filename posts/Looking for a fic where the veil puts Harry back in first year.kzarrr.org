:END:
Harry Potter fanfic where Harry is visiting the veil after he has 2 kids with Ginny but falls through and he gets out in his first year body


** There's probably a few of the Peggy Sue!fics with this set-up, but the first that comes to mind is "Oh God Not Again!"

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
