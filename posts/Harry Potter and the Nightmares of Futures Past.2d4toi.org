I was just wondering if anyone knew anything about the state of the work, whether it's on hiatus or permanently abandoned or if someone else has finished it or if it has been finished elsewhere. Because it's great, and I'm having an awfully hard time leaving it off where it is. Thanks!

*** It's amazingly well written, it would be a shame if it was abandoned (especially after the climactic last chapter).

** It's still updating, just /very/ slowly.

I know what you mean though about the quality. Back in its heyday, it was easily one of the top few stories in the fandom.
