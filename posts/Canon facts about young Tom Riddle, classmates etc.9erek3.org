I'm thinking about writing a story and the main character is going to be young Tom. I have a rough draft in my mind about the major events that are going to happen and I'd like to stay as close to Canon as possible. Is there a place that has Canon facts like birth/accomplishments/classmates/other info on Tom riddle while at the orphanage/Hogwarts?

Also a list of canon spells/potions/lore?

Thanks in advance!!!


** There's [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/tom-riddle][Pottermore]], [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/riddle-family/tom-riddle/][HP Lexicon]], and the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Riddle][Harry Potter Wiki]]. I personally use HP Lexicon the most, but they all have their value. The lexicon and Wiki both offer easy to search lists for potions and spells and the like too. If I remember right, though, the Harry Potter Wiki's compilation of info includes everything Harry Potter, from the books, to the movies, to PS2 games, and so forth. So, be careful if you choose that one as your fact-checking source, because if you count the books as canon, but not video games, some spells or potions may not be canon to you and may make your story "AU" if you use them.

** Minerva McG was a peer of his. I'm not sure if she's the same age, but she definitely did attend around the same time as TMR. Same with Hagrid, who's two years younger than TMR.

*** If I remember correctly, she attends Hogwarts once he graduates, maybe even after.
