After reading nightmare man and dead things, I want fanfics with an Evil Harry. I don't mean dark lord or something because they usally have Harry with a goal. I want one where he is evil maybe even insane, with him killing people just for fun and stuff like that

** Self Promotion if I may? It's based on the premise that Harry Potter is the Outer God Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos, it's also a crack fic.

  On a whim, Bill Cipher takes a short break and returns to Gravity Falls with the young Harry Potter under his arm. Ten years later, Harry arrives at Hogwarts with a love of physical pain, a stash of severed heads, and dexterity in demon magic. Inexplicably Human!Bill sometimes but not always. INCONSISTENT UPDATES.
