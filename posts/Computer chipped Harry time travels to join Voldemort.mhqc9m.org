:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic a while ago (year or more) that I would love to find again.

-Harry travels back in time (to summer after fifth year?- I don't remember Sirius in the fic.)

-He joins Voldemort, likely to be slash (probably HP/LV).

-HP has a *computer chip* in his body (neck?) that causes him pain when he apparates (or prevents the ability?) and he gets it surgically removed.

-Muggles of his time discover magic and wage war (against all magical beings: goblins, centaurs, etc.?)

-HP is a paranoid, PTSD, full on war veteran. Complete with knives, firearms, and potions on-hand at all times.

-Likely on AO3 or [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]

If ANYONE could help me find this, or at least let me know it actually did exist, I would greatly appreciate it. I feel like I have been periodically searching for this fic for 6 months.

Thank you!


** It does exist, that I know but I can't remember the name for the life of me. It was eden somthing, I think.

*** Thanks for reassuring me that it was not a figment of my imagination. I'll definitely try to find one with Eden in the title (knowing my luck its on my favorites).

Edit: Nope still no luck. Soooo frustrating!

**** I also remember that Voldemort traveled to either Hiroshima or Nagasaki and saw the destruction.
