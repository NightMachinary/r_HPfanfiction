:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a multi chapter fanfic that I read years ago on fanfiction.net (I think). Here is every thing I can remember from the plot. James is too late that night in saving Snape and he ends up being killed, but Dumbledore manages to cover things up but the boys decide they can't forgive Sirius. James and Lily become close over the years, especially over her grief over Snape's death and start dating. Years later, they are all part of the Order and I remember a scene where Regulus is working as a spy and ends up hurt so Sirius brings him to headquarters, which is when they all see each other again. I distinctly remember that Lily didn't trust Sirius and struggled with the boys talking again. Another scene is when Mr and Mrs potter get dragon pox and are dying and Sirius is there comforting James. I would love to read it again so I would appreciate your help it finding it. Thank you

Edit: I also remember that Sirius got involved with his family and deatheaters since he was no longer protected by the potters, so he was close to regulus and they became spys for the order

**** Any idea on the word count and rating? Was it complete or in progress? I'm assuming the genre would be Angst (at least one of them) but can your remember the time range? Was Snape a main character?

***** Hmm probably T? I don't think there were any explicit scenes in there. Also it was quite long I think, multi-chaptered with long chapters, not sure exactly how many words I'm not a hundred percent sure about the status but I think it may have been complete The genre may have been friendship or maybe hurt/comfort? No idea about the time range, but I would have read it in the last five years or so, so at least published before 2015 I'm pretty sure Snape died in like the first chapter so he wasn't the main character. It mainly revolved around James and Sirius

****** Was Lily a main character? I've been searching with James and Lily as characters, rated T, and >10k words, and the closest that I found is one where Severus is turned into a Werewolf. I'm on page 8 of the results, but under those conditions there's 205 fanfics.

******* I am not sure, she might have been since I was obsessed with jily around the time I read this I'm almost certain Snape died though, since it was one of the things James and lily connected over initially.
