** "Hrmph. Sloppy, my boy, terribly sloppy."

Griselda Marchbanks, head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority, stood over the heavily bound form on the floor of Hogwarts' Great Hall, tapping her wand against her chin in thought.

"I can give you full points for the disarming charm, that was a thing of beauty, but the body bind isn't going to hold him terribly long."

"I'm sorry Madam Marchbanks, I was in a bit of a hurry." Harry Potter did not sound at all surprised that his Defense Against The Dark Arts practical exam had been invaded by a Dark Lord, as much as a bit peeved at the critique of his bindings.

"I suppose that is somewhat of a mitigating factor," said the old witch, before her wand flicked out and wrapped the still struggling figure of the man calling himself Lord Voldemort in glowing golden chains. "But mind you practice on that before using it in the field."

"Yes, ma'am!"

"Wouldn't want you to end up covered in transfiguration accidents like this one." Leaning over the prone form, Marchbanks prodded the Dark Lord with one pointed shoe. "Clearly he didn't pay any attention in his later classes."

** "For /fucks sake/ Voldie, really? You're supposed to be 'the dark lord', 'reigner of terror', and all of these other, bullshit titles, but /look at you,"/ The man was utterly exasperated, even as all of the children cowered in fear, "You /do/ know that the dark arts has tens, hell, even thousands more spells than just /avada kedavra,/ right? You /have/ to know that, you absolute /shithead,/"

The students were watching in awe now. Voldemort, The Dark Lord Supreme, was getting absolutely bodied by some random auror. He could barely keep his wits about him, without another spell being thrown at him. It was all he could do to keep throwing the right shield spells up.

"L-like I can't /even, Jesus Christ./ No wonder you made an actual fucking child your enemy, you useless prick, you wouldn't be able to fight anyone else!" He threw another spell at the man, who this time, almost managed to hit him.

The man caught the spell in midair, and looked at it with frank disappointment, "Only half as much power you'd need to put into the Imperius charm for it to work, Tom. What the hell happened, man? I went to school with you and shit," He threw the spell back with a power adjustment, and watched Voldemort flip out of the way, a look of horror on his face, from the spell that just barely missed.

"Honestly, given the fact that nobody has been able to catch you, I think I'm starting to question the world where a literal child is better than half of the actual /fucking/ Order of the Phoenix," He threw another spell, and it slammed into Voldemort's shoulder, "Y'know what? Fuck this, /Obliviate,"/ It slammed straight into Voldemort, erasing all of his memories in a millisecond.

After a moment of stretching post-battle, the man looked through the crowd, "Yo, Harry, I know you're around here somewhere, y'might not know it yet, but there's these things called Horcruxes, which the big man without a brain used to use,"

"Horcruxes?" The very confused man without a nose asked, "What are horcruxes?"

"They're a really good kind of soup that Nan used to make,"

** It's not the proctors, but someone wrote about all of these old biddies (the Hogsmeade Knitting Guild) who managed to take down Voldemort, the Death Eaters, and the Order of the Phoenix in the same evening. So many Noodle Incidents!

  AKA: The Grannies strike back. Hermione joins the Knitting Guild of the Wizarding World and discovers that there are those out there more powerful than Voldemort, Dumbledore or the Ministry. This is a short, silly story of how the ancient matriarchs of the Wizarding world take on Voldemort and win, then reform the world in their image, that is to say, far better mannered of course.

** It's not the proctors but in the second of the Armistice Series (the books following the Changeling by Annerb) Harry does have to face an.. unexpected obstacle in his NEWTS. Would recommend reading the whole series but if you want to just read the chapter concerning the NEWTS it is chapter 18
