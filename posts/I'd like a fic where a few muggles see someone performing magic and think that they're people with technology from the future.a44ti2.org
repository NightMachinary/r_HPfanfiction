Like perhaps the spell Wingardiumleviosa,where they think it's some force field kind of thing.


** Hmm, I've never seen anything like that. Would be interesting.

** I beleive tony runs with just that assertion in Linkffn(heroes assemble by stargon1). Or maybe it was linkffn(child of the storm)? Perhaps both.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

** Not quite the same, but I've read one where Aunt Marge discovers Harry's accidental magic, does some reading in the library, and decides he's simply manifesting a variety of ESP.
