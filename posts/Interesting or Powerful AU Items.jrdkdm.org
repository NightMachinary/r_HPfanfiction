If you've got any ideas for powerful magical items that you wanted to use (but couldn't write) or see used in a story then I'm taking oneshot requests as a challenge.

Interestingly, I'm also requesting stories with powerful magical items in them, besides the Goblet of Fire and the Sword of Gryffindor. All other op magical items welcome.

(Edit) I had an idea for a set of magical walls linked to interplanetary ley lines that allow them to contain a wizardspace the size of the surface of the earth each in them. Any other ideas on this welcome as well.


** I like idea's that seem more whimsical than outright powerful in my artifacts. Like, a concept taken to its absolute extreme by magic rather than being especially powerful something. So, in my mind all these artifacts need to be some unique wonder that cannot be easily replicated by magic while also simultaneously being not inherently super useful (or atleast not amazingly OP).

A dagger that can cut anything (shadows, reflections, ect.anything metaphorical but simultaneously can literally be physically cut can be cut or cut off with this)

A latern that can shine "some light" on an area (havent decided whether this means if any secret in the area is instantly revealed by the light Felix Felicis style or it forces literally only truth to be told in its area).

A magical wallet that uses felix felicis style luck to get the owner in situations where it will turn full of gold, but might backfire (IE bad luck of close relative dying suddenly and leaving only enough inheritance to fill the wallet monkey's paw/evil genie style)

A sundial that slows time while you focus on it (but only while you focus on it).

Edit: A statue of a man with both hands outstretched in opposite directions while doing a handshake. Any party making a deal while holding both hands will be magically upheld to that deal (I always disliked how super easy magical oaths made things in fics. Why have courts or lawyers if a magical oath can verify the truth with a sentence? Making it a rare and very powerful artifact makes it much harder) I made up the rest but I think this one is from a Taure fic but not qoute me on the source

** The mirror of Erised in the versions I've encountered it is extremely powerful, more than the sword of Gryffyndor and probably more than the Goblet of Fire.

Orders of Magnitude has a few more super powerful artifacts. Minor spoiler: the Goblet of Fire in OOM goes all the way back to before Merlin's time. In those days it was called the Cup of Dawn. It's mentioned as a semi-throwaway factoid that it was also the Holy Grail. There was also a Cup of Midnight and a few other such items.

I think rather than Potterverse artifacts per se, you might like to read some large scale science fiction, that will put your imagination into a high enough gear.

** I know how to turn a portkey into a weapon of mass destruction (as long as it's possible to make a repeating portkey and use runes to "program" it, which is a pretty common assumption in fanon). That counts as OP, right?
