I'm looking for any crossover fics that feature as a father. He can be the father of a character from another franchise or even an OC.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/426848]] This is one of my favorites, it's a Harry Potter/Glee crossover and Harry is pretty much Teddy's father.

*** Do I need any knowledge of Glee to enjoy this? I don't really want to watch the show, but parenthood fics are hard to come by.

Edit: I just looked and realized it's slash, so nevermind.

  It was an unspoken rule between the Holmes brothers that one did not mention their father. John was beginning to understand why. He also gets to meet Mummy. Great fun is had by all. Particularly Mycroft. SH/JW Slash.
