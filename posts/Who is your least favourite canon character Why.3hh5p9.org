*** My first crush as a boy was probably Dolores Umbridge from the Harry Potter books. That strict authoritarian shell, but hints of her femininity with her love of kittens and pink, it's enough to drive a man wild. Sometimes I like to pretend I'm a centaur... and well, I'm sure you can guess the rest. Edit: Don't pretend like you wouldn't like to be punished!

I would have a bad opinion of anyone who thought they could impartially judge their child's criminal trial. The very fact that you even think that probably shows that you're leaning too far in one direction or the other, and the direction Crouch Sr. was leaning towards was hate. You aren't supposed to be able to ignore your teenager screaming for you to help them, that's something I'd expect of a robot or a Vulcan. It's not a very human thing to do.

***** Mmhmm. I've read a few fics where that is a thing. Certainly seems like a plausible outcome. Snape is a prick and poor teacher=kids don't learn=fewer graduates ready for jobs. I doubt students left Hogwarts thinking "I hated Snape at first, but now I appreciate his hardass attitude and learned a lot from him". There is probably a nice cottage industry of pre-hogwarts potions tutoring. Parents would know that Snape doesn't teach but tells 1st years to 'start chopping!'. No beginners basics, how to chop or dice, choose good ingredients, set up a workspace, safety awareness. Nope, just complete inductive teaching: "blow yourself up enough and you'll learn eventually". You will probably enjoy these two links. The fic is a short story along the lines of "what if Hogwarts had to pretend to be a muggle school to pass an inspection". The blogspot is similar, in that it's a mock report of an inspection done of the school.

Why don't they just rename DADA and split it up into different classes (dark animals into Care and Keeping, then name a class "Counters to Offensive Spells" or something) to get rid of the curse?

It's because Dumbledore is a crap administrator. A brilliant wizard I'm sure, but he's too focused on whatever else to really run that school efficiently, or care about people's lives that he's destroying. He wanted Snape close to him, it doesn't seem like Snape wanted to be teaching.

Though, of course, Snape was already heading down that path. Which is why it's a little strange to me that people think Lily was so mean for not forgiving him for one little slip of the tongue, or whatever. It wasn't one little slip of the tongue. It was the last straw. She let things go and supported him for years and years, as he associated with people who thought she deserved to die. I think she was a far better friend to him than he deserved, actually! Obviously she forgave a lot of Snape because he was her first wizarding friend, but at a certain point, you have to take a stand, and when your BFF, who spends all his time with people who think you are less than human and is slowly being recruited into an organization that MURDERS people like you and your family screams a racial slur at you when you're just trying to help him... I think that time has come.

It's funny, even SNAPE doesn't think that what he did was acceptable (that's why it is his worst memory). But fandom seems ready to throw him a parade for it half the time...

*** Snape is my favorite character and always has been - from the entire series. Lol!

I'm not trying to change anyone's mind on him, I just want to share why I like him:

He was not a terrible person. He was a man who never allowed himself to heal.

He was raised in an abusive, harsh environment. He never received support or love except from one person whom he loved more than anything, and whom he ruined any chance he had with her. Yes, there are other characters in the series who suffer and who become better, even great people. Snape isn't one of them - he is himself. Not everyone can get over things which have deeply wounded them. Time doesn't heal all wounds.

People can be in the same situation, but because people are individuals, that same situation will have many different outcomes. Snape's destiny was of his own molding, his own making.

He is an excellent example of a character who is on the side of good, but not necessarily a good person.

Severus was a deeply flawed, complex, contradictory individual. He had his horrible side and his great side. He was a mixture, a clash of the best and the worst. He was two sides of the same coin; light and darkness, night and day.

He was a bully...and a savior.

He was a traitor...he was loyalty defined.

He was petty...he was just.

He was selfish...he sacrificed.

He was cruelty...he was honor.

He loathed for years...he loved for a lifetime.

My favorite character from the whole series and a character I undoubtedly feel immense pity for and who I really love, flaws and all. Truly a great character.

***** I think part of what makes Snape a good character, though, is that he's actually a somewhat realistic person in certain regards. I think people tend to just see Snape being mean to students as a sign that he's just an asshole, but think about it: he absolutely hates children, and he hates teaching. He was essentially blackmailed into taking the position by Dumbledore. Wouldn't you be an asshole and do your job poorly if you absolutely hated it and were being forced to do it for the rest of your life?

You're right. The way he acts isn't /good/. But its realistic, unlike pretty much every other protagonist's actions and motivations.

Though honestly, I've had jobs I hated dealing with people I didn't like, and I didn't treat people awfully. I think the lack of any real consequences encouraged his behavior to an extent.

I can't say I agree.

I feel that he didn't do either one more than the other - like everything else in his life, his loathing and his love were balanced. A contradictory pair if you will, like everything else in his life. He was never one thing or the other, not more or less either. He was a perpetual mix of good and bad, right and wrong. Black and white.

While contrary and paradoxical, at the same time his emotions are balanced like I showed in my first post.

He was too complex to be one thing and not the other. Everything in his life was equally balanced and opposing.

His relationship with Harry was like this too:

He loathed Harry because Harry is James' son.

He protected him because he is Lily's child.

He tormented Harry because his father had tormented him.

He kept Harry safe because his mother was the love of his life.

He wasn't nice about it at all; he was cruel and mean and vicious...and yet, to be faced with the face of the man who bullied you for years in school and at the same time, to look into the eyes everyday of the one who you loved more than life itself isn't easy. Not many would do so. Again, Snape is caught in-between like always.

Even this is a contradiction.

Where's the duality loathe/love in outing Lupin as a werewolf?

What about literally /anyone/ who isn't Harry?

He is filled with bitterness, regret and most of all hatred. The only person he gives a damn about is Lily, that's not balance that's obsession.

******* The way he treats Neville is 100% the negative side of his (Snape's) personality. There is no justification in it, it is bullying plain and simple. It started off because Neville was incompetent in Potions - but in no way does that make Snape's attitude to him alright or acceptable in any way.

Sirius...

Sirius was a bully to Snape for years along with the rest of the M. gang. Every year Snape was at Hogwarts, Sirius and Co. bullied him. Sirius even says in the 5th book to Harry "Snape was a special case..." Even later as an adult, the loathing between Sirius and Snape is fully reciprocated - they cannot stand each other. Snape treats Sirius badly; in turn, Sirius does the same.

Lupin - yeah, I'm never going to defend Snape outing Lupin's condition to everyone and getting him fired. Then again, he did make Lupin the werewolf potion through the entire school year despite loathing the man - to Snape, Lupin was never going to be a separate person from when he was in the Marauders. Even though Lupin (from what we've seen) didn't bull Snape...he didn't stand up for him either. Lupin is the representation of those years of bullying to Snape and Snape could never seen him as anything but. He never forgave Lupin and never cared for him.

Not true though. He has a basically cordial relationship with the staff. He's alright with Dumbledore as well, though his relationship with the man remains complex. He's not a friendly, open person by nature. He's reserved and an asshole. He's not going to go head over heels with anyone and doesn't want to either.

As for Lily...

Is it so hard to believe that a person can love someone, and stay in love with them regardless of anything? Lily was the only good thing in Snape's life. He came from an abusive family, was dirt poor and had no friends. She was there for him. At Hogwarts he was unpopular, bullied and "the outcast". She again, was there for him.

Come now, even JK Rowling herself stated that Snape's feelings for Lily were not an obsession - he really loved her. Someone on tumblr just posted that with the link the other day - if I can find it, I'll link it to you.

I've addressed the contradictory, duality of Snape's nature in my very first post. All these things you've posted about him while true, are all part of that contrary personality.

/Not everyone can get over things which have deeply wounded them. Time doesn't heal all wounds./

/People can be in the same situation, but because people are individuals, that same situation will have many different outcomes. Snape's destiny was of his own molding, his own making./

It all comes down to the choices Snape made (continued to make) and how conflicting his personality was. Everything you and I have said are all part of that.

********* Dismiss his failings?

Did I not mention from my *very first post* his negative sides?

Did I not say Snape was a bully, a traitor, petty, selfish, cruel and full of loathing? Did I not mention he was an asshole? That he was cruel, mean and vicious? A tormentor? Did I not mention in my very first post that he is an excellent example of a character who is on the side of good, but not necessarily a good person?

Or are you pretending I didn't say any of that?

I don't understand why you're only bringing up his negative sides and not his positive ones. You're only seeing his scumbag side - which absolutely exists...but that isn't his only side.

If I was here only speaking of his positive sides, I would be just as wrong as you are as you are speaking of only his negative sides.

#+begin_quote
  Which is excellently contrasted by Sirius who was forced to do so by are mentors.
#+end_quote

Uh, Snape isn't Sirius. He's Snape. He's not going to deal with things the way Sirius does becuase /he is not Sirius/. Again, to copy from my first post: /People can be in the same situation, but because people are individuals, that same situation will have many different outcomes. Snape's destiny was of his own molding, his own making./

Moving on...

I've said this time and time and time again: Snape had many sides, many faces. He wasn't just one thing, he wasn't one angle, nor one side - every bad thing about Snape was counteracted by a good thing. Every good emotion was set against a negative one.

He's not that one-sided "complete scumbag" you wish him to be and you personally perceive him as. He was a man of many faces. A deeply flawed, complex, contradictory individual.

I'll post again from my first post:

#+begin_quote
  He was a bully...and a savior. He was a traitor...he was loyalty defined. He was petty...he was just. He was selfish...he sacrificed. He was cruelty...he was honor. He loathed for years...he loved for a lifetime.
#+end_quote

You have the audacity to tell me that I'm dismissing his failings, when from the start I've listed them out along side his triumphs! Both sides equal, never one without the other!

If anyone here is dismissing anything, it is you with your very one-sided mentality.

Like I stated in my very first post, the negative of Snape's personality (in this case, his treatment of Neville) is juxtaposed with the opposite emotion.

In this case, it would listed under "cruelty vs. honor" or even "bully vs. savior".

He's not one without being the other.

There really isn't anything else to say - his negatives go under one side, his positives go under the other as I keep on reiterating. He's balanced and a constant contradiction. He's always both things, all at once.

And no...considering he lived for years gathering information from different sources, putting on a front being a double agent, and then portraying himself to be a murder to the entire wizarding world (and committing a murder he didn't want a part of)...no. He didn't do "one good thing". He did a lot and without him, the war wouldn't have been won and Harry wouldn't have lived.

Still, if that one-dimensional viewpoint of Snape is what you choose to believe, go ahead.

Not really I think he is a very deep and complex character, I just think you're glorifying him waaayyyy too much. The whole "every bad thing he did he made up for in some way" is total bullshit. Like Neville is the epitome of this. No matter what he did, he never made up for the way he treated Neville. It just baffles me that you have such an issue with the concept of a bad person being on the side of the good guys. You just have to justify his failings in some way.

**** I agree completely! HP is a series written for children/teens. Authors who write in the YA genre shouldn't have to worry about accurately determining their fictitious school's exact student population, cafeteria capacity, organizational structure, teacher qualifications, complete curriculum and class schedule, etc. All that nitty gritty is not what YA (young adult) fiction is usually about. It's about overarching themes, emotional stories that draw the reader in, and the reader fills in whatever cracks there are in the story via their imagination. My comments were just a selective 'un-suspension of disbelief', the disbelief being that Dumbledore is good at what he does. If I turn that disbelief back on then I say "hey, I obviously don't have all the info here, and plus it's a different culture with different standards, I think Dumbledore is doing ok". But if I leave it off and hold Hogwarts to a similar standard we hold regular schools...well, it doesn't look so good.

In Harry's third year the entire school year he is hiding the fact he knew Harry's parents from him until a confrontation with Sirius forces the truth out.\\
Then he disappears again, and basically only shows up once more in book 7 where he suddenly has married Tonks, knocked her up -- and ran away again because of self pity.

I was happy he died. Just a shame he took Tonks with him.

(obviously I also dislike Umbridge, Fudge, and Snape but we're supposed to not like them. Well, Snape until book 7, where JKR tries and fails to redeem him. Making Harry's life a living hell [and trying to get Sirius murdered, when he KNEW he was innocent] was all okay because he was a stalker of Harry's mother.)

*** I don't think any of those are even the worst thing he does. In POA, he fully believes Sirius is a murderer who wants to kill Harry. He is also completely aware that Hogwarts' defenses don't protect against Animagi. The natural thing for a man that cares about Harry (and everybody else at the school) to do at this point is to inform somebody that Sirius Black is an Animagus, so that they can put up protections. Does he do this? No. Why? Apparently because then Dumbledore might be disappointed in him, and that's more important than the safety of a school full of children, including his best friend's orphaned kid. Yikes.

Fandom likes to forgive Remus for this because, of course, Harry was never in any danger from Sirius. But Remus DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

I would like Remus a whole lot more if people would acknowledge how shitty he is a lot of the time. Yeah, he has reasons, it sucks to grow up a werewolf, he has to be used to keeping secrets, he's terrified of rejection, blah blah blah. But those would be poor fucking excuses if Sirius had in fact been a mass murderer as Remus had every reason to believe.

*** Remus is by far the worst character in my opinion.

A lot of things show how little he cared about Harry:

- no contact before he started teaching

- doesn't mention he was one of his dad's best friends until it's forced out of him

- no contact in GoF, even though Sirius (an escaped convict mind you) manages

- no contact post Sirius' death

- doesn't tell Harry about his marriage to Tonks until They came to pick him up (with that insane escape plan)

Honestly the best part about it is that obviously Harry knows they aren't close at all because he consistently refers to him as Lupin throughout the books. It is really really telling.

It's not as telling as you may think. Hagrid's first name is Rubeus, and he's called Hagrid throughout the book. Same with Dumbledore, though I suspect that was due to Harry not really knowing Dumbledore until his fifth year.

I do admit, though, that Hagrid seems to prefer being called by his last name.

Deep down, he probably knew that he would never do that, but was so warped by hatred from years of bullying, a murder attempt by Black and a large desire for revenge that it made him just repress any notion of Sirius' innocence.

Let's not forget that Snape and Pettigrew were both Death Eaters. It's likely he would've had suspicions or even known about who the traitor really was, but seeing as he was 'dead' then he had no desire to state that Black was innocent due to a desire to get rid of yet another former bully from his childhood.

At least, that's my interpretation of the situation.

In one light, it is just Lily scolding her son, but it could also be the author using Lily as a mouthpiece. The whole story from there on out is how Harry is awesome now that he doesn't do all that dumb stuff. So to me it seems like a wish fulfillment fic for an author who thinks Harry was not the brightest bulb. It's not really a bash-fic, like the stories where Ron or Dumbles get humiliated time and time again.

After the second book, there doesn't seem to be much point to her character besides being an eventual love interest for Harry. She also is underdeveloped; we don't see much of her or get to know much about her character. As such, Harry's infatuation with her seems to not have much content. This makes their relationship appear uninteresting and somewhat forced.

There's a lot that could've been done to better develop her and make her a more compelling character. But that never happens so we're left with a disappointment. The narrative seems to expect that we'll like her, but I just find her to be an underwhelming character.

And then she appears in the story more often and you get a good image of her character, but gets thrown out of the story again in DH because it needed to be just Harry, Ron and Hermione in the end.

He's portrayed as lazy, unmotivated, insensitive, jealous, and at times even cruel. Even without betraying Harry a couple times, there's a lot to not like about his character.

I think part of the problem is that we don't see much from outside Harry's viewpoint. If we could've had scenes from Ron's perspective it would've helped to humanize him and put his many flaws in perspective. But we don't get that, and Ron ends up coming off as a prat.

  Second Year: He faces a giant version of something we later learn is his worst fear, this is the equivalent of Harry facing a hundred giant dementors then goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt.

  Third Year: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonnegal. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless). End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer "if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too".

  Fourth Year: Imagine you're Ron. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just maybe you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.

  Fifth Year: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch and then goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream.

  Sixth Year: He dates a girl because he thinks Hermione doens't like him. I don't get the big deal here? End of the year faces Death Eaters, again.

  Seventh Year: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick. If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. He eventually comes back, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him ("He beat you") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because it was the right thing to do.

Facing down a mass murderer to save his best friend. In the film, Hermione is the one who does that whilst Ron just lies in the background, absolutely silent except for the odd whimper.

She's always sure she's right simply because of her "logic", so she spouts false information without hesitation - like the wand issue, and who knows how many other things. When Luna talks about mythical creatures that Hermione doesn't think exist, like Heliopaths, she completely dismisses her as crazy, even though just several years before she learned that mythical creatures like dragons, basilisks and goblins exist, and Luna just proved that there are creatures that only certain people can see (Thestrals).

She excels academically, not because she likes magic, but because she wants to be the /best/, can't accept herself as less-talented than others in her class, and bawwws simply because she didn't get the highest score. She's a complete bore of a person who Harry hardly ever enjoys being around, and a complete hypocrite when it comes to the rules, which /she/ doesn't care to break even at the suffering of others, but enforces when it comes to others.

Whenever she realizes she did something wrong, she can't just accept it and apologize, she just begins crying and moping and hugging Harry so he is /forced/ to forgive her just because it's so pathetic. I strongly hold the opinion that, had it not been for Harry and Ron, she would have become Umbridge 2.0.

**** You know, I didn't just say it because I don't like her. Rowling drew a clear parallel between Hermione and Umbridge. Their middle names are very similar for a reason. Both adore cats. They both serve as loyal, rule-abiding-yet-breaking right-hand women to Harry and Fudge, and, about hurting others, they both carved words into the flesh of others as punishment - Hermione maimed Edgecombe's (Harry's enemy) face with the word "sneak" in OotP, the same book where Umbridge carves the words "I shall not tell lies" on Harry's (Fudge's enemy) hand. Both used cursed quill and parchment to do so. That's also not the first time Hermione hurts others - she certainly does so in the end of OotP where she leads Umbridge into a Centaur gang-rape.

So, she wouldn't have become a perfect replica of Umbridge, but I believe that the resemblance is there for a reason, and that without Harry and Ron's influence and friendship, she could have easily become that bitter, high-authority Ministry figure.

Umbridge was also a blood fanatic who lived a life of lying about her blood status in exchange for social status, and shunned what was left of her family for personal gain.

There are similarities between the two characters, but I really think the path taken by Hermione drastically separates the two of them. I don't think Harry and Ron specifically are necessary for that path, either. A war was brewing and because of her blood status, she was firmly on one side of it. She'd have either been killed, left the wizarding world, or fought on the side of the "light."

You could draw similarities between anything if you try hard enough. I might agree that there are a couple insightful similarities between Umbridge and Hermione, but the far more numerous differences show them to be very different people with very different morals.

If you're argument is to say that, without the company of nice friends and family, Hermione would have been bitter and violent, then perhaps you could make the same argument for almost any person, real or fiction.

Seventh Year: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick. If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. He eventually comes back, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him ("He beat you") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because it was the right thing to do.

******* Yes, I read that when it was posted elsewhere in the thread. It's irrelevant. Harry is the fighter and the destined hero. Hermione has competence where Harry lacks it. Ron's a sidekick, and a pretty good one, albeit with a few lapses. He's a slightly less skilled version of Harry.

The fandom tends not to know what to do with Ron. He's not a loyal minion, willing to walk into a meat grinder at Harry's say-so. He's not good at anything that Harry's bad at besides chess. He isn't a leader, a trusted lieutenant who has shown an ability to command others in Harry's name. He doesn't provide underhanded services to reinforce Harry's will. He isn't anyone's mentor or an authority figure to provide additional power that way. With Harry around, he feels kind of redundant. He's another warm body in case you can't get the Boy Who Lived.

That doesn't mean his characterization is poor. It doesn't mean that it's hard to construct a narrative from his point of view that is both canon compatible and empathetic. It just means writers have a hard time giving him his own role.

No, that only accounts for about 2/7 of them, if that. I would estimate at least 4/7 of them to be where Hermione is Harry's perennial damsel in distress and/or instantly loyal sidekick with no goals and ambitions of her own and no thoughts but about Harry and/or nominally "a genius" whose only function in the story is to facilitate Harry doing great things and/or (in fics where Harry gets a talent/competence upgrade) a foil to show off how much smarter, more creative, and better informed Harry is.

This is especially true if we weigh by popularity.

The remaining 1/7 manage to avoid both. They are to be treasured.

*** Geez, Horace Slughorn wasn't evil, he was just an over the top networker. And he proves himself to be a far more competent Potions instructor that Snape ever was. In canon, he never showed himself to be a pureblood supremacist. In fact, in HBP he talks very positively of Lily Evans, who was a muggleborn. It's also never said that he refuses to help out students; he just prefers talking to important ones.

  “Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true ...”

  Harry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either.

  “... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements ---”

he explains ideas in a convoluted way, doesn't cultivate an environment where students can ask him to clarify, and can't hold a class's attention. i think it was implied that only harry and hermione were doing well

he just tells them to use the text, then appraises them based on their performance. we never see him correcting potions that go wrong or providing instruction. the goal is 'impress slughorn', not 'learn'. if you can't bother to even remember your students' names, and if this is what people remember you for decades later, you're not a good teacher and you're not cultivating a good environment

  His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.

** I always get hate for this but it's Granger for me and I'll give some of my reasons:

- She's an annoying nagging person with almost no social skills.

- She is a teacher's pet kind of person and, despite being one of the top in my classes at school, that kind of person has always rubbed me the wrong way.

- She's a Mary Sue in that she's hyper intelligent, solves most of their problems, is actually fairly hot, has dated arguably the most famous international quidditch star, understand anything that might need explaining for Harry etc.

- She tries to free the house elves.

- Despite being dead keen on rules she loves to break them. Polyjuice, Blackmailing Skeeter etc.

- She likes authority figures more than any teenager I've ever heard of.

Generally, I like my fics to be Slytherin!Harry with no Granger or Granger Bashing or if I'm lucky, Granger getting killed by the troll (or removed from the school) at the start.

I know I'll get tons of hate for this but that's just how I feel.

Edit: 4 years later and Slytherin!Harry no longer appeals.

*** I fail to see how Hermione's a Mary Sue. She's considered ugly until Book 4 (and other than during the Yule Ball is never portrayed as particularly attractive, you're thinking of the movies), no one believes her when she's right, she's wrong a lot of the time and owns up to it. Finally, Hermione knows a lot of stuff Harry doesn't because she ACTUALLY FUCKING READS. She writes his essays for him because he's too lazy to do it himself. Harry is also not exactly the brightest wizard, so yes, he needs a lot of shit explained to him.

I know she reads, all we ever hear about is what she's read.

I don't want to argue because it is a matter of personal opinion in the end and a lot of Granger's character traits: Authority loving, Bookwormish, Teacher's Pet, Bossy, Know-It-All, Holier-than-thou attitude, are ones that I completely detest, end of.
