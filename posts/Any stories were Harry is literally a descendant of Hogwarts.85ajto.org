Were one of harry Great grandparents on his Fathers side, Found the room of Requirement with a Human form of Hogwarts inside and Had a Child with Hogwarts(maybe using the RoR while thinks of their want of a Child). Leading to Harry having the power of [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Architecture_Manipulation][Architecture Manipulation]] .When harry first upgrades the building he lives he does it subconsciously, Starting with Number 4 Privet drive because of his connection to the Property threw the blood wards and then as he gets older gets he gains control of the abilty and learns to do it consciously with him getting better at it over time. like at first he can only learn to speed up how fast he speed up the upgrade of builds and then as he uses it more he can pick what gets upgraded first, ect

some other powers he might get when it come to Architecture are [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Intuitive_Aptitude][Intuitive Aptitude]] and [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Craft_Improvisation][Craft Improvisation]]

maybe James taped into the Architecture powers to help make the Marauders map

I don't think I have ever seen any stories were Harry is part Magic Castle but I thought I would ask. anyway just in case I missed it

Also what other powers do you think it would give harry ?

Like if he became an animagus would be get powers like the [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Fortress_Physiology][Shiro Shiro no Mi]] form [[http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Shiro_Shiro_no_Mi][one Piece]]?

Could he awaken the spirits of magical Buildings (*what would the nymphs of a magical buildings be called?*) and make them like Naiads which are nymphs, that preside over fountains, wells, springs, streams, brooks and other bodies of fresh water. and dryad which are the nymph who inhabit the forests, groves, woods, and all other types of trees?


** Maybe talk to Hogwarts while he is within the castle

*** He could probably talk to Hogwarts easiest, but he could probably also talk to other magical structures like The Burrow.

**** The burrow is not sentient, it is just a house held together by stuff like permanent sticking charms.

***** What I mean is that Harry would be able to help magical architecture gain sentience/sapience

Or it could work similar to Parseltongue works in some fanfictions were Snakes gain sentience/sapience around a Parseltongue (and when snakes aren't around a Parseltongue they are just as intelligent as other non-magical animal although after meeting a Parseltongue some of the upgrades a snakes gets are permanent, with the longer a snakes is around a Parseltongue the more of there upgrades like increase intelligence become,permanent).

so any building Harry tries to talk to gains sentience/sapience and they longer Harry is around the building the more of the sentience/sapience the architecture would keep when Harry leaves. So Harry could talk to even non-magical building the way a Parseltongue can talk to any snake).

**** Could he talk over the floo with the buildings? I mean, that would have prevented the end of year five fiasko among other things.
