I fell in a rabbit hole recently and started reading a Charlie/Harry pairing... and surprised myself by how much i liked it. I think I've pretty much read all the good ones on AO3, so i'm hoping someone has a secret stash of other ones hidden on another corner of the Internet.


** linkao3(7708432) Dragon Singer. Not the best, but it's alright. Something about it keeps drawing me back to reread it. There is a bit of a weird age gap, though, because Charlie first gets to know Harry when he's a kid and a small attraction forms then (even though Harry's just a kid). I'm personally fine with that (as a shipper of Tomarry and Voldemort/Harry, I've seen weirder shit), but that might not be to your liking, so just a bit of warning first.

  When Charlie Weasley begins working at the Romanian reserve, he has no idea what a Dragon Singer is or how important the one that lives there will soon be to him.

  Harry had no intentions of becoming an Auror, but had no idea what his future held. A dinner at the Weasleys and a conversation with Charlie Weasley had Harry exploring the reserve and realising that he could see himself working there and being happy - with his best friend's older brother. Harry/Charlie, Hermione/Bill, Remus/Sirius.

*** Thank you, I really enjoyed both! The end of Dragon Singer was quite ambiguous though :)

** I'd actually be interested in this too, I think I'd like this pairing. Any chance you have any recs from the rabbit hole you were just down?

  From the moment Charlie left Hogwarts, he'd heard about Harry Potter. The longer time goes on, the more their lives become intertwined and the more Charlie can't keep himself away (8 year age gap be damned).This is an AU, but uses as many elements from canon as possible. It follows the order of the books but is mostly from Charlie's perspective. Up until later chapters of the story, this all could feasibly exist within the canon universe.Don't be turned off by the 'Underage' tag, I just wanted to cover my bases. Also note the story is only rated at Teen. That being said, if that's a trigger for you then protect yourself and pass this one by. I hold no grudges :)
