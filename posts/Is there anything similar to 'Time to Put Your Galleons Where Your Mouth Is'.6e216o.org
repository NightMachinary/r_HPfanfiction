Exactly what it says up there, though I'd prefer without slash.


** What did you like about the story?

- The brotherly love?
- The powerful Harry?
- MoD!Harry who is constantly reborn?
- The plot?

Give us a bit more to help you find the right story for you :)

*** To answer your question, then it's the entire concept of the story. So, yes, it's the powerful and Master of Death Harry...thing. I certainly liked the plot, though currently, I believe that I'm asking for stories that share the same idea, theory, etc.

**** linkffn(A long journey home) has an immortal Harry and partially similar themes, but goes in a different direction. Very slow updates.

linkffn(Fire Born by wickedlfairy17) is my favorite MoD!Harry fanfic, but also goes in a very different direction. Abandoned.

linkffn(On a pale horse) explores the concept in a fun way.

Generally this thread might help you: [[https://www.google.de/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2l1ahs/fics_with_an_immortal_and_possibly_ancient_harry]]

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter
