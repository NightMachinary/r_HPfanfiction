A nineteen year old Tonks preying on a 13 year old Harry in this story.

Why the FUCK Harry Potter fanfic authors? Why do you like making her a fucking disgusting pedophile? Seriously?! Why is it ALWAYS TONKS?!


** Might be a touch of the ol' wish fulfillment at play. From my personal experience fics shipping those two usually has a powerful and mature Harry, usually around fifth year. Plus a lot of fanfics follow the canon with minor tweeks, and Tonks has like 6 years on Harry so...

What I have yet to see is a deaged Tonks/Harry fic. I mean just shuffle her birth around so she's born shortly after or before Harry. It's not that hard, and it's not like the plot breaks in half if you do.

** There has always been a double standard when it comes to romances in age-difference body swapping and such.

For some reason, if you say, swap the body of a 30 year old and a 15 year old, depicting the older-in-younger-body dealing with sex and sexuality (and possibly continuing relationships with older people, or starting relationships with others in their body's age range) produces a visceral reaction.

While the 15 year old in a 30 year old body dealing with their body's sexuality is not viewed anywhere near as poorly, and sometimes even as comedic.

You get this a lot in HP fanfic, particularly around time travel (person going back to their younger body) or with Metamorphs. Tonks gets in with a lot of these subsequent fics.

I don't think that is what Barefoot did, but to your question on why it comes up a lot, that is part of it.

(I understand where this comes from in the visual medium: Backstory is easy to ignore, and if you just look at the visuals of '30 year old in 15 year old body having sex with 30 year old partner' or '15 year old in 30 year old body having sex with 15 year old partner' is going to be a visual depiction of basically child abuse, while a visual depiction of '15 year old in 30 year old body having sex with a 30 year old partner' or '30 year old in 15 year old body having sex with a 15 year old partner' is going to visual depiction of something not at all out of the ordinary. I do not understand why this standard extends to written word, although I would say it is a lot weaker there than it is in the visual mediums).

Fantasy (magic) and Sci-Fi tend to remove stories enough from real-world situations that it can be used to avoid... uncomfortable issues. For example, you are going to get strangeness if you write in elves that live for a thousand years and don't leave adolescence till they are over 100. But the 'this isn't really related to our reality, so you can't hold our moral standards to it' can generally be used when you break from the situation that much.

This usually ends up in HPFanfiction as "Going back in time kinda merged you with your younger self, so it isn't too creepy to be participating in teenage romances". I would say in most cases, the author would prefer to just not deal with the issue.

** Wait so they actually had sex in that story? I vaguely remember reading up to the point where Tonks started sleeping naked with him (yeah, just sleeping) for some dumb reason when he was like 12 or something. Oh and Hedwig becomes a human.

** My admittedly baseless and uncharitable opinion is: People hate Tonks because she proves Lupin is straight thus sinking people's wolfstar ships. Ofc she also proves he's a family abandoning coward later on but nobody seems to mind that.

I mean, in canon Tonks only starts dating Remus /after/ Sirius dies, so I don't think it really sinks anything. I've seen a bunch of fics (though you're right they're in the minority) that have Tonks help Remus move on from Sirius's death and his depression over Sirius being one of the issues she was crying about in HBP. Or Teddy Lupin finding out Sirius & his dad had a thing before Sirius died and his father got married.

**** Isn't it implied that she was trying to get his attention before Sirius died but Remus ignored it? I havent read the books in a while so it might be a fuzzy detail

***** Nah. Tonks is a /really/ minor character in OotP. There's a reason Harry doesn't realise why she's upset until HBP and that's because he never spends any time with her.

*** I personally consider that not as bad, as it could be said to be a semi-realistic showing of hormonal teenagers doing things that they aren't ready for, as long as the authors don't go into detail.

That being said, i agree that the older/younger pairings are messed up before 6th/7th year (16 being the age of consent in Britain)

** I wonder if you wouldn't find as many stories with Harry and another female character. When it's older younger paring, there can be issues. Someone chose a bad age range. And the answer to why it's Tonks is easy. Tonks is older and she has cool powers. It's generally the main reason people are interested in her, maybe even the only one sometimes. But I doubt you wouldn't find a similar story with Harry Fleur. It can be hard to remember that in fanfiction there are no rules and authors can write about anything they like.
