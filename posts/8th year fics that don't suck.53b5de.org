***** They are called 8th year fics because they are about the 8th year of the Harry Potter series.

****** I don't know why the guy is being down voted but he has a point. If you fail 6th grade, and decide to redo, it won't be your 7th grade that you redo but your 6th.

Similarly because they didn't finish Year seven in the book, if they do decide to go back they will be going back for year seven of their education and not year 8 because that doesn't exist.

Year one is first grade and so on in England, Wales, NZ and Australia.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_One_(education)]]

The only way that makes sense is if we are not talking in regards to education. So it would be the 'year' 8 considering in each book a year passes.

Meh, I don't care but kinda shocked by the down votes the guy received.

******* He's being intentionally obtuse, that's why I downvoted him at least.

No one, especially not me has in any way insinuated what you argued against. It's called a strawman argument.

******** I am not used to the trolls here because that's what he is if he is being intentionally obtuse. Fairly new to this.

*** They are called 8th year, rather than 7th year for tagging purposes. It's so you know it's a DH (probably EWE) compliant fic set at hogwarts. Also, in these fic usually lots of kids who were 7th years the year before come back again and are "8th years" because their 7th year was too turbulent to have learned much.

7th year fics, on the other hand, tend to be AUs where Harry and friends go to hogwarts for 7th year, or canon compliant fics of what the DA was doing at hogwarts during 7th year. It's just a nice, simple way of tagging so you can filter for the fic you want.
