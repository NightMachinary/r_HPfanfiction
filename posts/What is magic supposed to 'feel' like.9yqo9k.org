I always see "Harry could feel his magic" or "the feeling of the magic flowing through him" or some nonsense.

What's it supposed to feel like? I've just been imagining the feeling of drinking a glass of sparkling water, but all over.

It's a stupid question, but I've had it in my mind since I was 11 so I figured I would ask what you thought.


** I always imagined warmth spreading throughout the body.

** A warm flush like from an injection of IV contrast during a CT scan.

*** Warm flush? To me all IVs I have received as of yet were cold. I was shivering afterwards.

** I've used the idea once and said it felt different for everyone---one person says it's like sand underfoot, another like bathing in vibrating pebbles, another like cold steam on their skin, and another like a ribbon slithering through their veins.

In general, for myself, I'd imagine it's like a buzz under my skin that I get sometimes, almost like pins and needles except far less unpleasant.

** In my headcanon, every magic user "senses" magic differently. I remember one fic that went into it a fair bit, but can't remember the name.

*** In the Sacrifices Arc most powerful wizards can sense magic by different things (smell, headaches, teeth buzz, etc.) so it might be that one.

** For me it's like this: D'you know the feeling when you drink cold milk and you can fill it in your chest and your stomach. Or a cold glass of water. I think of that, but instead of it being this cold feeling, it's an electrically warm one. Like a bit of a nice static shock, rather than a jolt.

I also like to think that different spells have different feelings. For example, a Patronus gives you a warm fuzzy feeling that is similar to the memory or feeling you are using to produce it. The Expelliarmus is a jolt from your shoulder to your wand. Accio is a pulling in your gut kinda like apparition but less intense. A dark curse like the Cruciatus is pins and needles all throughout, unless you get some perverse joy out of it.

** I imagine it to be quite different for different people, just as their magic and character is different. To someone like Bellatrix I would think it feels like a rush on drugs when it streams out to commit violence. To Harry I imagine it feels like warm sunlight from within. To Hermione it is maybe a more conscious feeling, like the one you get when your efforts in a project come together to build the end product.

** Would you ask a blind man how it feels to be blind? A seeing man how it feels to see? Would you ask someone born with legs ask how it feels to walk? And what answers would you expect?

Magic has been part of a magical person's life since their birth. How do expect them to describe something that was always part of them. -

Now if you were to ask how it feels to use magic or being subjected to magic that is not their own - this a question you could expect a proper answer for.
