Are there fics where Harry goes back in time and meets young Tom Riddle where he joins Tom's group that aren't just romance stories between Harry and Tom?

I like the concept of Harry going back to meet a young Tom Riddle, but nearly all seem to focus on Harry and Tom falling in love and either Tom is redeemed or they have some weird, kinda creepy romance.

I'm not saying I'm entirely opposed to Tomarry in these fics (though it would be refreshing to see one that's gen or where Harry gets with somebody else) just that it would be interesting to read one where the focus is not on them falling in love, but instead on Harry becoming one of Tom's early followers.


** Yeah, a fanfic that has Harry actually join Tom early, desiring to betray him at his weakest moment would be great.

*** I don't even think he'd have to betray him because, a Harry who travelled back in time when he was say,10 might genuinely agree with Tom.

But yes, a story where he served him intending to betray him on Halloween 1981 would be interesting, you should try writing it.

**** BTW was your prompt inspired by this fanfic?

It's abandoned with a pending rewrite but it was pretty good and not slash.
