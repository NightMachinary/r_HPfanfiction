I'm looking for stories with a MoD Harry or femharry where he's been the MoD for a while. Mostly looking for stories that have him/her helping the avengers or being summoned or just showing up. I've just finished reading these and looking for stories similar to these but also down for new fics to read....got a 10h flight ahead of me and needing good long fics lol. Oh! Seer Harry too! I enjoy a powerful immorta Harry/god harry that other higher beings like asgardians ect fear and respect his wrath ect.Any rating gender pairing what have you is welcomed so long as it's got a lot of chapters or very long written chapters. Sorry for the long post thanks all!

Also any reborn Harry fics like this one I found. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10672002/2/]]

Or any fics of MoD Harry in bleach universe! Omg I keep thinking of ideas I wanna find stores of >.<.

*** I just finished reading this story - thank you for the recommendation! It has exactly the type of Harry I love, and it managed to pull off the whole "merging the universes" well, without making anyone incredibly stupid in the process.

So few crossovers get that right, which I was mostly reading dimension travel crossovers...

****** Be warned that the Harry from Heroes Assemble is pretty down to earth, maybe a bit too much even. The first chapters are also pretty slow, and while Harry IS powerful, he appears more s because of how magic is overpowered when battling or assisting non-magicals. Still a great story tho, and appears to be reaching the end soon.

** linkffn(9970825) and the rest of the Nargle Influence series feature a fem!harry MOD. its not all in one story and there are a couple one shots but the whole series comes out to ~33k words. This might not be the right story because she isn't actually going out and fighting anyone except for one story, but she is definitely powerful. It is more about the Avenger's and how she helps them without having her join the avengers or be a ass kicking badass all the time.

They're really touching stories, but it might not be the style you're looking for.

  The fates could have worked with Harry Potter, son of James Potter but when the chance came to steer Loki into Lilly's path so they might conceive a child together? That was an opportunity to tempting to let pass.Harriet spends the first 11 years of her life with no idea of the magical world or her mother's status as a witch but the truth of her father and the heritage he gave her will remain secret for some time more. When her enemy uses her blood in his resurrection this inheritance and the meddling of The Fates will see him forever changed. With her greatest enemy made her greatest supporter things will be forever changed.tl;dr Female!Harry is Loki's daughter and a goddess but doesn't know it. In using her blood to return Voldemort is magically forced through a change that leaves him an ally rather than an enemy. This first installment of the series focuses on Harriet and Voldemort and how things changed from canon after Voldemort's return covering Harriet's 5th year at Hogwart's and the summer before. Part 2 is a time skip to the year 2012 with the arrival of Loki and the events of Avengers.

  Harry Potter is fed up of all the attention that comes with being the saviour of the Wizarding world. Natasha Romanoff is the best field agent SHIELD have. How does an assassin deal with a Man who won't stay dead. Basically a fluff piece, could be expanded on at a later date.
