[Discussion] I want to start off by saying i do not hate Snape, but i do not like him either.I feel that a lot of people see Severus Snape and think Alan Rickman immediately. Would Snape have got the same redemption if he were to look like Timothy Spall when he played peter Pettigrew and made his love for lily seem more creepy that it might have had been? Sometimes "Snapets" ;) cite that he was spying for Dumbledore so in the end its all okay. Lets just take the same scenario and say that some kid joined a terrorist group and has been killing people and bombing a number of places with his " group mates" for a few years and decided that since there is a possibility of a future attack on his childhood crush/love as she worked against his group he switched sides and fed information to the FBI ( Or any anti terror agency) and still continued playing the double agent but was only loyal to his "love". When put like that it seems a bit sketchy dose it not?

Even when harry started his schooling, his irrational hate for a 10 year old kid privately/publicly seems a bit harsh, especially when harry came from an abusive home like himself ( Even though the extent of abuse done to harry is debated). Harry had a crappy childhood. His school years for no picnic either. In no way shape or form did he in any way try to make harry's miserable life any better. My point is he CHOSE to join a group that killed thousands of innocent people and then flipped and ferried information to both sides. I am sure there are many attacks he knew about but he could not warn others as it would have turned suspicion towards him. I know that he was in an impossible situation, but does that excuse the loss of innocent life? how many kids were murdered just because they were muggleborn? My point is, even though he was instrumental in the defeat of voldy and his role as a spy got the light a lot of intel but would you be so quick to redeem him if among the people that were murdered due to his and Dumbledore's inaction were some of your loved ones? .

Thank you for reading. I do apologize if this turned into a rant, but i really wanted to know how some people called him "the real hero" and stuff like that. Is it so easy to forgive and forget?

P.S. I do apologize for any spelling and grammatical mistakes, even after i edited a few. smh


** Hm, that might actually be part of the reason Snape is treated so well in a lot of fanfiction.

And the answer I come to is a big fat yes obviously from the above, it's not so much who the actor is himself, but rather in the tone and expressions he puts into it, he plays a good good/bad guy for damned sure.

Of course, I like many others don't think that Snape deserves his good guy image, you can't be an asshole for years then say "Heh, I was a good guy the whole time", he was a bully to children as an educator, that's some bullshit, there's no excuse- he could have told his Deatheater pals Dumbles forces him to play nice after all, they would have bought that.

Though I don't mind fanfiction that changes him into the good guy he should have been after repenting- making him strict because potions are dangerous makes sense, but don't pretend he was roses and sunshine in canon. (Book Purism)

Edit: removed needless stuff. I ramble.

*** I completely agree. Snape as a charecter has a lot of depth and is clearly has a very witty and sarcastic humor. Those are all fun qualities to have and would make one a fun person to hang out with, except there is this whole other thing of him being a bad educator,mentor and being part of a terrorist organization though under hidden protest.

** JK Rowling does a brilliant job of conveying to her readers that the world, and people aren't black and white. often their intentions are quite grey.

Sure Snape wasn't a nice person. But was he straight up evil? Also how much easier would it have been for him to just be a plain ole death eater, instead of a spy for the order?!

*** Well yes, but we don't say he's evil. He still killed of his own choice. Joined a terror organization of his own choice. Even joining the group that hated muggleborns, and he goes and joins them, his crush his muggleborn. He's a dick

**** See, JK Rowling makes a point of showing that Harry is not always right. That he has flaws.

Hence black and white and shades of grey.

***** I'd argue that H.P is certainly a flawed human but as a hero we see the he can do no wrong and honestly how could he when his only enemy is a racist terrorist with no real (given reasons) for his actions

** Alan Rickman was a great actor with an amazing voice. He was also far more relaxed and scathing than book Snape. Book Snape was more irritable and angry.

Something to think about is that a lot of Snape's evil is off screen/page. He was a Death Eater. We never learn quite how much that meant but if he's anything like the rest of them then I can safely say he's a very very bad man. We know that he was a spy for both sides, we never learn what he told Voldemort to convince him to trust Snape. We don't know the price payed to get Snape back in Voldemort's favour. We also see him bully Neville and honestly people need to remember that, he bullied Neville far more than he did Harry so all those people who excuse him because they hate James Potter need to ask what did Neville do to deserve that and how many other Nevilles have there been over the last decade he's been teaching?

Snape didn't fight against Voldemort because it was the right thing to do. In the beginning it was because he wanted Lily to live. He even requested her life from Voldemort as a spoil of war. He didn't love her, he didn't care about her or her happiness, he just wanted her. Voldemort killed her when she wouldn't step aside and then Snape works against him for vengeance. Think of Snape similar to Stalin. Stalin fought against Hitler similar to Snape against Voldemort. That doesn't excuse the things that happened before or after, fighting against evil doesn't make you not evil it just means that you disliked or disagreed with that particular brand of evil.

** I feel conflicted towards him. He's one of my favorite characters, yet it's very difficult to defend.

He had a very hard life his parents as far as we know probably weren't very nice to him, he was poor, lost his only friend because he said something racist in a terrible moment, he was bullied by four assholes because he existed and one of them had a crush on lily... Snape was the classical example of that vulnerable person who tends to join terrorist organizations and gangs. And he did it. Besides Dumbledore he probably killed and tortured many people.

His redemption quest begum after he realized that the girl he never got over was in danger, because HE told Voldemort the prophesy. And for that he defected to the light. It wasn't a selfless reason, but for the rest of his life he dedicated himself to help bring down the death eaters and Riddle, As a spy.

Another thing that we must remember is that he wasn't a nice teacher he had favorites, probably wasn't very didactic and, he hated potter with a passion of 1000 burning suns, a mutual hate. And since the books are in his POV, perhaps are a little biased in that regard.

Even after he was appointed headmaster he kept helping the light (punishments that aren't harsh, giving the sword to potter and the patronus spell). And giving Harry his memories before he died.

He was a mean man, he never got over an obsessive crush he had, he was a lousy teacher, his reasons perhaps aren't selfless... Yet the helped the light to win the war and had a very tragic and pathetic life.

That'd be his legacy: a nasty man with who at the end tried to do the right thing behind the scenes and at the end paid with his life. That's what makes him interesting...

A pathetic cunt who fighted with the light, and for his efforts, deserves at least be acknowledged as that.

At least for me he could looked like peter and I'd like him/pity him the same

I'm sorry if I had any grammar errors or the sentences are weird. English isn't my first language.

** I like Snape as a character because he is so contradictory. He was killed by his own bitterness, more than anything. He screwed up early on and kept going because he eventually had no reasons left not to. I sometimes wonder if he was trying to get fired by Dumbledore; he clearly hated his job, just having it was also a debt he would have to repay, and they both knew it would probably be done with his death.
