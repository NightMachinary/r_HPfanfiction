So I've always been enthralled with the idea of Wizards in America after reading Harry Potter, and think I'd finally like to write my own In-Universe story, or at least try. Here's my very first summary, something that would I guess be on the outside of a bound set? The way I've always written has been a full arc summary and then zoom in and zoom in one story at a time. I have no names or anything yet, just a general sense of locations. This obviously works in the general feel of Little House on the Prairie, but it is not any sort of crossover.

"Little Wizard on the Prairie

Our hero is born in Chicago in 1872 to a family moving west. Dad is a Midwestern Farmer, temporarily having sought work in construction after the Great Chicago Fire, Mom is a French Immigrant. Both parents are magical, but come from very different traditions and ideologies.

Father is of the north woods, a frontiersman who think himself and other wizards to be above muggles, both of European descent but even more above the Native Americans. Of Irish descent, but coming to the New World many generations before. He grew up in a loose knit Wizarding community in Wisconsin but received no formal education.

Mother is a recent immigrant from the South of France, having been schooled at Beauxbatons. She is of a considerably more progressive mind and came to the New World hoping to learn about and from the Natives as well as Wizards from other nations also settling here. She met Father on a steamship ride from Wisconsin when he was first coming to Chicago.

When Hero becomes of an age he can cause trouble in the city, Mother and Father decide it is time to leave the growing city for the health of the child, and leave for Washington Island, Father's hometown, to see his family one last time before heading west.

There travels will eventually have them in the Driftless Area, the Great Plains, the Badlands, and Cascadia, witnessing the birth of the new nation of Wizards along side the Muggles as they establish new laws, new governments, new ways of life, staying only in each place long enough to make a few friends, a few enemies, and feel too crowded before moving on. "


** I've also often wondered about Wizards in America. I'll never write it so here are my ideas on US Wizard School story.

- A yellow VW Beetle driven by a Squib or Wizard picks the kids up for school
- The wizarding school is disguised as a large Pennsylvania or similar east-coast farm complex.
- A sport more like baseball, but with magical elements.

You seem to be going more for the origins of America though. Good luck.

** The good: An interesting concept detailing different cultures clashing in multiple different ways. Could provide a very interesting look into societal advancements.

The odd: I have a hard time picturing a northern Wisconsin-Irish woodsman with a superiority complex. I'm all for subverting troupes but it will be very hard to write a believable character that has lived in that environment for his entire life, is a working class likely no-nonsense type that truly believes himself superior. He's likely been around and understands those cultures and hasn't sat back in a manor wondering why everyone isn't as good as him. It'll probably be excellent if you can make that character with those motivations come off as a real, but that's going to be very, very difficult to write.

The whole notion of 'leaving the cities' is kinda anti the time period you put it in. In fact, you're talking probably around 1880-1885 assuming the protagonist is old enough. I think it would be better served set pre civil-war for what your last paragraph puts it in.

Of course, I also thing there could be a fascinating story about the clash between the wizarding world and the Industrial Revolution. But that's not establishing new laws or governments, because by the 1890s that's pretty much set up. Especially in the Midwest.
