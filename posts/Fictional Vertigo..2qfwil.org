So, here's the situation: I finally caved and got through the first 10 chapters of "Delenda Est", and now I am well and truly hooked. However, I had this really weird experience.

You see, somewhat to my shame, "Burn Notice" is my favorite TV-show of all time. Sometime during the reading of delenda, I started comparing Bellatrix to Fiona Glenanne, and it's gotten to the point where i essentially swap them out while reading. Conseqently, Harry becomes Michael and it's like Im reading a crossover fic. Its reaaaaally weird.

Anyone else have a similar experience?

*** Hahaha, I had a week where I couldn't picture Draco to save my life. Brain kept returning the image of the vampire from America's 'Being Human' made no sense cause they have nothing in common beyond both being bipedal humanoids.

** I did the same thing when reading a fic that paired Harry with Mandy Brocklehurst back when marriage contracts were slightly less annoying. Watching Skins (the UK version) at the same time made for quite the experience.

It's stuck as well, because I keep picturing Michelle, JJ and other characters when reading fics that feature the OCs-in-all-but-name.
