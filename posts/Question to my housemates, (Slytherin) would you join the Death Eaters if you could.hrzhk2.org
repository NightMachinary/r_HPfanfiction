Honestly, yes, I joined without thinking beside the Dark Lord.


** No, I'm not some lackey who is to be ordered. Certainly not from an inferior being who bears a Muggle name. I'll never forgive the original Knights of Walpurgis for not killing the Mudblood in his sleep.

** Honestly, no. Now listen don't get me wrong, I'm all for being dark and sneaky, but being a racist pig isn't my cup of Earl Grey. I don't picture myself braiding Bellatrix's hair or having long drawn out conversations with Antonin Dolohov about his purple curse, or asking Thorfinn Rowle if he really is a dumb as he looks or if he just never really liked Gibbon.

So no, I never would. Why would I want to have sleepovers with Death Eaters who killed Madeye, Tonks, Lupin, Neville's parents (not dead but in my opinion much worse), Hedwig, countless others. Doesn't mean I think your decision is wrong, just...don't invite me. I'm not coming.

Just because we are Slytherin's doesn't mean we have to support the dark. I'm a Slytherin for my cunning, leadership skills, flawless sarcasm, and ambition but that doesn't mean I'll kill to get where I want to be, or think that I'm better than anyone else because of what color, sex or religion I was born under. Death Eaters do. Not all Slytherin are bad. Not all Gryffindor are good. It just depends on how you look at what's important to you.

** I'm not racist or mentally unhinged, so no I would not voluntarily join.

** Any Slytherin that willingly kneels to another is no true Slytherin imo. I'd probably do my own thing and inevitably end up being called a Dark Lord by the Ministry.
