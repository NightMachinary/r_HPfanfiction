I'm looking for fics with unrepentantly evil Harry, where he isn't some misunderstood tragic backstory with a grudge against the secretly evil light side, but fics where if it wasn't Harry doing the things, there would be absolutely no question that he was the villain. Bonus points if, if his evilness isn't revealed until he starts Hogwarts, his light "friends" don't side with him and aren't made out to be in the wrong for their choice.

I've only ever found one fic remotely like this, and I'm curious if there are more.


** /Business/ by Esama is a one-shot that fits your request. As a child, Harry is inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories, specifically by Moriarty. I won't mention what exactly he does, but he's definitely not a nice person. It's not amazing, as Harry is hypercompetent for his age, but it's a fun 12k words and fairly popular.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** linkffn(Too Young to Die)

Harry does have a tragic backstory in this, and he is trying to follow his own goal, but he uses any means, no matter how vile, to get there. Also a very good fic. Not sure that it /quite/ fits your request, however.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** I strongly suggest /Sum of Their Parts/ (linkffn 11858167) by holdmybeer, because it's a slow-burn "Dark Lord Potter" but keeps his friendship with Ron and Hermione (in fact, it's a strong basis for the darker parts of the story), all due to wanting to keep Teddy safe post-DH as the author implies that the wizarding world hasn't changed (huh! Go figure!).

/C'est Le Vie/ by cwyscross (linkffn 8730465) isn't finished and they are caught by story ideas elsewhere; however, it's definitely a 'Harry against everyone else' style in an alt universe. He does imply some darkness by admitting in later chapters he'd raze Hogsmeade if it meant protecting his friends. Although I suppose it fits more of the 'independent Harry' genres (same with 'Harry Potter and the Boondock Saints'! A pretty good crossover, and complete).

On a 'not Harry' option - /Dark Marauders/ by BajaB (linkffn 4586362) might fit your tastes. One shot, complete. A what if Lily died but James didn't - how far would the Marauders go for revenge?

Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
