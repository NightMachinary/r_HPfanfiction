So...it's been a bit of a week.

I'm looking for some heartwarming fics --- romance, friendships, bromances, anything works. Same deal with length---I'm just looking for some sweet fics to make me smile a bit. (bonus points if it's a Harry & Ron friendship or a Fred/George x Hermione, those are my favorites hahaha)

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

#+begin_quote
  Sirius broke out of Azkaban a month before Harry's eleventh birthday. After finding Harry at the Dursely's he realized that Harry has social anxiety, so he became Harry's service dog. Keeping what he really is is harder than he thought it would be as Sirius accompanies Harry to Hogwarts. Especially when it becomes clear that Harry has a knack for getting into trouble.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

#+begin_quote
  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

*** i've read it before, though i have no knowledge of the cross. most of that author's stories are interesting, though he has an extremely thin skin. i remember "controversy" over a review Joehundredaire left him on TTH back when Joe was still a mod over there. i also remember being attacked by him and someone else when i dismissed his complaints about Joe's review which had some very mild criticisms in it in a review i left after he complained about it in the author's notes.

like i said, a lot of his work is interesting, just don't bother leaving any reviews that are at all critical of his work because you'll either be ignored or he'll claim you're personally attacking him.

**** Yeah, there are some unfortunately... abrasive personalities in writing - appreciate the art, not necessarily the artist, is my general approach. They're still people, so they need to earn anything beyond general decency and manners.

I'm not familiar with TTH - I'm assuming it's a site and not a reference to tension headaches, but I could be wrong. :D
