But, any fics where the purebloods act as Christian fundies, but with Merl√≠n instead of Jesus?

Or the other way? Maybe a bunch of muggleborn families decide that they just /have/ to turn them to God.

Funny hijinxs ensue.


** Linkao3(Super Bowl Breach) is a fic with international stuff all around the world. Wizards accomplish one thing thought impossible; uniting Christian and Islamic fundamentalists in hating satanic wizards together. Major focus on religion, between united fundamentalist terrorist attacks on wizarding homes and an actual biblical character's ghost's horrified reaction to what his faith has become. "What do you mean, three Abrahamic religions???"
