** Sadly, all of these fics are dead, but they're fun reading nonetheless.

Jbern had a short fic of Trelawney helping raise Harry: linkffn(4966520)

And here's two fics that involve Divination but not Trelawney:

An OC came in and taught young Harry of the power of tarot: linkffn(7437961)

Harry got pulled to another dimension to defeat Voldemort for them. Pissed off, he tells them Divination is his best subject, and then works to actually make it true. I wish it wasn't dead, it had some really interesting ideas. linkffn(11160991)

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

  Harry Potter's life as we know it is entrenched with destiny, sewn together like a tightly plotted book. But what if his bond with destiny was far more imminent? What if whatever card said that Harry Potter is rubbish at divination was turned upside down? Discontinued, for all intents and purposes.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Isn't there a slightly cracky fic of this? I think it was abandoned though.

** I'd love to read something like this. Just the premiae is hilarious. En better if Harry turned out to have some talent in it. Can you imagine Snape's reaction to an 11 year old James Potter lookalike that acts like Trelawney? Priceless!
