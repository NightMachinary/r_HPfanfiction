** Linkffn(5278050) just linked this the other day. In my opinion, the best Tom/Minerva fic out there. Sadly, it's abandoned. But I still think it's worth the read. Both characters stay in character, the prose is beyond beautiful, the angst is well done, the historical setting is realistic. I highly recommend it. Hope you enjoy!

  How could she sit there, looking at all the innocent children she had sworn to protect, when she belonged to the guilty ones? How could she accuse others when she should be accused? And how could she have ever been so stupid to fall for one Tom Riddle?

***** Unfortunately, no :( my heart broke a little after finishing it! The author has a couple of one-shots if you haven't checked them out yet, but other than that I haven't been able to find anything that compares

** linkffn(8057908) This. This thing.

It's not a romance, it's a oneshot, and it will leave you wanting more (or it did me), but it was so enjoyable to read, for some reason. I just really really, really liked it. I hope you enjoy!

  NOT a romance! This is a one-shot highlighting a single meeting in the life of Minerva McGonagall, sixth year student.
