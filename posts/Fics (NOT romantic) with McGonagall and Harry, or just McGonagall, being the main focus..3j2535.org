I was reading the fic "Just a Random Tuesday" again and would love to read more that focus on McGonagall.

I have been searching for fics where McGonagall is more of an active mentor to Harry and/or the trio. I haven't been able to find very many after digging around for hours. Does anyone know of any sites, sections, or tags for fanfic sites I could use. Please NO romantic ones, though adoption ones are ok.

Here's a link to that fic.... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday]]

I'd also like to read more fics like this one that focus on the adults. ESPECIALLY with Umbridge thrown in for fun.

Thanks!


** Well, this is an obvious one, but still I will throw it out there:

linkffn(Harry McGonagall by witowsmp)

I cannot guarantee that it is a good story since I read it a while ago, but it does satisfy your mentorship requirement, since Harry is adopted by McG.

** The second half of linkffn(A call to arms) is from McGonagall's POV. She's characterized very well.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
