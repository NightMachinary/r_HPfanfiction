Pretty sure this hasn't been written yet, so perhaps this is of the nature of a prompt, but:

I've worked with and around government at local and national level at various points in my former career as a lawyer, and have a reasonable grasp on how most of it works. And, indeed, how realistic The Thick Of It actually was.

And reading a fanfic riffing on The Perils Of Innocence earlier today, I noticed a couple of the characters discussing whether or not there was a possibility of muggleborn magical children ending up in a lab somewhere being poked and prodded by Government Scientists.

It got me thinking: if you had a kid with supernatural powers, who /would/ you notify within the British Government?

I mean, magic isn't a notifiable disease listed in the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010, still less in the Public Health (Prevention of Disease) Act 1984, so that's the Department for Health out.

It's not an educational problem per se, so nobody's going to need to assess the child for a Statement of Special Educational Needs under the Education Acts, and that's a local government thing, not the DfE's problem even if the bill ends up with them eventually.

The Ministry of Defence aren't interested until he's at least 16 and eligible for the Army Foundation College, it's not like they have anyone qualified to research this stuff. Porton Down's the nearest they've got, but they don't have any paediatricians and they're more about supporting existing defence technologies than researching this sort of thing. Most of what they do is putting research proposals out to tender, their in-house stuff is about countermeasures for the other side's nasties. They'd probably scream for more budget if we gave them this. They'd have to hire at least one paediatric nurse and then it'd be a whole load of new facilities having to be built because it's mostly animal testing and adult volunteer subjects there, and that's /before/ MODREC screams themselves hoarse over taking in a child subject, guardian's consent or not. We already have to have a public statement on the MoD's website that we don't have any aliens under examination there...

BAE Systems and their subsidiaries do most of our weapons development, but unless this kid can fly at Mach 3 and blow up, they're kind of under-equipped as well.

It's not like there's even a university we can contract this out to, there are a few parapsychology departments out there, but they're strictly part-time deals and mostly about debunking anyway. The big medical research foundations and charities won't see a public health or medical advance angle, even if they didn't all have Strong Views on ethical experimentation involving kids. Wakefield had to go to an ambulance-chasing lawyer to get funding for /his/ fiasco.

None of the other departments even get a look in. DEFRA? Sorry, kid's not a farm animal, not our problem Mr. Dursley. Culture, Media and Sport? Come back when your little superhero has a comic-book deal. Home Office? Until he joins the police, not our problem. Welsh Office? Mae Mr Dursley, Surrey yn Lloegr. Ewch i ffwrdd.

You see what I mean? Vernon trying to get a five or six year old Harry immured in a lab somewhere is going to run in to a /lot/ of blank looks and civil servants insisting "We just don't /do/ that, nor have I any idea who /would/, kindly leave my office, sir." Followed by concerned phone calls to Surrey County Council Childrens' Services Department.

tl, dr: "I don't want to end up in a lab somewhere getting poked and prodded" sounds like a great source of dramatic tension until you think about what would happen if someone actually tried it. The screaming about budgets would be /legendary/.


** Vernon tries to sell him to a shady defense contractor. Except the defense contractor is shady, as child buyers usually are, and kills Vernon and kidnaps Harry, Dudley, and Petunia since they share DNA.

Upon learning there's nothing special about Petunia and Dudley, they're disposed of.

** Hmm, in the case of the MOD, there's always DSTL...

But we know the Ministry of Magic has people inside the British Government and its agencies (see their ability to get young Petunia Evans' letter to Dumbledore even though she sent it by Muggle post), while going by the Children in Need special, the Queen is kept informed of developments in the Wizarding World. Presumably, someone would notice the jurisdiction friction very quickly and the Minister of Magic would make a swift visit to the PM's office.

That's Porton Down, who are a /lot/ more boring than they're popularly made out to be. Apart from the countermeasures work, they mostly put stuff out to external researchers at the country's universities.

That would be where the story /really/ starts, since the secrecy that has kept Harry safe up to this point is now horribly, horribly compromised. Unless nobody took Vernon seriously, or framed it all in comic-book-superhero terms so the magical watchers didn't realise they were talking about a muggleborn wizard. After all, most of this would be handled by front-of-office people who wouldn't refer an obvious crackpot to anyone of a higher pay-grade.

** I don't know what the equivalent agencies would be in the UK, but in the US, if Vernon /wanted/ to have Harry get experimented on in a government laboratory, a shady defense contractor would probably be the easiest way, like [[/u/jeffala][u/jeffala]] said. DARPA would probably be the agency to actually do the experimenting, but I imagine they'd be difficult to contact directly (unless the intelligence community has agents looking for paranormal activity they can weaponize).

Vernon's only other options would probably be the actual military or a research lab. But civilian scientists are too transparent, and I would hope that enough soldiers would have morals to put a stop to it, so shady defense contractor it is.

Thing is, the shady defense contractors in the UK are all about the things that go boom. BAE Systems, who are as shady as they come - they never saw a dictatorship's defence budget they didn't like, and have been fined for corruption more than once - are going to be scratching their heads over this one. I mean, sure, they could probably hire the people to do the research, but who are they going to /sell/ it to? They have shareholders to satisfy, after all.

**** Well, to be fair, in the HP Universe the government was apparently read in on the magical world. Who is to say there hadn't been a branch founded with the purpose of examining wizards and their abilities and how to best combat them in case of an all out war?

Honestly, sounds like an interesting idea tbh:

In the wake of Voldemort's defeat the British government realize they need a greater ability to defend against and combat wizards. They found a secretive military R&D department who is to work and technology to support those activities.

Along comes Vernon trying to pawn off a barely 2 years old Harry. The government realize that this is a golden opportunity and snap him up. There is still enough ethical and moral people involved that it's a pretty sweet childhood for Harry but more importantly: he is growing up around scientists trying to figure out magic and he is to help them and in order to do that he needs to become as good as magic he can be: to explore the limits of his abilities.

It sounds like it could be a fun way to try and create a scientist harry and some interesting muggle/wizard relations drama.

*** I still want to know who the hell is funding those Evil Human Testing Labs, because they don't ever appear to be doing anything even remotely useful or profitable, and often appear to be acting in ways counterproductive to their stated goals. I mean, if you want to weaponise a psychic child, you want your weapon thoroughly on your side as early and as deeply as possible. Procedures of horrible scientific torment on someone you're trying to train to kill with their brain strike me as a health-and-safety-at-work blunder of the worst kind.

** 1) In canon setting Vernon would fail to go anywhere with such a plan because the magical and non-magical governments were keeping in contact with each other. Arguments in favour of this: 1.1) swift response from the MoM after the aunt Marge incident, and no repercussion from it in the muggle world. 1.2) the dialogue scene between the Minister for Magic and the muggle Prime Minister after the Brockdale Bridge attack, at the beginning of The Half-Blood Prince. 1.3) It is very unlikely that Vernon would've been the very first muggle to witness the anomalies happening around a muggleborn and decide to inform the general public about these incidents. Since muggles are unaware about the existence of magic throughout the entire series, it follows that the wizards have some extensive monitoring and controlling mechanisms in place for preventing and reverting information leakages. So the rest of this comment assumes some [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave][satisfactory explanations]] that negate this paragraph.

2) It's fairly likely that the work experience you've mentioned relates to parts of the government that operate within the confines of the law. If the government became aware of a human subject that is able to regenerate, teleport, disintegrate objects, alter reality, communicate with and command all types of snakes (and maybe also boost their intelligence, depending on canon's interpretation), etc, --- and this all before Harry even gets access to his wand and magical education --- then it is highly likely that they would be willing to break all kinds of laws for the sake of all the looming potential benefits that could come out of researching said subject. If there was no governmental agency well-suited for doing the relevant research, the project would keep escalating until someone with enough political power became aware of it to create a brand new division or re-assign someone to have it among their responsibilities.

3) Even if the government wasn't willing to break its laws outright, it could arrange for Harry to get transported to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_site][black site]] first; or to a friendly country so that the laws protecting its citizens would cease to apply --- similar to the loopholes [[https://www.fastcompany.com/40566948/how-countries-outsource-electronic-surveillance-and-threaten-privacy][they're now using for outsourcing mass surveillance on their citizens.]]

4) Even if Vernon contacted a group of legitimate scientists who did nothing more than some benign tests with Harry, the results of these tests would very quickly reach such a point that /other/ governments would start getting interested in him as a unique specimen. The Russian Federation, as an example, was able to assassinate someone who had received political asylum in the UK through /radioactive poisoning,/ on British soil; and then repeat the same thing 12 years later. So if they decided that they wanted this one kid kidnapped, they would at least be brazen enough to give it a try. The Chinese and Saudi Arabia too, likely, just to mention a few.

5) Vernon wouldn't even have to contact governmental agencies. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpbeOCKZFfQ][As Cambridge Analytica has recently demonstrated,]] private firms could be both more flexible at bending the laws and more swift at reacting to fresh “business opportunities”.

The specific group that was exposed to Sarin, and to which Maddison belonged, included almost 400 subjects. The Porton experiments were also unusual in the magnitude of the risks. An increasing number of subjects were exposed to an increasingly high dosage of the nerve agent Sarin, which was known by the principal investigators to be highly toxic and potentially lethal in minute concentrations [...] Britain's discovery of large stocks of nerve gas in Germany in 1945 substantially changed the nature of the experiments at Porton. ...

**** Unethical human experimentation is human experimentation that violates the principles of medical ethics. Such practices have included denying patients the right to informed consent, using pseudoscientific frameworks such as race science, and torturing people under the guise of research. Around World War II, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany carried out brutal experiments on prisoners and civilians through groups like Unit 731 or individuals like Josef Mengele; the Nuremburg Code was developed after the war in response to the Nazi experiments. The Declaration of Helsinki, developed by the World Medical Association (WMA), is widely regarded as the cornerstone document on human research ethics.
