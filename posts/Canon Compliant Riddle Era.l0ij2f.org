I was wondering if anyone's ever come across a Riddle Era fanfiction that is a canon compliant telling of his time at Hogwarts? Would preferably cover things like him gaining followers, opening the Chamber of Secrets, finding out about Horcruxes, etc. Preferably not a time travel one. I don't mind romance, but was hoping it isn't romance-centric.


** I am actually in the process of making this */exact/* thing - canon compliant, birth to (first) death, in multiple volumes. Unfortunately, I haven't published yet. Getting there lol

I don't know of any other fics that attempt this (for more than a few chapters, and with actual canon compliance), which is why I sort of took it on.

*** Wow, that's a really cool endeavour! I've seen some fics that try to do this, but they were all written before the Half Blood Prince was released, so obviously they're no longer canon compliant. Take your time with this, but when it's written, it'd be super cool if you could share it! I always felt like it'd be a really tough thing to get right, so that's really awesome that you're doing it!

**** Thanks!! I'll definitely share it. There's a lot to consider, that's for sure lol. And there are definitely some really dark elements to write about, so that will be interesting...
