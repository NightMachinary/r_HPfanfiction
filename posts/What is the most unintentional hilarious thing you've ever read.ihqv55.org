** In an explicit Harry/Remus fic involving knotting, the penis supposedly twists ties itself into a knot inside another person.

Don't remember the name of the fic though

**** A canine knot, which is where the werewolf trope came from, is just the base of the penis swelling more than the rest.

It's a weirdly shaped erection, not a prehensile dick twisting itself into a literal knot. /wince/

***** Kinda weird thing is that canines - which I assume werewolves count as - have a /baculum/, a penis bone, that basically gives them a literal boner. Without snapping the baculum, it'd be impossible for that to happen, even with a dick like a pool noodle.

** Oh, for the life of me, I can't remember what the story was called. I just remember a scene in Madam Malkin's shop, where Harry and Draco are being fitted and start goofing around. It was something like Draco saying "Harry Potter, not the Harry Potter, I always wanted to meet you, blah blah" and Harry saying "Draco Malfoy, the Draco Malfoy, blah blah", and the McGonagall enters the shop, and Draco is like "McGonagall, the professor McGonagall" and it escalates even more and Draco says he hopes to be sorted in Gryffindor, and right then Lucius hears him, and it was brilliant!

*** This is Methods of Rationality! I just listened to that part in the podbook. It is truly hilarious.

EDIT:Also, to be precise, Harry praises Draco, who loves it, then Harry informs him he doesn't actually know who he is. Then Draco praises Harry, as revenge, and Lucius walks in (who is /obviously/ disgusted with his son's behavior) and Harry rants the same praises to Lucius, to save Draco. /Then,/ Professor McGonagall comes in, and Draco returned the favor to Harry by praising McGonagall (Who is obviously disgusted with Harry's behavior)

and End Scene. It is legendary.

** It was a harem story (think it was the one by Temporal Knight) that was taking itself wayyy too seriously. At some point Hermione was arguing with Harry (in her nagging, logical voice) that Harry should absolutely add some other girl to his harem.

I remember just having taken a sip of coffee as I was reading that. Not only did I spray it all over my desk and keyboard but I also inhaled some, so I was coughing, laughing and trying to clean my stuff at the same time. It was classic.
