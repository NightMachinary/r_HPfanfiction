I had a thought that I rather liked.

​

Imagine Ron coming up to his Mum one day and asking her to teach him the boss-level domestic skills, because “Hermione hates cooking, and I've got more time than she does...can you teach me how to do a roast, Mum?”

​

Doesn't have to be Ron - Bill sharing a recipe he learned in Egypt? Charlie before he left for Romania? The twins, latching on to something where they're ALLOWED to make big messes and occasionally set things on fire? - but...yeah.

​

Could someone write me Molly teaching her kids things?


** Ron joins a cooking competition and does ask Molly about cooking and recipes.

** -‘You can do the cooking tomorrow Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I'll sit here and pull faces'-

-‘It's not like I'm not having the time of my life here,'-

-‘my arm arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night'-

-‘My parents are dead!'-

-‘I have seen your heart and it is mine'-

-‘Least loved as always'-

Ron Weasley woke up in cold sweat, his heart beating furiously and his eyes glistening with unshed tears. His gaze fell on the darkened walls of his own room, a familiar feeling of safety enveloped him. He was no longer in a tent complaining, or running for his life with a madman looking for his blood.

A quick look to his right assured that his best friend was finally sleeping peacefully on bed beside him, with no nightmares troubling him.

Ron sighed. His fingers rubbed his sweaty forehead, there's going to be no more sleep for him tonight. He grabbed his wand from under his pillow, and casted a Tempus.

Soft blue light illuminated the darkened room, and it read 3.30 in the morning. With another sigh, he got up from his bed, and dragged his feet out of his door to go down to the kitchens. Some tea would be nice right about that moment.

His mind wandered to the nightmare that he had, while the details were lost, he could still remember the voice, the images that pored out the locket Horcrux. A cold dreaded feeling went down his spine, he could have ignored the nightmare if it was just his imagination.

But it truly really happened, he left his best friends in the middle of nowhere when they needed him, and the guilt weighed in his heart so bad that it hurt.

Yes, Harry has looked him in the eye and clasped his shoulder firmly, and told him he had forgiven him, and Hermione had kissed him on the lips and tears in her eyes and told him he came back when they needed him the most, and that she had forgiven him, Ron still couldn't put the guilt out of his chest, and it hurt more that he wanted to think.

The last of the steps gave a squeak as he stepped in it, and he finally walked into the kitchen, his mind swirling with not so positive thoughts and -

He stopped, as his gaze fell on the person sitting at the family table, a cup of steaming liquid secured in her hands.

“Mum?” He asked, his long legs instantly taking him towards the Weasley Matriarch.

Molly Weasley was quiet, but her body was wrenching with silent sobs, and her cheeks wet with tears.

“Mum,” Ron tried again and wrapped his arms around her, in order to calm her down. He felt his heart break. Ever since he was little, he had never seen his mother cry until after the war, for F-Fred. It was painful, to see his happy family so devastated, so gloomed and in the verge of tears.

Ron placed a hand in his mother's head, and kissed her forehead, like she used to do to him all those years ago when he fell sick with anything more than a headache.

He looked at the table, which was empty except for the steaming cup of tea, and decided to do something about it.

He bent down to look straight at his crying mother, and wiped her tears. “I'll be back mum”

Ron walked towards the counter, and picked up the biscuit jar that was usually filled to the brim. But, to his disappointment, the jar was empty except for the small crumbs at the bottom of it.

Ron sighed again, when they were young and upset about somethings, his mother always used to give biscuits and tea, but now, the jar was empty. And he had no bloody idea what he should do.

What could he do? He couldn't possibly cook. He tried once, when he was at Bill's and he nearly set the house on fire.

A shiver went down his spine. Well, baking couldn't do any worse could it? If he burned something, he had his wand this time, so it wouldn't be so bad.

With that in mind, Ron took the flour out of it's container and roughly measured a few cups an put it to a bowl. If he was honest with himself, Ron had no idea what he was doing.

True to that, it didn't take him more than a few moments to be covered with flour and his fingers to be laced with not so good looking biscuit dough. It looks a little too watery for his eyes. So he reached for the flour jar again, but the container slipped off form his slimy hands and fell on to the floor, giving away a big racket of noise.

Needless to say, it didn't take Molly more than a second to flash into to look for the person who had invaded her kitchen.

The Weasley Matriarch, the world's best cook (according to Ron at least) , the mother of seven kids, who had a fierce determination in her eyes when she protected them, who had tears straining down her eyes just a moment ago, took a good look at flour covered Ron with slime dripping off his fingers, and gave a big teary laugh and walked over to him and hugged him, ignoring his protests on ruining her clothes.

Ron Weasley felt that maybe he had failed in his attempt to bake, but nonetheless, he brought a smile to his mother's face and that was enough.

And maybe, if he asked, his mother wouldn't mind sharing the secret recipe of her biscuits with him.

** With the Weasleys being such a large family and most of their in book together time is focused around food/meals together, this is really interesting to me. Gives me ideas. ;)

I have seen this before, but in time travel fics that include Ron. He feels bad about complaining so much in DH about the food and missing his Mum's cooking that he decided to learn how to cook so they can avoid that situation again. The one that comes to mind first is linkffn(8326928) It's unfinished though and has been a while since the last update. The author is still active and hasn't said anything about dropping it yet. Even still, what is up already is good. I've read it a few times. There are others, but I'm blanking on the names right now. But generally, any time traveling fic that includes Ron has him learning to cook.

linkffn(12157282) is a lot darker in premise since Molly has passed away, but it does include more domestic Weasley elder siblings. So It's kind of similar-ish? I stopped reading since I'm bad with keeping up with updating fics, but it's good and brings in an interesting concept of magic. Also heavy Percy-centric which is rare.

*** I was going to recommend Percy Take The Wheel too! Definitely it is a darker fic, but the concept of hedge magic was so interesting, and involves extensive lessons in cooking, cleaning, housework, etc. I love a Percy fic, and I also always appreciate a fic that takes time to distinguish between the twins and give them individual personalities
