** The Eagle's Nest by HeartofAspen - AO3 Dramione 291k

Sugar and Spice by InLoveWithForever - AO3 Hermione/Draco/Theo I didn't know I needed this until I read it. 156k

Apple Pies and Other Amends by ToEatAPeach - AO3 Dramione 76k shorter but very good

Anything by Turtle_Wexler on AO3

One Step Forward, Two Decades Back by Corvusdraconis and Dragon_and_the_Rose - Epic length, I've actually read it twice. AU Hermione goes to the Marauders era Severus/Hermione 428k

Pride of Time by AnubisAnkh - One of my favourites. Severus/Hermione Au she goes back to Marauders Era

Sorry for no links, I'm on my phone and can't grab them easily. I know Severus/Hermione isn't everyone's cup of tea, but they are so well written I had to add them.
