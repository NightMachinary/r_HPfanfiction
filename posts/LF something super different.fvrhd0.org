No crossovers please. I'm looking for any one of a kind story, completely different from all the others that puts a different spin on old tropes or has a different outlook on the wizarding world. Most of the stories now have twenty the same and fifty just a little different. Give me something that is so different that it sits in a catagory of its own. Must be complete or at least stop at a decent point.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19437019][Ten Tips to Tranquility]] by bking4 has a take on ice queen Daphne that I've never seen before and it's interesting and a bit unnerving at times.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]] by TheDivineComedian and a lot of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]]'s other fics are unique in the use of surrealism and a feeling of unreality that you rarely find in fanfiction. Blackpool especially is an example of an unreliable narrator done very well.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16329614][Civil Disobedience]] by Oceanbreeze7 is comedic and very different from other versions of a politician Riddle.

It isn't anywhere near done, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244][Spoonful of Sugar]] by widdlewed looks nothing like any master of death fic I've seen before.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] by noaacat is a fic where Hogwarts doesn't start until kids turn 14. Never seen another fic like it and it's fantastic and complete.

** All of these fics are complete. The first ones are mostly Voldemort/Harry fics but all of these are very unique and I highly recommend them.

A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magic surrounding immortality and what Voldemort did to create Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. Tom pov. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

A short character study. Harry writes an essay about magic and Quirrelmort reads it. Short and worth a read. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19946671]])

One of the best Harry/Voldemort fics out there. Harry and Voldemort share their dreamscape. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9372596]])

A very interesting fic in terms of characterbuilding and the circumstances surrounding it. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581]])

A dark Harry fic with a twist. I absolutely love it. I wish there was a sequel. The idea behind it is really unique. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6006037]])

This is one is a really good Tomarry fic but it's the ending that really gets you. It's what makes the story what it is. Very good twist. Basically what if Harry acted like a Horcrux in Tom Riddles mind. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

Very interesting. Harry gets trapped in a memory inside Dumbledores pensieve. Basically he accidentally meddles with time and so two timelines merge and there are two versions of Tom Riddle at some point. The original Voldemort and a somewhat nicer Tom Riddle. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/995179]])

This is a Drarry time loop fic that is Draco centric. Post-war. It's a good story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082]])

This fic is interesting because it's canon-compliant and we see what Fleur, Bill and Percy are up to during the time Harry is Horcrux hunting. We see the other side of the war. How it affected other people who still lived in society. Linkffn(The Order of Mercy)

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

** The Archaeologist by Racke

It's a fusion with Bloodborne the video game, but you don't have to be familiar with it; that is just the background of the tomb that is being explored. Harry is transported to another universe but finds himself in his dead female twin's body. No body horror/angst, though. Harry just accepts it and his losses of loved ones and moves on.

** World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren\\
An incredibly interesting trans-universe travel AU - love the Harry/Snape friendship. In the new dimension, the dead Harry had a relationship with Draco, so there is some unrequited creepy Draco behavior toward the current Harry. Really well-handled "another universe calls for a hero trope."

#+begin_quote
  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. No prominent pairings. 5* from DLP.
