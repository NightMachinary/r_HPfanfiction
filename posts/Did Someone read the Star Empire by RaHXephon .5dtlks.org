I loved it, but it's not online anymore.

For the one who did read it. Do you know other fic like this one ?


** I read it, and no, I don't think there is any HP/sci-fi fic with such good worldbuilding.

If you mean like it, as in Harry in space...

- linkffn(Browncoat, Green eyes)

HP/Firefly, pretty good

- linkffn(The Star Alliance)

also by RahXephon

Darth Marrs has a bunch of HP/Star Wars and HP/Star Trek crossovers. Most are entertaining, some are mediocre. My favorite is linkffn(7718942).

If you like Stargate SG-1 there's a good amount of crossovers with HP. Most suck, some are enjoyable. Almost all suffer from the SG-1 curse - a huge amount of lore leads into a lack of direction in the plot. One of the best in the bunch: linkffn(1995083)

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  General O'Neill is sent on a nice relaxing dipolmatic mission in the U.K. Of course there's bound to be trouble when he runs into a murderous cult called the Death Eaters, who've some how gotten their hands on alien technology. SG1xHP REVIEW!
