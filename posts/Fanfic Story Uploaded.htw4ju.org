Just uploaded my Ghost Rider and Harry Potter crossover. I would like to know what you all think (Hope i used the right flair, let me know if i didn't so I can change it.)

** I've read through this a couple of times, now.

First of all, well done on writing something, and having the courage to post it. That's a huge thing, and more than a lot of people ever do.

Now, I'm assuming that since you mention the Ball, this is only a prologue?

You have an interesting idea to draw from, here, and one I haven't seen before, at that. So, well done on that, too.

Your spelling is fairly strong across the board, and you know how paragraphs work, which are also positives.

Constructive criticism to follow, from this point.

You do have one spot where a thought would benefit from being on a new line (No one really calls me Johnathon anymore, except for Uncle Slade. Blaze thinks.) Since it's something that Johnathon thinks, in response to a comment that someone else has made.

You've had a good shot at writing out the accents, too, which I'm impressed by. That's a thing that's usually hard to do well.

The first thing that jumps out at me, at first glance, is the fact that you've written in present tense, aside from a couple of spots where you slip into past tense.

This is just a personal opinion, however, stylistically, it's something I find pulls me out of a story, to the point where I'm focusing on the individual words, rather than a story as a whole. Third person, past tense, I find, tends to be better for the flow of this sort of writing.

Compare - “Well, I'm expecting someone else to arrive here, another boy that's around your age.” Arthur says. He peeks out of the tent and frowns when he doesn't see his other guest.

To

“Well, I'm expecting someone else to arrive here, another boy that's around your age.” Arthur said. He peeked out of the tent and frowned when he didn't see his other guest.

It's a tiny thing, that can make a huge difference.

Formatting can also make a huge difference in readability. In particular, an old trick is having thoughts in italics.

The other thing I noticed, is that it's a little bare-bones, at the moment. You have some things here, sentences and ideas both, that could be nicely expanded upon, to the benefit of your story.

One thing I'm particularly curious about, is the idea of muggles knowing about mutants. How did they find out about mutants, in the first place?

Why aren't wizards considered the same as mutants? Or are they? Harry, talking casually about an entire branch of people being treated as slaves was something that threw me for a loop.

The Harry that we know and love would be angry about this, I think, and Hermione would be even more so. It's quite an injustice, when mutants are (I assume) simply people with unique powers that manifest due to mutation.

Your sentences could use more description, e.g running, standing, changing expressions, tones of voice, what someone is wearing. Tell us the little things that a person notices, to build on the bones of what you have here, and watch as people lap it up.

Don't give up, no matter what you do.

I'm really looking forward to seeing you take what you have here, and growing as a writer, and seeing where, exactly this story goes.

Thanks for sharing, and best of luck!

*** I see where you come from, description has always been a weakness of mine.

For the whole thing of Harry and Hermione being mad about the mutants being slaves has glossed over my mind.

For the Hermione and Harry anger about slaves beeing treated as mutants will be definetley used when the Death Eaters attack.

As for if the muggles think Wizards are considered mutants, it's safe to say the Dursleys do.

For the whole muggle population i'd have to give that more thought as to how they found out as to how the Wizards exist or if i can find a work around as to how they've ignored the wizarding population.

You've given me alot to think about and for that I thank you.

As to how I do the accents i use this website : [[https://www.payneful.co.uk/projects/french-accent-translator/#]] since I can hardly write an accent.
