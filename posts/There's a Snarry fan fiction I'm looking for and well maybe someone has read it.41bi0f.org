So a friend and I were talking today about fan fiction and we got into HP. Nonetheless, she's been trying to find a fanfiction she read back when where Harry Potter goes back in time numerous times. He either goes back in time or goes to alternate universes. In one universe, he's with his parents but then realizes he needs to go back so as to fight a war. In another universe he meets Snape but Snape goes by the name Johnathan, or Jonathon.

My friend says in the fan fic the name was spelled Johnathon(with a 'thon' at the end of it).

I know this is a long shot but I figured I post and see what y'all come up with. Any advice or suggestions is much appreciated. =)


** I don't even want to know how many years ago I read this but here you go.
