What tropes in this fandom do you love and would never get tired of reading?

For me, it's Sirius living and he getting a trial.

No matter how bad a fic is, I can read it only for that and then press the back button.

So what's yours? If you can, provide recs.

**** Honestly, I feel like if he had gotten to know and hang out with the DA kids from the first day people would not have been so quick to blame him. I remember in book 2 the ones who he did spend time with (Quidditch team, etc.) didn't take the accusations seriously and then he mostly stopped being a suspect as soon as Hermione was petrified. A big issue for Harry is he is this mysterious figure who's reputably very powerful but not very social - not a good combination.

There's of course Debt of Time, but also Chemistry and Timing (Remus/Hermione) linkffn(7860277). That one has a 20 year old Hermione traveling back to 1993, so it's not a Marauder-era fic, which is a nice touch.

I also really enjoy soulmate fic, especially the whole 'werewolves get soulmates, and they're super rare but hey look it's Hermione' trope. Super cheesy, still a favorite.

Slytherins who aren't truly evil, but who also aren't truly good. Who are 3 dimensional. I really liked Slughorn, he wasn't evil, but he also had his own personal flaws; which was something I enjoyed reading.

Characters getting a good redemption story, rather it be Snape or someone else. Maybe he sees Harry as his own person, maybe he doesn't but something happens and he's torn, I don't care, it's always great to read those.

** This might sound odd but I love reading "Depressed!Draco" fics that focus on his life, especially after the war. I like to see how the authors write his struggles to find his place in the wizarding world with the tarnished reputation of his family. How will he survive that? How do you build a future for yourself when you feel like you don't have one? I love to see people's takes on his character.

Seriously, feed me that shit all day long.

**** I'm into Harry x Hermoine, but only when they're best friends and lovers; philosophically, I think romantic matches between best friends work better than just romantic matches between people you simply court for romance because somebody who is your best friend already knows all your foibles and little quirks and would put up with them even before you two get together, so not much would change after you do.

***** Yeah, sadly most H/Hr stories lack a relationship between equals. Most either have OPHarry and Hermione as a follower or Hermione acting like a mother and not a lover.

I did write one fairly successful Harry/Hermione oneshot based entirely on "I would do this completely different", but despite liking the pairing I can't come up with a longer story to write with them. I always run into "X story already did this and it sucked" or "Y story already did this well, but I don't want to copy that".

****** Honestly, I think a H/Hr could be interesting if you successfully explore the friendship relationship between the two characters, from when they first meet on the train until they become inseparable best friends who spend 12+ hours a day together. Make it more a slice of life and character study of both Harry and Hermione, where both learn to appreciate each other over the course of their life, and I think it would be warm and beautiful.

** I have tons of tropes I love reading but not like what you're saying where the fic could be bad.

I guess I might tolerate a badly written adorable-clingy Draco befriends Harry Potter (no romance necessary). I'm a sucker for that Draco persona.
