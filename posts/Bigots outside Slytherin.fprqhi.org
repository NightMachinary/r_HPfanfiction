It's a common trope in independent Harry fanfiction is the neutral faction. A group of slytherin students who is just in it for the ambition and money and aren't really that bad. But it isn't often that we see the reverse, with bigots outside of Slytherin.

I feel like there should be more Ravenclaw Death Eater trying to explain their bigotry with random logic facts. Or more Gryffindor Death Eater, who don't join like Wormtail because they're cowards, self preserving and cunning, but whose Gryffindor attributes still shine. People going against their family to join the Death Eaters could be considered brave, or daring enough to be openly bigoted. Or Hufflepuff students who show a lot of loyalty to their family and their views, even when they know that the facts don't line up with the Death Eater cause.

We sometimes get Hogwarts turning on Harry, but that is often because they believe him to be dark. I can't remember reading any fanfiction where one of Harry's non- Slytherin year mates turned out to be a Death Eater. (Expect Ron, but we don't talk about those). We often get a dialogue about how Slytherin isn't all that bad and how some Hufflepuff joined Voldemort and showed a lot of misguided loyalty, but we rarely see it in action.

We don't know a lot about most of Harry's year mates. So who is to say that non of them carry any dislike for Muggleborns? It would be cool to explore this. With Harry being so focused on his biased view against Slytherin that he doesn't notice someone outside of it stabbing him in the back.


** I feel like all the Ravenclaw Harry fics that I've read always show the boys in his dorm as somewhat bigoted. It's always the same set that I can't name for the life of me, but there is always these two that are name dropped in the books, that are always presented as being just as bad as Draco, except that they hide it somewhat in front of the teachers/are not as outspoken as Draco. One of them always hate Harry from the get go only because of his mother/blood, whereas Draco always came off as being mostly spiteful (at first) because of the friendship denial.

(As a result, I always feel like Ravenclaw would have been a terrible house-especially in comparison with Hufflepuff or Gryffindor---where thinking outside the box, like Luna, would mean 7 hellish years and being different in any way a true nightmare).

(And wasn't Barty a Ravenclaw? Maybe he got corrupted by the house bigotry in the first place. See, all makes sense now haha).

I also can't help but remember Weasleys. “We have a squib cousin but we don't talk about him.” Molly basically calling Muggle medicine stupid. Arthur literally having a work that has him study Muggles and still being ignorant even of the most basic things like money. He could have asked any Muggleborn at any time to explain him anything, but he hadn't got around to it in all his 40+ years. It just shows how casually bigoted all of the wizarding world is.

When wizards can regrow bones in an entire arm inside 12 hours (as opposed to never in Muggle medicine), it more or less makes sense for Molly to say this. Wizarding medicine is far beyond Muggle medicine - it's like comparing modern medicine to some of the quackeries that claim to be medicine.

Arthur's job involves the unlawful enchantment of muggle goods by wizards and dispelling those enchantments, not studying muggles. He doesn't need to know how a currency bill works - however, if a currency note starts biting its owner, then it's Arthur's job to cancel the enchantment.

And Arthur is quite brilliant at enchantment, considering he enchanted his car to fly all by himself.

It isn't though. It's like calling medicine in a less developed country stupid because they don't have access to the same education/equipment/money that the first-world countries have. Similarly, Muggles don't have an access to the necessary skill (magic) witch doesn't make them stupid. And some things Muggles just don't need. They don't need to know how to regrow bones because in Muggle world you can't vanish them in the first place.

There's also a difference between ‘quackeries' and a less developed medicine.

Getting back to the stitches. Because of the venom, healers were unable to close the wound by magical means either, trying stitches wasn't unreasonable at all. Yes, it didn't work in this case. However, it's not a stretch to think that there are curses/cursed daggers/etc. that also leave a wound that couldn't be closed by magic , in witch case stitches would be helpful.

#+begin_quote

No, he doesn't need to. But his job still involves dealing with Muggle goods. Considering he's so enthusiastic about all things Muggle, I would still expect him to go and ask about the said goods if he's interested and doesn't know what it is (and ok, maybe he does this, the books really don't give that impression though). I also would expect him to be prepared when he knows beforehand that he will have to use Muggle money.

This is false - if something heavy enough falls on your hand or foot, you can expect your hand to get pulverised. IRL, you'd have to spend the rest of your life without a hand, while wizards can regrow your hand from scratch.

#+end_quote

This isn't the proper comparison. As someone living in a third world country, I can say that the medical practices we have here are the same as that in Canada or wherever. We have the same equipment and education as any developed country. The medical technology we use, the medical concepts used by doctors, the treatment of patients, and the overall science behind medicine - they are all the same.

Sure, a country like Canada would have more of the medical equipment that's bleeding edge, but we have that here too, just a lesser number.

It's not like we're using an entirely different medical science, like homeo or acupuncture or whatever they're called now.

On the other hand, Muggles use a completely different medical science compared to wizards. The fact that they don't have magic should not be a mitigating factor when you want to compare the effectiveness of the two sciences.

Besides, Muggles have done incredible feats without any magic, things that wizards haven't been able to do.

It makes for a nice story to laugh over later on, but when you're in that situation - an urgent case, and someone does something as stupid as this when a life could be on the line (speaking from personal experience as a by-stander) - the by-stander will lose their shit.

Imagine if the stitches caused complications and caused something permanent.

There are a lot of inconsistencies as far as the writing goes. This is another of them - Arthur knows how to buy a car and drive it around, but doesn't know how to use the currency to make the purchase itself.

****** I think he's trying to say that calling Muggle medicine stupid is just a ridiculous thing to say. Of course it's not stupid because it's the best it can be with the tools Muggles have. If they had magic, it would be an entirely different sort of medicine.

The comparison he's trying to make is between modern allopathy and alternative medicine like ayurveda or acupuncture. Calling those medical traditions 'stupid' is equally as ridiculous as a wizard calling Muggle medicine stupid. In both cases, every group did the best they could with what they had. They formed extensive medical theories, practices, and applications- they didn't simply bumble around in the dark in their stupidity. It just so turned out that one (allopathy) was more suited to today's world and has had better results.

What would be fair to say is that practitioners of other forms of medicine should adopt some allopathic methods because we have proven that that type of medicine is 'better'. You can pass judgement on those practitioners that refuse to do so. But a Muggle cannot adopt Wizarding magic so they are free from criticism. If Muggle doctors could use magic and refused to do so, then perhaps a wizard could say they are 'stupid'. But you're only stupid when you see something that works and refuse to accept it.

No, no it wasn't. If someone was possibly hit by dark magic, which has been known to not allow people to properly heal with magical means. Attempting to use muggle means is certainly a viable option, considering how on Earth would a pureblood spell Craftsman (Which would be most of the spell crafters, considering we can assume Severus Snape as an outlier, due to the outlandish pureblood esque names of all known spellsmiths) know about muggle healing techniques. And, even then, this entire argument is catastrophically retarded, considering said stitches were dissolved by Nagini's venom either way, and quite literally couldn't have caused complications, in the scenario offered.

Given the number of dark wizards who hate muggles in wiz history, why would you think that dark magic could be countered with muggle means? If dark magic could be countered easily with muggle means, that sort of defeats the purpose of using dark magic against muggles.

Severus is also an outlandish name by 1990s or 2000s standards.

When a substance gets dissolved by a solvent, that substance does not disappear. They are either still present inside the solvent as solute particles, or chemically react with the solvent to form a new substance.

If you want to look at this scientifically, the corrosive nature almost definitely means that the venom reacted with the stitches to produce a new substance.

And you're suggesting that the formation of a new substance in the bloodstream - probably one that's rarely seen before, seeing as normal snake venom is either haemotoxic or neurotoxic - won't cause complications? Are you joking?

To quote Arthur C Clark: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." There's also the magical inverse: "Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from Technology."

Again, how does he still have his job when he's probably not even doing it halfway properly? Because the wizarding world doesn't care.

Seriously, he has to go out into the field to do his work. Him not knowing basic things says the Oblivators must hate him. Or leaves behind things he's supposed to take because he doesn't know what it is. Or takes things he's not supposed to, again, because he doesn't know what it is.

*** Bigotry is thinking that you're /morally/ superior based on inherent qualities. it's not bigotry to think that medicine that works better works better.

The Squib accountant thing is more suspect, but there's certainly plenty of non-racist reasons for that, including the Squib simply not wanting to be reminded that there's an entire world out there that he's basically disabled in.

Arthur is ignorant, but his job is basically just getting rid of enchantments on Muggle stuff, not studying Muggles in any way. That's just a hobby. He also does ask Harry and Hermione about Muggle stuff, and it's implied that he does so to Muggleborns at work, which is why he's considered eccentric and kind of a loser.

** I think the "bigots outside your house" concept works way better with Grindlewald's ideology. I know the movies weren't all that great, but he does have a very intriguing ideology, compared to Voldemort's enslave everyone, kill muggleborns and, uh, I'm not sure what else there really was there.

- Ravenclaws are going to be interested in being benevolent dictators because, well, they view themselves are smarter then everyone else, so you extend that to looking down on Muggles as being intellectually primitive.
- Hufflepuffs could look at it as someone who was fighting for the entire wizarding world, and appeal to their sense of loyalty and perhaps bettering the world for both muggles and wizards alike. They could justify his crimes through "For the Greater Good".
- Griffindors similarly might be drawn to the motto, and considering the timeline of the movie, which was set in 1926ish, they would have seen WW1 in it's glory and could be forced into a more warlike and aggressive mentality.
- Slytherins would (naturally) love being in charge, so they'll be interested too.\\

So all in all, you've got a ideology that's reasonable enough to interest core characteristics of each house, and in the post WW1 setting and most of Grindlewalds's crimes in Durmstrang not being known to people, you have a very possible scenario for people from each house to be interested in joining him.

** I think that while this issue is noticeable, it points to a lack of planning by JK from the beginning. Unfortunately at no point in the series is Voldemort's goal logical. I'd guess she planned the first two books? Where it was clear bad guys vs good guys and was more a children's book than a novel. She created clear evil and good, with a distinct lack of ‘grey'.

It would make much more sense to make bigotry against muggles worse, but embracing magical people was encouraged. Like Grindlewald. If Tom was a disciple of his, he could have created an aristocracy based on magical strength, history, and knowledge that would have made much more sense (And it would have given you an opportunity to have the bigger boss fight).

Blatant bigotry against muggleborns and half-bloods, while part of story, is not only illogical from villain's perspective (who's a half-blood), but downright stupid.

I've seen someone do population dynamics math on here and show that being a pure blood meant you were something like under 10% of the population. Meaning that the chances they could have established a highly popular group with the sole focus on being bigots gets impractical.

I mean, maybe if you were already a fucking Nazi, I guess, but just being roommates with someone annoying doesn't make you hate their whole race. Plus, they'd still be around and friends with all the other Muggleborns at Hogwarts, which is apparently a huge amount, so I'm not sure where you're coming from.

** There's at least one canonically bigoted Gryffindor - Molly Weasley. She may not be of the "kill the mudbloods" variety, but she's definitely dismissive of anything Muggle, and as Ron says the "we don't talk about" her Squib cousin who works as an accountant.

**** Hagrid only seems about as bigoted as Arthur, i.e. not actively dismissive of Muggles but not particularly respectful of them either. Not sure where you're getting bigotry in McG.

***** She and Snape used the word ‘Muggle' dismissevely, which this fandoms seems to think means bigotry. There is a big difference between dismissing something/someone and being bigot. And for all we know, the Squib cousin could just have gone in self exile to the Muggle world or had a falling out with the family which would cause Molly to not remember that just like she cried every time someone mentioned Percy in OotP.

*** She's also shown bigotry towards werewolves despite knowing Remus, as evidenced by her attitude towards the Muggle in the same ward as Arthur in Book 5 who was bitten. I think its safe to say that any bigoted behavior Ron displays throughout the books was learned from his mother.

** I generally assume that Death Eaters and anyone with a similar belief ended up in Slytherin because blood purity was the issue which drove the founders apart. Not to mention that it would exclude you from the other houses since buying into social Darwinism isn't a sign of intelligence and the desire to murder people in gruesome ways or see that done to them goes against the values of both Slytherin and Gryffindor.

That isn't to say that there are no bad people outside of Slytherin, but the particular branch of blood purity related nastiness should be quite limited outside, although there might be some who only started to dig the rhetoric after they were sorted. But most Death Eaters are the descendants of other, likeminded people and that brainwashing should ensure that they end up in Slytherin.

Most House traits can be twisted into something which supports Voldemort (Hufflepuff loyalty (eg to old friends), Gryffindor courage (join to protect someone else) and Ravenclaw cleverness (I do not stand a chance against them so I better join)).

** I definitely read a fic once where the Patil twins were death eaters but I can't remember enough to identify it. I do remember Lavender became super badass after the betrayal though.
