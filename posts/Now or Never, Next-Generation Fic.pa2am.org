This next-gen fic is Rose/Scorpius centric. It follows them throughout their time at Hogwarts, as they fall for each other, and learn about their parents, etc. It's quite an interesting story and does a really good job at making the events and the Trio realistic.

Unfortunately, it's not yet finished. It has been a while since the author last posted an update, but the story is really great and well worth the read.

[[http://www.checkmated.com/story.php?story=9397][It can be found on checkmated.]] However, since some of the chapters are NC-17, it is in the "restricted section," and you need a log in.

[[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=6610&textsize=0&chapter=1][It can also be found on the Quidditchpitch]], and you do not need a log in. However, you can only read up to chapter 31. There are 32 chapters on checkmated.

*Below is a description from the author:*

There was no questioning that the competition with Scorpius Malfoy was right personal, and Rose Weasley intended to win at all costs. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, a different kind of conflict arose, and for the first time in her life, she was less than confident about conquering it.


** I have read up to Chapter 31 and it's a very well thought out story. I could not stop reading this!

*** I'm glad you liked it! I really loved it when it first came out. It's nice to be able to just read through it in solid chunks without waiting for each chapter. Hopefully the author will finish it eventually.
