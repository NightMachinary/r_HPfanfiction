** linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens Of Sanity) has Harry create a very impressive set of contact lenses. Warning though, LOTS of bashing. Like loads. Seriously. I think it's a fun story but don't take it too seriously.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** In the story 'Harry Potter and the other Path', if I remember correctly he takes his eye out to replace it with a magical one, and he installs a gem or something similar inside him in order to neutralize any poison he might ingest. It occurs towards the latter half of the story, and it is not its focus, but it fits your criteria.

The story is a repost by a non-author, since it hadn't been uploaded on ffnet. Feel free to look for the original one, wherever it is (even though it is the same thing technically).

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.
