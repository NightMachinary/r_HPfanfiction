I was doing some reading, and I came up with a ship that is intriguing. Ron Weasley and Susan Bones. I'm not sure if they have a ship name, but for some reason, I believe they would've worked perfectly. Ron, for all his faults, would go through Hell for his friends. Susan is extremely loyal.

They just feel like the perfect couple in my opinion, but I'm curious to hear what you guys think about it.

  Susan is extremely loyal.

You say this based off of her many lines in canon, right?

Oh, right, she only has three lines across all seven books and that characterization is entirely the result of fanon.

**** Hufflepuff is also the House where they put "the rest" like Zacharias Smith. Because of that, you can basically justify anyone going into Hufflepuff.

***** I mean do we really know enougj about him to say hes the rest? Other than him being an ass towards harry snd co? Even if he didnt like harry he never betrayed the DA. Seems pretty loyal. He was supposedly upset at harry for sneaking into the tournament which leans towards just.

  Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own houses, there was much pushing and shouting; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue, here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings.

  /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; Chapter 31; The Battle of Hogwarts/

Pretty hard to defend the loyalty of a character who is ready to topple younger students to save his own hide.

Concerning his fairness, there is the whole 1st Quidditch Match of HBP (Gryffindor Vs Slytherin) that he commentated. He spent more time attacking Harry for his qualities as a Captain (He has 2 Weasley in his team so he clearly chose his team on friendship rather than talent, look as that skinny batter they usually have a bit more of muscles . . .) than actually doing his job.

Canon doesn't give us a lot of information on Zacharias Smith, but there is absolutely nothing positive about him in the rare scene he appears.

****** Hufflepuffs are all around pretty awful. Tonks and Cedric seem alright, but JFF is the 1st person we see believe Harry is the heir and runs from him, Ernie is a dick until OotP, and as a collective they were pretty happy to consort with Draco in GoF.

**** Of course, all the Gryffindors are brave, just ask Peter Pettigrew. And all Slytherins are cunning, Crabbe and Goyle are obvious proof.

What house somebody is sorted into means less than nothing when discussing their characterization.

***** Slytherins are also ambitious. Peter might not have been brave but sought glory. There are parts of characters personality that are shown in their house. Crabbe and Goyle might noy have been cunning from what we saw of them but we also didnt see much lore than from harrys pov. When building on canon characters who didnt get much screentime so to speak we have to base it on something.

***** TBF Pettigrew found, nursed and restored Voldemort practically single handed. Sure he may have betrayed the good guys for unknown reasons and decided to fake his own death, but he isn't as pathetic as everybody seemed to think. Even as Scabbers he had the audacity to hide in Hogwarts in the bed next to Harry's when he could easily have slipped the country and lived as a muggle or possibly even a wizard in comfort.

*** Of course, Susan is as blank slate as Daphne Greengrass, but for me she is always the one from linkao3(wallflower: in defense of susan bones by dirgewithoutmusic). It is awesome how in not that many paragraphs, the author managed to create a person with her own character.

#+begin_quote
  When she was small, Susie's aunt Amelia had taken her to work whenever her parents asked her to babysit. She toddled around her office. When Susie was older, she got to sit under her aunt's desk in court and listen to her give out rulings, verdicts, decrees. There was tradition there, scripts and structure, and Susie had felt herself lean into them, comforted, strengthened. Over the years, she saw so many ways the system could be corrupted. Umbridge used it like a blunt weapon and blood purists had snuck into it for years like burrowing termites, undermining the foundations, making it their own home.When Susan Bones was twenty-three she would look across her steaming mug and the Ministry breakroom table, and see Hermione aching to burn it all down to ashes. Susan wanted to scour it to its roots, instead, wear it down to its rebar and concrete, and then rebuild from the old, worn foundations on up.“Your parents died for you,” Susie told Harry Potter once. “My aunt died for this. Now either shut up and get me a fresh cup of coffee or try to drag me out of here before I finish this.”But that was a war away. That was a childhood away from now.

*** I mean it is obvious that OP meant that Susan could easily be portrayed as extremely loyal, due to her already high fanon representation.

** Idk. Susan is basically Daphne withouth the edgyiness and "Gray^{™©}" ideology. She is basically a more human version of Daphne(although i once read a story where Bones were Necromancers and Hannah was an enchanted inferi created to take care of susan)

You can do whatever you want. for ship name i suggest Rosan.

** I think it's a strong ship for sure. I feel like with her aunt being so successful herself, Susan would have a lot of motivation as well, and would probably be really ambitious in a way that would encourage collaboration and teamwork. I feel like there is a lot of potential for a really healthy dynamic. I see it weir king far better than Ron with Hermione who's drive would be slightly different because of where they sit in society and the motivations behind the ambition.

** linkao3(18267848)

This Fremione fic took a turn and became more Ron-centric and in it he ends up Susan Bones it was so cute and they seemed like a really good pair, I enjoyed it a lot! It is a non-magic AU but Ron ans Susan shared a class I think and would study together.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Susan%20Bones*s*Ron%20Weasley/works][All of 56 fics tagged with it on AO3]], and based on my quick perusal, it looks like the vast majority of them just have it as a background relationship in a story about another ship.

That's unfortunate. I wouldn't mind seeing it explored more.
