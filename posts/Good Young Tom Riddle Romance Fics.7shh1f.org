** How young are you looking for? And do the pairings matter much? I know several Tom and Hermione fics but to many, that romance doesn't float most people's boats.

** I mean linkffn(11752324) kinda sorta not really fits the category. Except that Tom Riddle is Emily Riddle.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

An amazing story featuring an OC. It is not so gooey, lovey, and fluffy but as close as you can get to love with Tom Riddle.
