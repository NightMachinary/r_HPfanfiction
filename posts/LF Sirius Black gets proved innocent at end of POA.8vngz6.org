Any good fanfics where Sirius gets proved innocent at the end of POA and Harry goes to live with him? Not a one shot but a full length story if you can. Please no slash or m ratings. My preferred pairings are Harry/Hermione Ron/Hermione Harry/Ginny or no pairings. The less bashing the better but I can tolerate some.

My apologies if there isn't a fic that has these qualifications but if you can get it as close as possible that'd be great if not oh well


** It happens (or happened right before the story starts) in my stories "Patron", "Divided and Entwined", and the ongoing "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief". Harry lives with the exonerated Sirius in Grimmauld Place, and the pairings match your preference.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** I can recommend mine since it's pretty new (only 4 months since publishing) and ongoing. But Sirius is actually cleared after OotP. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12866177/1/Dysfunctional]]) No bashings and there are canon pairings but only in the background.

  Post OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. But, the war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge of defeating Voldemort and his Death Eaters once and for all. They just might have to make bigger sacrifices than they had imagined. Harry and Sirius bonding fic. No slash. Semi-canon compliant.

** linkffn(8045114)

There is some slight dumbledore “bashing” at the beginning before Sirius and Dumbledore link up, but done very well imo. Mostly Sirius just discuss a bit heatedly why he put Harry there and they agree to work together to help defeat Voldemort without all the subterfuge.

My issue with this fic is that the writing feels very American. But this is essentially the “Harry and the GoF plot except with Sirius free and in power”
