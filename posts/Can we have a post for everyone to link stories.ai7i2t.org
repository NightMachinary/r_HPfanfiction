I am constantly in need of linking stories, and I don't necessarily know where to do it, so I will generally use a random thread or one of my own to do it, even if it's off-topic. I mostly need the Kindle format and this is faster than converting the books with FFdownloader, so if you know a better way to get that, please tell.

Also, it could be interesting to see what people link. It could act as an unofficial repository of sorts, for someone to browse through and pick something new.

I hope this is not a dumb idea.


** The bot uses ff2ebook.com to download the stories, you don't need to go through the bot to download them.
