they don't need to be Weasley twins level, but I am looking for a story in which the twins work together or at least are on the path to working together like in Prince of Slytherin


** Hmm, I'm sitting here trying to decide if my fic kind of fits your criteria, but I figured I might as well give it to you anyway, because why not? Harry has a "twin," though not of the kind you're probably imagining, and they have some badass (I think :P) working together moments! Anyway, if you want, totally check it out, it would make my day!

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

** I can't remember the name but there is one heartbreaking story where Harry sacrifices himself, and becomes a spy for the Order. Dumbles is part of this op and so is Moody but both a dead by the start of the story. The key thing I remember about it is the two finger flick. If anyone remembers the name, I'm sure it would go down well (kinda).

*** linkffn(The Double Agent) There is a finger flick in this, and Harry was a spy. However, Alastor Moody isn't in this.

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.
