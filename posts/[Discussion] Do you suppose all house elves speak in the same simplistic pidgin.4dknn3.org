I was wondering, I mean is it only that the ones we interact with most come from household where their subservience and labour was prized and little else? We are told house elves breed as permitted by their masters - do you think there were other households/family lines which valued other traits (like intelligence, or height, or skin tone or whatever) and bred selectively to that end? Were there households who educated their elves?


** I am going to take this question very seriously because I was just learning about pidgins and creoles in a language contact class (I'm a linguistics major), and immediately thought of house elves cuz I'm a big geek.

First of all the answers to the questions in the body of your post will not answer the question in the title of your post. The reason (very simply and without getting into much detail) that pidgins emerge is because of two groups who do not speak the same language must find a language that they can both communicate in. Often times the subordinate group actually come from many different places and speak many different languages such that they also must find a way to communicate with each other.

So if we're thinking of the Atlantic slave trade, you have many groups of africans being enslaved, and then white English speaker enslavers (just focusing on English based pidgins and creoles for the moment though of course other, mostly European languages were the superstratum). The African languages are the substratum language, and the English is the superstratum language. The English speaking slavers simplify their own language (think how you talk to foreigners), and this simplified version is also heavily affected by the substratum languages(s) as the slaves use this simplified version to communicate both with the slavers and each other.

So that's a very simplistic overview of how pidgins emerge. I have not done the subject justice, and to be honest I am not an expert on pidgins and creoles though I am getting more into it.

As you can see, pidgins crucially involve more than one language. It would be interesting to think that house elves might have had a "native" language, but once, as a race, they became enslaved, a pidgin emerged and then became their dominant (if not only!) language (this is a process called creolization; a pidgin becomes a creole when it becomes the native language of the community, without widespread balanced bilingualism). In this case, yes, I would think that the house elves speak a creole.

I don't know if that's exactly what JK Rowling intended, but I think it's clear that with the house elves' speech she is drawing parallels to the Atlantic slave trade, and English based creoles that developed as a result. Linguistically, Dobby's speech does share some similarities to English based creoles, but I'll admit that I haven't done a full analysis (though I intend to at some point).

I think what's important is to understand that pidgins and creoles have nothing to do with intelligence. People who speak these languages (yes, languages!) are not unintelligent. Slaves were not unintelligent. Also, it has nothing to do with level of education; you could become literate and educated in a creole. It is a full fledged language (pidgins less so). You can communicate just as effectively speaking a creole.

*** Thank you for your brilliant answer. You're the perfect person to help me understand.

I didn't mean to imply that the pidgin English utilised signified a lack of intelligence - there are actually several ideas all mashed together in this question and I didn't mean to equate my questions about traits resulting from selective breeding and linguistic development as sharing a causation.

I think the word of "god" is house elves are derived from kebolds who were caught and domesticated. I'm not sure what that means in terms of their native language.

Would there be elves who assimilated and picked up human language more easily than their fellows? Would their descendants therefore likely /not/ speak the same pidgin creole or patois but instead a closer approximation of standard English/French/Spanish/Klingon? Is it just that we didn't encounter them in canon?

**** Ok cool yeah I just wanted to clear that up because it actually is a huge misconception about pidgins and creoles.

What is critical here is not a human vs non human language, rather two different languages. What I mean is, in the real world only humans have actual languages (as opposed to communication systems, which animals do have, and complex ones at that). Also only humans can truly acquire a language (let's ignore the primates being taught sign language for a moment, to simplify my point). Therefore, we must assume that house elves (and centaurs, and goblins etc) are humanoid enough so that they are able to acquire and speak a natural human language. Therefore the issue becomes when kebolds' language meets English (or in other countries other non house elf languages) what happens?

We can then imagine that the kebolds that were not caught and exploited for human servitude remained with their native tongue. Among what became house elves developed a pidgin, for the necessity of communicating with wizards, and then developed into a creole, as the house elves ceased to use and pass to their children the original kebolds language.

Through this, though, the house elves are exposed to standard English. Now we have something called the creole continuum. While not everyone agrees with these categories and their implications, roughly we have three levels of variation within the creole continuum: basilect, mesolects, and acrolects. Basilects are varieties that are least like the superstratum (in this case English). Note I don't say that it's closest to the substratum (original kebolds language) because many different processes are involved in how creoles emerge. Then we have the acrolect which would be the variety that is closest to standard English. In between there can be many mesolects; different variations that are either closer or further away from English.

Your question pertains to this continuum; the house elves would speak the /same/ creole, just different variations of it. It is crucial, however, to understand that the goal of a creole is not to approximate the superstratum language. Acrolects can emerge because there is often close contact between the superstratum and the creole (but not always!). This would be the case with the house elves, especially as time goes on. In fact, house elf speech in HP seems very acrolectal, and it could be that it has converged with English to the point that it is just another dialect of English. Note that you can actually understand 100% of what Dobby is saying, even if you recognize that he speaks differently than standard. This process is called decreolization

In fact, there are many linguists who posit that African American Vernacular English (AAVE), a dialect of American English, derived from a creole, and is now (obviously) decreolized. (in case you're curious, the other popular theory posits that AAVE derives from DIALECT contact between the slaves and the slavers who spoke vastly different dialects of English).

Anyway, your hypothesis is probably correct; if a wizard was interested in their house elf's education, then perhaps that house elf would speak a more standard English. However, it depends also at what age they come to the family. Are they raised in like house elf training centers until adults and then sold? Or are they born into families?

If you still have questions regarding the linguistics side of things then maybe we should repost to [[/r/linguistics]]?

**** Just another quick thing. If we're talking about the creole continuum, then it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine a difference between Hogwarts house elves and personal family house elves. Hogwarts house elves mostly talk amongst themselves, and therefore it would make sense if their variety is more meso- or basilectal than personal family house elves

Definitely. It's true that a more educated elf would be more likely to speak Standard English, but that's only because the education process itself involves teaching them standard English. If there were textbooks written in Creole (like you can see in Haiti), there's no reason an elf couldn't become super educated in Creole only.

In fact IIRC there was a push in Jamaica a while ago to introduce Patois-medium schools that taught English as a foreign language (as opposed to being entirely in English).

**** Exactly. Unfortunately the norm in the post-colonial world is for education to be only in the standard language/dialect, but it definitely doesn't have to be so.

Although I'm not sure that an educated house elf would necessarily speak a more standard english. It could be that norms of use developed in that " 'tis the mark of a house elf" to speak in the non-standard lect to their master. Like it could be that they have the competence to speak in standard english, but it's considered disobedient to speak it. I don't know if such a thing is attested historically in (real world) human languages, but I really would not be surprised if so.

The issue I see here is that our one data point (Dobby) doesn't speak Standard English after he's freed (he doesn't even try), making me think that House Elves simply don't care about learning Standard English since it's not like they're judges because they can't. Then again, Dobby may not be the best data point though.

I forget the technical term but in certain communities women actually conciously modify their speech around their husbands because using certain words is considered disrespectful. I don't know if they ever vary grammatical structures, but it's something at least.

****** We also have Kreacher and his syntax and mode of speech is similar - although his familial background and environment were also similar to Dobby's. It would have been handy to have a broader cross section than Dobby, Winky and Kreacher. All of whom grew up in traditional pureblood households.

*** Kind of an intriguing question. If you ordered your house-elf to speak German, would they suddenly know the language? I don't know that we know what happens when a house elf is ordered to do something that is impossible (or at least not possible instantaneously) to them.

Perhaps that's why Kreacher is such a grump. Ordered to do a task that he is unable to complete.

** I think it's an argument of nature vs. nurture. You are not born knowing a language, rather you pick up on what's spoken in your environment.

Therefore, how a house-elf speaks will depend on the house they were raised in. As most pureblood families treat their elves as slaves, they would not be concerned with their education. They would only learn language from their fellow house-elves in servitude to the family. Thus, the form of English we see Dobby speaking. He was taught by other Malfoy elves who have all lived in an abusive environment that does not see elves to be worthy of anything, nevermind education and intelligence.

I think I know why you asked this question, so I will pose a question back to you. If a "good" owner took over ownership of an elf and instilled values of intelligence, family, etc. - would that make up for a lifetime of servitude to an abusive family and conditioning to be a slave and have low self-worth? House-elves from the Black, Malfoy, Prince, etc. families would be conditioned by their time serving family members who believed in blood purity as well. Can you just flip a switch when a new master with different politics takes over the family? See Kreacher as an example of this in the Black family.

Further, what is the life span of a house-elf? Do they age differently than wizards/humans? Do we know how old Dobby was? In some ways, he seems almost childlike.

*** You're right about why I'm asking Bri.

I've taken the extended writing on House Elves to suggest their family lines parallel the families they serve, so the house elf in question would have been raised and served in the matrilineal line of my MC. I've a particular notion of them and what they value which I think will give me a little latitude. Especially given what [[/u/Vorham][u/Vorham]] has said regarding linguistics

**** Not sure if you are intentionally not saying who the main character (and their family) is... but I suppose I'm a bit confused since my understanding of the family was that it supported the blood purity ideals. Which leads me to think they would look down on house elves. Perhaps that's an unfair assumption. Can you explain what you think they value?

** It's not actually all that simplistic. Dobby only speaks in the third person, while retaining most grammatical structures that English possesses. Winky simply uses a continuative present-tense structure for every verb phrase, and uses "is" for not only 3s but 1s/2s/1p/2p/3p as well, but similarly retains most grammatical structures. The rest of it is Buffy-speak and coining words for things they don't know the name of.

[[/u/vonham]] explained the rest of it well.
