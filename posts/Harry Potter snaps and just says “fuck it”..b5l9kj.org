Eg when he chases Bellatrix in the ministry and gets mocked for not casting the crucio curse right he takes her advice and tries again. Or when he just says ‘fuck this shit imma do this my way and my way involves a lot of dead bodies'.


** Isn't Harry snapping and going his own way the premise of every Indy!Harry fic ever?

It's usually paired with Harry going "grey", refusing to go back to Privet Drive during the summer, demanding his Gringotts key back, and changing his name to Lord Hadrian.

******* Is it canon that Dumbledore was blocking them? Why would they need to enforce the statute? From what I remember it wasn't a huge disaster or anything, Britain was able to deal with it easily on their own. I could be mistaken though.

There's no indication that other nations do have comparable wizards. Nobody was able to stand up to Grindelwald other than Dumbledore, and Voldemort is constantly touted as one of the most powerful Dark Lords of all time. Not to mention that nobody else knows about his horcruxes - their existence, how many (or even that there's more than one), what and where they are. That would be more than a bit of a problem. Though I suppose Harry could send a letter or something if he leaves after he becomes aware of them.

Even if the ICW does decide to unite and step in, Britain still falls, and there's still a bloody war. It's just more likely to be Voldemort defending Britain instead of him attacking others.

******** It is personal headcanon based on Dumbledore's anti-statute past. He would have used his myriad positions to prevent the ICW from stepping in or marshaling forces because they would have been brutal in accomplishing what was needed, as would have been seen throughout history in places like sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere that probably wouldn't have adopted the statute willingly.

The way I see it, Yes the statute would need to be enforced as Voldemort and his forces moved to either kill or control the nonmagical population. The enforcement of the statute is the core of the ICW's purpose and the core behind the magical governments.

We also only see the story from Harry Perspective and he doesn't really get out much. There should be other people at that level elsewhere in the world unless Britian has something in the water. Futhermore, Grindelwald had the elder wand. I very much doubt Dumbeldore actually beat him in a duel. Far more likely is that he seduced Grindelwald and then stole the wand. The duel that followed is the one everyone knows or the duel was an illusion/fabrication Dumbledore created to cement is status after the war and hide the nature of the wand.

I agree it will be bloody, no they wouldn't necessarily know about the Horcruxes off the bat, though the return of a defeated Dark Lord is sure to set off some warning flags.

** As several other commenters have already indicated, this genre usually leads to those garbage ”Harry going grey, refusing to go back to Privet Drive during the summer, demanding his Gringotts key back, and changing his name to Lord Hadrian” and “Harry goes on to be a 13 year old powerhouse politician with 18 wives and 24 titles” fics.

There are exceptions though, and protagonists don't always have to be Harry. For example:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster][A Crime Fitting the Punishment or Dumbledore's Monster]], linkffn(8854828): Harry only snapped many years after the war when they murdered his family. But then he systematically massacred Wizarding Britain's establishment. Once done, he time travelled back to Year 5 and massacred his enemies again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016): Both Hermione and Ron left Harry on the Horcrux Hunt. They were soon brutally murdered. Harry waged a lone campaign against Voldemort for several years until he freed Daphne Greengrass. This is one of the few H/D fics I like as is does not have that Ice Queen of Slytherin nonsense.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755544/1/Bowling-For-Hogwarts][Bowling For Hogwarts]], linkffn(10755544): Neville couldn't take the bullying anymore and carried out a massacre at Hogwarts. The title is a tribute to Michael Moore's [[https://www.google.com/search?q=bowling+for+columbine&oq=bowling+for+&aqs=chrome.1.0l2j69i60j69i57j69i60l2.3671j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8][Bowling for Columbine]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): AU after Year 4. Umbridge directed her maliciousness at Muggleborn students instead of Harry. Hermione snapped and would become a very efficient killer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Again, Harry had it enough after the war when the Ministry and Wizengamot turned out to be incorrigible. One of the most popular fics on this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]], linkffn(5265558): Instead of acting out, he, Hermione, Sirius, and the Grangers all fled Magical Britain and left Dumbledore to deal with the mess. Dumbledore had to no choice but to step up his own game.

**** Ron is very OOC in that fic though and his bashing just goes way over the top. I honestly don't understand where the trope of chauvinistic/misogynist Ron comes from. Throughout the series, he's one of the very few who does not get intimidated by Hermione's intelligence, but actually welcomes it.

Hermione is also damn OOC in this one. I highly doubt a radical one like her would ever put up with the shit of that postwar Ministry. It's the same failed characterizations of her in those marriage law fics.

This fic also goes all out into 'give every Death Eater a second chance' Dumbledore trope. We just had a long thread two days ago denouncing the very same thing.

Both this fic and "The Sum of Their Parts" have quite similar premises in that Harry fights a still malicious postwar Ministry, but "The Sum" is much more superior:

- Characterizations. Not only does the Trio stay true to their canon characterizations, Neville, George, Susan, and Dean all have their bright moments.
- This Harry doesn't wait X years until the bad guys killed off his family. He strikes out only three months after the Battle of Hogwarts, when the Ministry finally worn down his patience with its malicious policies.
- The overall, slightly melancholic, tone of this fic is very compelling. Trio interactions are a really bright spot.
- The plot, the depictions of magic, and attention to details.
