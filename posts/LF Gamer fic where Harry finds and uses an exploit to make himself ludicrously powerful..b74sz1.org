You know that one trick in Skyrim where you wear apparel of Fortify Alchemy, then brew and drink a potion of Fortify Restoration, then de-equip>re-equip your Fortify Alchemy gear so it's boosted by the Fortify Restoration (since Fortify Skill is a restoration effect) then brew a stronger potion of Fortify Restoration, then de-equip/re-equip, make a stronger potion, et-cetera et-cetera, until you can make ludicrously powerful potions and use that to make +10000% potions of enchanting that you can use to make gear that makes all your spells free to cast and your weapons do zillions of damage?

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

** Anything with save scumming.

Like limited resources with chance to skill up,

save - >craft, fail? Reload, skill up? Save again.

Work with anything involving rng like gamble, crits, drops, etc.

I remember a fanfic with infinite levels with int increasing exp gain, dump all to int and go to town. Not sure if it was hp though.

  Hermione dies to a surprise attack just before walking off into the sunset and wakes up to find out that her life up until now has been a video game or at least that's what all of the signs are pointing to. This is her attempt to play through the game as other characters so that she can try to get brought back to life.

** This is the premise of a short recursive fanfic of HPMoR: linkffn(Nothing Left But Fire).

However, HPMoR itself is not short at all, and is pretty much required reading in order to understand it. And opinions about it are sharply divided. The quality of the prose is well above average, and the story is complex and thought-provoking and funny, but a lot of people hate the protagonist and the author tracts.
