For the live of me I can't remember the name of that one fic, it began in 3rd book in diagon Alley, Luna showed Harry that Ron and Hermione were being paid for being Harry's friends.


** That lowers the search to hundreds of fics

*** I specifically remember that Harry crashed into Luna on the stairs, and then she said that Ron and Hermione were isolating Harry by insulting people that were trying to become friends with him

** I don't remember the name but I dropped something very similar the second it started getting "lemonish", because, you know, they're second and third years.
