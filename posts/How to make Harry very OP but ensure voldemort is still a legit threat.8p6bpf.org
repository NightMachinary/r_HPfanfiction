I want Harry to fight the entire Auror department and all the death eaters at once. And have another fight with Dumbledore, voldemort and griendalwald at the same time near the end. The only one I want to power up is Harry. Everybody will remain same as canon.

Here is the problem. I want to ensure that Voldemort is still a major threat to Harry in a one on one fight without him becoming stronger. And not due to the twin cores or the horcrux.

Is it even remotely possible? Thanks


** You can't. Those of Voldemort and Dumbledore's level can fight off tons of Wizards with little effort, but all the Death Eaters and the entire Auror force is just silly for Harry, even when OP. Especially if Amelia Bones counts (head of DMLE), who in canon was powerful enough that Voldemort had to "expend considerable effort" to kill her.

If Harry is already at this level, it cannot be done without doing some idiot ball stuff, i.e. bad writing. He'd be on their level, there's no room to grow without being silly. At that point, all you could do is make Voldemort even stronger than in canon, which defeats the point of making Harry so OP.

My suggestion (if giving it isn't out of place) is to just weaken Harry. I don't know anything about your story but having him OP (unless it's the story premise) seems boring. If you make him generously strong (near Bellatrix's level; she's very powerful) then at least there's real room to grow as opposed to "my magical core got a boost!"

**** How to handle this:

1. Make Harry suffer ie make him getting that powerful take effort and sacrifice maybe have him stumble on a book of rituals in the Black Library which making him better able to hold his own vs his enemies but that power doesn't come without a cost. Have it start small like he gives his ability to feel a negative emotion like envy or anger but it isn't enough so he starts sacrificing his more vital and positive emotions like joy, empathy, love, happiness.
2. Make Harry suffer more. Put him in a relationship and then break them up because he spends all his time training and makes no time to be with his partner and do things they enjoy.
3. Make Harry be wrong have him attack someone he shouldn't be over the top about it and suffer for it. JKR tried to do this in book 6 but it failed because we knew that Draco was up to no good. Instead have him attack someone more sympathetic because he thinks they are helping his enemies but he is wrong. This will then allow the story to go one of two ways Harry gets help and realizes that power isn't everything or he pushes everyone away burns his last bridges and the Wizarding world along with them.

***** Point 2 seems like a silly token to me. Having his GF dump him for trying to kill magical Hitler seems petty. "Oh, you saved the world. But what have you done for me lately?"

And having more teenage drama doesn't make Voldemort a more credible threat. If anything it makes him appear weaker because we've got time for such trivialities (instead of Voldemort's latest murder spree).

****** I don't mean on that level I mean have Harry obsessed with getting more like how he was in book 6 but with actual results but that is what he does every spare moment it should be portrayed as unhealthy and when people try to help him he should react badly.

This isn't about making Voldemort more threatening it is about making the story more interesting first. You make Voldemort interesting by have Harry use power as a crutch while Voldemort finds ways to go after vulnerable friends or trap an overconfident Harry.

******** Again Harry would not be portrayed as going through magic special forces training he would spend his time learning dangerous dark magic and using rituals to boost his power. And we should see the consequences of that as Harry sleeps less, gets increasingly short with his friends, and in class Harry bypasses skill and technique in favor of just forcing his magic to accomplish the task. And then to drive the point home one of his friends should be kidnapped and Harry gets to come to the realization that he missed the signs leading up to it, didn't even realize it happened until much later, and when he goes to save the kidnapped victim he ends up exhausting himself because he has been relying on pure strength and not honing his skill and technique.

Harry should not be doing regular coursework if he wants to focus on the "more dangerous" Voldemort. Half of the classes have little to none combat applications and OP wants an OP!Harry, something he won't get through Binns. Honestly, a civil war story and boarding school drama do not mix well.

I don't think this works, it opens up questions like "Why didn't the Black family do this?" The house of Black were very arrogant and seemed prone to madness; if they could chunk emotions to gain power they'd have already done so and ruled Wizarding UK before Voldemort was conceived.

** Voldemort, in canon (or fanon, I forget sometimes), is supposed to be an incredibly powerful Legilimens, so much so that Snape being able to fool the Dark Lord is considered evidence of him being an incredibly skilled Occlumens. One of my personal pet peeves regarding the original seven films is how little they explored mind magic (despite stating the Voldemort was a world class Legilimens), and one of the main reasons I like the new films is because of Queenie, and how they use her to explore what being a powerful Legilimens would mean.

So I would love if your fic made Voldemort threatening, by really exploring what Voldemort's innate mastery of mind reading means.

Queenie, in the new film, is a mind reader, capable of easily and effortlessly hearing the thoughts of others. Voldemort should, at least, be able to do this, and much, much more. Make mind magic more central to his character. Grindlewalt became a Dark Lord because of his power, and because the Elder Wand only amplified that. Voldemort, starting out, didn't have an Elder Wand to make him unbeatable. Make the reason Voldemort is such a terrifying foe be his mind magic, and you have a way to have him reasonably threaten Harry without actually giving him a straight forward 'power up'. There's already so many 'psychic' spells in canon that a Dark Lord with a talent for using them would already be pretty terrifying.

Harry wants to use an incredibly powerful spell he knows? Voldemort is reading his mind, and manages to hit him with a tactical Obliviate so small and targeted it slips past his shields, deleting the wording of the spell from his memory. Harry is taking aim to snipe Voldemort from the shadows? Nope, can't be done, Voldemort can hear your thoughts and knows where you are. His organization can't be spied on (with the exception of Snape, who becomes even more valuable to the Order, letting him get away with being even more of a asshole). Voldemort is an expert of intimidation, persuasion, and torture. Duel Voldemort for too long, and he leaves knowing all of your secrets, long term plans, etc...

Essentially, make Voldemort threatening to an OP Harry, by making him more specialized in mind magic. Make him the Dark Lord that was so obsessed with the Elder Wand because he actually needed it to expand his power in other areas.

And this way a four way fight between Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindlewalt and Harry could be more interesting, because Voldemort would fight in a way unique to him, instead of just blasting supercharged spells everywhere like the rest.

*** Brilliant idea building on this. Dumbledore knows the implications of this, and uses his pensive to store memories that would be dangerous for the dark lord to find out, possibly even implant fake ones. Cold war spycraft levels of standard protocols and procedures, letting him be combat capable without necessarily knowing anything more than what he needs to win the day. Voldemort not only can't beat him, he can't learn anything from fighting him, hence the constant avoidance. It would also explain the casual insanity and spontaneity.

***** Glad you enjoyed it! Feel absolutely free to use this if you want to take a shot at writing anything from this.

I really love worldbuilding in fanfiction by scaling up one person, and then walking through the game theory of how it would change everything else. Here, the rules of engagement change because the assumption is that Voldemort will be inside your mind. And to expand further, Voldemort will get absolutely blindsided by Snape's betrayal, his entire paradigm is that he knows everything his subordinates know with absolute certainty. Similarly, Dumbledore can be outmaneuvered by increasing the complexity of the conflict to the point where he has to know too much to make the right decision, giving up the entire war effort. The ideal counter to Voldemort then becomes a small group of highly skilled improvisers souped up on Felix Felics (and/or any other available means of increasing luck), trained to reduce the time of each mental decision to maximize the luck potion.

Or, he could be completely emotionless (heh, soulless), not feeling panic or doubt, not being disturbed in the slightest by an ambush, not pausing to consider if a certain spell is a good idea, and otherwise never letting up due to indecision, second-guessing himself, or concern for collateral damage.

Or the other way around, make him completely psycho, emotionally volatile; uncontrolled magic explodes out of him after every spell, magnifying his curses, sowing chaos upon the battlefield, and his rage gives rise to completely unpredictable magical effects.

Another possibility; give Voldemort a signature spell that he's an absolute monster with. Maybe his Avada Kedavra can pierce physical barriers and curve to hit living creatures, so that the Dark Lord can announce himself by firing a killing curse straight through Hogwarts. Maybe he can conjure up a freezing blizzard, turning any battle with him into a natural disaster. Or maybe Serpensortia, conjuring and transfiguring snakes from everything in his vicinity, transfiguring opposing Aurors into giant serpents that turn on their allies.

** The only way to pull off an OP harry story that I can think of is that if he is *not* the main character. He shows up already powerful in the story with some motivation beyond what is shown in canon.

In fact, I can think of what I find to be a great example of exactly what you described in this fic linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB).

I won't spoil too much, but in the FIRST CHAPTER, Harry defeats almost all the staff at Hogwarts, a contingent of aurors, and most of the older Hogwarts students. He duels Dumbledore on nearly equal footing on several occasions (Harry is like 80% where Dumbledore is 100%). He uses incredible magics that I can barely articulate properly because of the beautiful descriptions, but some examples include: creating a black hole that sucks out the flames from fireplaces to stop flooing away, summons blades that seem to tear through the dimension, inverts the gravity in an entire room, and creates centipedes of liquid mercury. Seriously, this is a great example as I see it of what you are looking for.

Hope this helps.
