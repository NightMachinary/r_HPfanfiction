** Uh, immediately break the fuck up with her and probably memory wipe her for good measure. And myself. Life goes on.

** It honestly depends. If it's as a teacher/student relationship, break the fuck up.

If it's a time travel, same age thing, I need more info. Do I just wake up as Snape or do I have all the memories and emotions that Snape had till that point in life? And most importantly, is it a healthy relationship?

** Half my age and seven. Probably obliviate her, then myself, and /pray/ word of the relationship never got out.

Probably find a way to sic Rita Skeeter on Umbrige, because I'd /really/ need a distraction besides grading.

** What everyone else said, besides I would grow a mustache and go to my class without addressing it. Then, I would show to owls in Bermuda shorts but with a mean enough frown as to keep people from asking questions

** Shave, shower, see a dentist, see a mindhealer, sign up for teacher training, apologise to everyone I've trained starting with Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom, sell Spinners End house and pay as much compensation to victims of the death eaters as I can.

** If I woke up as Snape, regardless of what was happening, and somehow discovered the situation would end when I next woke up, I'd do Hogwarts and indeed the whole og magical Britain a massive favour, and commit myself to the Psychological ward at St. Mungos, demanding they never let me go.
