From this story, linkao3(The Very Best by BrilliantLady), comes this wonderful theory which is probably my favorite explanation of why the Food Exception to Gamp's Law exists.

#+begin_quote
  Professor McGonagall's explanation about the “five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration” and how you couldn't transfigure things into edible food was interesting, but still didn't answer his questions. Because apparently you could make water, wine, and other liquids out of thin air -- even sauces! You could make drinkable liquids but not edible solids, and you could expand food in size but not create it from scratch -- it just didn't make sense.

  Harry thought that perhaps people just didn't want to totally ruin the economy. Odds were that the people who convinced everyone these “laws” were true, and probably banned all food-creating spells, had some kind of agenda. The Dursleys had told him all sorts of stupid lies simply to make their own lives easier -- adults lied all the time.

  In the musty stacks of the Hogwarts library Harry spent hours digging through dusty old tomes, looking up the wizard who'd first come up with the “Five Principal Exceptions” centuries ago. It turned out he'd been the pure-blood owner of extensive farms and also three restaurants in the wizarding districts, and he was a former Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. He and other “magical theorists” had convinced society so well that food created by magic would be non-nutritious and harmful to you, and that the spells to do so went dangerously wrong far too often, that everyone started believing them. Wizards and witches stopped casting the spells to make food, or when they did, the results were flawed or unimpressive. Without belief and a drive to succeed, magic didn't work so well.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.

** There's the one in... I think it was Lady Archimedes, where if you assume that Transfigurations are temporary, food is an exception because you /can/ probably Transfigure it if you're really good, but it'll eventually turn back, which makes it dangerous because it might turn back to wood or glass or whatever while ingested.

******* Good point, but it's possible to muck about with the magic system to close that plot-hole. We know you can't /Accio/ a human being, not without a tremendous amount of magical skill anyway; so I propose that living beings' inherent magic interferes with attempts to Summon them. This makes summoning an animal very difficult, summoning a Muggle near-impossible, and summoning a wizard right out of the question. Now, if we accept this prior, we also know that it's harder to Summon an object out of some abstract concept than if you've got a very good idea what the object is like, and, ideally, the general area in which it is. So between the "living creature" block and the "'fish' is pretty vague" block, /Accio Fish/ would presumably be something Dumbledore could do, but not a teenager.

** Eh, isn't this kinda the same thing fans have suggested for ages? Like how you can't transfigure gold presumably (although silver apparently works) to prevent economic issues. Seems unlikely anyone would just drop it, kids in particular would probably have figured out that it worked long ago since they try all sorts of things people say are impossible.

I think it's more likely that the inability to conjure good food from thin air has to do with the complexity of the living things the food comes from. Perhaps if they had a better (i.e. scientific) understanding of living things they might be able to.

**** I don't think so. Conjurations are less an issue since (with the apparent exception of the hand Voldemort conjured for Pettigrew) all conjurations fade away after a little while. Transfiguration in general though does present a problem. But then, now that I think about it, how much does the wizarding economy even depend on those materials? Most products seem to priced based on how, er, magical they are as opposed to the materials making it up (best example would be goblin-enchanted silver being more valuable than normal silver). Can't really transfigure an enchantment into something, you have to charm it.

************ Far more ridiculous is the idea that a government full of wizards and witches with magic cannot track down a single, ordinary wizard who is wrecking their economy with the little amount of gold the could get from the muggle world. There's literally no way that would work, people are too fallible to get away with it for long, especially against motivated people with magic. You cannot stay completely hidden from everyone. Even with the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry was discovered in DH when he entered Hogsmeade, so no one short of a Voldemort or Dumbledore would have a chance at pulling this off for more than a few days.

Besides, as I said, gold isn't currency in HP, minted galleons are. Goblins aren't going to take in a bunch of material and mint them if it's going to break their place in the economy.

************* The Wizarding world is really tiny, the amount of gold available to a wizard in the Muggle world is probably around a few tens of tonnes at the least. If you buy slowly and hang on to it, it shouldn't be spotted, considering the manipulations of various governments on this market.\\
Anonymity is the crucial point here, there are spies and undercover agents in canon. I refuse to believe they're all on the level of Voldemort and Dumbledore, and lots of them were never spotted. So they can't find you outright. As all the plan can be done by one wizard alone and a few mind-controlled Muggles, there are no risks of traitors either. The distribution part could probably be done within just a few days or less, this is the only part where you do something that might get you spotted. Before that part, good luck figuring out what's going on anyway, if you indeed attract attention.\\
Gold isn't the currency of the Wizarding world, it doesn't mean you can't break the economy with it. You're attacking the market, not the currency. Probably less disruptive, but it doesn't mean it wouldn't be.

Then, there's the little part you forget where the ministry is canonically incompetent to an extraordinary point. If the Goblins find out something's going on, there are chances they'll just wait for you to come cash in your gold in the only bank of the wizarding world, which they happen to control. Because this is the cheapest efficient way to react to this kind of things. That someone is trying to derail the entire economy rather than simply acting on greed is something they'll never think of considering their Canon personality.

So dangerous? Probably. But certainly not as much as you think.

** This explanation hinges on the belief in a law, within a system of magic: this mean shared education and culture. For all we know, the exceptions to Gamp Law are universal across human cultures at least : this means that it hinges on the notion of humanity.\\
The law exceptions exists, because they points to our limits as human beings (goblins and Veela probably included); Voldemort trying to not die is stretching the definition of human quite a bit (some would doubt he is human anymore), but he still do not die instead of coming back; Flamel seems to be able to create money (although we don't know how much work is needed), but he does not try to do anything with it as far as we know.\\
The limits reagarding what can be done with magic are not limits of Magic, they are a limit of magicians. Soft ones (Dumbledore in his NEWT breaks some) who allows to know who got the biggest wand, and hard ones (Food, Money, Death,...) that defines us on a fundamental level.
