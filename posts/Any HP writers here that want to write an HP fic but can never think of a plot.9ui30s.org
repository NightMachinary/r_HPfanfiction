This is an issue I have only when writing HP fanfiction, and it's that I can never think of what to write. How does everyone here figure out their plot? All I ever usually know is that I want to write an SI or SI-OC (or just OC), but I can never really think of where it goes from there.


** .....I just think of what ifs... and go with them. Then I write out a plot detailing each chapter. Then I write the story over a period of time and begin posting it. I have a lot of ideas I guess, but I have to stop myself from starting new stories every time and continue the ones that I have.

** Hey, that's the opposite of my problem. I have a few (pretty original and well thought out) plot lines, but my English is lacking since it is not my first language.

Why don't you think of your OC and what kind of person you would want them to be and then think of how you could show (! not explain or tell !) the reader their personality.

** So I had the concept for a Harry as a werewolf raised in the states by Remus story right, LinkFFN(Wolf Lord)

Once I had that setting I asked, now what happens. Why does he wind up at Hogwarts, where does he go, who does he interact with.

I also have certain scenes I expect to tell, some already written.

Mass scale tranfiguring an army in the First Task A showdown with Fenrir Greyback in 1997/8 A compotent Peter Pettigrew

And such. I also have how I want magic to be bound, and great geopolitics of the magical world all in my head that I want to share through steady reveal.

IE - SubSaharan Africa was no down with the Statute of Secrecy but was violently supressed/conquered and forced to adhere. Then rebelled and tried to throw it off as Europe was drawn into war with Grindelwald and the aftermath of all that.

Once you have some stuff like that it is just a matter of stringing it together. How you do that is up to you. Also consider, as your characters develop they might do something you never expected. Accept it and see where that leads. Don't try to force them to be someone they aren't just for a plot point. Change it and see where it goes.

You have an SI/OC, okay where are they from Do they know the story What track will they take What do they have access to upon appearance in the HP world What year is it Is it following cannon or is the world slightly different Dumbledore? Work with, trust, don't trust There of their own volition or as a result of a magical accident Magical or no-magical If going to Hoggy Hogwarts What House What Friends What Classes/performance/specialty witll they have/develop What are their flaws? What limitations are there on them? Super powerful- unmatched characters are boring unless their power itself becomes a problem or it is a humor/crackfic If the foes is equally powerful it can work out.

** I had only the most nebulous of ideas for a plot when I wrote my first chapter, and by the end of chapter three I had it 90% figured out. Try diving in and see where your brain takes you. I've found that at least half my ideas/inspiration spring up as I'm in the act of writing a scene.

** Characters plus situation makes plot. Put the characters in a situation, write down what happens, what they say, how it all looks, sounds, smells as it happens. If you run out of plot, add a new character or a new situation. Practice long enough and eventually you also have a story, although before then you probably have a bunch of rambling beginnings that go nowhere.

Alternately, decide on an end you like, and ask what would have to happen to get there, and who would need to be involved?

In my experience, if you daydream before you sleep, it helps. Also, I personally can't plot at all unless I've eaten recently and had enough sleep.

** I typically have a plot, but am super bad at writing. Like I have this bomb idea where Harry has a pretty good time at school until 5th year where we find out the stone is in the castle, Riddle releases the Basilisk to cause chaos and Harry has to stop both in 1 night. In His 6th year, he is entered into the tournament. 7th year is a mild horocrux hunt with Dumbledore that ends with the latters death and Harry's appointment to the DADA position.

Some post school years where Harry is leading an Order like group to oppose Voldemort.

** I have the opposite problem. I've got so many plots that I'll never be able to write them all.

I used to have this problem though - I'd have an idea for a scene or a character, but no plot to out them in and you know what cured me? TVtropes.

Seriously, if you're just starting out, TVtropes is a wonderful resource.

** I just want more battle school fictions, honestly. Think Triwizard Tournament but on steroids. The only things I've only seen even come close are Hogwarts Battle School, HPMOR, and Jbern's The Lie I've lived.

As far as I'm concerned you can't go wrong if you write a good battle school story.

** I have trouble nailing my vague plot ideas down into actually writable things. I also go through regular phases of self doubt that I'm not bringing anything new to the table.

By the first, I mean that I know what themes I want to explore, and I have an extremely rough 7 year timeline which I've nailed against Alchemical theory... but trying to get down to what actually happens in more detail and when is trickier. Part of the issue is the second thing, that I want the way my story goes to have something new and interesting.

#+end_quote

You read stuff and then think something along the lines "I can do that better" or "You know, it would have been awesome if X happened at this point instead of Q".

It can be stupid ideas like "What if Hermione was stuck at the Order HQ early in the summer and ran into Tonks? Well, the obvious solution is fast food from Germany, teasing and a date", semi-serious stuff like "Pansy wants to get out of a marriage contract through a loophole but ends up married to Harry instead" or even completely serious stuff like "I want a Harry gets adopted story without the usual suspects or Harry banging his mother/sister figure. Family feels for days."
