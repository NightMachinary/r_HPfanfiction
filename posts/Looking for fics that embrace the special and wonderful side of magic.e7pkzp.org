brought to you by the fact I have the frozen 2 soundtrack stuck in my head and want to read something that feels magical in the same way

edit: since that's a super unclear request, I'll try to explain more. Books that play with the wild side of magic, or just the beauty of it. I feel like a lot of fics sometimes make magic almost mundane because of all the rules.


** what's her name in hufflepuff perhaps?

I want recs like this too

*** Well, I haven't heard any Frozen soundtrack (apart from that one [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOaqiCBum2w][parody]]), but The Reclamation of Black Magic has some rituals and stuff and a coven of witches. It's rated M, if it matters to anyone.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
