I am looking for a story where Harry uses wandless magic and a walking stick because his knee is injured. He lives for a while in a cave where he practices magic. I think that in the course of the story he manages to enchant the Ministry building to return peoples belongings to them by the items walking.

This is all i remember form the story, i may have mixed some things for different fanfictions, but i am pretty sure this is some of what happens in the story.

Thanks for all your help.


** I used to be an Auror like you. Then I took a Reducto in the knee... ^{^{^{sorry}}}

*** Thank you. Yeah, i was mixing different stories, you gave one of them that i really wanted to read.

The other one i think is where he was bitten by some rare spider while in bed but do to the venom of the spider he lost some mobility in the leg. I also think that in this one he teaches the DA in the ROR about how pronunciation is meaningless by using different word for light (lumos). I cant really remember much from it and would like to read it again if you have a link?
