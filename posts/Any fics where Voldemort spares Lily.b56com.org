Are there any good fics where Voldemort follows through on his promise to spare Lily?

I suppose that canonically that would mean Harry dies because a father's love isn't good enough, but I'd prefer if he lives somehow. Either way is fine though.

** linkffn(Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here) has this premise. Voldemort spares Lily but kills Harry.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world by ruled the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James. COMPLETE

*** I don't remember any mention of James' sacrifice forming a powerful magic love protection, do you?

It was mostly a joke/sarcasm though.

Actually, using his death would work really well as a near canon way of saving Harry without having Lily die.

**** I think it depends on the specifics of how Voldemort killed James. In my mind, I always thought that James was caught flat-footed when Voldemort came blasting his way into their home, with only enough time to call out his warning to Lily before being felled by the Killing Curse.

***** Eh. He knew Voldemort was coming and declared his intent to fight him and not back down or run away.

I suppose you could say that's different enough, but I don't think it's sufficient to be the difference between granting their son nigh total invulnerability to Voldemort's magic and doing nothing whatsoever.

Though James didn't have the option of being spared, so there is that.

****** I look at it as a question of intent. Voldemort was always planning to kill James, so the sacrifice wouldn't activate a magical protection. OTOH Voldemort intended to spare Lily and she was given the choice to save her own skin, and by not taking that choice activated the protection.

  Prophecy brings nothing but ruin, and half a prophecy is even worse. Lord Voldemort is neither fool nor weakling; he vows to break away from the prophecy's accursed magic. He is ready to defeat Albus Dumbledore at his own game. After all, Harry Potter is just a boy. AU, sort of Mentor!Voldemort.
