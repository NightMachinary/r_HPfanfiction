*At Gringotts*

Harry looked down at the list, "I've inherited the entire estates of...all of these?"

Breaknut the goblin nodded, his thick fingers twitching ever so slightly.

The Boy-Who-Lived's /emerald orbs/ slowly widened as he went down the list a second time, mentally counting up the net assets, "That...this...this is more money than exists in...the whole of Europe, I think! Am I like the richest wizard in the world now?"

Breaknut reached for a thick folder and opened it up, leafing through it before looking up at Harry and shaking his head.

Harry tilted his head, "No? But this is several billions of galleons, added all up..."

"I'm afraid that list only lists the gross assets of each estate you have acquired, Lord-times-52-and-two-thirds Potter. Taken individually." Breaknut said with a slight smile, "Adjusting entries for consolidation and gross liabilities still need to be taken into account."

Harry suddenly shivered-

"None of that," Breaknut said sharply, "This isn't the fic where Gringotts is horribly corrupt and impoverishing all the muggle-raised with inheritance scams! A pox on those!"

Harry still looked nervous.

"I assure you that all of the fees you needed to pay have already been handled without complication, and all of the accounts you have inherited are entirely solvent." Breaknut continued.

Harry started to relax a little.

"Now let's see..." Breaknut shuffled his papers again...

--------------

*Several hours later...*

"And if we offset this contractually owed compensation from the LeStranges to the Blacks against the debt owed to the LeStranges by the Blacks, with an adjustment for the profit-sharing arrangement...we are done!"

Harry woke up with a start and refocused his /emerald orbs/ on the goblin in front of him.

Looking at the young wizard with a wide grin, Crushjewel (who had swapped places with Breaknut once the former goblin started getting exhausted) pushed a balance statement over the table, "I am glad to report, Lord-52-and-two-thirds Potter, that all of your outstanding debts have been consolidated and offset against assets, all of your property has been revalued correctly, and all goodwill has been accounted for."

Harry looked enthusiastic, "Great!...How much do I have now?"

Crushjewel leaned forward slightly, looking at the balance sheet again, before he reached into the desk and counted out one, two, three...half a dozen silver sickles, before pushing them towards Harry.


** Breaknut and Crushjewel, eh?

** By the way, people, if you're wondering, I was re-reading some of my old posts; I was looking for my musings on how a 'forgive everyone' Dumbledore could make sense ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6de0gy/lf_bad_tropes_done_well/][this thread]]), but I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/77sjo2/recommendation_in_a_sobaditsgood_way_look_at_this/][this terror]] instead, and remembering what the first chapter was /solely/ about inspired me to write this snippet.

  ...how on earth did that author sit down and write ~18,000 words of lists.
#+end_quote

Look at her profile page; she does it there too. She has pretty much every book she's ever read and every TV show she's ever watched neatly listed and sorted.

Heh, and she has [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4zqtX6SH40][Twilight]] in her name.

...Actually...wow. It's amazing that she can write that much, even if it's just lists. It's like, every idea she has, she's neatly jotting down and sorting into its rightful place.

Maybe that's just how she works. She writes an idea, then she writes more, and writes more, without caring how amazing it is literature-wise. Every time she puts down an idea, she includes everything her mind extrapolates from it, without caring for how 'high quality' it is.

Shakespeare it ain't, but who knows, with all the...oh, who am I kidding, there's no world-building in her stuff that isn't Mary Sue World, so, I dunno, see if you can fish an original idea out of those lists and lists of lists.

***** So I'm actually reading through the lists to look for any ideas... I have to ask how Dumbledore magically blocked his knowledge of his heritage (Literally it says Knowledge of Heritage: 95% blocked) and how he is learning all this stuff if he is magically blocked from learning it

edit: oh god reading the will:

To Peter Patrick Pettigrew aka Wormtail we leave 3000000 galleons if he is the one to betray us as he is our secret keeper the following part is void and he is to be locked in an antianimagus cell in azkaban and the key thrown into the deepest sea

Wouldn't that mean that if he betrays them he /doesn't/ get locked up? Actually that could work as an idea; miswriting(or reading) of will causes massive screw up of some sort

Update: somehow he has the locket of slytherin in the slytherin vault. hmm.

oh man he also has "Round Table"

Update again: Theres some magical schools you could use for some background worldbuilding

Another Update: So theres some magical companies I suppose you could use... anyway apparently Harry fired Vernon. And by that I mean he straight up said "Hey, go fire Dursley for embezzlement" with no proof. lmao. I'm not sure if thats legal, but whatever.

Another Update: So apparently families can sell off their children(as slaves, to clarify) and thats OK. Seems legit.

That seems to be all the lists in chapter 1... dare I go forward? nahhh

*** oh god I remember that... I just skimmed it (and by that I mean i scrolled through it and read about 2 words every few lines. first chapter only) and i have to ask... what even is lord of diagon alley? diagon alley is a shopping district.

edit:also does anyone know how it got so many favs and follows?

Edit again: I went through the reddit thread and I commented about Lord of Diagon Alley back then too... although it was a reply to someone else, and I apparently didn't see that on my first skim through lol (edit: I also commented on the favs and follows. I am a broken record and I don't even know it)

** I'm sure you'll agree this rewrite I just decided to write is much better than the original.

*At Gringotts*

Harry looked down at the list, "I've inherited the entire estates of...all of these?"

Breaknut the goblin nodded, his thick fingers twitching ever so slightly.

Harry's Avada Kedavra colored orbs still looked nervous.

The Raven started to relax a little.
