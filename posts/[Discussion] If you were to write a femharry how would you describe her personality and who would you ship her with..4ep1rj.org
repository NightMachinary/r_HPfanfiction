Any thoughts about the prophecy and how that would play out? I think either Neville is the BWL, Harry is exceptionally powerful magically and accidental magic is somehow responsible for killing Voldemort as I don't see a witch raised by the Dursley's ready for war in the same time frame, or the horcruxes don't exist and Voldemort dies in Godrics hollow.

I know that I never could ship a fem!harry with Ron as I see a female harry as a delicate and sophisticated woman that takes no shit from no one. Whereas I see Ron as a moronic slob that doesn't know there's a difference between his food, chess and sleep life, and everybody else's life. And that I hate him for believing life owes him something just for existing. (I know my impression of Ron is heavily colored by fannon but still.)

I once read a fem!harry/Draco story once and remember liking it but don't remember the name of the fic. I do remember that harry becomes dependant on Draco's magic to function. I find it weird that I liked it as I usually don't like any shipping between Draco and any of the "golden trio". But that's life.

Your impression of Ron is completely blinded by bad fanfictions and movies' character assassination. Canon Draco, on the other hand, was a worse person than Ron by several magnitudes.

No, your impression of Ron is /wholly/ dependent on bad fanfiction tropes.

It's not like Ron risked his life going to the MoM with Harry to save Sirius, when everyone but Harry knew it was likely a trap. He also didn't stand (on a broken leg mind you) between Harry and Sirius Black when everyone but Sirius, Remus, and Peter thought Sirius wanted to kill Harry. Ron /totally/ didn't risk expulsion by participating and helping run the DA in 5th year. There was also something about risking his life by going out to hunt down horcruxes or something during what should have been his final year at Hogwarts. I think that might have been a minor plot point in the last book or something.

All that said, yes Ron had his issues. Sure he was insecure and it reared up from time to time, but he was an otherwise good friend to Harry and doesn't deserve this stupid "Hur, Ron is bad" bullshit that happens far far to often in fanfiction.

Edit: Don't forget going with Harry to save the stone in first year and to save his sister in second year. Ron is such an asshole for that.

Really though, for someone whose defining flaws are immaturity and jealousy, he's /very/ loyal, probably the most loyal person in the entire series. Sure, he made a lot of mistakes because of his immaturity, or his jealousy, or because he didn't want to be pitied, but when push came to shove he showed that he is a true hufflepuff at heart and he should be darn proud of it.

Its easy to forget all the times that his loyalty held true. Its easy to forget he is a 17 year old that shouldn't be in the shit situation the HP kids are in. Its easy to ignore that despite fucking up he does recognize his mistakes and tries to correct them in the end.

It doesn't help that the Ron in the movies isn't nearly as redeemable as the Ron in the books, and that colors a lot of peoples vision of him very heavily.

At the same time I read him as immature at times, and I have never liked to hang out with immature people. So for me he's a great guy but I don't think I could do him justice because that immaturity colors me.

*** You are of course right in that Ron in the books did help harry a lot risking his life in the process several times.

But of Ron's many faults I can name several that irk me to no end.

- unwillingness to apply one self

- running of during the horcrux hunt

- accusing harry of putting his name in the goblet of fire

- Bullying Hermione (firebolt, SPEW, running around calling her mental.)

- Eating habits

- Hygiene

- Jealousy

And about the DA, if I'm not totally wrong Harry did not actually want to do it at the start the whole thing was Hermione's idea from the get go. Yes Ron was a part of it but both he and Harry went along with the plan not spearheading it. And the MoM as I remember it harry was ready to go alone but the others talked him into taking them with him adding to the danger and stress of the situation (this is at least fact in the movies as I don't have the books at hand for fact checking)

I will also admit to that most of my memory of the harry potter franchise is dominated by fanfiction most of the time, and bad fanfiction at times(reading fanfics for 8 - 10 years without re-reading the books does that to some people) but that's mostly me disagreeing with the route that J.K took the storyline after book 4.

**** Admittedly, though, at least some of those are justified enough in the series. And, just like with Dumbledore, many people who bash Ron simply don't get his character at all.

#+begin_quote
  Jealousy
#+end_quote

Here I ask, what is Ronald's most desperate desire, the thing he saw in the mirror of Erised? It is to raise high enough to get recognition not as just the sixth son who wasn't the best at anything but as someone who did something significant. Anything he could have achieved academically had already been achieved by one of his siblings, it wouldn't be /significant/, so for him it is worthless and the fact that he can muster enough effort to pass at all already means something; he is the child who never would get acknowledgement for anything pertaining to his studies, so he has no reason to apply himself to that. And yet here he is, always the second player to Harry who already has that recognition he wants so very badly, regardless of whether Harry wants it or not. The fact that he sticks to Harry throughout the years, separate incidents notwithstanding, is a sign of some serious loyalty the likes of which can only really be found in Bellatrix's loyalty towards Tom (and she was a fanatic).

#+begin_quote
  unwillingness to apply one self
#+end_quote

We get back to the previous point. Nothing he ever does academically would cause his family to recognise him because everything he could have done had already been done. At that point he was a child, and children learn to do things they are encouraged to do and recognised for, so since nobody recognised his efforts in that area he just stopped caring.

#+begin_quote
  accusing harry of putting his name in the goblet of fire
#+end_quote

A bad thing of him to do, sure, but once again we get back to his desire and to the fact that once again Harry got more recognition whereas he didn't get anything. Those were words said in anger, not truly meant, and though the fact that it happened at all shows his flaws and his bad side it also shows that no matter how big his flaws were he got back to Harry. And for many other people such a falling out could have spelled the end of their acquaintanceship.

#+begin_quote
  running of during the horcrux hunt
#+end_quote

In a very large part the horcrux's influence, exacerbating his negative emotions and his one desire that was the root of his flaws. And had it not been for the fact that he had an immediate run-in with the snatchers and had to escape he would have been back after mere minutes. Going out of the tent is his fault, if you presume that it's not the horcrux's fault that it affected him but rather his, but not returning to them (and thus “abandoning” them) very much isn't.

#+begin_quote
  Bullying Hermione (firebolt, SPEW, running around calling her mental.)
#+end_quote

And didn't she do things to deserve that? Both the issue with SPEW and the issue with the Firebolt boil down to Hermione deciding that she's automatically more knowledgeable than anyone else and knows better and has the right to decide for others, which is one of her major flaws by the way. With SPEW it should be obvious why it is so, and with the Firebolt she pretty much stole it from Harry to take it to McGonagall. Ronald was petty when he called her those words, but deserve them she did.

As for the MoM situation, it's still a choice he did make, and the same about the DA situation as he personally had no reason to go against Umbridge's teaching aside from his loyalty to Harry. His hygiene and eating habits are both valid points, yes, and regardless of that it's not like you aren't allowed to dislike him for whatever reason, but overall your perception of him is dyed with some bad paint.

Like many other teens. If you're going to judge Ron for that, then something like 80 percent of teenagers are unworthy of friendship.

#+begin_quote
  running of during the horcrux hunt
#+end_quote

I think it's pretty much outright stated that Ron leaving was likely due to the fact that they'd all been wearing the horcrux, and that he felt terrible almost immediately after leaving and tried to come back, but wasn't able to find the tent again.

#+begin_quote
  accusing harry of putting his name in the goblet of fire
#+end_quote

Yes, this was immature. So far, it's the only real immature thing you've attributed to him that makes sense to call him out on.

#+begin_quote
  Bullying Hermione (firebolt, SPEW, running around calling her mental.)
#+end_quote

Hermione gives as good as she gets. Or are we going to forget the numerous times she implies or explicitly says Ron's an idiot, or calls him a pig, or that time she sends a flock of birds to attack him all because he /dating a different girl/? Hermione is just as shitty to Ron as he is to her, and anyone who thinks she isn't is either legally blind or too deep into fanon Hermione-wank (which, let's be honest, is mostly just Emma-wank transplanted onto Hermione) to see it.

#+begin_quote
  Eating habits
#+end_quote

What? Can't a man eat what he wants, when he wants, how he wants? Who are you to dictate what someone else can and can't eat, and how they eat it?

#+begin_quote
  Hygiene
#+end_quote

The only hygiene problems I remember are his eating habits. Sure, he snores, but that's not something you can control. Besides, eating the way Ron does is kind of uncouth, but hardly unhygienic. He's asking for second and third helpings, not refusing to wipe after he shits.

#+begin_quote
  Jealousy
#+end_quote

Yes, but that is quite clearly meant to be his biggest character flaw, in the way of Harry's temper and Hermione's lack of social grace. Ultimately, he is the lastborn son in a family of talented boys and feels like he's the least talented of them. Furthermore, he's often ignored in favour of Ginny, because she's the only girl of the family, leaving Ron with severe middle-child syndrome. I mean, if you felt ignored even in your own family, wouldn't you feel just the tiniest bit jealousy to your ultra-famous friend who is a natural with certain types of magic, a once in a lifetime talent at quidditch, and who has (for the most part) the adulation of everyone else you know?

So, yes, Ron is jealous of Harry and he was out of line during the Goblet of Fire incident. But they're hardly unforgivable, and neither of the two justify the widespread hate Ron receives throughout the fandom.

** She would be a very damaged girl. Between her childhood, the complete lack of a normal friend-type relationship outside of Hermione & Ron (again, debatable given how often they just manage to squeak over the survival line with the end-of-year showdown) and the massive trap Hogwarts turned out to be when she found out she was a destined hero, I do not think that she would be capable of anything approaching normality in terms of having a life after Voldemort.

I also don't think that she'd look anywhere near as good as people assume she would, given the chronic pain, strain and stress she is under most of the time. She'd be scarred, wary, paranoid, thin and a tad short by the age of 18. Whether or not she'd bother with such things as makeup and clothing is another factor. Why do so, after all, when everything you ever learned had more to do with trying as hard as possible to sneak past unnoticed and survive rather than boldly put yourself out there where everyone and their pet Death Eaters wants to /kedavra/ you and everyone you love? Those habits would be hard to break if she chose to do so and I'm not entirely convinced she would even try given what she went through to get them.

On the other hand, she would have one hell of a snarky sense of humor to her.

As for Ron? He'd be a surprisingly good fit in this. Canon book Ron, that is. Canon movie Ron would be rather amusing in his conflicts with the girls, but would otherwise fall flat. And bashbash!Ron? Probably wouldn't survive one of fem!Harry's bouts of paranoia-fuelled stalking/pre-emptive acquisition of targets.

** Please excuse the wall of text, but this obviosuly needed a release. No tl;dr I'm afraid. I'm just that ruthless.

As a matter of fact I am writing a fem!Harry fic, although I have no idea if I ever publish it.

I'm not sure if my input here helps since I deviate from any sort of canon quite early. In my fic Poppy Pomfrey and Minerva McGonagall save the life of fem!Harry as well as Lily at birth which was complicated by a curse that has hit Lily during pregnancy. That leads to the daughter be named Poppy Minerva Potter and Pomfrey becoming her godmother.

The only thing canon is the attack on Godrics Hollow a bit over a year later. Pomfrey heals Poppy up in the Infirmary but refuses Dumbledore since she knows she is named in the will as the guardian for Poppy.

Poppy Pomfrey then raises Poppy Potter together with McGonagall (because I always imagined those two being a cute couple) half the time at Hogwarts and half the time at McGonagalls cottage. They call each other Pop (Poppy Potter) and Pom (Poppy Pomfrey).

My characterization for Poppy was always a bit tomboyish at heart, but I made her look very girly in her first years due to Minervas and Pom's opinion on whats proper hairstyle, dresscode and whatnot for a girl is. Shes still not someone who learns magic for the sake of learning, but growing in a environment of a Healer and a Professor of Transfiguration did give her a healthy work ethic. She very much emulates her two parental figures by being stern and very no-nonsense when the situation calls for it, but I made her also get a lot of goof and sillyness from Grandpa Albus (who deals with the situation by growing into the role of grandfather for Poppy). What will become a problem for her later is that she resembles her grandmother Dorea Potter and by that, her Black side. Neville gets rather hostile against her simply because she looks like a miniature Bellatrix with green eyes. Poppy deals with that by rebelling - a lot. She takes aging-potion and makes fake ID to get tattoos and piercings, dyes her hair, wears muggle clothing as often as possible,... all in order to distance herself as far as possible away from her resemblance of Bellatrix Lestrange (I took [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/7c/2e/6e7c2e2a07c64f40bfde7b58aa94f8ce.jpg][Jinx]], [[https://40.media.tumblr.com/c99ec186ffa21f564a159b5e2415ff4a/tumblr_n0usgj4JMu1rvarxzo1_500.jpg][Vi]] and [[https://cdn1.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/292/673/large/tracer_presskit.jpg?1443931586][Tracer]] as inspirations for the way she'll look in fifth year). But she still resembles Bellatrix so much that when Voldemort eventually returns and frees the Death Eaters, Poppy can swindel her way out of a situation by fast-talking Bellatrix into believing that Poppy is her daughter that got stolen from her by Voldemort. Bellatrix then kidnaps her... but that is way too far into the story.

Also, since she /has/ a family, her greatest wish is one of great ambition. She wanted to fly to the moon using magical means since she saw a picture of earth from the surface of the moon. Its actually the way in which she and Hermione become friends since the muggleborn is smitten by the idea.

When it comes to pairing her with a boy, I'm not sure. For a first, I keep her character open. She has two bisexual parental figures and one homosexual grandfather - so "nurture over nature heterosexuality" is flat out. I already have a scene with her getting a bit lovesick about Cedric Diggory and awfully jealous of Hermione going with Viktor to the Yule Ball (or is she jealous of Viktor wink wink, nudge nudge). Anyway... possible candidates are also one of the Weasley twins. She does have a little thing with George after he helped her procure the aging potion to get tattoo equipment, but the thing is quickly over after she gets grounded for three eternities after Min and Pom find out that she had tattooed half of her body with skulls, dragons and griffins (because teenage and eeeedgyyyyyy) and a little souvenir on George's bum (a joker mask). Ron is flat out. I think he was a good friend for Harry, but I don't see him enjoy being around Poppy, who constantly mills over outlandish applications of magic. Dean and Seamus... meh. Nevilles also out because even though he eventually gets over her resemblance of Lestrange, he still couldn't date someone who looks like the torturer of his parents (just imagine what Freud would say about that). As for boys in other years, I don't really know.

So, after we have the boys, we can hold onto George, Cedric and Krum.

Since I made Poppy bisexual, the fairer sex isn't out of question. Lets just make one thing clear, I'm not gonna put her with Hermione - thats established itself pretty fast in the bit of dialogue and such that I already have between them. They're sisters and fellow pioneers into outlandish areas of magic. Her first experience in this area is going to be with Parvati. Is she the final thing? I don't think so. Poppy does get a bit lovestruck with Fleur, but realizes quickly that the aloof french girl isn't what she wants. Currently I'm writing about Poppy trying to woo Susan Bones because... well, because boobs...

/"You just want to go out with her because she 's developing chronic back aches. You keep staring, don't try to deny it." Hermione shot her the patented Granger Glare of dissaproval, melting every denial like ice cubes under the summer sun./

/Poppy stared at her friend. She blinked once, she blinked twice and then tilted her head slightly to the side. "I imagine my head between all that flesh-fluffy goodness just buried in there, my hands... ." She trailed off, a dreamy expression on her face while she gestured massaging roughly round shapes around her head./

/"You're the worst."/

/"You keep telling me that and yet you're still my best friend. What gives?"/

But I have a feeling about the buxom Hufflepuff and I keep my writing open to see what happens. I think that Poppy is going to find a bit more than flesh-fluffy goodness with Susan.

So yea, to come back to your question: George or Fred, Cedric and Krum for the boys - Fanon!Susan or a similar character for the girls.
