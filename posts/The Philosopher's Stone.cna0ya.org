Are there any fics out there in which Harry (or femharry) steals, absorbs or in any other way you can think of, obtains the Philosopher's stone?

Thank you in advance.


** He absorbs it in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13116300/1/The-Mysteries-of-Magic]])

It's still a WIP, though.

  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.

** Not Harry but Hermione does it in linkffn(New Blood)

The entire story is about how she cons everyone into thinking that she's the purest pureblood ever even though her parents are muggles. She's making considerable progress.

*** Highly recommend this fic, updates are consistent, although sometimes the chapters are short so you get left feeling like you wanted more, but that's a good problem to have!

We're just now getting into second year and it's shaping up to be quite interesting.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** There is a lot of the Philosopher's Stones in linkffn(5435295). Yeah, I am not the biggest fan of the story, but it is a classic in its trope.
