Hi, I'm looking for some top tier fics on ao3. I feel like I can never find anything that's written well, has the pairings I want, or has a solid plot. If you have any recommendations PLEASE share them.

Requirements: I prefer M/M fics as I am a queer guy but I also really enjoy gen fics with no main pairings, no rape/non-con, preferably Harry-Centric, 80k words or more, no outrageous bashing, maybe Dark!Harry?

If it helps my favorite fics are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589][Evitative]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630][The Sum of Their Parts]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18394907][The Left Words]].


** If you haven't read them yet, check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599][Reparations]] & [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879624][Foundations]] by Saras_Girl. They're post-Hogwarts Drarry. I don't want to say too much about Turn and spoil the plot.. Reparations & Foundations has Harry training as a Healer doing the magical equivalent of residencies when he has to work with Draco.

** I have one! It's called Relentless We Survive by Araciel. It's a really well written Harry Potter & Assassin's Creed crossover, with Harry Potter/Ron Weasley/Hermione Granger as the shipping.
