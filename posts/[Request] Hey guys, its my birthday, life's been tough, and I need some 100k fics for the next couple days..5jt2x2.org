** I'm sorry to hear life's being tough. Whilst not fitting your criteria, Seventh Horcrux (sorry I had to) and A Black Comedy are both crackfics that should cheer you up.

For a serious story, Rise of the Wizards features a Harry with significant power, even if it becomes somewhat outlandish as it goes on.

The Firebird trilogy has an unusually powerful Harry (not really magically, he has an ability that no other male has), and quite a bit of political intrigue.

Sorry I can't think of any more right now, but I hope at least one of these is new/useful for you. Happy birthday!

**** Well, there is the deservedly popular linkffn(What You Leave Behind). In the world of crossovers, linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) features a Harry that has to delve into the meaning/nature of magic deeper (due to necessity) than any other fic I can think of. For something darker, linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress) is an OoTP AU that's pretty good, though the first 5-9 chapters are kinda rough.

While different than UT and Valbone, there's a short fic called linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao) about Bill Weasley were basically every sentence is /perfect/.

I am currently reading quite a few stories. Marauder's Plan being one of them.

Try Linkffn(Harry Potter. My Life Is My Own) It's a really good story that has some cool political maneuvers and interesting powers.

  Harry has a great memory, photographic even. He remembers everything even the day he was born. Every sight, sound, smell or touch he remembers with crystal clarity and he has power from the moment he is born. And whats up with Hedwig? All chapters edited for spelling, grammar, and some content. You may want to re-read it.

**** No worries. There aren't any romantic pairings in this one, yet but I'll have a think for something more appropriate.

linkffn(The Closer You Look) might be fun or linkffn(11585823).

** Hi there! Sorry you've been having a rough time. I know what it's like to have shit happen and need a distraction. Here is one of my favorite stories this year, and it seems to fit all of your requirements: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]]. It's 51 chapters with a sequel that was just started this month, over 200k words for you. :) No romance at all, very young start, Harry gradually becomes quite powerful through hard work and teamwork, and it's very much a life journey with some politics. Maybe you can give it a try.
