  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** I liked the general tone of the story until the dreaded love triangle struck again. Are there stories with a similar tone that have a regular pairing for Harry and are not overly angsty like the regular "Harry was abused" fics?
