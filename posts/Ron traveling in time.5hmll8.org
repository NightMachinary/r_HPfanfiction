Hey guys, I am searching for a fic where Ron is traveling back in time.

I would prefer if he stays in canon timeline and that he is the only one but if you have something good then fell free to post.

Thank you


** Well, linkffn(The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl) is an in-progress, updates every 3-7 days fic where Ron from a near canon universe is reborn as himself in a slightly different universe. But that's it for me and solo-Ron time travel ([[/spoiler][yes, Violet and Hermione are time travelers/reincarnates too, but Violet isn't Harry, and Hermione isn't the Hermione of Ron's native universe, so I'm not counting them. Ron did travel alone, after all]]). For Ron, Harry and Ginny you can check out linkffn(Backwords with Purpose I: Always and Always).

*** Red Knight is... interesting.

On the plus side, a positive focused characterization of Ron is rare. The writing is decent and time-travel is a fun device. There's a good aspect of mystery in the vein of the original series.

But on the bad side, Ron is being a dunderhead. He's a fully grown /adult/ and yet he took, what, /10 chapters/ to even /consider/ that Violet and Hermione might be time-travelers too. The number of inconsistencies he overlooked drives me crazy. And he's extremely inactive. I know the Horcrux hunt can turn cliche, but time is ticking as the butterfly effect throws off everything.

And if he says "m'lady" one more time, I'm going to punch a hole my screen :P .

The later chapters are getting better; the duel at Malfoy mansion was good. I just wish the author would stop toying around with Hogwarts politics and childishness when our main character should be an adult. But that seems to be an overall problem with the time-travel trope in general; oh well.

**** Well, it doesn't help that he's in a world different than his own. He just chalks up the inconsistencies to being in a different world. Add in a still-developing child brain, and his incomplete memories, it doesn't surprise me. Plus he's not naturally clever /in that way/.

I'm not sure he's inactive. We are only through half of the first Year, he already built quite a new alliance in the Slytherin house, and he got the Diary. On the other hand, he knew Violet and Hermione were time travelers too, so he didn't necessarily need to hunt horcruxes by himself.

***** I just hope he'll drop the kid stuff and gets together with the two other time travelling adults. I don't really get why Ron'd bother with the Slytherin kids to that extent. It's always creepy if a grown man is hanging out with kids that way. Doubly so if there are other adults in kid bodies he could be hanging out with instead.

As Ember-Rising said, it's a fault of many such "back in their Young bodies" fics. "Reunion" by Rorschach's Blot is one of the few who actually deals with this in a plausile manner - by the time travellers flat-out sticking with each other instead of trying to build relationships with children.

As far as we're told from Ron's point of view, there's no indication of any plan for dealing with Violet/Hermione. Besides a few word games, he hasn't even begun to form an alliance with them let alone let them know of his intentions to save the world, etc.

If he's being cautious in case they're the enemy, he hasn't stated it in the chapters so far. I just feel like there's a very big blank spot when it comes to actually using his knowledge.

Maybe that's intentional to keep the mystery. But it's personally frustrating that there's little visible long-term plan from a first-person story.

** I absolutely love Ron-centric time travel stories, but sadly there aren't many out there at all.

The most recent WIP that I've found is The Red Knight, which has already been mentioned. It's kinda weird, so I don't really know how I feel about it yet. There's a little too much Slytherin/pure blood politics for me, personally.

Linkffn(10962103) - I read this WIP recently too. I don't really remember how it is, and I don't think it's regularly updated.

Linkffn(4843238) - this one is dimension travel, so not exactly what you're looking for, but I really enjoyed it. Sadly, it's unfinished :(

I hope someone else can contribute, because finding these type of fics is nearly impossible!

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.
