Good evening. I have been on a horror kick recently, and I find myself longing for a genuinely creepy Harry. I want a Harry who is subtle and elegant about his creepiness though. Not Nightmare Man levels of bombastic evil. In fact, he doesn't even have to be evil, just disturbing and uncomfortable. Lovecraftian themes, Hannibal Lecter style serial killers, slightly insane intellectuals, Unspeakable Harry, all are good.

No smut of any sort, but slash is okay as long as it isn't Harry with Snape, Malfoy, Voldemort, assorted-other-Death-Eaters, or people decades older than him and as long as it isn't the focus of the story. Doesn't need to be long, or even complete as long as it is well-written. I prefer no bashing of any characters, no crack, and no Fem!Harry.

Some of the fics I enjoy are the Inquisitor Carrow series, anything by The Carnivorous Muffin (the only decent Fem!Harry I have ever read.), and for more along the lines of this request, Circular Reasoning.

Thank you very much for any suggestions.


** I'd say that Harry in The Art of Self Fashioning is suitably creepy. He's fucking insane, he's constantly experimenting on himself, he can't interact with people normally, he's just uncomfortable. But that's what makes him so interesting.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

The plot took a massive turn though, and by saying anything else at this point it will probably be super spoilery. I can say that he gets slightly less creepy around this point in the story, but I'm not sure if this is permanent or not as I thought he was going to "recover" several times earlier in the story and was wrong lol.

** "In the mind of a scientist" by ZeronoKyuubi features a very dark, borderline unhinged Harry with a sick fascination with the human body and how to improve it.

Most of it's played for laughs, but it has a very sinister undertone as he cuts his own body open just to take a look at his insides, drugs his classmates and even develops a strange fascination (and subsequent relationship) with Tonks.

Harry is very much based on Doctor Stein from Soul Eater and when placed in a world of magic that can produce some... interesting results

******* It's not correct if nobody uses it that way anymore.

Words are social constructs to convey meaning. If the meaning has so significantly shifted to the point that you will be greatly misunderstood by almost everyone, then you are the one not using the word correctly.

The only point of alphabet, symbols and words is to convey concepts. Once the meaning of an adjective, symbol, or noun has shifted in the public conscious, *that* is the true meaning, not something forgotten and unused that came before.

2000 years ago in Rome, thumbs down meant aproval.

You start thumbing down because that was the "correct meaning", in 2019? It's not clever, it's retarded.

The time that has passed is immaterial.

The only people I've seen pulling semantic shit like what you're taking about have been the most obnoxious, pretentious psuedo-intellectuals I've had the displeasure to meet. The sort that think they're clever when they say "gay" and mean "happy".

People like that aren't smart, they aren't witty or learned, they certainly aren't "using the word correctly". They're just annoying assholes, and everyone thinks so.

*********** When, in 1990s?

I've been in the fanfiction scene for well over a decade now, and have literally never seen the word "slash" as an adjective refer to a pairing.

[[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slash]]

Use your brain, and think why on Earth 99.999999% of authors clearly say there is a pairing in the description, write X/Y, and then write "Slash". Please, tell me why you think that is with that big brain of yours.

I challenge you to find a SINGLE peice of fanfiction within the last decade, where "slash" means "pairing".

Nobody is saying that you stop using the symbol '/', all I am trying to get through to you is that the word "slash" does not mean "pairing", and never has for as long as I've been reading.

  Harry Potter's uncle goes too far and a broken, bleeding Harry is left in his cupboard. However, he is rescued and taken in by our favorite, faceless entity in a suit; Slenderman. How will Hogwarts deal with a corrupted Harry Potter? Harry Potter x Creepypastas. Dark-ish!Harry. Teen for general Creepypasta goodness and language. Manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley Bashing.

** I would reccoment Paradoxical Parallels; this is a story I have just started, but it does have a very creepy Harry, in which he has great charisma not unlike young Riddle, but also has a terrifying side to him. I do think you will enjoy it.
