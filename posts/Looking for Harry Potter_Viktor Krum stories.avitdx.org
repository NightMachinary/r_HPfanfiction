I found this pairing a while back now, and since then I've been reading some of the stories I have been able to find myself, but I was wondering if anyone knows of any more.

I'd prefer if they were longer, but shorter ones are welcome too.


** Yes please Babadook this would be so cute a couple and good a story because they like Quidditch and also both famous and at school so they can relate to each other.

And they could help each other out during the Tournament, and maybe KRUM goes with Harry to the Graveyard and lives, and Krum has to deal with the aftermath of being Imperius'd into Crucio'ing Cedric.

Also yes it would be interesting and funny to see a jealous Hermione thinking she was going to get Krum but Harry did. :) Instead of jealous Ron fics it would be jealous Hermione. Yes it would be interesting to see flipped gender roles of a girl being jealous of two guys together. And there can be a horrible scene where Hermione might try to assault Harry over it like she did Ron with Lavender in canon. Canon Hermione assaults people over things they have no way of knowing because she didn't get her way. She's so petty and childish!

Gosh yes there are so many cool ideas to go with this. :o If Krum went on Horcrux hunt he would recognize Deathly Hallows sign and maybe connect it way sooner?

*** I do wonder how differently it would have gone, so I'm eager to find more fics that explore this pairing. I personally always thought Ron would get jealous as well as Hermione, seeing as he's still being outshone by Harry again; maybe he believes Harry thinks only famous people are good enough for him.
