So, regardless of your opinion on the various reasons why, from her Twitter and Pottermore additions to the story, to Fantastic Beasts, to the Cursed Child, to her opinions on LGBT issues... I think we can agree that JK Rowling's reputations has suffered serious damage.

Lately, I've been wondering whether this is likely to damage the HP fandom. After all, much as many people have strong opinions, the debate over whether you can separate somebody's body of work from them as a person is far from settled, and probably won't ever be.

But as I am just one person, I must humbly admit that I'm far from equipped to decide whether the fandom will be damaged.

Therefore I'm curious about what others think. Has or will the fandom be damaged? Why? What are your feelings on JK Rowling and has this affected your enjoyment of the Wizarding World as a creative endeavour and the fandom?


** Probably not. At this point, more headcanon exists than actual canon. Even if we pulled a Farenheit and burned every copy of her books and every copy of the movies and every memory of the play, the fandom would still survive on headcanon alone. It's been a decade since the last movie (of the OG series) came out and a decade and a half since the last book did and people are still arguing passionately about whether Snape was a douche or James Potter was an angel or how magic works or what a relationship between Hagrid and the Giant Squid would be like.

The HP Fandom will be fine. :)

** I'm fairly sure death of the Author has already happened in HP. I see plenty people hating or irgnoring JK Rowling but loving Harry Potter. Though Rowling's reputation has also caused the opposite effect but I'm not sure to what extent.

** Not much on fandom directly, but her readership will probably decline in the long run. Given Harry Potter is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_book_series][the most popular book series ever]] and [[https://hobbylark.com/fandoms/fanfictionnet-vs-archive-of-our-own][the most popular fandom]] (twice as many stories as next Naruto), I don't think we have too much to fear.

** Every year there's someone to say "The HP fandom is dying!"

Yet there has never been as many fanfics written as these last two years, Pandemic or not.

** First of all she hasn't done anything to warrant all the hate she gets. I've seen a lot of misogynistic language used against her for just having an opinion. But no, I don't think it'll affect the popularity of Harry Potter. It's too popular for that to happen.

** Well, there's already people distancing themselves from harry potter as a franchise. So, I'd say yes, the fandom is likely going to be in for a rough patch. I don't know if it will be a meaningful detriment to it given how enormous the harry potter fandom is though...

Personally, I'm not wanting to support Rowling too much, right now. Not just because I do support the trans crowd, but also because everything recent hasn't been very good.

I will probably buy the video game if it looks good because it likely doesn't have that much to do with her personally, and I really want there to be a hogwarts video game that doesn't suck.

And I'm still going to read fanfiction, because that doesn't support Rowling in any way.

** The main books no, death of the author has been a thing for about half a decade now.

Anything outside that though is done for. The FB films have very few fans, the play is considered non-canon, and this new game is going to be dead on arrival at this rate.

** Not really. Her reputation has been pretty damaged for a while now, anyone who was going to leave over it probably already has. And the fandom is still going strong and is very busy.

** I dont think so

There are some people that dont want to have anything to do with it/trying to be bossy and demand that others dont either but that's on them

I think it's doing well, especially with the time people are having from quarantine

Side note- I'm not gonna share my opinion on the whole thing but some of the hate JK is recieving is ridiculous. It shouldn't be acceptable to say that you hope she gets raped or something

** I think at this point, Harry Potter has really drifted out of Rowling's hands and people just do what they want with it. If I could give any advice to Rowling, I would tell her to cut things off and just let Harry Potter belong to a corporation or public domain. The fandom itself will definitely survive her issues, but I feel like many people will refuse to financially support it, as the money will go to Rowling. On a side note, torrenting is kind of fun.

** I actually know of 2 fanfic authors that refuse to write HP fanfics anymore because commenters gave them so much crap about what they wrote in the fanfics for some reason. So I'd say that the fandom is already kind of declining in terms of fanfics but for those who stay to the absolute cannon I believe that that probably won't dissapear. But I could be wrong

** I don't think it will have a significant impact. This fandom has resisted a lot of bullshit from Rowling, like the completely bizarre Cursed Child, the mediocre cash grabs that are Fantastic Beasts movies, and all the pottermore pooping wizard stuff. The fandom is more attached to her setting and characters, rather than her politics or her idea of canon. The only thing I think would seriously alienate the fandom is if she tried retconning a villain into a trans woman or made Hermione a mouthpiece for her TERF politics.

The fanfiction community, I think will only naturally slow down considering the series is older. I don't see them abandoning it immediately. Regular fans though, yes I've seen a lot of posts from people who are disappointed in Rowling and will probably not buy her future works. This isn't the ASOIAF fandom, where a lot of people drop out due to disappointment. There are plenty of HP fanfic writers who don't agree with her politically, and writing fanfiction doesn't really benefit her monetarily. That said, I can understand why some might be completely turned off the fandom by her actions, and I expect they'll simply switch fandoms, and good for them.

** Its not doing a lot for existing fans but younger people are a lot less interested. That might have happened anyway, they're 20+ years old now. Personally while I'm still into the series I try not to spend any money that might go to TERF causes and that has influenced my purchasing decisions in the last little while.

Considering the books' villains are basically conservatives I don't see a lot of overlap between people who agree that trans women should be treated as men who want to rape you in the bathroom and HP's target audience.

*** Also, I wouldn't say the book villains are exactly Conservatives. I think that's being a bit harsh on Conservatives, seeing as most Conservatives aren't in favour of torture and genocide.

I grant you that they hold Conservative views on the Wizarding World, but the villains of the books are extremists and I think it lacks nuance to just call them Conservatives.
