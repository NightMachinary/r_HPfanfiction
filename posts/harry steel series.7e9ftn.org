looking for stories set in Investigator Harry Steel by TheBlackHand724 world


** If TheBlackhand724 hasn't given permission for others to write in his creation, there won't be stories. Since the series is still ongoing, iirc, he/she probably hasn't given permission.

*** So... Maybe I'm an idiot (likely the case) but given that JK Rowling hasn't given permission, and fanfiction of any sort is questionably legal (bla bla nonprofit derivative work) in the first place, I would imagine that fanfiction of a fanfiction is not even questionable for someone who would write fanfiction in the first place.

I mean, sure, it may not be "PC" to just use someone's world, but isn't that what every fanfiction writer is doing?

Sorry if parts of this sound snarky as that's not my intent.

**** But that's just it. Rowling has long stated that fanfic is ok, even as far back as in interviews in 2004. The disclaimer nonsense on most fanfics is/was a FFnet rule, not any sort of legal statement.

When you write based upon someone else's work, you should ask permission. Even Weird Al does it.

***** so you mean to say that all the fanfiction that are out there like naruto(animations), percy jackson(movies), ncis(tv series) and so on (the list goes on) has the permission of their creators like harry potter fanfiction has???

***** Ah, my bad. I just took all the disclaimers as a legality thing.

Still, being as it's still HP fanfiction, and legally TheBlackhand724 can't claim ownership/proprietary whatevers, I fail to really see the issue. I mean, I wouldn't do it, but I don't see the issue. (Mainly the reason I wouldn't do it, is because I couldn't do it justice, but I probably wouldn't have an issue using the world/premise from a story that was bad)
