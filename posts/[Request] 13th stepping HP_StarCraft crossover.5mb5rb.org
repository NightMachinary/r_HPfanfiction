I recently read a small summary of the 13th stepping which I thought was intriguing, but haven't been able to find the story anywhere online. I was wondering if anyone knows where I can read it. There's a copy on patronuscharm but that is only 4 chapters, and I think the may be 8 or 9. Thanks


** The entire story (it's not completed) is currently available in the DLP WBA. It's posted in snippets, small chunks at a time, but it's all there. That's usually done to make it easier to edit and review before polishing it up and posted it on ffn or whereever. You need a minimum of five posts on the website to view it.

*** Thanks! Was able to read it there. It's a shame it got abandoned though.
