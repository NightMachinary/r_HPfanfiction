Or possibly of Lupin already like "Mate, the last two professors already tried to harm us! What if he is an accomplice of Black?!"

  All they wanted was a normal school year and now they're willing to fight for it. An alternative take on the Trio's fourth year.

** 4 Out of 5 DADA Professors Recommend linkffn(2366263)

Not really, but does have Harry noticing a pattern. After 5th year, Dumbledore assigns a summer essay on what they've learned in Defense. Harry's learned most of them want Harry dead.

  With the DADA professor for 1996-97 being unknown, Dumbledore assigns all returning students a summer essay, “What I have learned in DADA while at Hogwarts”. You wouldn't believe the approach Harry took, as some people are finding out, much to their shock

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)
