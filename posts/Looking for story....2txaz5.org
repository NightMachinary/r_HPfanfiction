There's a fanfiction I've read in the past, Come What May, that has a scene in which Harry takes a potion and some of his memories are played to the Potions class. We see the students reactions as they find out some of Harry's secrets. I'm really interested in this type of scene and was wondering if anyone knows of another story that features something like that? I think the idea of people finding out some of the things Harry has gone through or suffered is very intriguing and I find the proposed reactions interesting. If anyone has heard of or read anything similar, I'd love to know! Thanks :)


** There is a scene like that in chapter 9 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6174426/1/Champions][Champions]].

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7429542/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] has a scene somewhat similar to what you're looking for, only it's in a courtroom and not a classroom. It is quite a ways into the story though, and it's not a short fic. It is a good read, but can get rather angsty.
