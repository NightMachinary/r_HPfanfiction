LF a good story that explores the darker side of *soulmates* trope. Thinking about it it is little more than variation of forced marriage. In most stories victims don't even have a choice! And yet vast majority of these stories seem to be lighthearted fluff where characters still fall in "love". I mean is it even free will? They are forced with no options to refuse (most of the time). It is little more than sanctified rape if you ask me.

​

Sorry just tired of endless slew of soulmate hippy happy BS stories.

** TBH, how a person sees the soulmate trope depends on how much they would enjoy the concept of destiny existing, I think? To me it's not like, 'this scrawl on character x's hand tells them Hermione is their soulmate, so they have no choice but to fall in love with her', but more 'the most perfect relationship for character x would be with Hermione, and if they meet, they will fall in love, but here's a little foreshadowing of that in the form of a scrawl on their hand' - that's how I see most of the fluffy soulmate tropes, and I can enjoy it. Though it could be quite interesting to read about a character trying to fight fate by not wanting to be with their soulmate... I think I'd like to read that, going to bookmark this thread for recommendations :3

*** That's how I always saw it. Soulmates by definition are perfect for each other. They might still need to learn about each other and adjust to the relationship, but the idea of them being bound unwillingly by an outside force makes no sense to me.

**** To me, the kind of soulmate fics that portray their coming together as inevitable and unavoidable rub me the wrong way because it's essentially robbing them of their agency, and removing a part of their free will.

***** So not a fan of strong destiny-themed fics? Admittedly, while I'm not exactly against that portrayal, it does not seem too interesting to me. I like the more moderate take on the trope myself, where the people know their soulmate would be the person with whom they'd be the happiest, but there's nothing actually forcing them together aside of societal expectation of WOW YOU FOUND YOUR SOULMATE IM SO JEALOUS OF YOU!!!

I vaguely remember a fic in a similar tone where 'darker'/more traditional families would discourage their children from getting attached to their soulmates, and straight out forbidding contact if they turn out to be muggleborn, since family legacy is more important than personal happiness.. Damn, wish I could remember the title..

  "Scars can come in handy." --- Magic gives the gift of a soulmate. Separated by war, alliances, beliefs, and blood, but connected by skin. What if you shared the scars of the person that magic has given you? What if you really, really wished that you didn't?

** It's rather short but ObsidianPen's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11449983][Unlikely]] does so.

This is similar and just as short but the ending is less satisfying. linkao3(7130459).

There's also linkao3(12714501) and the rest of that series, which is much longer.

  “Soulmates,” Harry repeated. “Like the one you'll love for the rest of your life?” Ron shrugged. “Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's the law. To marry your soulmate, I mean. It's illegal not to marry them. Or to marry someone else, ‘cause then you'll be taking someone else's soulmate away.” There was a niggling feeling on the back of his head. Something's not right, it said. Harry frowned. “I have to marry my soulmate?” Ron looked at him, puzzled. “Well, they're your soulmate, so why wouldn't you?”

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
