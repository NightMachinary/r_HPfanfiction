Anyone knows fics that are set during the Cold War or deal with the Cold War during it's heydays? Or fics written as technothrillers/spythrillers - without being crack/parodies?

Preferably Harry-centric when it's possible and non-slash.


** There is linkao3(8208254) - it was part of a larger concept that never got quite developed, since the author moved on to other things.

Also there is this new fan film called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voldemort:_Origins_of_the_Heir][Voldemort: Origins of the Heir]]
