**** Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived, wherein Harry has a twin or Neville is the 'public' child of prophecy. Harry may or may not be the actual child of prophecy in these fics.

A side affect of this tag is frequent bashing, terrible James and Lily's, and overpowered Harry.

** Deprived is a Harry/Fleur fic along those lines. Harry runs away because he is neglected in favor of his twin who is the boy who lived. He returns to Hogwarts as Fleur's bodyguard during the TriWizard tournament. It's pretty angsty but Harry is very powerful. He has a knight that his the embodiment of his hatred that follows him. Unfortunately it's incomplete but fits your request pretty well.

** Honestly most fics like this are pretty shitty but linkao3(Sarcasm and Slytherin) or linkffn(prince of Slytherin) sort of fit this. Others do what others have said and look for wrong boy who lived fics.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
