I remember reading a fic where Harry becomes a professor at a muggle university pre-hogwarts.

At an early point in the story he befriends Snape when he comes searching for him on the command/requests of Dumbledore.

Harry keeps assisting students from the school he worked at pre-hogwarts while attending said school.

I would highly appreciate it if anyone recognizing this story would link it.


** A university professor at 10 years old?
