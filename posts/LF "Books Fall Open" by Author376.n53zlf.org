I'm looking for an old Viktor/Hermione fic that was taken off FF.net years and years ago but I'm hoping someone here might have a copy. It's 'Books Fall Open' by Author376 and another user has asked for it (6 years ago lol) in this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2zvh2d/looking_for_books_fall_open_by_author376/][post]] but the lj page they directed the OP to is no longer active or replying to messages. If anyone happens to have a copy squirreled away that they could send me I'd be super appreciative!
