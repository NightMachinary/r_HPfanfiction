I am fan of charecters that mix everything from magic to material art to sword,and use everything that they could have to do their job' I was wondering if there was a herrypotter fanfic like that


** I don't know any but I'm certain that there will be a few in the near future niw that the Witcher series is on Netflix

** The Life of a Rogue Assassin is HarryP/ AC/Witcher and Percy Jackson. More leaning towards swords and shit compared to Harry potter magic.

** I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12343855/1][The Swallow and the Dragon]], and I think its pretty good. It could do with some more tension, but other than that great.

*** It's a good story despite it's sometimes random magical strength, but it's been a while since I read it so this might be an exaggeration. Only really bad thing is the long wait between updates.

** I've seen a couple of Creature Hunter Harry fics, but they're mostly linked to animes I don't know and that Monster Hunter game series from a few years back.

I agree that there'll be more now that the series is on Netflix though.

** Lots of presumably abandoned fics and a fair few that take a couple months to update. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Witcher-Crossovers/224/8719/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10]]
