** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by Jbern) has Harry study in the infirmary under Poppy instead of taking Potions. It's a well-written story that takes place in 4th year and was written (or at least started) before OotP came out.

While the Poppy/Harry mentorship isn't the main focus of the story, it's relevant plotwise and I can't think of any other stories I've seen that have her play an important role.
