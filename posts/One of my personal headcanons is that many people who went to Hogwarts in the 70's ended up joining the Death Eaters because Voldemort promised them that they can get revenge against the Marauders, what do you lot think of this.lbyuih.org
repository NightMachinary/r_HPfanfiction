#+TITLE: One of my personal headcanons is that many people who went to Hogwarts in the 70's ended up joining the Death Eaters because Voldemort promised them that they can get revenge against the Marauders, what do you lot think of this?

*** A little late to the party but Mulciber, Avery and Rosier are mentioned as being Snape's peers. Lucius overlapped with them for at least a year (but you could argue that a fifth-seventh year wouldn't really give a shit about younger students not in their house). Regulus was one or two years behind the Marauders and Barty Jr was described as being 19 during his trial so probably same year as Regulus.

** They made good points about the age of the DEs.

But also, I feel like people really over blow the Marauders' evilness after reading too much fan fictions ? Because, sure, they're mean to the equally mean Snape and his friends---who are canonically just DEs. But the Marauders really don't come off as goofy oddballs constantly playing pranks on pranks like the Twins on acid. There must be a reason why all the adults and teachers preach their talent and cleverness. They also must have spent most of their free time perfecting the animagus transformation and the work on the map. For me, they come more off as the popular, rich, clever band of friends who are a good fun but in a world/bubble of their own most of the time. And sure, they can also be dickheads, but they're not torturing people, and certainly not 24/7. They probably didn't care about most students nor engage with them, since they had their group, their projects and their secrets.

So, yeah. You can have someone like Snape be all « boo, hoo, I hate these popular guys because they're pretty and clever and rich while I'm not. And they got the girl I'm hot for. And they didn't like it when I was bullying this kid because of his blood status ». But I don't see how that'd be a way to recrute many people? The random guy in Ravenclaw who may have hated them because they disrupted the class with funny quips/didn't try as hard and got better grades/whatever may be legit in his feelings, but they won't just join a radical party who seeks to eradicate muggles and torture or kill anyone who isn't pure blood just for that? Or there is something wrong with the whole generation.

(Also I don't see how killing anyone not pure blood be a revenge on the marauders. Half of them are at least pure blood from prestigious families...)

** No. This only partly applies to Snape, who had genuine trauma from being abused that stunted his emotional development. Even then, I don't necessarily see it so much as being about revenge, but feeling he needed protecting from them.

From what we see of others, they do appear to be blood thirsty, or bigots or power hungry or overlooked in some way (like Barty Crouch Jnr though I am not sure if he was at Hogwarts at the same time) or a combination of any and all of these.

Take Lucius Malfoy for example, I reckon he just thought of the marauders as nothing more than a slight iritation, but so far beneath him in order of what was important to him, that he will have hardly paid them much attention, save to have knowledge of them...knowledge is power and all that.

** Attractive as that premise is, it's probably not the case, although it's certainly true for Snape (to a point). They were too young, as others have mentioned, and the DEs we know of from Snape's time came from rich important families and not the type of people James and Sirius targeted, no matter how much people pretend that they stood up for the little guys.

***** We know they befriended a werewolf when the situation was so bad for werewolves that it wasn't sure they could go to school, fought against voldemort and risked their lives when none of them were muggleborns, we know James couldn't bring himself to say the word 'mudblood' even in anger, we know of only two canon instances where they hexed people - snape in SWM (who was already throwing around slurs and hanging with future death eaters) and Bertram Aubrey in the detention slip. So I would say we don't know much at all.

We know Snape used slurs against muggleborns and delighted in/downplayed the suffering of Mary Macdonald. (Don't give me the 'he was pressured or possibly bullied to join the wannabe death eaters bullshit'. Mulciber wasn't there when Snape defended him in front of Lily. If he didn't like them he could denounce them just like Lily denounced the Marauders in the same conversation. And don't give me the 'Dark Arts can mean anything from jinxes, hexes to curses bullshit' either. Lily was very confident in stating that the Marauders don't use Dark magic so either the Marauders hexed people for fun and what Mulciber did was worse or Mulciber only used a harmless hex on Mary Macdonald and the Marauders' "bullying" was "only" name calling until SWM. You can't have it both ways.)

If you're determined to paint them as two dimensional evil people just to romanticize precious Snape then feel free.

****** We know they befriended their dorm mate and then didn't drop him when he turned out a werewolf. Big difference.

Lily being confident is in fact not proof of anything but if her confidence is that definitive, she was very confident in calling James an arrogant bullying toerag.

I have plenty to romanticize Snape on and I don't romanticize teenagers, I prefer adults, so this is plainly irrelevant.

For the sake of the argument, Snape and Mulciber being anything in particular doesn't prove that the marauders defended the little guy. Especially since they never went after mulciber, evidently.

Please explain what Dark magic is, by all means, if the author's definition isn't good enough for you :)

******* Rowling isn't saying that as a third person omniscient narrator. Rowling is saying it through Lily. So we have to understand dark magic the way Lily understands it - whatever the Marauders do isn't dark magic but whatever Mulciber did is. I am going to assume you are smart enough to know that and are just being facetious.

Also you seem happy to ignore the whole "fought against Voldemort when they didn't have to" in your argument that they never stood up for the little people. I'm sure you will find a way to twist this too. Because that's what "passionate" Snape fans do. When there is a lack of canon evidence, assume every other character is the worst version of themselves. When there is canon evidence, assume it's a lie or twist the characters' motivations or downplay their good deeds.

Like I said both "Marauders never stood up for little people" and "Marauders stood up for little people" are headcanon. You can headcanon that the Marauders never went after Mulciber just as people can headcanon that they did. You can keep insisting your headcanon is canon all you like but the fact is we don't know enough.

******** As an omniscient narrator, Rowling wrote that all jinxes, curses and hexes are Dark. That a literal baby was considered a great Dark wizard by many people for having defeated Voldemort. That love potions aren't Dark. And that the marauders ran around with a textbook Dark creature as of the time Lily said they don't use Dark magic.

Which is actually fine by me, since I don't think the Dark arts are inherently and obviously evil. But it does mean that Lily's judgment isn't impeccable.

With all due respect to them for joining the order, they were playground bullies, per Sirius himself, whose gang featured a would be mass murderer, and every scene that features them depicts them as bullies. Let's not pretend Sirius and Lupin couldn't have given Harry more representative memories if they wanted to.

********** Sure, I guess we need a minute by minute account of fictional characters' lives to know what they got up to.

Mulciber might have been great at care of magical creatures and his true passion being a magical vet, but his role in the story is such that we're very free to paint him as nothing but a creepy DE, because that's how extrapolation works. I'm extrapolating from data that exists, and you're extrapolating from data that doesn't, one of these is more reasonable and valid than the other, and if you need to make shit up about characters in order to like them, there are plenty of characters that are ALREADY likability, like the Trio, but who are we kidding?
