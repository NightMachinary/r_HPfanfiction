So I just finished a godfathers promise and am enraptured by how well made it was, it balanced kinkiness and character development. I'm just asking if anyone knows of good stories where its harem style with good character development centered around a Harry/f with a smidge of f/f, smut is definitely welcome.


** The Power of Seven - linkao3(14253384)

"Harry realizes that he's a horcrux a year early. Desperate to help her best friend, Hermione discovers a ritual that can save him. The problem? Harry needs to have sex with and bond with seven witches."

The writing is pretty good and it gets consistent bi-weekly updates.

***** Hmm. I'd recommend Fugue - linkao3(16999143) - but it's unfortunately abandoned/indefinitely on hold. What's there is really good though.

If you're interested in Harry/non-human (veela, mermaid, sphinx etc) you should check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/dirtyuncle/pseuds/dirtyuncle][dirtyuncle's oeuvre]]. It's on the smut-heavy side of things but well done, and his latest story Taming Demons - linkao3(21357481) - is a bit more plot-y.
