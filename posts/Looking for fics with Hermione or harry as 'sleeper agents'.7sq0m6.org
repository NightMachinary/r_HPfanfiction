I expect a lot of people have seen the meme where the trio are on the Express at thr start of third year, Hermione points her wand at Harry 'to fix his glasses' and then kills him. Any fics with some sort of similar premise?


** Not the best one but it has Hermione as a sleeper agent for the good side.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** could be funny as the ultimate bashing fic, everything happens according to canon but ron schemes like crazy and in the end kills Harry and is awarded by Voldemort who adopted him some time before
