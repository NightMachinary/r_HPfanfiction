  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** Been reading Gryffindor's Girl lately. Has canon Harry's memories going into a fem!Harry's mind. The original Harry doesn't take over, but the she does treat it as similarly as she can.

  When a magical backlash causes a rift in space and time, Mary Jane Potter gains the memories of her male counterpart. With only a few years before her inevitable death, Mary works to defeat Voldemort and keep her friends and family safe. Year 3 & 4 complete. Rated M for language, mature themes, and language.
