I'm just going to say who I think Harry's divine parents would be because frankly I'm more interested in your opinion than mine (Something I already know). I would like to see different opinions and ideas.

My opinion:Hades if he is a Greek demigod and Jupter(Ironically) if he is a Roman demigod.


** James: Hermes Sirius: Dionysus Remus: Athena Lily: Athena Severus: Nemesis

** iirc he doesn't have many children in the pjo series, but i think it's interesting to think of snape as a weird goth child of dionysus

** I had a half formed idea for a crossover where some of the HP characters had divine parents or had been divinely blessed. The goal was to feature all 12 in some form when the Seven were included too.

Mrs Weasley welcomes an old crone into the Burrow and her hospitality gets her current pregnancy (Ron) to have Hera's blessing.

Frank Longbottom never married Alice, instead he had an encounter with Demeter.

Harry was tricky. There were 3 possibilities that could have worked. Artemis would be impressed that James can turn himself into a stag and so she put a minor boon on him that instead of dying he'd turn into a stag (hence saving him at Halloween). Apollo might have seen that he was a child of prophecy and given some blessings. Hestia would give a blessing when Lily sacrificed herself, then she would help him along to having to sacrifice himself to destroy the Horcrux. I probably wouldn't do all of them at once, and I liked the idea of Harry being one of the spares at the Hermes cabin rather than an extra secret power. (So probably just nix the Apollo idea).

In which case we can say that Xenophilius and Apollo had a good time and neither were surprised when Luna showed up.

[I also had the idea that Cedric was a son of Dionysus. At the graveyard Tom gets the idea (from Kronos) to use Cedric as the flesh/host of his new body. Cedric is still alive but has no control until Tom gets drunk. The villains work together to take over the world and Cedric and Luke are just watching.

I actually thought OotP would be fun if “Cedric” came back to Hogwarts but sided with the Ministry even though he was Voldemort.]

*** Not familiar with Percy Jackson but aren't Artemis, Athena and Hestia eternal virgins according to the Greek mythology?

**** Yeah, that's why they are giving blessings to already conceived children.
