House-Elves genuinely enjoy many of the tasks we consider tedious chores, and they especially enjoy helping and/or taking care of people. For an elf, working for someone is an act of love. This is why they get so insulted by offers of payment - if you did something you enjoyed to help someone you loved, how would you feel if they tried to treat it as nothing more than a business transaction? How about if your Significant Other left cash on the dresser after lovemaking (as anything other than a joke)?

This is also why the Hogwarts elves are so disgusted with Dobby: To them, he's basically a whore.

I'll admit that this take doesn't explain everything we see from House-Elves in HP canon, but it does put an interesting (and sometimes disturbing) new layer on some of it.


** I think the important thing is that house elves are different species. They are not analogues of human slaves, for if they were, they'd be human as muggleborns are analogues of victims of racism and werewolves are analogues of HIV/AID prejudice victims. House elves, like centaurs and goblins, seem to have different biological impulses than humans. They seem to want to help humans and have work. Winky can't function without an owner, house elves at Hogwarts are happy with work and angered by the prospect of freedom, and Dobby - the sole anomaly - only wants what amounts to essentially token pay and vacation time. They all want to work; Dobby is no exception.

Do we look down upon some spiders for killing their mates? Herd animals for showy displays of fighting to earn the affectations of a mate? The fact that we look down upon house elves for their biology simply because they're sentient reflects what I consider another form of prejudice, that any sentient being must be a mirror of us.

We ourselves are influenced by our biological imperatives as any species. Why is racism so prevalent? Because of biological impulses over in-groups and out-groups that reflected past evolutionary pressures over competition between groups. Because of biological impulses over heuristics to ensure that thinking is more efficient, despite the fact that it also leads to stereotyping. Dobby's rejection of his biological influences may be what autism might be to us, where those afflicted with the disorder can struggle with nonverbal language that comes innately to us humans. Is the treatment of Dobby by his fellow house-elves right? No, like human treatment of those on the spectrum is often immoral.

But forcing house elves to accept freedom *without an attempt to educate house-elves and change their culture by allowing them to confront their own biological impulses* (as we have confronted our own) is, in my mind, just as bad as deliberately mis-treating an elf.

AIDS victims turn into monsterous murder machines and lose all control and want to do nothing but infect others? They, as a community, choose to cause crimes against humanity in the name of a fascist leader whose main goals are power and an ethnical purge? AIDS is spread solely through acts of violence

Like, I get the supposed parallels (incurable disease and all that), but given what we see of werewolves in canon, saying that it is an AIDS metaphor is honestly something I'd expect to read in a 4chan greentext since that's their brand of dark humour.

It seems to be the one comment of hers that everyone, regardless of ideology, is horrified by.

Almost certain [[/u/Impossible-Poetry]] is arguing that since lycanthropes and muggleborn are explicit analogues for the other two groups by authorial intent, the lack of similar treatment by the author in canon is evidence house elves were never intended as an analogue for slavery. Not claiming that people with AIDS are cannibalistic predators.

  Remus Lupin's affliction was a conscious reference to blood-borne diseases such as the HIV infection, with the attendant stigma. The potion Snape brews him is akin to the antiretroviral that will keep him from developing the ‘full-blown' version of his illness. The sense of ‘apartness' that the management of a chronic condition can impose on its sufferers was an important part of Lupin's character.

The more important bit is where Lupin is sent to negotiate the neutrality of the werewolves (unknown if merely the British ones or the European community) and they choose violence and what can best be described as crimes against humanity or war crimes in his service. Lupin did not report that they were divided on the issue or anything which would imply that it was less than the overwhelming majority who joined Voldemort.

****** You can support a cause without committing violence. I don't recall any werewolves besides Greyback who acted as a snatcher and I don't even recall any werewolves at the Battle of Hogwarts. Most of it is implied.

In any event, of course it doesn't excuse their actions. But it certainly explains the context and motivation behind such actions. When an entire minority is looked down upon, discriminated against, and treated poorly, it's not exactly a surprise when built up resentment and desperation leads to them joining the first cause to promise them better treatment.

Greyback is implied to threaten many people into service and that's not even considering how Voldemort was effectively the ministry for a few months. Voldemort controlled the symbol of authority for magical Britain. Ever study (not just read) the Milgram experiments? There's a reason as to how Nazi Germany ever happened.

To reduce such a complex issue into black and white is an oversimplification. It's why psychology exists as a subject. Understanding is not the same as excusing. It's this same type of reduction that leads to prejudice of all types.

******* Nazi Germany happened because the parties in the Weimar repubilic could not work together nor sort out the issues of postwar Germany. Add Versailles, a hyperinflation, a global economic crisis and a long list of failed governments, and you get a rise of extremism on both sides which led to street fighting, which made the state look even more failed, which further added to extremists popularity. In the end, the Nazis took over since people were desperate for any alternative.

The big issue with Voldemort's movement is that canon has no magical Versailles or troubled governments which would explain why Voldemort gained mainstream appeal. He caused the crisis in government later on, but that does not explain why many people who were doing alright in life joined him.

*** There is so much wrong with this post that its frightening.

No, you cannot hand-wave away House Elf slavery as okay by saying that they're a different species, and that its just in their nature to be slaves. Because we see that House Elves express a range of different views on the subject. Different biology or not, they are clearly self-aware individuals who possess a range of individual thoughts and feelings on the subject, not a hive mind.

Also, while rivalries between different groups has doubtless been part of humanity since the beginning, there is some reason to believe that the dominant form of modern racism, systemic white supremacism, is relatively recent. It seems to have largely grown up as a rationalization for (highly profitable) colonialism, imperialism, and plantation slavery over the last several hundred years, not something that is biologically hard-coded into all humans.

I'm pretty sure "rejection of his biological impulses" is not an accurate definition of autism, either.

**** At the very end I literally note that house elves should be given the opportunity to change their own culture. But I suppose your comment couldn't have been as dramatic without an implicit accusation of racism.

And while I don't believe that house elves all want to be slaves, it's pretty clear they all want to work. Not even Dobby, the most egregious anomaly in the house elf community, disagrees. Acromantula are a suitable comparison; they are a sentient magical species that also consume humans (sentient as well) because they are incapable of overriding those impulses.

Yes, while racism has become systemic and codified more recently, to say that it was around before would not be true. To say that racism did not come around because of innate heuristics that have been programmed into humans since the evolution of man would equally be as foolish. Why do proper stereotype? Because it helps people think faster. Why do people support their in-group? Because of biological impulses. Why do people obey authority? Because of biological impulses.

Rejection, fair enough, was a poor choice of words. It's certainly not conscious on the part of those afflicted. And yes, the disorder means that those afflicted can struggle with socialization as a result of the disease.

****** Bias /is/ an inherent part of human neurology/psychology, an effect of the cognitive shortcuts our brains take in order to process a complex world in real time. /Acting/ on that bias is a decision made by individuals and societies. All of us, whether we want to admit it or not, have brains that will try and stereotype people, but we are in no way forced to accept this stereotyping. We are entirely able to check our thoughts and go "No, that's not right." and it is each individual's responsibility to do so.

Instinctually seeking to benefit one's own group is a basic feature of /all/ social animals for obvious evolutionary reasons. Again, that doesn't mean that we as sapient beings are unable to override this urge.

Impossible-Poetry's points seem to be that /everyone/ has some form of prejudice and desire to disproportionately benefit their "us" over "them", both of which are entirely true. Nowhere do they state that this justifies or excuses bigotry, only that it explains its origins. If anyone here is "protesting too much", perhaps it's the person freaking out over having it pointed out that they, too, have implicit biases?

My point is that there are many factors underlying things like racism, including biological impulses. I actually studied biology and psychology, so I do, in fact, know what I'm talking about. I'm also a minority in my country (US) that's discriminated against fairly often, so I even have first-hand experience of what I learned about. So yes, I suppose I was offended.

** That's the problem, though- it doesn't fit what we see in canon, and while a fanfic can to a point ignore that, ignoring it in this case comes off as trying to make justifications for something that as depicted is blatantly slavery.

I think the most important thing to remember when writing House Elves (or anybody else) is that they are sentient beings. They're individuals. They are not going to all have one single view on things, either culturally or biologically, that is hard-coded into all of them. So some house elves might be genuinely fine with serving without payment, for a variety of reasons, and some (Kreacher, Winky) might be okay with serving one master but not another, and others might accept it because they feel they have no other options, and others (like Dobby) might object, to varying degrees. And the central problem with the way house elves are treated is that it doesn't afford them the right to make that choice.

The other thing to remember is that its hard to say how much of "house elf culture" is really there's, after centuries of Wizarding indoctrination, abuse, and control. Do house elves like Winky want to serve because that's their "nature" or culture... or because they've been basically brainwashed from birth to believe that's what they're supposed to think? One of the saddest things about human history is how many times you see people accept and even praise their own horrific abuse and tyranny because propaganda backed up by overwhelming punishment for disobedience has taught them to do so.

** I agree with you, but I would not be to judgmental towards either Dobby or Hermione. Just like an SO, house elves still need love from their owner. Kreacher is the prime example of how loyal he stays to Walburga (despite she being a bigot), hates Sirius (despite being a good character) and then radically changes his attitude when Harry decides to treat him well. It's quite clear that Dobby was suffering abuse at the hands of Lucius (and possibly Draco), but it's also possible that he liked Narcissa. Same with Winky, Crouch Sr suffered a public humiliation when it was believed that she stole a wand cast the dark mark, but otherwise both him and his son were nice to her.

Edit: as a general observation, it seems like women are more empathetic to house elves. Kreacher loved Walburga but only liked Orion. Hermione cared about their rights, but Harry and Ron were rather indifferent as long as they were not being mistreated. Also Bellatrix and Narcissa (despite being on the baddies side) knew how to make Kreacher feel loved, as opposed to Sirius (who was on the good guys side).

** House-Elves, or at least the mechanism that binds them as slaves, is /clearly/ artificial in nature. There is no way that something like "you are a slave, bound to one family, unless that family gives you a piece of clothing to own" evolves naturally, even with magical assistance. It's too specific, convenient and solely beneficial to the wizards not to be an artificial mechanism to keep slaves compliant.

What you're using are three of the most prolific arguments used by white slave owners in american history: "They want it", "It's necessary" and "It's natural". The brownie connection exists, as well - but the brownies had free will and could leave at any time. House-elves cannot. I know you didn't mention it on your post but it is often brought up as an argument to support their slavery.

Additionally, from the way they exist, we can reasonably deduce that very little of "house-elf culture" isn't also artificial. They exhibit all the signs of an indoctrinated species that passes on constructed morals and beliefs through the generations to keep them docile.

*** Nowhere in my entire post did I bring up their bonding/enslavement, as that's a related but different topic. The bond could easily be an exploitation of the elves' helpful nature. As for the cultural aspect of rejecting pay and looking down on those who ask for pay, that would mirror our own cultural stigma against sex workers - a thing that exists and explains certain behavior, but not something I think is positive.

Remember that house-elves are very obviously based on Brownies, a type of fae known to do various helpful things (fixing shoes is one of the more iconic, IIRC), but who will take offense and leave if you try to pay them. That's the Doylian explanation of things, more than any metaphor or analogy. I was just trying to float a different Watsonian explanation.

**** You keep bringing up the point of "but they like it!" or "But it's their culture!". The slave-bond disproves this. Enslaving a species that thrives in slavery is still slavery, and it doesn't make said slavery right. Especially when you're going off things wizards have said in the books, not the words of house-elves themselves - two of the three we see abhor their masters and are abused, and the third is used as a scapegoat and then half drinks herself to death. That is /not/ a brownie mentality. A brownie would have cursed Barty Crouch's foot to always hit every piece of furniture in his house and then bent all his forks, then she'd have vanished and appeared somewhere her efforts are more appreciated.

Perhaps House-Elves are brownies, but the "culture" you describe is a warped, twisted form of the brownie mentality as described in mythology. And that warped, twisted form is enabled and perpetuated through the continued enslavement.

***** I am seriously questioning what post you read, because it does not seem to be mine. My post speculated on how they might perceive the world differently from your average human and how that could result in the observed behavoir. It assigned no value-judgements (other than a positive value to observed altruistic tendencies) and never touched on the forced nature of house-elf servitude.

If I were to attempt a deeper dive on the bonding of house-elves, I would speculate that they began as something very similar to the brownies of folklore but were either tricked or coerced into magically-bound servitude by wizards a long time ago. Now, their instinctual desire to help out (whether out of altruism or simply enjoying the work) is exploited while the bond permits them to be abused without recourse. Their rejection of pay would thus be a combination of their attitude when free (how dare you treat this as nothing more than a business transaction!) and cultural/magical indoctrination.

TL;DR: I think that house-elves genuinely do enjoy their work and care about their families, at least when they're treated well, but that does not excuse coercion and abuse.
