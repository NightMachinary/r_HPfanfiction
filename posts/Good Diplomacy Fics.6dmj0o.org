Can anyone recommend a story where the good guys use diplomacy and it's done well?

Not stories where the author makes up a new traditional magical custom whenever it gets them out of trouble, or stories where someone treats a goblin with basic decency and the entire nation falls in love with them. But stories where accumulating allies through realistic negotiation is a major theme.

I'm asking mostly because I'm trying to write such a scene myself and completely failing. I thought other authors' takes might inspire me. Alternatively, if anyone knows any resources or advice for this, that would be helpful too.


** The only one I can really think of from the top of my head is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]]. There's plenty of diplomacy there, although some aspects of the world do get reinterpreted to give it more of a place than it had in canon, at least that's the impression I get. linkffn(11574569).

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
