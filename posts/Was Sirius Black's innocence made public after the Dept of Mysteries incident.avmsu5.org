From the books, I remember that while Sirius was alive Harry, Dumbledore, and friends didn't make any attempts to convince people of his innocence, even to DA members, and that his name eventually gets cleared by the ministry by the beginning of HBP.

But was the general public made aware of that information in the books? If so, how were the public informed? Was Pettigrew's guilt and Death Eater involvement then also made public?

Unfortunately, I can't seem to find either of my copies of books 5 and 6.

Thanks in advance!

  The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.

  "Is Serious Black with--er--He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"

  "Black? Black?" said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. "Sirius Black, you mean? Merlin's beard, no. Black's dead. Turns out we were--er--mistaken about Black. He was innocent after all. And he wasn't in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean," he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, "all the evidence pointed--we had more than fifty eyewitnesses--but anyway, as I say, he's dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There's going to be an inquiry, actually. . . "

*** I didn't realize that the books never mentioned whether or not he was officially cleared. I guess I've read so much fanfics where that was the case, that I forgot it didn't happen in the books.

Thanks for the clarification!
