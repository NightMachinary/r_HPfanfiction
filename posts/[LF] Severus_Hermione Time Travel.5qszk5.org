I'm looking for a Sermione fic where Hermione and Severus are together in any random version of the future and one or the other or both have to travel back in time for some reason. I'm sure that you can, err, imagine the angst of a school-aged witch with the mind of someone substantially older pinning for a Professor who told her that her teeth looked better when they weren't in her mouth. Or, you know, Severus becoming a complete bastard because he can't leave the school - they had to have had some plan with the time travel - and completely avoiding Hermione while being impulsively angry and caring at the same time. Or the more, ahh, elicit version where they both end up back in time and try avoiding each other but end up snogging in a corner of the library. Or the awkward and bittersweet one where they go really far into the past and Hermione only remembers fragments of the future as she grows up while Severus remembers everything. He tries to avoid her but she ends up finding him in a world where everything is different, he still has no self worth and, even though he's the reason, say, the Potters aren't dead or Voldemort actually died first year instead of flirting off like a sad wraith or that they have a fighting chance this time around, he thinks she will be better of without him. The confusing memories of another person inhabiting the indifferent mans skin driver the young one a bit crazy and it's not until a lot of time has passed that she manages to corner him properly and he cracks. Err, excuse me - I got a bit carried away. I could keep going, but it would only drive me a bit spare as there is no story to the plotless synopsizes my brain has conceived. Any that vaguely follow any strand of that sort of AU would be greatly appreciated and the recommender would hold my eternal gratitude and devotion.

*** The WIP is very well written, but not exactly what I'm looking for. When it's done, however, I might have to add it to my list of favorites. Thank you for the recommendations â‚¬:

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

**** I would point out that it isn't SSHG, but I don't quite think you - who deleted your post - would know I said so -~-

** If I understand your post correctly you are looking for a Peggy Sue fic but with sshg? You know, despite reading a crap ton of sshg I can't recall one like that. At least not one that's completed. I don't read alot of WIPs.

*** (After looking up what the 'Peggy Sue' trope is) I would say that yes, that is the kind of story I am searching for. I have read a large quantity of SSHG fics but this idea does not seem to have met that community, perhaps it's a taboo I am ignorant too, but I still felt the need to ask for one. At least, this might seed the idea for something in a few years. These are the sorts of ideas that tend to eat away at your brain until all rational thought is gone... I've seen SSHG time travel in a few instances, but never where their together before she (because it's never him) goes back in time. Only, one where it was because he knew her that she went back in the first place to get to know him.

Edit: Avidly avoiding WIP fics, unless they are presented under the guise of brilliance, is one of my life's duties. I have no need for more anticipatory events to cloud my mind from education and work. FF and VG's have done enough damage there to suffice for a lifetime.
