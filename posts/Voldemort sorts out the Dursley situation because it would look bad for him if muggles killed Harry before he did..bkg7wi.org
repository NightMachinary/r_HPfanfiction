** Voldemort does his best to make Harry rich, healthy, well-educated and popular, because otherwise being stuck with a teenage archnemesis just makes him look incompetent (it's bad enough that he was killed by Harry when he was just a baby).

"My lord, I have good news! I was able to confound the Dursleys into mistreating Harry without Dumbledore noticing. I've also arranged for some of the Slytherins to work on sabotaging his learning at Hogwarts and slander the Boy-Who-Lived, and, believe it or not, I succeeded in swapping all the gold in his Gringotts vault for worthless paper mache."\\
"Uh...great. Now go back and confound the Dursleys into being proper parents, have the Slytherins leave Harry alone, and put his gold back."\\
"Err...why, my lord?"\\
"Because I can't maintain an image of superiority if my notorious greatest enemy is reduced to a delinquent sickly poverty-stricken teenager. It's like claiming to be a dragonslayer after stepping on a lizard. I'd be laughed at."

** Voldemort sat quietly on his throne, brooding.

“WORMTAIL!” He suddenly snapped. The balding rat-man scurried into the room, looking so much like his animagus form that Nagini tasted the air with interest. Wormtail groveled furiously, wondering if he was about to receive another crucio.

“M... my lord?”

“Tell me, Wormtail, your thoughts on Harry Potter. You had the opportunity to observe him for three years, did you not?”

“Y-yes, my lord. H-he is an average wiz-wizard, not particularly intelligent. His classmates feared him in his second year, because he possess your noble gift, my lord. Dr-Draco Malfoy and Snape have been working to sabotage his education. While I was at the Weasley's, the twins mentioned having to pull bars off his window and rescue him from his muggle relatives. He looks starved. He has a pathological hero complex and is an average wizard at best.” Wormtail's voice gained strength as no crucios seemed to be forthcoming.

“Oh? I am impressed, Wormtail. I did not know you knew the word ‘pathological,'” Voldemort's voice was sibilant. “Tell me, Wormtail, is Harry Potter a worthy opponent?”

“No, my lord! He survives due to pure chance and luck. But his luck will run out.” Had Wormtail been more observant, he perhaps would have noticed that was precisely the wrong thing to say.

“I had cause, Wormtail, in my youth, to travel extensively,” Voldemort hissed. “I sought the secrets of magic, of the beings revered as gods, the power of death itself! And do you know what I learned, Wormtail?” Wormtail shivered in fear as he realized too late that Voldemort had gone past so far past furious that he could see the back of its head.

“That you would not make their mistakes, my lord, and succeed where they had failed?”

“NO!” The word echoed in the cavernous hall of Riddle Manor. “I learned, Wormtail, that a man is judged as much by his enemies as by his skill. A tyrant who has defeated skilled warriors in battle is feared; a tyrant who rules over farmers and brainless peasants is usurped. Even in death, those feared tyrants were spoken of in whispered awe! Who was Grindelwald's arch-nemesis? None other than the very Albus Dumbledore himself! What does it say about me, Wormtail, that my still-surviving nemesis is a sickly, abused, ill-educated teenager? Who, I might remind you, is STILL NOT DEAD!”

The shout rang off the walls, the echo fading into the oppressive silence.

“Wouldn't that make him more dangerous, my lord?” Wormtail ventured, regretting it sorely before the first syllable even left his mouth.

“CRUCIO! I have gone further down the path to immortality than any other, Wormtail. I have little to fear from any would-be hero. It suits my plans, that they do not acknowledge my return. But do you know what that means, Wormtail?”

“M-m-my l-lord is br-brilliant?”

“THEY BELIEVE A BABY COULD HAVE DEFEATED ME! /ME!/ THE GREATEST WIZARD THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN! SALAZAR'S HEIR, THE COMMANDER OF THE KING OF SNAKES! CRUCIO!” There was silence for a moment, punctuated by Wormtail's broken screams.

“They believe,” he continued softly, “that a baby who has grown into a pathetic excuse of a wizard, defeated me so thoroughly I could not return. They ridicule him even now for being unhinged and a liar. The hapless boy-wonder the world has cast as my nemesis, mocked and ridiculed by his own. For proclaiming my return, for fearing me as he should! No. No. I will not have it. I will not have the world look at that fool and think that he is my equal. Dumbledore is a has-been, but a powerful has-been. Even now, Harry Potter is kept from me by the old fool. There would be no shame, there. But he, according the sheep of the wizarding world, is not my enemy. Harry Potter is. I will not stand for it!”

“They claim Dumbledore is the only one you ever feared, master.” Wormtail ventured, wondering at the awakening of long-dormant suicidal gryffindorish tendencies.

“They do not hold him as my defeater! They will look to Harry Potter to defeat me, when my triumphant return is made. Spread the word, Wormtail, I reserve the right to kill him myself. I shall be severely... displeased... if I discover so much as an *attempt* on his life. And fetch me the Malfoys and Snape. We will ensure that Harry Potter is every inch the hero---idiotic, courageous, popular, and alive. When I kill him, I want the wizarding world to know even its best and its brightest could not stand in the face of my might. But first, Wormtail, you will see to it that his relatives are dead and Harry Potter unable to return to their home---without revealing my return or exciting that fool Fudge into doing something stupid that would lose us a valuable, if incompetent, ally.

“As bad as this situation is, it would be infinitely worse for the boy to be killed by worthless muggles before I can kill him.”

***** It's really good. I'm an extremely picky reader and i must say, i wish i can match that kind of writing when i try my hand at fanficiton. The only thing that i think could make it better is using, in the last time that Wormtail spoke, whispered instead of ventured, he was crucio-ed a couple of times after all.

** "But, my lord, why must we wait until june to make our final move for the prophecy? Why not in, say, december?"

"We must let Potter have a chance to finish his exams without interruptions, Lucius. I will not have the symbol that overcame me be an imbecile. Let him have his education. Just imagine if he missed an entire year because he was wounded in our fights... He'd be behind */everyone/* in class! No, no, that will not do."

"My lord, it would be easier to-"

"/I have standards, thank you very much!/ Just think; when we finally do glorious battle and everyone remembers him as that kid who failed all his exams! I'd be laughed out of office!"

"But- My lord, I"

"No. It's final. I let him have his exams before our confrontation over the stone, my younger self waited until the end of the year too, Wormtail only rejoined me after his exams, the third task was in june, I've managed to be consistent so far. I MUST let him sit his OWLS first. It's final."

"As you say, my lord."

"And make sure to give him that one instructor -what's his name again?- who is a complete fanboy of the patronus charm as his judge for his DADA owl. That way, he's bound to get an outstanding regardless of him not learning the theory. He */needs/* to have an outstanding on that subject, Lucius. He's the chosen one to stand against a Dark Lord, just imagine if he turned out to fail at DADA... "

** Not a response, but interesting none the less:

In ye olde times, back in roughly 180BC there was a military general called Hannibal Barca, from a place called Carthage, he was seen as one of the best strategists of the time and still considered so to this day.

He was defeated by a Roman general man named Scipio Africanus, similarly to this prompt, the historians who worked for the Romans at the time were thought to have been told to actually embellish Hannibal's victory's to make him seem like a better general.

They did this so that when they recorded Hannibal's defeat at the hands of Scipio it was seen as a much bigger achievement for Scipio to have defeated this “great strategist”

** The green eyes of the boy hero narrowed. "I got a strange letter last week." he said.

"What does that have to do with this? Give me the stone!"

"It said my aunt was looking forward to seeing me home. It said that my uncle was dead and my cousin's in the slammer. I think you had something to do with it." he said.

"THE STONE!"

"No." said Harry Potter. "You can't touch me, not even a bit. I don't know why, but I'm not going to give that up. I'm not stupid."

Voldemort re-evaluated him. He truly wasn't. He might seem that on first glance, but it was really more that he didn't particularly care to define his success on the same metric as everyone else. He failed in class, yes, but he failed in conjunction with one of his closest allies which facilitated common ground, and a connection through tutoring with his other one. Perhaps...

"You think I was involved with the letter." he said.

"Yes." said Harry Potter. "I think you arranged whatever happened to make my aunt nice and my uncle gone."

"What are you going to do about it?" asked Voldemort.

"Why did you do it?" returned Harry.

"We are judged by the quality of our enemies Harry Potter. I don't intend to merely conquer this world, I will crush it. I will be known as the greatest Dark Lord in history, and I cannot do that if my greatest enemy is a baby."

Harry Potter smirked. "So even if you wanted to you couldn't kill me now." he said. "Because I'm eleven."

Voldemort seethed. It seemed that Potter had figured out that he was holding all the cards.

"Someday I'll be a hero though, and you will." said Potter.

"I will duel you to the ground and torture you until you are screaming for mercy." threatened Voldemort.

"There's a slight problem with that." said Potter. "I don't want to die. And frankly I don't care much about being a hero. The only thing I've ever wanted was the end of the Dursleys, and well... that's done now, mostly."

"What do you want then?"

"A lot of things now." said Potter. "And I have some things you want. Shall we do business?"

---------

4 Years Later

---------

Harry Potter walked into the graveyard with a smirk on his face. It was finally over.

"Here." he said. "One diadem, one diary, and the link to the hole in Hogwarts wards."

"Did you get the wand?" asked Voldemort. He was leaning against a desecrated gravestone that Harry suspected had once belonged to Tom Riddle.

"Yes, but I rather think I'd like to keep it, if it's all the same to you."

It wasn't, but Voldemort and Harry knew each other rather well by that point, and there were some things that weren't up for negotiation.

"Here's your identity." said Voldemort. "I imagine you'll have to use glamours for a while, but as of today Harry Potter is dead. Congratulations, you got what you wanted."

"Don't look so glum." said Harry. "I put on quite a display in the past few months. Your defeat of me is a perfectly legitimate one."

"Without an audience. Are you sure you won't become a death eater?"

"I already tried slavery, thanks. You might have gotten me out of it but it doesn't make me any more keen for a new master."

"Shame." said Voldemort. "Good luck then."

"I have it. Felix Felecis isn't that hard to brew. And who knows, I might show up in a century or two." said Harry. "It'll be interesting to see what you've done with the place."

"I won't look forward to it."

Harry chuckled. "Well you have a very long time to change your mind."
