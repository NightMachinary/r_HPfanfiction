The only known creator of the Philosopher Stone in the series is Nicolas Flamel. Also would you think that gold is one of Gamp's exceptions? Why so?

In addition to that, can you think of other elements that are immune to magic? I've seen a few fics making lava and rocks of volcanic origin as immune to magic. Thoughts?


** Because Transfiguring a base metal into gold does not change the past of the gold, ie. it remembers having been a base metal once (and can thus be Untransfigured). On the other hand, alchemy removes the history of the metal, and the gold is just that, gold. It cannot be Untransfigured because it does not remember being anything but gold.

I think canon supports this. Of note is the fact that Leprechauns can conjure gold, and Voldemort can conjure silver (Pettigrew's hand; silver shield), but like all conjured objects these will vanish. The former vanishes after a few hours, but Voldemort's conjuration (silver hand) lasts for 3+ years.

Edit: I don't think gold is an exception to Gamp's Law. Hermione states that good food can't be conjured, and Leprechauns conjuring fool's gold would directly go against a similar statement for gold.

**** True, and it would make things simpler if that were the case. Given that Hermione is the first in her class (in a first year class) to turn her match "silver and pointy," you could say that the transfigurations were simply metallic. It's the Leprechauns that throw a wrench into this explanation. I suppose you can say that the Leprechauns conjure metals that look like gold (Hermione's fake galleons come to mind), but it all seems a bit hand-wavy.

***** I'm sure there are several explanations that someone could come up with to explain the leprechaun gold, but they all bring us firmly into the realm of headcanon, and I'm not sure it's possible for then not to be hand-wavy.

The easiest solution is to probably just say that leprechaun magic works different than human magic. There's already plenty of support for the idea that different species have different types of magic (particularly house elves), and Gamp's Law could very easily be a description of the limitations of human magic, because that's all that most humans care about, and not the limitations of magic as a whole.

*** I disagree with the Untransfiguration argument. I think it's complicating things, and it's not needed to explain what we see in Canon.

If we simply assume "Untransfiguration" is just another transfiguration, the instances in Canon where this might happen still can be resolved, simply by assuming they weren't full transfigurations. We know bad transfigurations are hybrids, like a mouse-snuffbox mashup. It would be rather easy to "untransfigure" that: What the item was is still clear. And in the same way, one could imagine an almost-perfect transfiguration, and the "almost" part allows a skilled wizard to transfigure it back.

And for the most noticeable cases of supposed untransfiguration we see, Draco and Slughorn, this makes perfect sense: We /know/ transfigured humans don't retain their senses, yet both of them clearly remember having been a ferret resp. a chair. So it stands to reason they were only superficially transfigured, and kept, say, their brain, so McGonagall could transfigure Draco back, and Chair!Slughorn could transfigure himself back.

The upside of assuming this is how (un)transfiguration works is that you don't need any strange magical memory: The transfigured wood is the same as any other wood, there is no difference in the quality of the matter, either physically /or/ magically.

And that aside, if one at all needs magical residue, then I prefer Dumbledore's take: Magic leaves traces, yes, but on (or around) the object, not /as part of/ the object.

.

So for the gold, if one /could/ create it by transfiguration, that would be that, except one just can't. It doesn't work; nothing happens if you try.

It is important to note that you're creating a distinction here: Full transfigurations.

#+begin_quote

Is this "almost part" a physical aspect or an intangible one?

#+end_quote

I will argue that Malfoy and Slughorn were not superficially transfigured. We know it is possible for humans to retain their minds in non-human (more specifically, animal) forms (animagi), and that might be the case for Malfoy and Slughorn. I'm not sure whether there is a statement in canon that contradicts this (transfigured humans do not possess their minds in their transformed state, barring animagi). Therefore, they can be untransifgured because the ferret/armchair possesses an intangible aspect that remembers the untransfigured state.

#+begin_quote
  The transfigured wood is the same as any other wood, there is no difference in the quality of the matter, either physically /or/ magically.

This is something I agree with- that the wood is indistinguishable from an oridnary tree that does not possess any exceptional magical properties (eg. wand wood).

  Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came

  zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two

  smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goalposts. A rainbow arced suddenly

  across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and

  aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the

  balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering

  shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands.

  Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it ---

  “Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and *heavy gold*

  *coins rained from it*, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the

  shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny

  little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or

  green.

Assuming this isn't a conjuration, and the DA coins were the product of a colour change charm or something, then it is a neat solution.

***** Yes, that'd be me.

Anyway, right, the distinction of "full transfiguration" follows naturally for me, given that we see partial transfigurations all the time, unintentionally (say, the Former-Teakettle-Still-Steaming-Tortoise) and intentionally (Krum's shark body). And yes, the "keeping their mind" point is made w.r.t. Animagi; in Beedle's Tales, Dumbledore notes

#+begin_quote
  Animagi do not retain the power of human speech while in their animal form, although they keep all their human thinking and reasoning powers. This, as every schoolchild knows, is the fundamental difference between being an Animagus and Transfiguring oneself into an animal. In the case of the latter, one would become the animal entirely, with the consequence that one would know no magic, be unaware that one had ever been a wizard, and would need somebody else to Transfigure one back to one's original form.
#+end_quote

In fact, I would cite this as tentative evidence for my entire point, given that it is specifically said to be "becom[ing] the animal entirely", and "transfigure [...] back", not untransfigure. Whether the difference between a full and a partial transfiguration needs to be a physical (if perhaps invisible) aspect is open to debate; I don't truly mind things missing some intangible aspect -- say, a sense of self, that wasn't transfigured away, in the case of Draco and Slughorn -- so long as /in principle/ it is possible to produce perfect transfigurations with no difference at all.

#+begin_quote
  And that is my point. I'm arguing that the transfigured object has a history and it remembers that history. It may be that the history is not part of the object itself, but is instead associated with the object, but it does exist.
#+end_quote

Yes, and I got that, but to me, that is introducing a difference between X and Transfigured X by the backdoor. They aren't /truly/ the same anymore, because one has that history and the other doesn't. My distinction would be that the trace left behind could be removed from the object (or the object from the trace, for that matter). If it exists, it wouldn't be something that's tied to the object in any sense, rather something vaguely floating around and perhaps also eventually fading away.

.

Regarding the Leprechauns: I always regarded that as simply something else than gold entirely. Like, we have alloys that look like gold but aren't (e.g. fool's gold), and this is the magical equivalent, a substance called "Leprechaun gold" that in fact has nothing to do with gold, just looks like it, and eventually fades. Something like that you could transfigure all day long, of course.

But I will say that "it's real gold, but fades because you can't transfigure it" is a very coherent approach, if you consider that to be how transfiguration works. I didn't make that connection before now.

****** Pardon me; I've been quite vague when I said "full transfiguration." I do not use that term to represent the examples you've cited. Say, the fact that the transfiguration of Malfoy into a ferret was not "full" because it was performed by Moddy, but would have been "full" had it been performed by Dumbledore, ie. there would have been no trace of Malfoy left (not an "almost" perfect transfiguration, but a perfect one). I see you've adressed this in your next paragraph.

The passage you've cited certainly supports the point you're trying to make.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I agree with this. It seems to tie up the loose ends, so to speak. So Malfoy, Slughorn and even Thickenesse the Sea-Urchin in DH would possess that sense that sense of self, but it would have been possible to transfigure them without allowing for the sense of self to exist in the transfigured state. The latter would, if it existed, be Dark Magic, I think. Perhaps, something similar to the legend of Quintapeds?

#+begin_quote
  They aren't /truly/ the same anymore, because one has that history and the other doesn't.
#+end_quote

And here I would insist on that distinction to separate Transfiguration from Alchemy. That is, the history would remain associated with that object and would separate it from a naturally occurring, identical object by virtue of allowing itself to be untransfigured. This is a difference in opinion.

#+begin_quote
  My distinction would be that the trace left behind could be removed from the object (or the object from the trace, for that matter).
#+end_quote

This, I think I would disagree with. Or at least say that the removal or perhaps obscuring of that trace would be Dark Magic and not simply a very skillfully performed Transfiguration.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, and if true, Gold would fit into Principal Exceptions of Gamp's Law. JKR said that she had read up on Alchemy to write the HP series, and Gold is considered the perfect metal in alchemy. The counter-point would be that JKR uses silver quite consistently (primarily conjured by Voldemorty), and hence, I would presume that when she says gold, she does, in fact, mean gold.

#+begin_quote
  But I will say that "it's real gold, but fades because you can't transfigure it" is a very coherent approach, if you consider that to be how transfiguration works. I didn't make that connection before now.
#+end_quote

This a little tricky for me. When I say the Leprechauns' gold fades away, I say so because it is an essential property of all conjured objects. A skilled wizard like Voldemort could make nearly permanent objects via conjuration, but even his conjurations would vanish one day. This is from JKR's interview, paraphrased: "Conjured objects do not last."

On the other hand, if a wizard transfigures an object into gold (DA galleons which Neville supposedly showed off to his students during his years as a Hogwarts Professor), then the gold would be physically and magically identical to naturally occurring gold, but would possess that instrinsic property that would allow for it to be untransfigured.

#+begin_quote
  If it exists, it wouldn't be something that's tied to the object in any sense, rather *something vaguely floating around* and perhaps also eventually fading away.
#+end_quote

And this is what would separate (say) a transfigured golden needle from a needle forged by a muggle from naturally occurring gold. This would be a property of a transfigured object because it is uniquely inherent to it.

Additionally, this would also be what is truly remarkable about the Philosopher's Stone: the transformation of base metals into gold is permanent; there is no room for +untransfiguration+ the possibility of the transformation being undone.

The Wizarding World article on animagi says:

#+begin_quote
  *You do not adopt the life span of the animal you become*[[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/ron-weasley][Ron]] was always so bewildered that his pet Scabbers managed to live for so long; 12 years is a very, very old rat. That is, unless you're actually Peter Pettigrew masquerading as a rat, which in this case was true. This means you could theoretically be an animal for decades, far longer than the animal is supposed to live.
#+end_quote

The Philospher's Stone also produces the Elixir of Life which extends the drinker's lifespan. But we know that Transfiguration cannot be used to extend a wizards life (Taure's Lords of Magic headcanon not withstanding). Therefore, a wizard can transfigure himself to look younger, but his lifespan would remain unaltered even if he never untransfigured himself. So there must be a transformation induced by the Elixir which delays death (not aging, if you go by FB2, where Flamel is a feeble old man**). This supports the existence of transfigured objects having a property by virtue of which they can be untransfigured.

Something I once read online when I wanted to write fanfiction:

IIRC, and I'm very annoyed that I have been unable to find that source again, Alchemy occured in 3 stages:

- Firstly, the element would be transformed into a black liquid, where all the impurities would coalese.
- Secondly, the black liquid would turn white and possess no impurties (undesired properties or no properties at all)
- Thirdly, the white liquid would turn red/gold and acquire entirely new properties, before finally solidifying into a new element.

** Gold, in old alchemist belief, represents the Ultimate Perfection (Life, Matter, Spirit, etc, the whole shebang). It's like the Nirvana of metals, basically. And in a lot of mythology, Gold has some odd effects and meanings - I think it's mostly Scandinavian Mythology, but there's also a pattern of curses being attached to Gold. Think Thorin and the Dwarf Gold in the Hobbit.

So, I can imagine Gold has some odd magical properties that make it particularly hard or draining to transfigure stuff into - because it's a 'perfect material', it's really difficult to get transfiguring it /right/ and the efforts can consume you (literally or metaphorically) if you do it wrong. Thus, the Philosopher's Stone is impressive for being able to do it automatically and safely, not necessarily for being able to do it at all.

In one interpretation, non permanent means that it reverses by itself after a while and permanent means that it lasts for an unlimited time. In another interpretation, non permanent means that it can be reversed manually and permanent means that it's irreversible.

To make true gold that could be used as currency you need irreversible transformation where it's impossible to tell that it's artificial.

Canon seems to be permanent in the first interpretation, but non permanent in the second. A transfigured object or person can be untransfigured.

Irreversible transfiguration is honestly pretty scary because the source object is completely destroyed. If you transfigured a person into something else using irreversible transfiguration, the person is dead.

** The most simple causality works the other way round. /Because/ alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone is something special, you cannot transfigure (or conjure) gold.

And the "why" would be like asking why (not how) gravity exists. It just does. That would be how the exceptions to Gamp's work. In practice, I should think simply nothing happens if you try. Your block of wood stays a block of wood. So notably, you're not getting "fake gold", because Transfiguration, if it works (and the caster is capable), is perfect.

** Okay, here's my take.

You can transfigure something to take on the /color/ and /texture/ of gold, but not anything beyond the superficial - you couldn't give it the magical properties, electrical conductivity, that sort of thing. It wouldn't stand up to scrutiny as being actual gold, especially to most magical folk (/especially/ goblins, who don't appreciate being swindled).

This would be similar to food in canon - you can Transfigure something to have the look and texture, but not really the taste or nutritional value (if I remember it right).

The Philosopher's Stone, then, is a way to make /actual/ gold - having all of those properties that Transfiguring something can't confer.

That's not stated. It's one idea people came up with how it works if you try to transfigure food anyway, but it's just that -- an idea.

** IIRC transfiguring gold violates Gamps law bc it creates something of value (the reason you cant transfigure money), which is one of the many parts of canon that makes you go ??, what standard of value is non transfigurational, the capitalist ideas of supply and demand? the marxist interpretation that value is measured in hours of labour? Its a completely arbitrary concept, so to say you cannot transfigure value is like saying you cant transfigure something into being "cute" theres any number of factors to consider what makes it cute.

Anyway I became slightly sidetracked there, another reason for its special status, other than irl reference to the pursuit of alchemy, is (this could be fanon) transfiguration merely makes the new object resemble whatever was chosen, alchemy truly transforms it into something alike the Platonic ideal of the target material, if im making sense.
