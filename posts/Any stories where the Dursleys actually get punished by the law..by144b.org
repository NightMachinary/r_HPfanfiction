I don't care if it was because Harry went to a neighbours with a broken arm, and things snowballed from there, someone notices bruises, or loud yelling which causes the police to find a kid living in a cupboard, etc...

Just want some well deserved justice that doesn't have the regular humans in Azkaban, or being tortured. I'd prefer if this happens before Hogwarts as well, but I can't really be picky with such a request.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Bar Linkffn(Petrification Proliferation), other fics usually take the abuse to extreme levels before 'justice'. In canon, there was no physical abuse, though lot of emotional. Is there any fic with /canon compliant/ abuse and proper inquiry in it by police? Not by Dumbledore or Snape. Both obviously knew and Dumbledore thought better alive than happy. In canon Snape never showed concern for well being of non-slytherins, getting him sappy for Harry would be too off-character.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Harry is weird. Even for the Wizarding World. He can ''see'' the past, the future and your true heart. He makes it his law to never interfere directly or indirectly in the life of people, as all his ''prophecies'' or ''visions'' are self-fullfilling. This is his first year at Hogwarts and he can't help but ''see'' what a disaster it is going to be. With little to no choice, Harry has to protect Neville Longbottom, the Boy-who-lived, Gryffindor's Golden Boy and suicidal idiot from dying before the end of the year.It would be so much easier if he wasn't in Slytherin...

** For what? The absolute most that would happen is maybe Harry would be taken away by government. You're thinking fanon abuse. In canon, the worst they did to him was make him use the cupboard as a bedroom. Yeah, Petunia told him to "look after the bacon" in Philosopher's Stone, but my mom had me stirring food and keeping an eye on the stove from around that age as well.

Any physical abuse came from Dudley. You'll recall the scene in Philosopher's Stone where Dudley, Vernon, and Harry were all scrambling to get Harry's Hogwarts letter. Harry literally jumped on Vernon's back and was grabbing him by the neck. All Vernon did was send him to his room.

All the abuse from the Dursley family (apart from Dudley) came in the form of emotional abuse. They didn't treat him like a slave (other than locking him in the cupboard from time to time), they didn't smack him around for fun, and there's no evidence that he was even malnourished, other than his skinny appearance. Really, by the time he was 17, he was the exact same height as James Potter. The only time he ever complained about being starved was summer before 4th year when Petunia forced the whole family on a diet.

Harry was unloved. That's absolutely horrible, but not illegal. As far as I can see, the only illegal thing they did was lock him in his cupboard. And I that's not really jail worthy. Maybe a fine for safety reasons. They clothed him (regardless if the clothes fit well or not), they fed him, and they housed him. They did the minimum required of them as guardians, basically.
