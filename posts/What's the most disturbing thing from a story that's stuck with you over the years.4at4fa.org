I've been rereading The Live I've Lived by jbern and I just came across the subplot of Sarah Underhill.

For those of you unaware (and slight spoilers for the story) it involves Snape taking polyjuice to become Sirius Black, only for him to have sex with multiple female students and end up impregnating one.

There is just something about him impersonating Sirius that's wrong on so many levels and really gets under my skin. Him having sex with Sirius' body for one, misleading the women into making them think he's Sirius for another, and something about the entire concept of him taking polyjuice to become someone he isn't for his own disgusting needs/desires is so sick to me.

It really makes me think of the seedier parts of magic, and while there can be greater triumphs and achievements, there are also lower lows.

So how about you guys? Is there anything from a story that just got under your skin in the worst way?

** Any of the stories where anyone is magically forced into being someone else's mate (Veela/werewolf/Giant Purple People Eater, whatever). I don't care that 'they get used to it' or 'they feel they have to go along with it to save the other person' or, worst of all, eventually the magic somehow makes them consent to it, usually by gradually making them reciprocate the Veela/werewolf's feelings. Creepy and wrong all over the place, and yet it's invariably presented as a good thing, even if it's not until later in the story, after both characters have had time for some superficial angst. I can't think of a specific example at the moment because it's been so long since I've braved clicking any story labelled Veela or werewolf.

** There was a fic that has since been taken down called 'Sanitarium'. The concept was that after the war, Fred and George took it upon themselves to trap most of the surviving members of the DA in their flat until they all sorted out their various Traumatic Stress coping behaviors. The story jumped perspectives each chapter, so that any one character's dysfunction and the cause for it was only partly revealed from the view of others until you got a reasonably complete picture of what was wrong and why.

And if the concept wasn't disturbing enough... Hermione had been presented through half of the story as a scatter-brained weed-addict. Her situation, once revealed, cut me to the core- early on in the war and in secret, Theodore Nott had blackmailed her into pulling the bulk of her education out of her mind and put the memories in his Pensieve, so that he could absorb her brilliance at his leisure. The nature of the memory-pulling made the knowledge only accessible to one of them, so Hermione had been operating in a state where all her intellectual leaps led to smoky dead-ends of 'I should know this, but...' She was smoking dope so that she wouldn't have to think and get lost in the empty spaces in her head.

It's the only time in my life I've ever had to jump ahead to the end of a book or story to assure myself that things would work out.

** There's disturbing in a good way and there's disturbing in a bad way.

The last few chapters of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] are brilliantly disturbing. Tom is brilliant at manipulation, and his systematic takeover of Ginny's body and soul is brilliant and horrifying. The big reveal of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]] is another example. The reason for Ginny's estrangement from her family is the reveal in question, and the story leads up to it in a way that you know it's going to be disturbing, and in the end it's more disturbing than anything you could have imagined.

Disturbing in a bad way are those fics that make you shake your head in disgust and close the story. Those fics that use rape solely as a cheap plot device come under this. One particularly disgusting example is a Lunar Harmony by the perpetually tone deaf Silently Watches (I think it was) where Harry, Hermione and Luna take turns obliviating Ron 30 times or something. There is also the opening of a Robst fic which I've read about on this site that does much worse, but I forgot the details of it.

** Forgot which one it was, but there was a brilliantly written Dark!Harry fic where he becomes friends with Tom's Horcrux. It was pretty good, but then the author threw in a Voldemort/Snape pairing where he bends Snape over a cauldron.

I dropped it soon after.

** Do Not Go Gentle by cloneserpents features a rapist Ron, a Death Eater Ginny, an 80% lesbian Hermione, and a demon Harry.

Other people may like that kind of thing, but it just wasn't for me.

Yay! The other things don't sound so good, though.

** Hm. The torture of Ron and Hermione in the (crazy) sequel to Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. It's set in Ireland, I think. Can't remember the title of it.

Generally the characterisation and battle scenes in Voice of the Nephilim's Sitra Ahra. Although, I really enjoyed that one, well-written. It does get extreme and gory though and I'm a bit squeamish so there were bits I had to skip. A scene early on, a main character is killed viciously by Voldemort with no warning (and gruesome detail) and it really takes you by surprise. It's unfinsihed but if you like dark stories and competent!Lily Potter, I would highly recommend it.

A scene where Tonks kills Bellatrix in To Fight the Coming Darkness by jbern. Also in general, the way Tonks uses her metamorphmagus powers in that story. Not exactly disturbing but not something I've seen explored much before - e.g. she can stretch limbs, reorganise her organs, etc.

I'm unsure how to use the bot but these are all on ff.net.

** Some of the curses described in Dumbledore's army and the year of Darkness. Horrible stuff.
