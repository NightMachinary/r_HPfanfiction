HP verse has tons of characters with issues. Hell, after the war, probably all of the school would require therapy.

But who had it worst? For me, it's Sirius.

In a single night, his best friend and his best friend's wife gets murdered, betrayed by his other very close friend, who Sirius himself trusted to keep the secret, then when he tries to avenge them, he gets framed for betraying James and Lily, and gets thrown in the worst prison in the world for a crime he didn't commit for 12 years.


** I mean if we're talking about the worst mental health and not sympathetic as a character, I'd say Snape was so unwell and unhinged he shouldn't have been near children, and Bellatrix Lestrange - look, I know we're talking the Wizarding world, but any muggle equivalent of her would be in maximum security and would be sedated with a full battery of psychiatrists on her.

That's my opinion anyway.

** ... Surely, the answer to 'Who has the worst mental health of any HP character' is Voldemort.

*** From a certain point of view, yes. But he got blacklisted after he gave two therapists nervous breakdowns with his unedited life story and brainwashed a third into his army.

** Grey Lady. Not only is she so unstable she refuses to move on. She has to spend her afterlife trapped with her murderer, who is covered in her own blood, for all eternity.

** I don't think anyone had worse mental health than Sirius, but if I had to pick someone else, I'd definitely say Remus Lupin.

Remus was infected with lycanthropy at a very young age. As a result he was kept away from other children until he was enrolled in Hogwarts. While there he still had to worry about not only the safety of the other children who attended school with him, and also the threat of being ostracized if anyone were to find out. He was lucky to have a few good years, but after James and Lily died, Sirius was put away, and Pettigrew was "dead," so he was on his own again until Harry's third year.

While teaching at Hogwarts he had to be on high alert again, and deal with Snape basically hinting to the students that he was a werewolf which everyone ended up finding out. He was no longer able to work at Hogwarts, found out Pettigrew was a traitor and only had two years with Sirius before he was murdered. After that, he had hardly any time to enjoy his relationship with Tonks, then died and didn't get to see his son grow up.

With all of that being said, he probably had awful mental health.

*** Draco does not have mental health issues, at least until 1997. At least none worth mentioning compared to the other contenders.
