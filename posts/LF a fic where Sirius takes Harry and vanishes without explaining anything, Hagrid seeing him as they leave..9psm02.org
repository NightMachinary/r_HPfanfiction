**** I have not read all of it. I read the first story and some of the first sequel. The first story is immensely worth reading, focusing on Sirius parenting Harry while in hiding and then his struggle to be believed and to reintegrate back into society. After that's resolved, my interest in their day-to-day life kinda petered out, so I stopped reading. There were a few slowdowns/things I wasn't interested in, but the good bits made up for them.

*** It depends on the feel you want your fic to have. If you want more baby!Harry or cute parent Sirius, I'd focus more on the mundane but adorable parts of Harry's life before Hogwarts. If you want a grittier fic focus on his Hogwarts days and possibly have him receive some training from Sirius. (I think he was an Auror but that may be fanon) maybe have him be a bit arrogant but not cruel, like an asshole you can't help but like. I have no idea if this helps at all but I hope it does.

**** I'd probably go a bit grittier.

First years would be Sirius barely holding on, only supported by Harry and in turn supporting the little tyke. They would be continuously on the run once Sirius figured out the betrayal and the following warrant on him.

Then I'd add some light to it. Harry grows up cared for and happy, even if they keep on travelling. Its Uncle Sirius and him against the world, after all.

Then they'd get stuck somewhere. I imagine Africa would be a cool place ("place", he says while referring to the second largest continent on earth) for them to end up in. And by "stuck", I mean that Sirius realizes that the hunt for him has tuned down; their ongoing flight creating a cold trail nobody was really capable of following. So they settle down a bit, also in the interest of Harry who never had close friends until then.

Then something happens that sends them both for their individual crisis. /Sirius becomes a father/. Of course not by choice. He fooled around, enjoying that they stayed somewhere for longer than a few months. But his fooling had consequences. Dame Unnamed is pregnant and Sirius has a choice to make. Be a father? Tell her who he really is? What about Harry? Harry had similar thoughts. If Sirius becomes a father, will he be there as much for him as he will for his own child? What if he stops loving him? Things a young child /almost teenie worries about when confronted with such an issue.

And then there is the question of schooling. Hogwarts? Doubtful. If Sirius sends Harry to Hogwarts, the chances of the boy coming back are practically zero. So I'm thinking Uagadou. Worldbuild that african wizard community out a bit, you know?

Not sure how exactly the plot would go... Maybe really focus on that Slice of Life thing going on?

***** I think people would really be waiting for the "payoff" of seeing Harry interact with the other canon characters and them coming to realize that Sirius is innocent, so not having him not go to Hogwarts would be kind of a tough sell in that respect.

Personally I'd want to know if people in Britain thought Sirius had killed Harry, or if they got hints that he was alive because of the hunt for him. I'd want some callbacks rather than just world-building, unless you were really a good enough writer to make me care about a whole big group of multiple OCs.

****** I'll second this. One of my favourite aspects of dimension travelling (mostly crossovers) is seeing how two different groups react to each other, more specifically the main characters from two different sources.

I'd be interesting to see a well traveled Harry (though still young) interacting with the relatively well established cast at Hogwarts.

****** Also, Sirius taking Harry and running fundimentally shifts another important plot point: his very public confrontation with Peter. The reason he gave Harry to Hagrid was so that he could go track Peter down. No confrontation means no blast that kills tons of muggles, but it also opens the possibility of Peter not faking his own death. If Sirius isn't around to reveal the truth of the secret keeper situation, Peter might feel safe staying in the public eye, selling the "Sirius was the traitor" narrative, while setting himself up to be an inside man if/when Voldemort returns.

****** I'd be interested in both. On one had, exactly like you said. Send him to Hogwarts, so now everyone knows What Happened.\\
On the other hand, Sirius' fears regarding them trying to take Harry away could be well founded (granted, I've read lots of Manipulative!Dumbledore), so he goes elsewher. Presuming Harry doesnt enroll under a false name (which...is actually likely that he will presuming above circumstances), the British Wizarding World is bound to find out where he is (and/or that he's even alive), and their attempts to convince him to return to his homeland, safely out of BLack's influence, whathaveyou. would be a fun read as well.

****** I think playing to the “payoff” is a very dangerous thing to do because as soon as that happens if you don't have anything else lined up the story bombs out into boringness. The only example of this being done right that I can think of off the top of my head is linkffn(8045114) where the main plot is supported by the subplots in three seperate acts, with conflicts clearly labeled into political, magical and social for the reader.

******* I agree, that's what happened with Innocent and the sequels, at least for me, but at the same time if you never do it a lot of people would be disappointed and stop reading because of that, also.

You'd have to describe it differently than your prompt, get a different audience to start with, maybe, because when you say this:

#+begin_quote
  Everyone's expecting a a death eater or something but instead they get an 11 year old wearing a denim jacket and a shit eating grin.
#+end_quote

that's what people are looking forward to seeing, not an AU where Harry goes to school in Africa with a bunch of OC's.

A lot depends on how long you want the story to be, maybe the author wouldn't want to write an epic where they wrote hundreds of pages after the payoff. Maybe they just end it after it stops being fun.

Maybe you could include the occasional cut back to Britain showing Dumbledore's panic over the prophecy, or even newspapers with neville being the new Boy-Who-Lived or something. But slice of life sounds like it could be really interesting and African Wizarding society isn't something often built up. As long as it doesn't end up being a canon rehash with new characters I think it has a lot of potential, post a link if you end up writing it, id be the first to read it!

**** Like I said I think going with one chapter a year as a minimum until hogwarts would be best. Show Harry growing into a happy cheeky powerful child, and Sirius growing from a vengeance driven more than slightly depressed playboy into a loving parent. So many dadfoot fics spend all their time with harry, and let small increments of time pass, and because of this although he definitely changes it happens so slowly you can't really notice it. That's one of the things that I think Rowling does amazingly that no one really acknowledges, time progression. You always know when in the year it is but it's never a major point that is repeated
