:END:
Harry catches some of Naruto when Dudley took to temporarily watching it, and teaches himself how to do jutsu. He ends up with Luna but he can't teach her jutsu because her magic is too used to doing things in the Wizarding way?

I think I read it on ffn but I can't for the life of me remember the title. I appreciate any help :)


** I would read the heck outta that.

*** I mentioned it to my sister and I think she might have found it! It's been a while since I've read it so no promises on quality, but I really enjoyed the idea.
