Lucius Malfoy, sole heir to the Malfoy estate, Prefect of Slytherin house and bethrothed to Narcissa Black had to uphold an image that was nothing less than what his father expected from him. And he did everything to meet these demands. He did not associate with Muggles and Mudbloods in any way that was more than necessary courtesy. He did not mingle with those who would taint his reputation and he upheld connections with whomever promised to be useful to know in the future - how unpleasant these people might be. He didn't even smoke (the few exceptions on the weekend's in Hogwarts could hardly be counted) but there was one thing not everyone was aware of.

Lucius Malfoy was also the proud owner of a small collection of -Muggle- vinyls. And thanks to Narcissa and a few of her more /rebellious/ family members it was sure to grow some more with every year. Not that Andromeda was ever aware whom exactly her boyfriends records reached in the end. Nor did the poor young Slytherins know that the /horrible noisy vinyls/ that he had confiscated did not land in the bin. Thanks to Sirius Black - who seemed to regard Narcissa in a whole different light after she'd asked him about it - he even possessed a fair share of Punk albums.


** I've always thought a story about Draco going full punk after fifth year would really work.

He shows back up at Hogwarts suddenly embodying the spirit of Sirius Black and nobody knows what to do about it. Really I just want people to spot Malfoy lurking around muggle London listening to really edgy music about fighting the system.

*** Hahaha yeah. But I guess he would take what he'd get because Lucius Malfoy can hardly affort to go to a Muggle shop himself
