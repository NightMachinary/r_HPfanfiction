I've gotten into the Master of Death Harry Potter kick again but can't seem to find very many good fics for it, sadly. Or at least some that I haven't read over and over (Of Wizards and Heroes)

So, any recommendations? I'd prefer completed stories but frankly, I'll take anything at this point. Thanks in advance.


** Hey, I'm not sure if this is an MOD!Harry story but He's immortal, it's a very captivating story for those who like evil or dark Harry with good or a moderately sane!voldemort.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/][www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/]] It's a fanfic by Tiro in FanFiction.net There's a prequel, the main story and a sequel with a Drabble too So, it's pretty long

The rest should be available in Tiro's profile called the birth of nightmare man which is the prequel, the nightmare man's journey which is the sequel and fractured time which is the Drabble, and the main story's called The nightmare Man

** There's an ongoing Supernatural crossover called Love, Fate and Prophecy that's worth a look - it has a pretty unique take on MoD that ties in with spn canon fairly neatly. It's still updating regularly.

The Consequences of Ascension is a possibility too, though that one hasn't been updated since February. It's a MerlinTV/Percy Jackson crossover, and what's there is pretty good.

The Crownless King is complete, and a cracky take on both MoD and the whole raising himself thing. It's also inspired by covid. If you missed this one, definitely check it out.

  Hunters are not allowed to raise magical children. When it is discovered that Mary is pregnant with a wizarding child, MACUSA steps in, and the Potters step up. Henry Winchester is raised as Harry Potter until security concerns send him to a family that does not know he exists. As Winchester luck dictates, the road will not be smooth. Especially when Heaven intervenes.

  When Harry Potter defeats Lord Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts arcane magic combines with the Deathly Hallows to an unforeseen consequence. Trying to raise Teddy and deal with those consequences as best as possible while desperately wishing his Saving People Thing wasn't quite so strong, Harry grudgingly involves himself in another war when he hears the Great Prophecy and realises people are expecting children to save the world again. Dragging Merlin along with him, Harry tries to keep his godson safe while his unexpected interference throws the Fates into an unknown future. Can he keep everyone safe in the end?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family.

  "A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped in front of a bench and turned to look at the being. "A second chance at what?" "Life."Harry laughed bitterly. "Because that has worked out so great the first time?"Death tilted its head. "You've changed," it stated."Life does that to you," Harry said and his mind felt clearer than ever, "Or should I say the last seven years. I never really left this place, have I? I lived a life feeling not quite dead and not alive either," he spat. "I know how you feel," Death said after a moment, grinning."Oh, do you," Harry retorted and pierced Death with a look. The being's smirk widened as it leaned closer."Bored." Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

  Harry Potter didn't want to be a warrior after the war; if they wanted a savior he would only take the title as a healer. Things changed suddenly and rapidly, so he finds himself running from the wizarding world with Teddy. With the help of Death he manages to escape, but still finds himself facing challenges and conflict. And an opportunity at happiness...but only if he lets himself.

Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
