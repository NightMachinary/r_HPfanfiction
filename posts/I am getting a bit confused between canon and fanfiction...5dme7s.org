** No he didn't know. He also never seemed to wonder. Which I don't think is SO strange. I mean, maybe he asked his aunt once upon a time when he was younger.

  But they were not living, thought Harry. They were gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them.

Given his reaction to actually seeing their graves, I don't think Harry is the sort of person who draws comfort from visiting a graveside. So yeah, it's probably not that strange that he didn't actively seek them out until he already knew where they lay.

** There's a common fanon trope that has the narrator castigate Dumbledore, McGonagall et al for never telling Harry more about his parents. Yet the truth is in canon Harry just doesn't seem all that interested in the details of their lives. He never really asks anyone about them, and if he doesn't ask, why should people assume he wants to know?

** We're told right from the beginning of the first book that for Harry, one of the rules for a peaceful life with the Dursley's is to not ask questions.

Whether he ever wondered or not, who knows. But it does seem a move toward self-preservation not to dwell on things if you can't imagine that you're ever going to get any answers. By the time the answers would have been available to him, the questions had been quite far put out of his mind and replaced by ... well, other more immediate needs of self-preservation.

** People rarely like to think of their loved ones as dead, instead prefering to remember them as they were when they were alive. Harry, having not remembered his parents much, seeked stories and anecdotes from those who knew them, wishing to see them as they were in life. To someone like that, flesh and bones hold little meaning.

So no. He didn't give their graves much thought. Not just because he had more pressing matters to focus on, but also because it fits his character.

** He would have but someone hit them with a notice-me-not charm if I recall canon correctly.

*** Well no, notice-me-not charms aren't canon. It just never came up until Deathly Hallows.
