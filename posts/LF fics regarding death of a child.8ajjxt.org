Hi, yeah, it's me again. The dead spouse guy. Listen, if you guys could comment fics about anyone dealing with their dead kids like Molly/Fred wise, that would be great. Thanks!

Oh btw I really liked the way Darth Marrs portrayed Harry's reaction in linkffn(The Forever Mage). That's a good place to start as any.

** "Breath of Life" linkffn(11038778), "Delight in Whatever Remains" linkffn(11348923), in these two, the children in question never really make it to being born, but I would say it still counts since the characters grieve for them the same as they would one who made it past gestation.
