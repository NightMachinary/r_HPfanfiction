** Melindaleo's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]], isn't it?

*** Definitely. And it's a better book 7 than Deathly Hallows was.

**** I used to think that, but now I consider it more on the same level. Ginny is really my main problem with both, but both also does the Horcrux hunt pretty poorly :(

Also, Deathly Hallows had a pretty disappointing final battle, but Seventh Horcrux was even worse.

***** Yes and no. But I follow you. I really enjoyed Melindaleo's book overall, mostly because they seemed more like teenagers and also because it was clear that I was reading the sophomore novel of a budding writer.
