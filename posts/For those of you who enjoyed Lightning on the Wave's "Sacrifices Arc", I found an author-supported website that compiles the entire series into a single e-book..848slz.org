I am a huge fan of this entire series and try to reread it every year. It is triple the length of the canon book and delves deeply into the theory of magic, pureblood history, political maneuvers, and gives a more "adult" side to the world of Harry Potter. It is *very* AU, but very worth the read, imo. Give it a try!

(The link also contains some of her original stories, but I haven't personally read those.)
