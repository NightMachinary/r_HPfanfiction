Instead of this british nordic magic system why not a cultivation wuxia system instead. This would be absolutely AU.

Has anyone tried this yet? I know they added cores but any cultivation?


** To the best of my knowledge magical cores are an entirely fan created thing. Just like Transfiguration being temporary instead of permanent is a fan creation. A few Naruto crossovers are a bit wuxia, for full blown Xianxia though I can't think of any. Even webnovel doesn't have any that I know of.

I had started to write one and realized it would take minimal work to just make it into a new book I could legally publish. So that's been percolating now instead of being a hpfanfiction. Honestly if you take the time to create a HP xianxia/wuxia world that works you can easily cut the HP parts out and publish for real.

Sorry, wish I was more help and really hope someone finds some.
