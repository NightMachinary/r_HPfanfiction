The main character Harry Potter or SIOC or some random person starts down the path of making a soul anchor not a Horcrux Because a Horcrux splits soul this doesn't is what a lich does any fanfictions plz post here


** You might want to look into stories where Diarymort (or some other splinter of Voldemort) regains a full body, as for /them/, the result is very much like a classical Lich Soul Jar --- their whole soul resides in the object, and they have the opportunity of retreating back into it if their body is damaged.

In that category, I know no finer story than linkffn(The Imposter Complex), but there are a lot of good-to-great stories with similar premises.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
