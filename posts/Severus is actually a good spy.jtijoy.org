Are there fics where Severus Snape is actually a good actor and spy?

Y'know, he's a professional and engaging teacher at Hogwarts, tells Harry stories about his parents, that sort of thing. Maybe teaches spells, but works small weaknesses into them so when they face danger, they're vulnerable. Says shit like "I'd be a terrible double agent if I still acted like a Death Eater, and unlike you, Lucius, I don't have hundreds of galleons to throw around"

And then his face-heel turn happens, it's actually a shock.


** Linkao3(9821300) is a fun one. Snape & co make use of Unbreakable Vows to prevent spilling information and poisons Voldemort.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** I don't particularly endorse this story given the squicky nature of how early it turns HP/HG (literally first year, IIRC) but in Seel'vor's "The Real Us," Snape is a good guy fooling everyone (except the "main cast") into believing he's a jerk.

Ever since I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13536654/1/Apex][Apex]], I can't stop thinking about that scene where Riddle rips Snape a new one for being a crappy and obvious spy while Barty Crouch pulls off the con of the century as Moody.

*** Tw for Harry sexually assaulting Rita Skeeter in like the third chapter? Came out of pretty much nowhere and stopped me from reading any further. "grey" Harry is one thing but thats a bit ridiculous

**** There was lots of scrolling for me. Some parts are neat, like the Voldemort calling Snape a bad spy. Or Draco getting whooped for running his mouth. Others, not so much.

I previously dropped it because of the Rita scene, bit came back to it when I had no internet, and it was already downloaded on the app.

** I think this fits what you're looking for. It's more about his relationship with Harry after Harry is basically raised in Hogwarts by Sirius. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3673549/1/The-name-is-Potter-Black][The name is Potter Black]].
