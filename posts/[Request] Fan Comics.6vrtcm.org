There seems to be little talk of fan comics around here. And, true, there aren't /many/, but there /are/ some. Here are those I know:

- /[[http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/tagged/harry-potter%20Dumbledore%20is%20a%20Jerk][Dumbledire Is a Jerk]]/'. Often hilarious sketchy comics published on tumblr, wherein the most striking difference from canon is that Dumbledore is completely unlikable and, for lack of a better word, douchey. Typical bit of dialogue: *Hagrid*: Professor, I... */DUMBLEDORE/: You see my Phoenix? (Hagrid nods.) Now it's gone. Like the tiny, tiny damn I gave about this conversation."

- /[[https://tapas.io/episode/608952%20Hogwarts%20Founders][Hogwarts Founders]]/'. Funny comic that only has one strip so far, but hey, one can hope.

- /[[https://tapas.io/episode/233793%20Finite%20Incantatem][Finite Incantatem]]/: a bitter Squib set out to bring down the Statute of Secrecy. To do so... they wrote the /Harry Potter/ books. The events are fictional, but not the setting and lore. Now Muggles are threatening to bring about the doom of magic as Harry Potter fans uncover the secret world, starting with Platform 9 and 3/4.

- /[[https://tapas.io/episode/439580%20Cursed%20Kids][Cursed Kids]]/: A not-very-serious comic about Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter. Pokes fun at /Cursed Child/, but not only.

- /Villainous Crushes/ --- a long-runninng crossover comic about... well, it's in the title. Among the titular Villainous Crush is Voldemort and Bellatrix's, which is depicted as reciprocated and sort-of dorklily likable. See these [[https://treacle-miner.deviantart.com/art/VC-23-Interrogation-261262789][three]] [[https://treacle-miner.deviantart.com/art/VC-24-Speculation-262807555][hilarious]] [[https://treacle-miner.deviantart.com/art/You-Thought-Harry-Had-Problems-248508659][pages]] for examples.

- /[[https://askvoldemort.tumblr.com%20Ask%20Lord%20Voldemort][Ask Lord Voldemort]]/: A tumblr roleplay blog for, well, Voldemort, where questions are answered as small comics.

- /[[https://askhogwarts.tumblr.com%20Ask%20Hogwarts][Ask Hogwarts]]/: A short-lived but masterfully drawn tumblr ask blog for the Hogwarts staff. Book-inspired, not the movies!

- [[https://briannacherrygarcia.deviantart.com/art/why-you-no-hug-me-246770166][Some]] [[https://loleia.deviantart.com/art/Harry-Potter-Comic-01-81255056][funny]] [[https://julvett.deviantart.com/gallery/64601/Harry-Potter][miscellaneous comics]] on DeviantArt.

- /[[http://www.dorkly.com/tag/kevin][Voldemort's Assistant Kevin]]/: a funny short comic poking fun at Canon Voldemort's lack of common sense through the addition of a sharp-tongued, non-evil sidekick. Compare and contrast with the well-liked /Evil Overlord List/ story where it's young Tom Riddle who gets this treatment.

- /[[https://slinkers.deviantart.com/gallery/217757/Harry-Potter][Harry Potter Funnies]]/: Yet another series of short funny comics, probably my favorites in writing if not art-wise. Highly recommended. Plus, there are a /lot/ of those.

Do you know anything else? Of some quality, of course.

Also, [[https://nicholaskole.deviantart.com/][this]] is just one comic strip (deviantart), but it's a great portrayal of the beginning of the Dumbledore/Grindelwald duel.

Except for the fact that Dorkly never bothered to do more than a minute of research/thinking. Only one of their HP comics makes sense.

*** How so? Of all the points they make, only one seems wonky to me (namely, the 'blood donation' idea to get Harry's blood). /Why/ shouldn't Voldemort make an ordinary-looking object into a Horcrux? Why couldn't he have tried to kill Harry with an axe instead of using the Killing Curse? Neither is /in character/, of course, but that's not the point here. And the thing about the Statute of Secrecy seems entirely possible to me --- there's a debate to be had, of course, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to hold the opinion that nothing terrible would happen if the wizards exposed themselves in the present day.

I agree, this idea is stupid. Unless Voldemort knows another ritual which involves blood taken by free will/trickery.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Because, ordinary-looking objects are easy to lose, and if the lost item got destroyed, you would not know(not that he did know in canon). Besides, it's soul we're talking about here. I wouldn't put mine in a teacup, would you?

This is the one that made sense.

#+end_quote

Except we're talking about Harry's time, which would be before or during 1998. For comparison, The Battle of Hogwarts took place on May 2, 1998.

Even if we're going by the prologue year(September 1, 2017) the same few things would happen:

War, due fear. Mind you muggles do have Nukes,(although they might be unlikely to use them) and guns.(Which are more deadly and faster than spells, in a hands of a trained soldier). Keep in mind that there are groups of people IN THE REAL WORLD who think that the Harry Potter series promotes witch craft and satanism. Now imagine if wizards actually existed, and suddenly we're faced with a group of people that can defy nature to their will.

And that's not even taking into consideration that there are groups of wizards the DO want to hurt muggles. Voldemort and his followers were all about the superiority of wizards and wiping out all those who were not "pure" like them. And they almost took over the wizarding world. Do you really think muggles would just trust wizards if that sort of thing came to light?

Even if the muggles would've accepted magic, they would rely on it so much, that it becomes a crutch to them, making them overly reliant on wizards, creating two situations, God Wizard Kings, or Wizard slavery. Also, the governments love detaining things they don't understand, for Science. You monster.(Portal reference)

Well, I /would/ put it in a teacup if it was needed to ensure immortality. It only needs to be ordinary-/looking/. My idea would be to make an ordinary rock into a Horcrux, add all sorts of protections on the Horcrux (including an alarm that warns if it is somehow still destroyed), then dump it in a random undersea cave far away from Britain, which will contain many similar rocks and upon which you shall install some more invisible but very efficient wards.

** Pretty much all the fan comics out there are comedy ones. Is anyone interested in a serious one? I've had this one idea sitting in my head for a while but I'm unlikely to write it, though a comic would be more doable. Just wondering :)

** I still remember [[https://www.elidupree.com/voldemorts-children][Voldemort's Children]] pretty fondly, perhaps because I stumbled upon it before I ever read any fanfiction proper.

The art is Not Great, to be honest, but it's a fan comic for Harry Potter, so I thought it deserved a mention.
