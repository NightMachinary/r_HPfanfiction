Desperate to find this fanfiction! Features a female harry character, in a world where voldemort separated reality into two: one where fem harry died (but parents survived) and other where she's alive (and parents died, like canon). The night that voldemort comes back to life in GOF, he breaks the barrier between the two worlds, bringing the characters of each reality together. Has a fem harry and blaise friendship, and love/hate relationship with Sirius. Any suggestions? Searched on google for so long but couldn't find it. Would love to find a way to read that story again.
