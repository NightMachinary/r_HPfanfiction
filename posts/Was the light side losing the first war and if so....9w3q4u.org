how badly were they losing? Could they sustain their casualties (they after all seldom killed the DEs, they locked them up and Voldemort broke them out again at his convenience! Dumbledore was too soft (and not much of a true war-leader!) to fight a true war after all! It's just not his nature, after losing his sister at least!) for much longer?

​

I'll start us off:

​

I think (as you can see in my criticism of Dumbledore who is one of the worst leaders in a war! He's Chamberlain more or less! Appeasement, forgiveness etc. at a time where Churchill was needed IMHO!) that what the light side was doing was losing the war bit by bit! They suffered casualties (Molly's brothers, James Potter's family etc. etc.) without inflicting serious harm on the other other side (To paraphrase Patton: "Your job is NOT to die for your country (replace with: Side!), but to make sure the other bastard dies for his! - Voldemort grasped that, especially since he wasn't a dumb maniac back then, but still Tom Riddle! Smart, charismatic, handsome, powerful! - Dumbledore on the other hand never did and neither did his followers in the useless Order of the Phoenix! Most members are not combat effective after all (note: I still think that Molly killing Bellatrix was a mistake on Rowlings part!), they can gather gossip and that's it! Hell, Pettigrew showed how easy it was to spy on them! Hell, anybody might have become a Pettigrew if Voldemort held their family hostage! They also never seemed to train fighting (they didn't teach Harry, no not even Sirius or Remus can claim they showed Harry any usefull combat spells or tactics!)

​

So: DISCUSS :)

​

ps: Do you think you could puzzle that together from the old Daily Prophets etc. at the Hogwarts Library (so that Harry could learn that Dumbledore isn't all he's cracked up to be!)?

Quite badly, as Remus says the Order was outnumbered ten-to-one by Voldemort and the Death Eaters. No, they could not sustain such casualties.

The Order appears to work primarily in subterfuge and sabotage. Outright battles don't seem to be their usual methods of operation. There are exceptions--Fabian and Gideon Prewett were taken down by *five* Death Eaters, which suggests they killed four, before being taken down by Dolohov.

But by and large, the Order of the Phoenix, which is not a government entity, is not responsible for capturing or killing Death Eaters. That was the responsibility of the Ministry of Magic.

And you are wrong in that they only locked up Death Eaters. Barty Crouch ordered lethal means--Including the use of Unforgivable Curses--when engaging Death Eaters. Several, among them Evan Rosier, were killed in battle.

And Voldemort did not break out his followers during the First War, unless the Ministry had a second, smaller prison--which, admittedly, is not out of the question. Sirius escaping Azkaban was explicitly stated to be the first time in its history. Most Death Eaters escaped Azkaban not through Voldemort leading a rescue mission, but due to corruption in the courts.

#+end_quote

Albus Dumbledore was the only man that Tom Riddle ever feared, and was able to capture several Death Eaters single-handedly some fifteen years after the First War ended during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.

He was a more than capable fighter, but for all we know, his hands were tied by his other responsibilities. And more to the point, Barty Crouch was willing to do evil things to bring the Death Eaters to "justice," and Dumbledore knew all too well that he was not to be trusted with too much power.

It's easy to condemn Neville Chamberlain as a coward, and venerate Churchill as a champion. It is also unfair. To elaborate on how history, with the benefit of hindsight, has cruelly chastised Chamberlain (to say nothing of what has been done to besmirch Churchill's reputation), would take far more time than I have.

And this is a thread for Harry Potter fandom. On that note, Albus Dumbledore is no appeaser of evil.

In the First War, Albus Dumbledore engaged the Death Eaters and led the Order. He knew that Tom Riddle had experimented with the Darkest of the Dark Arts, but he did not know to what extent. His actions prior to the beginning of the War were containment--keep Tom Riddle from growing his influence. But the state of the Wizarding World was a hive for those who sought to break natural laws.

We are never, ever given a canonical reason to believe that Albus Dumbledore was a weak leader. He feared power and sought to contain it. Refusing to abuse his authority, when he knew better than any what might happen if he did, is not weakness.

In the Second War, Cornelius Fudge looked the other way. Albus Dumbledore demanded they engage and do things that would be profoundly unpopular--send emissaries to the Giants, remove the Dementors from Azkaban--to fight Voldemort completely.

Forgiveness is among the most sacred of virtues. Valuing the life of your enemies isn't weakness. Neglecting it isn't strength.

Fabian and Gideon Prewett died, and they took Death Eaters with them.

James Potter's family? You mean James and Lily right? James's parents were not killed by Death Eaters, they died of natural causes. Specifically, dragon pox, if we take Pottermore as canon.

#+end_quote

Tom Riddle already had several of his Horcruxes made during the First War. He was a murderer from the time he was sixteen, and brutalized small children by the time he was eleven. He was a brutal, evil, insane bastard and was never anything other than a brutal, evil, insane bastard.

He was smart, but intelligence is not a virtue. Neither is charisma, or being "handsome."

Tom Riddle was little more a rabid wolf.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The Order fought. They fought despite being outnumbered ten to one. They had courage the likes of which can scarcely be comprehended.

They fought against a nigh-on-unstoppable force and they did it in spite of the fact that they knew they may die for the cause.

They were not useless.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There are more ways to win a war than fighting. Some of the most important people in all wars were not warriors, but spies. James Arimstead helped the Americans win the Revolutionary War by spying on his master, General Cornwallis.

And it was beyond right for Molly Weasley to kill Bellatrix. She did not kill out of hatred or revenge, which would have torn her heart and made her as dark as Belllatrix. Such a fate would have awaited Neville had he struck down Bellatrix in anger.

Molly struck down Bellatrix because she was protecting those who she saw as children, her daughter Ginny and Hermione and Luna. A mother struck down evil to protect her children.

Belaltrix who lusted after Voldemort and relished suffering was struck down by someone who embodied love and protection.

How is that a mistake?

#+begin_quote
  Hell, Pettigrew showed how easy it was to spy on them! Hell, anybody might have become a Pettigrew if Voldemort held their family hostage!
#+end_quote

That was one spy in the Order, and an indeterminate number in the Ministry of Magic--Augustus Rookwood is the only one named explicitly, but it stands to reason that there were others.

But only Pettigrew joined Voldemort, and even then he didn't join straight up. As far as I can recollect, Pettigrew joined the Order first, and later defected to Voldemort in the name of self-preservation.

And it is mentioned that the Order had come to realize that there was a spy among their ranks, but they did not know who was the defector. Presumably, Pettigrew was skilled enough at Occulmency that he was able to evade detection.

#+end_quote

What part of Curse Against The Defense Against The Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts was unclear? Very few of the Order would have had a proper education in Defensive Magic, and those who did were likely self-taught.

And Sirius and Remus DID take steps to ensure that Harry and his friends could defend themselves--Harry noted their usefulness for the DA when he received the books on defensive magic for Christmas in /Order of the Phoenix/ and Remus taught him about many Dark Creatures, including the Patronus Charm, which was instrumental in his survival.

Considering the libel that was routinely published while he was in school, I doubt Harry has anything remotely resembling a high opinion of /Daily Prophet/ publications regardless of the year.

That Dumbledore let this curse on the position continue and didn't abolish the course to replace it with say "Defensive Magic" or "Combat-Magic" (or put the spells for Defense into the curriculum of charms and hire another professor as "secondary charms instructor" or something?

I am not saying I agreed with Dumbledore's reluctance to kill; I was explaining why he felt this way. There's a difference, and it's a darned important one.

And if you're willing to bring up muggles, then it's worth noting that the overwhelming majority of muggle police will never discharge their weapons and kill a suspect.

But okay, let's play your little scenario out. Kill the Death Eaters. Then what? Should Dumbledore have gone after their financiers and killed them as well? What if they weren't blood supremacists but had been blackmailed into it? Lucius Malfoy claimed that he had been put under the Imperius Curse. Stan Stunpike and Pius Thicknesse *were* put under the Imperius Curse--should they have been killed?

Dumbledore drew the line where he did--and there's no actual, canonical evidence that he forbade killing in combat--because he knew the slope would be too slippery, and that once started, many wouldn't stop.

And what about the people who think bad things, but haven't done anything bad yet? There are plenty of cases where innocent people--genuinely innocent people who had committed no crime--were for no tangible reason.

#+begin_quote

But that's the point! Chamberlain did not know what Adolf Hitler really was. And I will not allow you to condemn a man who was trying to prevent a war his people would not want, and were ill prepared for anyhow.

Winston Churchill was a titan, a man worth ten times any of his contemporaries, and a damned hundred times more than the damned dirty devil Roosevelt.

You don't understand what total war is. The enemy was hidden among the people. Logistically, it would have been impossible for there to be no civilian casualties, and Churchill had every reason to believe Germany was more than willing to kill every last British citizen.

#+begin_quote
  Why is it unrealistic? Because Bella should have run LAPS around Molly in a fight! Damned, trained terrorist against housewife? Seriously, that is not even a contest!
#+end_quote

The contest be damned! Do you not know what story-telling is? It's values and virtues and symbolism! The deranged, murderous, hateful torturing temptress is brought down by the grounded, protective, loving, nurturing mother. Molly is Bellatrix's opposite! It makes perfect sense for Molly to bring down Bellatrix, who thought her beneath her.

Re-read the fight scene--Bellatrix taunts Molly, and in the briefest of openings, Molly is able to strike her down.

Only thing is, canon states that Veritaserum can be countered. And the moment Pettigrew got word that there was interrogations going on, he'd have Disapparted on the spot.

And you really think that Voldemort wouldn't have thought up that loophole and planned contingencies for it? You just described him as a smart guy who understood how to be a leader.

** Dumbledore is indeed acting like Chamberlain but it is impossible to say if he was the one who ordered no lethal force to be used or if most Order members were simply uncomfortable shooting to kill. Most were not war hardened Aurors like Moody but working regular jobs.

If the Battle of Hogwarts is any indication, the issue does not seem to be Dumbledore. The Death Eaters attacked across an open field, charging a fortified hilltop and still were not cut down like blades of grass. And each defender basically had a magical mortar or grenade launcher at their disposal.

So while yes, someone with MacArthur's or Stalin's attitude would probably be a better leader, a paradigm shift of the others seems to be necessary as well.
