So, whether it is Harry or Ginny or other Character who perform Physical training and their Friend is coming for a Reason, but than gets captured by the "hormones" that spread from the sweating but enticing Body. Can be Hetero or homosexual.

Another thing could be the smell that Pregnant Woman might spread. Hermione is Pregnant before or much earlier than Ginny and Harry gets attracted to her (might lead into infidelity, dont mind).

Same scenario but with Ginny. she is pregnant and Harry is "from time to time" or "mostly" or "the whole Day" horny and feels like a Stallion. Ginny has the same "hormonal case".

What i can also imagine is: both Ginny and Hermione being Pregnant and attracted to each other by their Hormonal smell, so they "snuggle" with each other. Or just one of them, but the other (actual hetero) being attracted to the other and tastes the sweetnes of a Pregnant Body.

It doesnt have to be the Canon pairs or just Ginny and Hermione, though.


** Sometimes, my friend, when not enough people share your preferences you have to write your own porn. Go for it. Please don't get a beta, and leave all the spelling mistakes in, it'll be a lot funnier that way.

*** No one is forcing you to read or comment on this Threads. There are several hundreds of Fics out there and nobody can know them all. But now i know, that you clearly dont know any of them...and you wouldnt be interested either. So spare us both the stress and keep those comments to yourself.

**** I'm not stressed, I genuinely want to read this story. It could be a new classic of... some sort.

There are over a million HP fanfics. I've read hundreds. I've been a member of this sub for three years or so. But I've never run into anything exactly like this.

Edit: You could try searching for werewolf fics, they do tend to have a lot of being able to smell things due to enhanced senses that normal people don't notice.
