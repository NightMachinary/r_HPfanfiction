Does anyone know of a fanfic where a major plot point is that Merlin was a douche bag and left a painting of himself to manipulate the ghost/frozen corpse of a girl to be 'the spirit of hogwarts.' and she thinks she is hogwarts thanks to him? I read it before and can't find it now :(


** That would be linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall).

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
