So a lot of fics have Harry find creative ways to handle the Tri-Wizard Tournament, but I don't think I've seen one where he just point blank refuses to take part in the Yule Ball that is apparently required as a Champion.

And I don't mean "finds a trick that gets him out of it", I don't mean "uses some obscure law to get a pass", I mean "he just says no and refuses to do it". Like, he just /refuses/ to take a date, refuses to dance, refuses to have anything to do with it.

It'd be a smaller part of a larger fic probably, but I was curious if anyone had thoughts on this idea.


** Isn't there a fic where him and Ron just go fuck off in the Chamber of Secrets so no one can find them lol

** There's at least one where he doesn't bother to argue; he just takes the train instead of staying for the holidays. He might be staying with his girlfriend, or in one of his own properties. McG and Dumbledore are really pissed with him when he comes back, but he points out that it is NOT required and they can't force him to give up his holidays (and besides it's moot now).

*** That is exactly the sort of thing I was thinking. Harry just... not doing it, because why would he? He doesn't want to, so why would he entertain the farce?

Also: "it's moot now" is a great thing to say after the fact, I love it.

** Try motivation by jeconais. Its not a major plot point as the story primarily takes place in 6th year but it does tell how he doesnt go to the ball during the tri wiz

** "Enslavement" by jeconais: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Enslavement/index/]]

Quite a bit harsher than "Motivations" (an excellent fic!); Harry spends the night of the Ball with Hedwig, flying/dancing with her.

** I have two that come to my mind right now. The first one is a one-shot named "Conscripted" by Broomstick Flyer. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5259803/1/Conscripted]]) I nit, Harry only want to go to the ball with Hermione so when she refuses because she already has a date, he decide not to attend. It cause some drama when Dumbledore force him to attend (by using magic against him) and Hermione laugh at him, causing great harm to their friendship and relationship. */As a fair warning:/* Harry here is acting a lot out of character. Like in many Broomstick Flyer fics, Harry feel processive of Hermione and jealous of anyone else who get her attention.

The second is a longer fic where Harry and Hermione leave Hogwarts because Harry fear for his life and prefer to loose his magic instead. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7392700/5/Banking-on-Her][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7392700/1/Banking-on-Her]]) Unlike the other fic I recommended, the characters here aren't OOC. ;)

#+begin_quote
  A different fourth year story where being conscripted into the Tri-Wizard tournament leads to a different life for Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. As its a one shot there is not much I can say here without spoiling the story for my reader.
