What's going on in an author's mind when they have a character in their story die? Much more, what are they thinking about when their character decides to /kill themself?/ I'm writing a fic, and had this happen out of nowhere. Well, she /thought/ about killing herself, at least.

This is mostly aimed at authors, but I'd appreciate anyone's input on this.

*** I agree with this. In a story with war or enemies that are supposed to be scary, capable or bringing a nation to its knees etc. Character death serves as a way to introduce risk and tension to the story. MCD does this at a high level by showing no one is safe

In my opinion it makes the story better, so long as the death serves the story.

On thing I kinda dislike is post-DH stories where everyone survives because I feel like it cheapens Voldemort and the fight that happened there.

** Well, that depends. When I killed off Urdont Wrex in one of my stories (a Mass Effect story, and Wrex is a fan favorit), I wanted to hit the reader with an emotional punch and make them HATE the people that killed Wrex, as well as understand the blind rage that lead to two reasonable sides go to war because one was framed. Whenever you kill a fan favorite, you have to be aiming for that sort of visceral reaction and sadness.

When I killed off Delores Umbridge, what went through my mind was AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.

*** How would you go about killing a fan favourite when the protagonist doesn't really care about him? For example, Fleur during the second task while Harry has no real attachment to her? And would something along the lines of "Oh fucking shit, I might be next" be enough or does Harry has to have the customary brooding period?

**** I'm not [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] so I can't speak for him, but I tend to think that part of the fallout of someone dying is the people they leave behind.

Harry might not be overly fond of Fleur, but if something bad happens during the Second Task, then it happens when he's concerned with making sure Fleur's hostage gets to the surface safely.

That's some great dramatic irony: Harry helps Gabrielle to the surface, but Fleur isn't there trying to get back to Gabrielle. Harry witnesses a /nine-year-old girl/ realizing that her big sister, who loves her more than anything, is dead.

***** That is awesome. Stealing this.

For my story, Wolf Lord, I am planning on killing someone each task in the Tournament arc to drive home the absurdity and blood sport nature of the event. This will make a great moment

***** Right, I've forgotten about that part.

Suppose there is no gut wrenching moment happening next to him (eg Fleur is killed and the task aborted, Harry is taken away before Gabrielle is woken), how would Harry react? Especially considering that Fleur was a little insulting towards him before.

****** Well...hmmm....that's a toughie.

Harry does have a bit of a hero's complex...so, I don't really consider him the brooding type.

That said, Harry isn't particularly vindictive...so, to be honest I have no idea.

Maybe bewilderment, at first? /Why was the Task aborted?/ or /Where's Fleur?/ And then guilt or even shame, especially if he thinks he could just as easily not made it to his hostage.

** Ultimately the author decides if a character decides to kill themselves or not. I always found this "character become almost self-aware" [[/r/writing]] circlejerk a bit over the top pretentious... well, or highly concerning regarding the sanity of the author.

#+end_quote

When they decide to kill the character.

I happens that you come to points where the in-character decision making suprises you. The "oh, yea... that really /is/ what my character would do" and it often leads to interesting places in a story (and can easily derail a carefully laid out plot for that matter). Vice versa it can seem wooden at best and out-of-character at worst for the author to glance over a character's consequence. However, the consequence of death is only one of many of equal if not more severe impact. "I'll kill myself" is often the most uncreative of them, and too often in novels, one that means absolutley nothing and only leaves a bad taste in your mouth going onward.

Personally I feel like the death of a character, when it adds to a story, is a worthwhile end for it. It may be a little sad if the character was fun to write, but if the overall end-product gets better with it, I'll gladly accept that.

** When I first realise one of them has to die for the story it starts as "what no I don't want them to die", and then over a period of grieving time it turns into "okay well fine, if I have to". I've never wanted to kill a character, but it happens.

** I don't read or write anything with MCD, and I know a lot of people are the same way. All I'm going to say is that I highly advise caution when considering killing any of your main characters.

** Suicide/self sacrifice specifically is a tricky subject that can piss of a /lot/ of readers, or at least turn them off, so I usually only include that unless it is what the fic is built around; it's a topic you have to really commit to.

The thing with MCD is when I decide to go down that route, I think of other options that /don't/ require the character dying that could be equally terrible, and whether or not MCD is actually vital to the story or if I could achieve the same things if they lived. If the story really works with character death, considering the absolute nature of it, the huge emotional impact of it, the implicit understanding of it by other characters that can't be achieved otherwise, then I include it, and it is /always/ a hugely critical moment of the fic.

** Often a character dies to remove their skills from the team to force someone else to step up, or to grow someone else's arc, or to escalate the tragedy or seriousness of the story.

I've never had a character kill themself but in-universe and out-of-universe, that could be to promote conversation about mental health or secret suffering, or just in-universe, to impact other characters and move on their arcs or change direction.

For example, using canon as reference, a common character to die is the powerful and experienced mentor (e.g. Dumbledore), forcing characters to find solutions that don't rely on using his knowledge and expertise first-hand. The difficulty is also escalated because without Dumbledore, the enemy can move more openly as there is no longer an equal opposing force to them, and he is no longer insurance to rescue our heroes if they get in over their heads.
