*** Wards are canon. The term is never used, but there are protective spells and enchantments which are commonly called wards in other fandoms.

And you can alter appearance with spells, like Hermione did to Ron when they went to rob Gringotts.

**** Yes, I know, but I mean using those exact words. Especially with wards, fanon takes them to another level with Pureblood families having very old wards and people being "keyed in" to the wards and such and I get so used to those sometimes I almost expect to see them mentioned in canon.

** The Point me spell being used by everyone. It was only used by Harry during the tournament and was designed by Hermione Edit: As corrected by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]], the Four-Point spell was made available to Harry by Hermione, presumably finding it in the Hogwarts Library. The Fanon part is that she changed it to point at what you are looking for. All it does is find North.

Somewhat ironically, you've mistaken fanon for canon here.

in GoF Hermione finds the Four-Point spell and adds it to a list of spells to learn along with the Impediment Curse, Reductor Curse, Shield Charm, etc.
