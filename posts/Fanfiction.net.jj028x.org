******* It's obviously HP but it's a Drarry one. It's set in Harry's 4th year. There will be 3 OC's but two of them will sorta be in the background. I have pages and pages of plans.

******** Ah, okay. Well, good luck with it. Hope those plans come to fruition. If you're not aware, there is a HP Slashfic ([[/r/HPSlashFic]]) sub that you could self-promote on. You're a lot more likely to get responses there.

********* Thank you, I might do that. I have only posted the prologue. I do have 6 chapters written but I want to have a bunch pre-written in case I get major writers block at some point. Does that make sense?

********** Yeah. Having a backlog of chapters like that is a relatively common-ish practice among those who write-as-they-go rather than write the whole thing then upload.
