You know those fics that have Harry as being more realistically damaged emotionally and mentally from being psychological abused at a young age (I'm talking the canon situation, not the horrible 'beat Harry with a belt' and 'starve him for days' stuff)?

Harry finds a tattered self-help book series after his First or Second year: after reading them, he realizes that he was unintentionally being a bit odd, cold, and/or unsociable (insular) physically and emotionally towards people because he simply hadn't known any better.

So, following the books' advice, he aspires to be a "better person": just minor things, first off, like hugging Hermione hello when he sees her again on the Express and spending more time with people, making new connections/friends, managing his temper, etcetera... and this is where the humour kicks in and subverts this little trope: his changes of behavior actually begin to confuse, worry, and scare the shit out of people, from teachers to students because, hey, he's not acting like the Harry they knew.

Theories range from Harry going nuts; being replaced by a doppelganger (from alien to fae, to possession to someone wearing his face like Polyjuice, etcetera); conspiracy theories; Harry gone 'bad' and is 'overcompensating'; Harry fancying them which confuses some: anything you can think of.

Events and interactions between everyone in Hogwarts snowball/domino/feed around on/each other, such as girls like Lavender and Morag getting in fights because Harry obviously fancied them, Pansy fighting with Malfoy because 'Potter isn't that bad, really' and Malfoy being paranoid, thinking he's up to something, Katie, Angelina, and Alicia think he's being controlled by aliens and are determined to free him and not be 'controlled' themselves, Pomphrey begins to covertly check him for 'abnormalities' in him when possible, etcetera.

Ironically, the only 'sane' ones are Snape, who recognizes that Harry is trying to change for the better and reacts accordingly (which freaks Harry out a little because /Snape/) and Aurora Sinistra, who also came from an abusive background herself and sympathizes/understands.

Poor Harry is just in the middle, confused at why everyone else is acting odd around him. He's obviously not following the books' advice correctly, right?


** Oh. My. God. This is a brilliant prompt. I'll have to save this for when I'm a better writer more capable of dealing with all the details! Absolutely brilliant!

**** Agreed. You get better at writing /by/ writing, so write that fic now. If it's not good, then put it aside and steal the concepts for something else later.
