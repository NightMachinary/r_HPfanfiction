Sometimes there are such great comments from a character in fanfiction, that you're like, this is perfect! Or even be something that you could see canon selfs saying, or even if you can't see the canon self saying it, you just really love it.

So, what are some of your favorite comments/quotes from Harry Potter fanfiction? It can be from any character.

Would appreciate it if you could say the title and author as well.


** The [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/page-28#post-3208644][latest chapter]] of Enter the Dragon has a marvelous scene where Dumbledore confronts Lucius regarding the Chamber of Secrets issue and puts the fear of Dumbledore into him. Just a snippet:

#+begin_quote
  "A nation can only be a nation of laws if those laws apply to everyone, /especially/ to those who might otherwise have enough power to ignore them with impunity! If /I/ do not follow those laws, /no one will/. Who would follow a rule that even the rule's creator flouted?...On the other hand, I am also bound by my oaths as the Headmaster of Hogwarts. And in your /blind idiocy/, Lucius, you have managed to put those two oaths into conflict. You have threatened one of my students while she was /at/ my school, a child that I am therefore oathbound to protect.”

  “I have brought you here to remind you that actions have /consequences/. No /lasting/ damage was inflicted by your recent bout of stupidity, Lucius, so I am within bounds of proper behavior to leave you alive, but I give you this warning. Should another of my students come to harm in a way that I can trace back to you --- in school or not, court admissible evidence or not --- /I will bury you/.”

  "You see, Lucius, I could /refrain from/ killing you where you sit, or I could /accept the punishment/ for killing you where you sit. The law cares not which.”

**** I had just read it the day before yesterday and it stuck with me because the moment it was delivered was very proper. I really liked that story.

There are many more quotes but for some reason, I liked that one, it fits the tone of story and is a very good explanation for why someone who can Force Choke others with magic is playing a sport.

I actually enjoy all your stories (Except the ending of Pureblood Princess, which for me ended with the Christmas Epilogue and nothing no one says to me will change it.)

My favorite is Letters, it was my entry point for Harry/Fleur and the reason I like the pairing.

** I think this line is from Benefits of Old Laws, but I can't find it so it's possible the line is from another Voldemort-adopts-Harry fic. Anyway, Draco is going on about how it's such an honor to be adopted by the Dark Lord and Harry snaps, "Well, maybe if you ask nicely he'll murder /your/ parents and adopt /you/ instead!"

It's a lovely Oh Shit moment, in large part because the reader has been seeing Voldemort's POV as a sympathetic character trying to make amends. So on the surface Harry is pointing out how tactless Malfoy is being, but it's also a great reminder that no matter how nice Voldie is now, there's some things he CAN'T make amends for.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

/Dumbledore, McGonagall, the other school heads, and the Ministry officials in charge of the event strode in a moment later. "Harry Potter, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?" Dumbledore demanded. He was standing just inches from Harry, so close that their noses were almost touching. There was a spark of curiosity in the man's eyes./

/"Me?" Harry asked, delicately placing a hand over his heart. "I would never, sir. To be accused of such a thing is absolutely astounding.

** So many. Unfortunately I forget most of them.

Three that stick with me continually from the awesome fic Protective Custody by colubrina:

"They should have killed Narcissa Malfoy. There are some women you don't allow to slip off into exile, and the woman willing to lie to the darkest wizard the world have ever seen for the sake of her son, a son you're holding as a slave? She would be one of those women."

"It turns out that after you fight and beat a literal monster you become difficult to intimidate with bureaucracy."

"It turns out that if you hand-raise a tiger you can train him to attach your enemies. It also turns out that tigers grow up and become less malleable. The Ministry had had a tiger by the tail and, unaware of this, had let go. That had been a mistake."

--

A recent favorite: "Snape cocks an eyebrow at him. "I should try quite especially hard not to die, in return for which you will consent to inherit all my worldly possessions when I do?" he says coolly.  "Yes," says Harry, stubbornly. Snape appears to wrestle with this concept for a moment. "Have you ever actually heard of irony, Potter?""

It's parody-crack, but openly mocks tropes... Like this gem from Dumbledore:

or another one from him.

#+begin_quote
  "Do you even know about the Greater Good, you little /shit/?!" he shouted in a commanding voice. He then proceeded to improvise a call-and-answer performance with the teaching staff.

  "WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?"

  "THE GREATER GOOD!"

  "WHAT ARE WE LIVING FOR?"

  "THE GREATER GOOD!"

  "WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE?"

  "THE GREATER GOOD!"

  "WHO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA?"

** The ‘oh shit' moment in Isolation by Bex Chan when Draco gets angry and says muggles are just as barbaric as he'd always thought and racism is ridiculous because the colour of someone's skin isn't something they choose (after reading To Kill A Mockingbird I think) and Hermione just sort of smiles and looks at him and he realise what he's said.

** Theres a bit in Happily Ever After by jeconaise where Harry's talking about legacy and living forever that really speaks to me. I'd have to hunt the passage down to get the exact quote but its basically about how Voldemort let's his fear of death destroy the only way he could ever truly live forever.

*** Is this the passage you mean?

“I think,” Rebecca said softly, “that most people think that killing Voldemort was enough to get whatever you want.”

“I've got what I want,” Harry grinned. “And I'll spend the rest of my life making sure all my friends are happy. Isn't that the point of life? To make yourself and your friends as happy as possible, and if you can, make a legacy that will last forever.

“That was what Voldemort never truly understood, that you don't need to live forever to be immortal, you can just work toward something that will last. He had so much power at one stage, and if he'd just done something constructive rather than give into the fear caused by his own mortality, he could have been a legend that never died, like Merlin or one of the Founders.

“It's sad that all that potential ended up in a graveyard, but fitting all the same. He had the chance and he didn't take it. He tried to be evil and force people to do what he said. But he never repented, and even as I killed him, he looked at me with malevolence and hate.”

He took a long sip of the orange juice in front of him and absently saluted the professors at the table. “Voldemort could have been up there next to Dumbledore, the next generation ready to take over, to be respected, to have influence beyond the dreams of most people, but it wasn't enough for him. He had to have it his way, and his fear meant that everything that was different had to be destroyed.

“Some say that Voldemort was a hero, that he had the courage to make the changes the Wizarding World needed. I say he was a coward and a juvenile one as well. He had to destroy everything around him if he didn't get his own way, and his idea of recreating the world would have killed it faster than a Killing Curse.

“The Wizarding world is only strong as long as it continues to be diverse. You take out the fresh blood and new genes arriving and you end up with everyone like Draco -- largely incompetent, full of prejudice, and remarkably powerless.

“So if you are going to change things, you have to start at the bottom and sort out the problems first. The economy, the lack of opportunities for everyone leaving Hogwarts, the restrictions put in place by people afraid of change, and once you've fixed that, then and only then can you have a civilisation that can be remembered through eternity. Only then can you have immortality as someone who lived during that time when the old order was destroyed and a new one created. Only then can you tell your grandchildren that you were there. That you were one of the people who started it, you stood up and were counted when the time was right.

“The history books might not remember you individually, but when you look down and see the paradise that this world could become, that will be your immortality, that will be your legacy, and in thousands of years time, there will be a generation of children in this school who will study us, and will marvel at what we have achieved, just as we marvel at the exploits of Merlin and Godric, and Rowena, and Helga and even Salazar.”

Harry looked around in surprise to find everyone concentrated on him. He blushed. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “I didn't mean to interrupt dinner again.” He felt uncomfortable with the looks on the faces of some of the students; he wasn't sure what they meant.

** Okay this isn't actually my favourite quote from linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7) but it's up there...

"Nah, you'd have given it up and gone off and lived on some tropical island with like four supermodels in some weird haremesque relationship that no one actually understands. But everyone would just shrug and go 'hey he's Harry Potter, he should have an orgy with every beautiful, mythical being without question,'" Titus said.

"So I'd just spend every day like I spend the offseason?" Harry deadpanned.

--- Making Lemonade by Dayja linkffn(11123626)

​

#+begin_quote
  “The curse in my hand is slowly killing me. When the time comes, if Draco chooses the light, I need someone who will show mercy to an old man.”

  Harry stared at the blackened shrivelled hand, and then at the objects on the table he now had a name for. Horcruxes. He looked back at the man he used to regard as his hero, and was reminded of people too lost in the details to see the bigger picture anymore.

  “Will you deserve it?” Harry asked quietly, feeling like a complete arse. He didn't dare meet the headmaster's eyes as he left the office.
