:END:
This community is so freaking sweet and supportive. (Most of the time.) It is filled with wonderful writers and great ideas. I am thrilled to announce the completion of my quarantine project: The Potioneers. Now I know an obscene amount of you just hate Dramione and that's fine. I get it. You still might like this one if you try. If not, sorry. I intend to do my favorite ship (Hermione and the twins) at some point and you can check back then.

Its a post war world building/ romance fic that explores a variety of (new) places around the magical world while their relationship grows slowly.

*Pros*

- In character
- World building
- Natural relationship progression
- Unpredictable
- Slow burn
- Realistic Drama

*Cons*

- Weak first 4ish chapters
- The rare spelling mistake (no beta)
- Unpredictable
- Apparently a lot of phones get thrown
- Lacks the Soap Opera drama that, let's face it, can be very fun

​

*Rated T for teen.*

** It is not really my style but after reading the first chapter, I wanted to congratulate you. First on your finished project, but also on the fact that it's really well written and the world building seems amazing. Best of luck!

** The first chapter is promising though-I liked the ambiance, I liked what you did with the characters, I also like the exotic setting of the story. Well done!

*** Oh my... such a quick response. Thank you. I honestly hate those first chapters after finishing the rest of the fic. They were written so long ago that the skill in later chapters makes the early ones pale in comparison. I fully intend to rewrite them at some point to bring them up to par with the rest of the fic.

I appreciate the interest!

**** Having that disparity is what I love about longer fanfiction like yours. You're not only watching the characters develop, but the author as well. It encourages me to write.
