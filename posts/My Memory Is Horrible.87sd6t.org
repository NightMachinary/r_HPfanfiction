There's a fic that at the Triwizard Tournament Dumbledore constantly tries to make harry either become friends or makeup with the Weasleys (Don't remember if it included Hermione).

Two events I remember specifically is Ron and someone else visiting Harry because of the Organizers but Ron walks over to Cedric instead. The other is that Ginny is Harry's hostage for the second task instead of someone else.

I went through my browsing history looking for it but the fact that I can't remember if it's a Goblet Of Fire AU or something else before GOF. Also before anyone says that it wasn't a good enough fic that I remember it, Only two fics have their names burned into my memory. Cadmean Victory and The Red Swordsman: Slayer of Aincrad.

I have read hundreds of fics and few of them have made it to my favorites list. This didn't (As far as I know) but those two scenes are stuck in my head and I want to read the story that they are from.

(There's also the slim possibility that they are from two different stories but I doubt that)


** At outs with Ron (and Hermione to some extent) and with Ginny as hostage - that sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9631998/1/The-Thorny-Rose][The Thorny Rose]], but it doesn't fit with most of the other stuff.
