I'm looking for this HG/SS story when Hermione wakes on day and starts transforming in some kind of rare witch/creature. (She ends up blonde hair, gold eyes and can fly) she is bound to Snape and has a compulsion to heal him whenever he gets hurt. Her blood can be used as a defence against curses and she ends up being captured by Voldemort.

That's all I can remember but it won't stop bothering me..I need to read this story again..
