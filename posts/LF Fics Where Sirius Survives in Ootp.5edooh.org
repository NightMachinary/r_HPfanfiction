Bonus points if they are fics where Sirius joins Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the Horcrux Hunt!


** I have two recs for you; both are slash so if that's not your thing pass this comment on by.

linkao3(Found in the Moments between the Search) is Sirius/Severus and is my favourite short example of this.

linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge) is also good; he doesn't survive, but rather a younger version of himself comes forward in time (via the Map) and joines the Horcrux Hunt. Harry/Sirius, non-explicit. It's not an exact fit for your search, but it's long and magnificent, and if slash isn't a complete and total no-go for you I highly recommend it.

  When Sirius returns from beyond the Veil with knowledge of Voldemort's Horcruxes, he takes on the task of finding and destroying them. Somewhere along the way he finds an unexpected ally and perhaps something more. (AU from the end of OotP, takes place during HBP period)

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

** I have him survive in "Harry Potter and the Spygirl", which starts at the end of OotP.

He usually is alive in most of my stories, but they generally are AUs. He survives in "Uncle Quentin's Spy", but that's set in an alternate OotP.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** The Lion Tamer series. Can't remember the author. The horcrux hunt, however, is completely different. I can't say more without dropping /HUGE/ spoilers.

***** Yup. That is indeed the first fic in the series. While the series was too edgy and suspenseful for my normal reading tastes, I nevertheless liked them.
