'Her teeth were her only bracelet; she carried them within the red velvet purse of her lips'. :D

I read this today and all I could think was that 'Pale, Shining Avada Orbs' literally pales in comparison. Like, dear lord. If you ever, ever feel bad about your writing, like every word is shite and your descriptions are corny, remember that a book with that two-page description of nonsense actually got published. Even more motivational - it's the second in a /trilogy/. :D

So I can keep this thread HP-relevant and not deleted - what are the most unintentionally funny or cringy descriptions you've read in HP Fanfic?

*** I think that was /intentionally/ cringe-y on Rowling's part. The writer of that one was 11, and probably not in her right mind at the time (even if she wrote it in the time she'd thrown the diary away, she'd still be feeling the effects).

** "your eyes are the sound of rain" "Her face had the fragrance of a gibbous moon"

listen, I'm fond of the flowery metaphors myself, but they should at least be comprehensible. At least avada orbs tells us Harry's eyes are green(wrong shade though, iirc.) If your eyes are "hard as amethyst" or "the sound of rain," then that tells us absolutely nothing about what they look like. It seriously sounds like the person describing this woman was tripping on acid with all the mismatched sensory metaphors.

You might not know the colour, but you can guess that the person has a hard, unpleasant look 24/7, which also tells you a bit about their face/expression without ever explicitly saying so.
