I've been looking for a while and I've come to the conclusion that maybe I'm too picky. I'm looking for a complete fic that's not indie Harry or op Harry that's got decent writing under 150k. There's a few exceptions but I've found that fics over 100k just have a lot of boring "filler" and it takes too long for things to happen. I just really want to avoid a lot of awful tropes and bad writing, and so many of the recs I have seen here in my search fall into one of these categories. I'd prefer post war but at this point it doesn't matter too much as long as they're in character. Any background ships are okay unless they involve Snape. Thanks in advance :)

Edit: complete is preferred.


** I recently compiled a big list of HHr fic recommendations into a doc found [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juV1sSMBpPdab-FgoAntz4XxOOg8gpM5nL-GZlrjrHo/edit][*here*]]. I'll probably add another list for one shots in the future.

Have a look. Maybe you'll find something in there for you. I'm not very fond of all the typical Harmony cliches/tropes (e.g. SuperHarry, ...), so you won't find any of them there.

** I highly recommend unlike a sister by mad harmony

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister]]

Warning its unfinished, but by far the best harmony romance fic out there. Well worth the read.

Post war, with a beileveable relationship,

dont worry about being picky, even though I primarily read exclusively harmony, I drop a lot of fics because most harmony fics are just really bad wish fulfillment fics.

*** Thanks! I might check it out but I don't really like getting invested in unfinished fics. Is there a lot of unfinished business?
