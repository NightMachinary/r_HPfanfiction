1) No Snape slash

2) I love reading Snape mentors Harry, and Snape is a father to Harry fics, but I also like fics where Snape hates Harry. I can't explain why easily, but I just do.

So this has to be a fic where Snape hates Harry, as much as he does in canon.

3) This is optional, but a fic that follows Snape's actions, thoughts, feelings, and so on; based on canon; would be greatly appreciated.

For example, in canon, Snape tries to get past Fluffy, what if that were told from his perspective? What if Snape seeing Harry trying not to fall off his jinxed broom was seen from Snape's perspective.

Of course, number 3 is optional. Number 1 and 2 are compulsory.

Please let me know in your post if your fic meets requirement number 3, so I can prioritize that fic.


** linkffn(The Never-ending Road by laventadorn) I'm going out on a limb and saying this is probably my favourite fanfiction ever. I'm eagerly awaiting updates from the sequel. This meets most of your needs, though the Harry here is fem!Harry. The difference between Harry and Harriet is nuanced and subtle. Snape's feelings towards Harriet are more complicated because rather than focusing on his resentment towards James, his actions are fuelled by guilt towards Lily. You don't have to worry about the pairing because this part is basically gen. The writing is beautiful and Snape's internal monologue is hilarious.

These are all fics with mentor Snape but they both take a long time to warm up to each other:

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste) Snape mentors Harry and still hates him at the same time.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills by Jocelyn)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within by Theowyn of HPG ) and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls by Theowyn of HPG)

linkffn(Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar)

linkffn(A Place for Warriors by owlsaway)

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

Canon Harry is transported into an AU where he married Lily after James' death and loves Harry like a son. Except Lily is not quite there mentally, and Snape has to take care of her. Alternate!Harry is transported to the canon universe to find his mother dead and his adopted father hate him. Really liked the contrast between the two Snapes and Harrys, and their interactions with their alternate selves.
