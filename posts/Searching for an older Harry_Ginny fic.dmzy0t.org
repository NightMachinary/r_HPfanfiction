:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm searching for a fic I read years ago. Here's what I remember:

- Took place years after Voldemort.
- Pairing was going toward Harry/Ginny (can't remember if we got there).
- Harry was a powerhouse
- Ginny was participating in a large scale wizarding competition like the Triwizard, but much harder.
- Harry was involved in the competition (either helping Ginny or involved in the organization or both).
- Harry had an adopted child from just after the war.
- The fic probably was on FFN.

Thank you for your help.


** Gave it another try this morning and finally found what seems to be it.

I was definitely more forgiving years ago, as it starts with a lot of red flags which will normally make me quit. It seems to be getting better with each chapters (I'm starting sixth)

  After the war Harry vanished with a small girl for 7 years. Now a new dark force and a terrifying tournament draw the Boy-Who-Lived out of his exile to stand, once more, as a hero. Can he and his adopted daughter, Lily, prevent another war?
