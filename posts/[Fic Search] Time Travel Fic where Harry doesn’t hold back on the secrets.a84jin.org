I was reading this on the reddit mobile app tonight off a link from this sub & the app crashed & now I can't find the post. It's a time travel Fic that drops Harry back to the moment he is sorted & he immediately starts using his knowledge publicly. He's declared lord slytherin, calls in his life debt to snape, & snaps the elder wand all in the first couple chapters.

Help!

**** You know, I actually don't know and never noticed that! I was reading it because there was a thread about it earlier and I got bored by chapter 5 or so (but up until then it's exactly what you describe.)

***** Stargate is involved later on in the fic. It's slow to add in and makes a lot of sense when it does. Honestly this one of my favorite fics so I can't recommend it enough.

****** I gave up when it looked like it was going into a harem fic direction, which was early on.
