I'm looking for a story where a Muggleborn realises they have powers of some sort and try figuring it out. It doesn't matter where they get their inspiration from. I said Hermione because she's the default Muggleborn but anyone raised without knowledge of magic will do. If it's Harry I've likely already read it but I'd love to see any recs regardless.

Examples are:

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demontologist)

linkffn(The Perils of Innocence)

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** Confectionary Chronicles is great. It's a crossover with Supernatural, but I know bugger all about that show (Gay Angel and they meet Death a few times) and I've been able to follow and enjoy the story. I know quite a bit about mythology and theology though, so I'm not entirely sure how good my knowledge-measurement is there. It's definitely fun, and Hermione becomes quite the Trickster with her magic.

** Dodging prison and stealing witches has it as a part in the story, though it is quite controversial....
