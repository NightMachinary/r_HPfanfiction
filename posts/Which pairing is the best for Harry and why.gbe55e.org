Of course this is jn your opinion so answers will vary but why are you right about which pairing is the best for Harry.


** There's no singular answer, and the key to any pairing would be good writing.

For instance, the canon pairing of Harry/Ginny is... Well, I don't find it particularly convincing, mostly because Ginny felt underdeveloped as a character to me (ie, I associate her more with the fangirl version of Ginny than as the character she became), and that she seemed to become his partner just because that's what JKR wanted. However, a good author can make it work a lot better.

Some pairings I've enjoyed in fanfiction are Harry/Hermione (which I see as a decent 'default', personally), Harry/Daphne (a blank slate character, but the combination of being traditionally wizarding + varying amounts of adherance to pureblood ideology makes her interesting), and Luna. OCs can also work quite well - even a seemingly random muggle one, like in 'Grow Young with Me' can have a buildup that feels very good. The younger version of Bellatrix is also an interesting pairing for time travel fics.

Some pairings that I like in theory, but haven't seen any great executions of also include Fleur (most fail by playing up her Veela nature x100, then making Harry immune to it, or by making her into a terrible person) and Tonks. Delphini could be interesting as well, in an AU where she's more prominent earlier on and close to Harry's age (eg, if she went to Hogwarts at the same time Harry did), but that's not something I've seen... for good reason.

However, any pairing can be made to work - it just needs a good author that's willing to put in the time to make it believable/interesting.

*** We didn't really see that much of Ginny's character in the story, though, so it's not necessarily because she's underdeveloped, but maybe more because she didn't have a lot of 'screen time' to show it.

** It very much depends on what you're looking for.

​

Daphne and similar pairings like give political knowledge and knowhow, which suits more politically inclined Harrys.

​

Ginny tends to be very much hormone driven, but can also have elements of shared experiences with horcruxes and possesion, as well as quiddich ofc. I personally don't like this pairing because that's all they seem to have in common but to each their own.

​

Hermione pairings tends to be about driving him to do better and be the best "him" he can be. This is one of my personal favorites because they have very similar upbringings ie. friendless and bulied so it doesn't take much to get them into a relationship.

​

Luna pairings vary greatly between being about having fun, and Luna's insights into strange topics, depending on what version of Luna people are writing about. This is my other personal favorite.

** Fleur/Daphne. Both really expand Harry's horizons. Daphne being a pureblood gets Harry an In for the rest of his life, and provides him with political knowledge(if we are going off the common fanon), Fleur has a lot of the same sort of reasons. Her father works in the French Ministry(fanon once again) and she herself is an extremely talented witch who can assist Harry in whatever he pushes himself towards. Plus the Clout that that relationship would pull with them BOTH being members of the first Tri-Wizard Cup in over a century, well I'm not sure powerhouse even begins to describe this combo

** I'd say Tonks, and specifically because the question is 'best for Harry'.

Tonks is a powerful and competent witch. She's an expert in things Harry needs to know like all the Auror skills and training, knowledge of Ministry rules and laws, and she has allies within the DMLE. Her shapeshifting ability makes it easy for her to integrate in his life without becoming a vulnerability.

Ted and Andromeda Tonks would also be helpful in providing perspective and support from both the wizarding and muggle worlds. Most others would see the reasons for his attraction to her and the relatively 'politically savvy' aspect of her background -- she's a British witch descended from Pure blood but with enough muggleborn influence to not make him seen as wholly in the Pureblood camp.

Tonks herself is outgoing, funny, self-effacing yet cheerful. Harry might expect her to be alright teaching him about sex without looking down on him for it, which would make it easier for him to approach her honestly.

To me, the real stumbling block for the pairing is 'how is this best for Tonks?'.

*** This makes her a good mentor, not a good romantic pairing. It's pretty much just grooming as described here. If you're going to pair Harry with Tonks, it should be post-Hogwarts with Harry already having had past relationships. Otherwise you have some very concerning dynamics.

***** In the context of a romantic relationship in which Harry is still a romantically inexperienced teen, yes, absolutely. Harry may be mature in someways, but not socially/emotionally, which is the type of maturity that matters in romantic relationships. An adult "sharing their experience", in the context of a developing sexual/romantic relationship, with a traumatized teenager is textbook grooming. That is 100% what predators do.

How old are you? At the age Tonks is when she meets Harry, I would have absolutely considered that relationship predatory. I think that's harder to see when you are the age of the younger partner.

****** I think you're confusing what a dynamic can be versus what it is.

One person in a relationship is always older than the other. One person may be more experienced than the other, both sexually and relationship-wise (as they are not the same thing, though related). Honestly, I think much of the problem with sex education is this assumption that it's best for both partners to be virgins. In no other context is the idea 'just leave them to figure it out between them' considered the ideal training scenario.

What you seem to be saying is that Tonks in this scenario HAS to be a predator because she is more experienced than Harry. I haven't even said when the sexual part of the relationship is forming. Harry could become close with Tonks in year six, be separated during year 7 but Harry still hasn't had a long term relationship, or even sex, when they hook up a few days before the Battle of Hogwarts. By my perspective, the last thing Harry needs at that point is to fumble his way through with someone equally inexperienced, like Ginny or Hermione or Luna (assuming they are inexperienced at that point). If it goes badly, and it most likely will, all either party will remember is pain, shame, regret, and a total lack of bonding in the moment they both needed reassurance.

******* Nah Tonks is too old for him to date before 7th year. She was already in 7th year when he started Hogwarts. Post-Hogwarts was good. You can write good story where she lives after final battle, she and Harry takes care of Teddy then fall in love. During Hogwarts was pretty awkard and unhealthy relationship.

******* Sex isn't about "training" though. A healthy sexual relationship is one in which you both adapt to each other together anyway. The first time between new partners is usually a bit awkward regardless of experience anyway. People are not interchangeable, they have different likes and dislikes. And a significant experience gap tends to just increase insecurity in the less experienced partner, making them less likely to communicate in the way that is needed to facilitate an enjoyable experience. Also, awkward sex is hardly the death knell of a relationship, especially if have built your relationship on a solid foundation, which is harder to do if you're not on equal footing.

The more important gap is social/emotional maturity. The gap in that between a 17 year old and a 24 year old is going to be quite large. Again, I think this is something that becomes easier to see with the perspective of age. Even if Tonks doesn't have predatory motives, pursuing this sort of relationship is not the behavior of a healthy adult at all. I mean, talk about a recipe for shame and regret...
