Hey guys! I'm looking for fics where Hermione ends up in the marauders era. I'd love romance fics but I'd also like suggestions for good non-romance ones if you've got them!

Bonus points for HG/SB Double bonus points for HG/RL

Dark, angst, mystery, adventure, action, I love it all.


** You are in luck, recently finding semi-readable Hermione/Sirius fics has been my new obsession. There are so many fics, but a very few completed.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  The smartest witch of her age is thrown back twenty years in time only to study and fight alongside the infamous Marauders and their friends. Add the sudden existence of a carelessly handsome Marauder's love life to the mix and the wizarding world's history simply cannot remain the same. [Sirius Black X Hermione Granger ] - COMPLETE

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
