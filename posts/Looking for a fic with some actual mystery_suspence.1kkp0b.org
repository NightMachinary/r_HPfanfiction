** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1312532/1/The-Human-Condition][The Human Condition]] by C. J. Talons is very good. 260k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  He never had it easy. But now Harry Potter is faced with a new challenge an enemy he cannot see. But before Harry can consider battling his new foe, he must first control the demons within his mind. Written before publication of HBP.

All of the Alexandra Quick stories by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]] would also qualify. They are a dramatic AU, borrowing essentially no characters from the original series. Four complete, novel-length stories.

#+begin_quote
  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

Tinn Tam's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees][Song of the Trees]] is also quite good, riddled with mystery and intrigue. 207k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

** I'll offer up a story I completed a year ago. It's set about 40 years after the war, but still focuses on the canon characters from the book. It's about 262,000 words long.
