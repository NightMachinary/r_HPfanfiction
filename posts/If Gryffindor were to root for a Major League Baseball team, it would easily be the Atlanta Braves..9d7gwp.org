Why? Because they are my favorite baseball team (so I'm biased) and are */literally/* called the Atlanta Braves. And being brave and having a fearless attitude is a major trait that represents the Gryffindor house. We also love red and have play in red jerseys sometimes.

Really, British wouldn't care about baseball or American sports in general for that matter, but if wizards were to migrate over to America and share and spread their culture here, the wizards would went to Hogwarts and were sorted into Gryffindor would be big Braves fans.

** I dunno Gryffindor as we see them at the start of the series are perennially downtrodden, totally full of themselves but with little to show for it in terms of success all while being obsessed with past glory?

They're the Boston Red Sox pre 2004.

** Them's Ranger's fans dude.

Gryffindor's attitude in general actual fits well for the stereotype people have of Texas, now that I think about it.
