** These fics might be close to what you are looking for?

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] - A WBWL fic. Harry has a traumatic childhood, is kidnapped by Death Eaters and ends up sorted into Slytherin. His past makes him unable to connect with most people, but his brother and Remus try to help him. There's not really any romance, but his relationship with Luna is sweet. linkffn(12021325)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12405748/1/][Harry Potter and the Curse of Undeath]] - Harry is ostracized when his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. Disillusioned with everyone who should have helped him, he returns to the Chamber of Secrets looking for knowledge that can give him the power to survive. Thus he begins to walk down a dark path. Contains a Harry/Daphne pairing. (Not a Slytherin!Harry story, but otherwise seems to fit your request.) linkffn(12405748)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
