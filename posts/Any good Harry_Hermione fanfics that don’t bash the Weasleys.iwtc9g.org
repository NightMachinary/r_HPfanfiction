Harry/Hermione is my OTP, but at the same time I like the Weasleys, so it's a big turn off whenever they get bashed in stories.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

*** Finished now. Pretty good actually, I really like the way the author handled Ron and Dumbledore. Did anyone else notice how, around chapter 8 or 9, suddenly the author started using a TON of ellipsis? Like wayyyyy too many. The writing quality was pretty good otherwise.

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL

**** It seems like a mix, leaning more towards excuses. I've only read Chapter 34, though, but it seems more like a soul bond fic than anything else at first glance. I will say that Chapter 34 does deliver on the original request of no Weasley bashing.

They are in fourth year and refer to each other as their "mate." After Harry's name gets called by the Goblet magic forces him to propose to Hermione and she accepts. Fleur asks Cedric if this is typical for the "kitty couple" and he agrees, seeming tired of it. A group of their friends seems to have formed a, well, group to fight with them called "Chaos" and they all have "Warriors"-style cat nicknames and basilisk armor and meet up in the Chamber. Additionally, Ron is the one who organizes everyone to research the tournament and help Harry prepare and the twins are part of the group, too, so it does seem that it avoids Weasley bashing at first glance

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.
