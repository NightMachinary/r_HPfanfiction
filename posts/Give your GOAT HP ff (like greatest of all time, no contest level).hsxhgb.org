** Here you are, one for each of my favorite parings.

linkffn(13022013).

linkffn(12797831).

Has trigger warnings on some chapters so read the ANs at the beginning if anything might bother you. I think its chapter 13, 14, and 32, no gaurantees though.

Edit: Not sure if I linked it right, and just a note that Harry is significantly changed in the second one in a mental and emotional aspect, with the abuse from the Dursley's having greater impact.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

**** It's popular because it's a Harry/OC pairing without the stigma of using a blatently original character.

Grow Young with Me is a good option if you want an OC pairing in an epilogue compliant story. It's a fluffy/angsty romance with bonus Parent!Harry and has a fairly well done OC. Surprised it isn't here yet, I'm sure it's somebody's GOAT fic lol. linkao3(16405130)

**** Don't bother with Novocaine. It's awful.

In our world, Novocaine is a drug designed to nullify our senses in times of extreme pain, and to be fair it does the job of nullifying your senses perfectly. It's a grey walk through the wizarding world from one boring place where Harry throws money at things to another boring place where Harry throws more money at things.

It's the literary equivalent of one of those awful musicals where the lead character solves all the village's problems and ends up at the apex of a triangle of grateful people following him (and it's almost always a him) down the street.

Steer well clear.

** While it doesn't really mesh with your desire not to see OOC or trope heavy, I've always found myself returning to the various stories by TheBlack'sResurgence simply because the actual quality of writing is very good. The stories all flow well and make sense in the setting them establish.

It does help of course that 2 of the 3 main stories they have written are Harry/Bellatrix ( my guilty pleasure) and Harry/Tonks ( which is one of my 3 favourite harry pairings)

The one I re-read the most however is the Harry/Daphne

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

** I've said it before and I'll say it again: linkffn(Vitam Paramus) is my favourite story.

It's so sad that it often gets called a Harry Potter/Gabrielle Delacour romance because that simplifies things far too much. Saying that it's a story about two people saving each other gets closer. But really, just read it for yourself.

It might not be [[/u/TE7]]'s "best" story in terms of writing and depth of plot but it stays with me as a story I read time and time again and it never loses its edge.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** MILD SPOILERS - You obviously didn't read the post description. I find Cadmean victory way too long firstly with a lot of unnecessary bs put in there for the sake of it. More than that, I find that Harry's character is so fundamentally changed in that fic that it might as well be an OC. The Hermione Ron Snape and especially Dumbeldore bashing is too much for me and I just feel that Harry's choices that revolve around the whole I do not forgive I do not forget shit are all so OOC. Ik that fans will say that this is because he was going through emo teen shit and had a horcrux in him but he still did kill Dumbeldore in one of the last chapters. That fic almost made me hate HP FF just because of how convoluted and bad it is.
