** As a contrast, why I don't like it:

1. The writing isn't good. In contrast to some posts in this thread, MoR is not written "professionally". Yes, in terms of technical writing there are few if any errors. But good writing is a lot more than an absence of errors. MoR is full of characters monologuing or having extended tangential conversations. Brevity is a key part of good writing, and MoR lacks it.

2. The pacing is terrible. This is probably the worst aspect of the fic. It just goes on and on, meandering here and there but without any overarching plot structure. Some people raise the defence of "it's episodic like a TV show" but no, it isn't. Even episodic TV shows have structure. MoR isn't like Friends, MoR is like an alternate idea of Friends where it's season 7 and they've still only known each other for a week.

3. I don't like the magic. This is largely personal, I suppose, but I hate the nerfed temporary transfiguration, the complete reinterpretation of Dementors as representing death rather than depression and decay, the Sorting Hat, etc. It's just so much less romantic than canon, so much more mechanistic. It loses something in the translation, I think. I also rather dislike the abuse of "loopholes". This ties in with "mechanistic magic", I suppose. Magic only has loopholes if it acts mechanistically. I prefer to think of magic as capable of closing its own loopholes e.g. if you try to use Felix Felicis to brew more Felix it'll backfire.

4. It's disrespectful of canon. While I can accept that fanfic going a different direction with magic is a matter of personal taste, this is something more objective. MoR doesn't just say "Hey, wouldn't it be interesting if Dementors were creatures of death", it says "Dementors must be creatures of death, the idea that they're creatures of depression is ludicrous". In doing so it's making itself out to be a superior kind of canon to that which JKR wrote. Not only is this insulting the source material, it also means that MoR opens itself up to all sorts of argumentation regarding canon compatibility, because it's now making claims to be a superior interpretation of canon events than JKR's.

5. The kids act like adults. This doesn't need much explanation. The fic fails to make the distinction between intelligence and maturity.

6. It's a mess of different ideas. MoR reminds me of Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart, where the author just shoved every single idea they had into a single fic, regardless of thematic unity or how they relate to the plot. MoR is like an ideas document, a fanfic sandbox.

7. Thematic clash. Voldemort sending his horcrux into space is the perfect example (which is also an example of bad pacing, in that you've basically set up a villain who can never be defeated). Is it logical? Yes. Does it fit with the feel of the HP universe? No. There's a reason why wizards haven't gone to space despite having all the magic you'd need to do so, and that's the simple fact that combining space travel with a semi-medieval semi-Victorian society is the literary equivalent of wearing pink and green.

8. The author used it as a cash cow. Admittedly this has nothing to do with the story per se, but it still makes me somewhat sick. The author promised accelerated chapter releases in exchange for monetary donations. Yes, it was to a not-for-profit organisation, but it was a not-for-profit that the author has a financial interest in, given that they pay (paid?) his salary. Given how the fandom feels about authors holding chapters hostage for reviews ("I'll post the next chapter when I get 20 reviews!"), you can imagine how a lot of people felt about asking for money. It's just unacceptable.

*** For me, I'd add (risking downvotes, I'm sure):

1. The author presents himself as a pretentious douche with some of the thinnest skin of anyone who's supposedly an adult. In the early days of the fic, I recall leaving honest reviews only to receive hostile replies, presumably because I wasn't part of Yudkowsky's cult of personality. (Honestly, I do find the whole "I'm smarter than you" bit tedious, the kind of thing done by those who would edit their Wiki pages to include SAT scores in lieu of actual accomplishments and who apparently don't interact much with other people in their day jobs.)

Because stories are inevitably a reflection of the narrator, I find that I just can't enjoy them when I find the author unlikable. I won't read John Ringo or Michael Chrichton because they suck/sucked as human beings. After meeting GRR Martin, I can no longer enjoy Game of Thrones. I suffer enough "plug my nose and read this shit though I despise the authors" in my day job, reading scientific papers by a few of my colleagues/competitors. I don't need to compound the woe in my free time. It could be the greatest writing since Billy Shakes, but I won't touch a story by JoeHundredaire, Kinsfire, Bobmin, Perfect Lionheart, or LessWrong.

**** I respect that viewpoint, I really do. For me, it's the /Ender's Game/ conundrum. I /loved/ (love?) Ender's Game when I read it as a teenager. Since then, basically everything I've read/heard/watched about Orson Scott Card has made me feel very ambivalent about liking that book.

It's a classic debate - can you, should you separate the author from the text? To what degree can stories stand on their own?

I've gone back and forth on it many times. I can't fault you for taking the other side. I think there's a degree of immediacy that comes into play: I can know, intellectually, that Card has some opinions I don't share and is kind of a d-bag in the way he chooses to express them. If I'd written Card a letter and gotten a sulky, pretentious response, I would no doubt find it much harder to like /Ender's Game/. Might not be the most logical thing ever, but...

Anyway. I don't have strong feelings about MoR. It was something like the fourth or fifth fic I ever read, back when I was getting into fanfiction (about a year and a half ago). I laughed at some of the jokes, I thought the premise was interesting, but it didn't feel anything like the books and many of the characters felt a little too stiff, a little too long-winded. I neither love it nor hate it.

In particular, if you don't like the deconstructive approach to magic, HPMOR simply isn't for you.

Pers' criticisms, unfortunately, are the usual meaningless tripe I see often. I've had a couple dozen interactions with the author and never been treated without respect and politeness (and he doesn't use /ad hominem/ arguments). I additionally can't agree with the "don't like the creator don't consume the content" approach because it turns your moral standards into your literary standard, which doesn't make any sense.

I've personal experience with the author's behaving unpleasantly with respect to criticism. I fail to see the logic of why my experiences should be automatically discounted as "meaningless tripe," whereas yours are somehow germane to why I don't enjoy reading LessWrong. /I/ find the author unpleasant to deal with and choose not to interact with him, including reading his story.

Fanfiction, with the expectation of readers leaving reviews (something I recall LessWrong was rather shameless about back when I followed his story), is more interactive than traditional fiction. If I'd merely wished for the one-way author-to-reader infodump, then I'd pick up a book and in the process get a much more polished, higher quality story.

Consider Orson Scott Card, who uses the cash from his books to support his strident opposition to homosexuality and marriage equality, including his serving on the boards of lobbying organizations whose stated purpose is to stifle gay causes in Washington and elsewhere. Buy /Ender's Game/ and you tacitly support these causes, making this a moral choice.

Another example: Michael Crichton probably did more to muddy the scientific position on anthropogenic climate change (as well as other important social and scientific issues of his day) than any other writer. He did this by pretending to authority he did not possess and using said authority to counter the concerns of legitimate scientists. Why was this one man, who did no work whatsoever in climate science and had no scientific background in the field, given such a privileged position, even testifying before Congress? Because a lot of people bought his technobabble books. This apparently made him in their eyes an authority (much like how Tom Clancy is continually tapped for panels on international relations and military force). Again, consumption of an author's pablum has moral implications.

LessWrong is, like it or not, the de facto spokesperson for and authority on fanfiction--show me another HP fanfiction writer who gets written up and promoted in /The Atlantic/. When LessWrong's comments evince apparent disdain for JKR's source material, it's not just "some obscure writer somewhere" but the one who would speak for all of us. I don't like him with that power; I don't trust him with that power.

Specifically, when LessWrong makes statements that threaten the tenuous truce between traditional publishing and fanfiction with respect to violations of copyright law (and the attempts over the years by various parties to make money directly or indirectly from his fanfiction certainly raises its profile), this can be potentaily dangerous for the community. It would take only one salvo of Cease and Desist letters from JKR's lawyers to essentially wipe out HP fanfiction from the various archives.

But this really isn't why I don't read LessWrong. I just don't like his stories that much (not enough to overcome my dislike of him and his antics, at any rate).

/This/ is a criticism of the story, or at least a justification for not reading it. I've had dozens of interactions with Yudkowsky and never felt belittled or offended (often the opposite). I'm aware in the past that he's clashed with DLP and maybe others, but I've interacted with DLP as well and you'll excuse me if I default to taking Yudkowsky's side until I learn some details. I do not regard DLP highly.

However, and this ties to my main point, I still read stories that come from that forum, if they're good. You make good points about Crichton and Card -- I would certainly never give either of them money so they could spend it immorally -- but I was trying to express the difference between moral standards and literary standards. Morally, fuck those two. With regard to literature, I'm not going to /buy/ their books but I've read several by each. That I didn't much enjoy them was a function of the writing, not the spectre of the author's jackassery.

The overwhelming problem with entangling morality with what you read is that [[http://www.amazon.com/Intellectuals-Paul-Johnson/dp/1470887568][you can do it with /anyone/]]. There's also the illogic of picking up a book by someone you've never heard of, reading it, enjoying it, finding out the author is a rapist, and then deciding you hate the book.

Can't really comment on this. I will go on record as saying there is no power implicit in speaking for a loose community of fanfiction authors. As far as the possible cease and desists, I have been told by reliable users that Yudkowsky has permission from JKR's legal team to use canon in the way that he has (indirect fundraising, you might call it). Additionally, I am aware of the various jabs at canon in HPMOR. They're probably my least favorite part, for what it's worth, but tons of other fanfiction authors do the same. I don't think it betrays a disdain for JKR's books; he seems to enjoy the universe enough to have written 750000 words in it. Indeed as I said to Taure elsewhere, picking apart the canon plotholes and trying to find a consistent way to make them all work seems more like an homage.

Those were pretty much all fair criticisms. Although I wouldn't call any of them dealbreakers ... great fanfictions are few and far between, so I can't imagine anyone not jumping at a chance to read one that is long, going to be completed, grammatically perfect, and generally funny and interesting. Many people criticize HPMOR and then turn around and recommend utter crap. I understand high standards, but not the baffling inconsistency I see a lot here. Regardless, it's nice to finally read an intelligent critique of the story that doesn't revolve around misapprehensions.

It's not his fault he's the most popular author (or close). He /may/ be the only one whose profile is high enough that attempts to monetize would result in catastrophe ... but I doubt it. And I doubt that this hypothetical attempt would have the endgame you think it would. JKR seems very welcoming of fanfiction in general. If the widespread smut communities haven't cratered the whole thing, one fanfiction trying to make money won't either. At worst I imagine she'd have HPMOR removed from major websites, press individual charges, something like that. I don't see Yudkowsky having the power you ascribe to him.

I don't remember this, unless it's the thing where some hard copies began popping up on the west coast? I think they were distributed to children, free, to encourage interest in science or something, but I don't have any details. Might be different. But given that Yudkowsky knows the line he is walking with the JKR legal team and has reached out to them in the past, I find it /very/ unlikely he would do anything to jeopardize his status. His readers ... that's a different matter. People without a firm understanding of copyright law routinely bring printing copies up on [[/r/hpmor]] and are routinely disabused.

Anyway, [[/r/hpfanfiction]] likes to demonize Yudkowsky for asking for donations specifically for fanfiction, as if all other fanfiction authors are on a higher moral plane. The reality, of course, is that Yudkowsky would have had to long since abandon the project he started /specifically to attract interest to AI research etc/ if he couldn't prove to his employer that it had a tangible benefit. "Has popularized MIRI" isn't tangible, but money is. Since we want the story, and he presumably wants to finish it but understands his job is more important, donations to his (nonprofit) organization seem like the ideal solution. I've never really understood the antagonism there.

**** Regarding the "deconstructive approach to magic", I'm not quite sure what that exactly refers to.

To clarify, therefore, I do like fics that explore magic in-depth. I'm just not a fan of the particular way that MoR does it. I think there are a few reasons for this:

Firstly, there's the issue of explanation vs. description. While I love fics that /describe/ magic in a lot of detail, making it seem complex, difficult and real, I'm not a fan of /explanations/ of magic. Explanation can mean two different things here, either explaining magic in terms of other things, or explaining the one true fundamental nature/source of magic. It always reminds me of the ancient Greek metaphysical systems like "the world is made of water". No matter what explanation you give, it will always feel too simple.

In this sense I like magic to be reminiscent of science in that we have no real ultimate answers, and that many of our answers are incompatible with each other or clearly false in certain respects. A wizard should not be able to explain what magic is in a paragraph, or even a chapter. Wizards should just be able to describe human-made theories of how various items of magic work, and maybe speculate as to some ideas about the nature of magic.

Secondly, I dislike the MoR treatment in terms of research methodology/the nature of magical theories. I'm not a fan at all of an empirical approach to magical theory or a mathematical approach to describing magic. There should be few, if any, equations for magical theory in my view.

This connects to the way in which I think HP magic is heavily concept based rather than concerned with physical quantities. Consider the way, for example, that a magical law prevents you from creating food from nothing with transfiguration, but you can create animals with it. /The human concept of food is magically real./ Similarly, a job position is magically real, as are words.

In this sense I think that wizards involved in magical research are kinds of "conceptual engineers" and that their work should accordingly be like that of philosophers and literature critics rather than scientists. Magical theory is thus less about discovering and explaining "how magic works" and more an act of creating a narrative that describes magic so as to capture some essence of it. Spells can be created on the basis of these narratives and so they have a sense of reality, but they are basically created by humans. In essence I see magic as a way that human fictions can override reality. As such I consider magical theory as essentially pluralistic: there is no single correct magical theory, no "magical truth" but rather many different, equally correct, ways of viewing magic.

Different narratives will have different advantages and disadvantages depending on what they focus on. For example, Voldemort favours a narrative that sees magic as essentially inert, mechanistic, and able to be mastered with all variables within the control of a suitably skilled wizard. Dumbledore prefers a more "mythic" or holistic view of magic which takes into account such obscure ideas as the power of moral certainty. Neither approach is more correct than the other -- Voldemort achieves many great magical feats with his narrative of magic, and also he recognises the power of Dumbledore's narrative in GoF when he said that Lily's sacrifice was an old magic that he should have anticipated. But Dumbledore's narrative ultimately prevails in the story, because Voldemort repeatedly fails to give it due consideration and acts on the sole basis of his own ideas.

This is what I meant by deconstruction. Nuts and bolts. I understand that this can take the, well, /magic/ out of things. If all the criticisms of HPMOR leveled here were of this sort, I would never rear my ugly head to defend it, because I get the argment. Unfortunately most are character assassination or just factually incorrect (below in the thread - "leaves plot threads hanging" or whatever ... why don't we let him finish the story first...).

To me, on the other side of the coin, the attempts to explore magical theory while being (nearly) entirely true to canon are the most fun part of HPMOR. The author has been handed a bunch of bizarre and often arbitrary rules (food/animals e.g.) and has his protagonist deal with them, learn them and rationalize them. It's unique. Others interpret it as "trashing" canon, but I think it's actually a really cool homage to canon. Instead of changing things that JKR came up with that don't make a whole lot of sense, he attempts to reason out a way it could all be cohesive.

Yeah, that's less in the spirit of the original books. But fanfiction in the spirit of the original books has always been less fun for me, because whoever writes it is invariably not as eloquent as Rowling.

I agree and if I ever wrote a story, this is how the Unspeakables and so on would operate in the background. But I can still appreciate a damned interesting attempt to put science and magical theory together (especially as it's now clear that the end of the plot is going to revolve around that, so what seemed like digressions and authorial inserts in chapter 20 are now foreshadowing for chapters 105-115).

** It's well written from a mechanical perspective: no spelling errors, no grammar mistakes, prose that starts a bit janky but smooths out quickly enough. It avoids most of the problems I have in fan fiction: uneven overpowering of characters, Harry being super special in ways that nobody else possibly could be, and so forth. There are over a hundred fics that meet this bar, I'm sure.

Hermione has her own motivations rather than just hanging onto Harry. That filter takes out the majority of the fics that met the previous criteria. In point of fact, most characters are written as intelligent people with their own motives.

It pokes fun at canon's silliness, which is amusing if you haven't read fifty fanfics that each point out two or three flaws, and it's not afraid of being silly itself. At the same time, it's serious quite often.

So by the time he's introducing idea M that everyone just has to know about someone who isn't on [[/r/HPMOR]] and pulling the thing apart is left wondering why Draco is still talking to Harry because he never really got over the conflict from idea A.

Also the idea of writing a first year fic falls apart when you have so much conflict in such a short period of time, it's just unrealistic.

As for the dropped plot-lines I explained my feelings on this elsewhere but it's not so much a matter of putting something on the back-burner it's that as soon as something new comes along that interests him or he wants to talk about he moves on immediately. I'm not necessarily talking about massive story defining things but arguments that are never resolved because Harry just has to let everyone know about his new scientific theory he's come up with so everyone forgets that they were pissed at him and moves on because it's /rational/.

** Its been 5 days, but this was still on the second page, so besides some of the other positive comments, here are a few I haven't seen mentioned:

- I liked Ender's Game as a kid because I could imagine myself in Ender's place and it felt /good/. Ender outwits his peers and the adults depend on him. I like HPMOR because I like to imagine I would take exactly Harry's approach if I was faced with a strange new magical world: analyze and exploit everything possible.

Addressing some common concerns:

- Canon-bashing. A lot of instances that look like canon bashing are actually subtly showing Harry's flaws. Harry dismisses Ron, later Ron helps provide Hermione the winning strategy in the battles. Harry questions how Hermione could end up anywhere but Ravenclaw, ignoring the fact that she spent time under the Hat and was likely considering Gryfindor like in canon. The issue is that initially it looks like cheap shots at canon and it takes many chapters later for the reader to notice Harry's mistakes (kind of like dealing with real life cognitive biases).

- Kids not acting like kids. Draco has been specifically trained to be able to act in a calculating and controlled manner. Hermione is just an extremely well-read kid (and has trouble keeping up with Harry and Draco as a result). For Harry, the current theory on [[/r/HPMOR]] is that Harry is Voldemort's horocrux, and has Voldemort's genius/underlying personality, but lacks his memories and has developed empathy from being raised in a loving environment (ironically for a story about rationality love is still a key advantage).

- Destroying the romanticism of canon: Yeah, I can see where you are coming from, but I think for all the romantic wonder it destroys, it replaces with enlightenment idealism and optimism.

** Hmm. I'll bite, despite the fact that you didn't really hold up your end of the bargain by, for example, listing /why/ you don't get it. I'm familiar with most of the common complaints (at least the ones on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]]), but still. I'm about to write like 500 words. The least you could do is write 15.

1. HPMOR is the /only/ piece of fanfiction I have ever read that could legitimately pass for professionally-written. Plots (within the context of the serialized "tv season arc" format he uses) are created and resolved, with the requisite amounts of drama and conflict [NB: I say this with the caveat that the story is unfinished, but I have confidence that all the plot ends will be untangled]. Every /single/ character is consistent, acts intelligently and interestingly, and has background. The emotion is real, the humor is (mostly) funny. The grammar/sentence structure/nuts and bolts are absolutely impeccable. The amount of effort that is put into the writing process would put HPMOR in the top ten fics ever written even if it was a generic post-OotP rehash.

2. But it's not. Yudkowsky can flat /write/, and the story is probably the most uniformly original ever written in fanfiction. I'm not really sure how it wouldn't be.

3. The entire plot is /solvable/. All plot details and pieces of foreshadowing (of which there are dozens) will be tied up by the finale. [[/r/hpmor]] has spent the last 3-4 years guessing at what will happen in each chapter, where the plot is going, etc. There are a lot of smart people on that subreddit (in fact I'm pretty sure at least one of our current theories vis a vis the ending is mostly correct) -- but the author still manages to throw us for a loop pretty often. This, plus the fact that story has no (or very, very few^{)} [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][Idiot Balls]], gives it that satisfying feeling peculiar to so-called rationalist fiction -- you never feel like you're watching a shitty horror movie ("don't split up!" "don't go outside in the dark" etc. Characters act as you would, and occasionally even think of things you didn't.

4. It is by far the best "theory of magic" fanfiction of all time. As a bonus, the author is a scientist who discusses any and all field-specific details he uses on [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]], to make sure they're accurate. Sure, HPMOR is so brilliant as a story that even if the experimental angle was removed (Harry's attempts to learn why magic works, and team it up with physics) it would /still/ be the best fic I've ever read. But the scientific method, all the great Harry-Hermione conversations, his attempt to win over Draco using reason -- perfect. And everything Harry does is what any precocious muggleborn with a deep interest in science would do if they learned about magic.

5. Yudkowsky is very clear on the departure points for the fic and sticks to them (often so subtly it takes us at [[/r/hpmor]] a long time to notice), which helps a lot in forming a cohesive narrative -- which would otherwise be a concern, because the story is extremely long and published in serialized format. He also knows in advance all major plot points and how HPMOR will end, which is vital to the fic making sense (this rule applies to all fiction, with very rare exceptions).

6. Yudkowsky puts [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/inexploitability][thought]] into what he's doing, and in the process makes points about fanfiction that have never even occurred to me. [Additionally, his [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][nonfiction]] is brilliant. There's a lot more where that came from.]

7. Yudkowsky interacts with his readership on facebook, lesswrong and reddit all the time, keeps us minutely apprised on the story's progress, goes to meetups, even incorporates small reader ideas into the narrative occasionally. As a result I have absolute confidence that he will finish the story, which is refreshing.

And when you throw in the fact that the author had never written any fiction over ~10 chapters before he dove in, and he did so only to drum up interest in rationalism, futurism and his work ... yet he still wrote the most popular fanfiction in history ... it's pretty damn impressive. Honestly HPMOR is barely fanfiction -- it only borrows the characters/settings so that Yudkowsky can work from established anchors (see the link above on inexploitability) and therefore make his point more efficiently.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has perspective in HPMOR; most wizards don't, because of the unenlightened society in which they grew up.
#+end_quote

No many wizards are muggleborn and have exactly the same perspective Harry does, MoR doesn't really address this.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Again this is only really applicable if you take MoR and make it canon, we must assume there are reasons for certain things in canon that are there for an actual purpose rather than just "oh aren't wizards barbaric" like MoR makes out.

There is no necessity though. Only what is created in MoR.

  And don't try and tell me you'd treat a twelve year old the same as a twenty four year old, because no matter how much we'd like to - we wont.
#+end_quote

Speak for yourself. I treat intelligent people intelligently, or strive to. Thing is, yeah few and far between are the 12 year olds who cut muster**. But that's one of the departure points of the story. Every great story has one suspension of disbelief (who said that?), and in this one it's that the protagonist is also a child prodigy. (A pedant will point out that magic is the suspension of disbelief, but that pedant will not have read the link to Yudkowsky's blogpost on inexploitability that I posted above.)

#+begin_quote
  And it's very hard for anyone to take him seriously within the novel - you see throughout the story, even when it'd be logical to stop this, there is still some condescension from the adults towards him.
#+end_quote

Dunno how long it's been since you read HPMOR, or how far you got, but the exact same thing happens there. He wins over his elders; they don't yield to him immediately (caveat: Dumbledore sort of does, because of his concept of the "hero" in the "story" -- but again, that comes from canon). I would also point out that basically none of the children in canon act 11. Maybe Ginny. They don't really start acting their ages until like 15, when they take a giant maturity step backwards and all get really angry for no reason.

I just now got why you could get "accusatory" out of my (brief) response. To expand, he's not the target audience if he doesn't feel that children who are intelligent should be respected and encouraged, because that feeling would be anathema to Yudkowsky, who would take it as a given of any "Idiot Ball-free" universe.

**Ever read Neal Stephenson? He wrote a brilliant and annoying 12 year old, albeit a minor character, but one who was treated like an adult when he earned it -- and no one got angry.

*** 1. You've clearly missed a lot of fanfiction. Whilst MoR is well written grammatically and the like it's structure and plot leave much to be desired.

2. You're right that it's not generic but that doesn't make it good. The original concept was fantastic but the more he wrote the more he added to the story to try and push in all these ideas that he had and the views he tried to convey to people and imo it doesn't work.

3. See here's why I think it's so well liked, correct me if i'm wrong, but every time a chapter comes out fans must spends hours poring over it and debating with each other what everything means and about the 3 new ideas that were introduced? That I can see being enjoyable, who doesn't love a good theological debate? The issue is as a self-enclosed story his ideas aren't conveyed well, there's just a mashup of things the author wants to tell people about and show off his knowledge on.

4. Agree to disagree, the charm of Harry Potter for me is the magic is self-enclosed and as another commenter pointed out, self-correcting. The author reduces the magic to a scientific experiment about rationality that doesn't fit in a universe where one of the key themes is the absence of logic and the natural laws of physics.

5. Again agree to disagree, if he has actually planned the whole thing out he's a much worse writer than I give him credit for.

6. See above.

7. This is just him stroking his ego to me but i'll get to that.

My reasons for disliking it that I haven't already mentioned are as follows:

A) The idea that everyone and everything in his universe is rational and logical and all can be explained thusly and in doing so ignores emotion. In canon Draco is a bigoted racist, try going up to a member of the KKK and convincing them black people are alright using logic, they'll beat the shit out of you because humans are not rational all the time. The same issue is posed with Voldemort's space horcrux, he's now truly immortal. Job done the story is no longer interesting not to mention he went against his canon prejudice against muggles because it's rational.

B) He writes children as if they are adults. Not a fault just of his but certainly glaring when reading the story.

C) Like you said it's barely fanfiction and he only writes it to make his point.

D) His arrogance is overwhelming, other people have given first hand evidence of the jackass when he's dealing with people who disagree with him. The entire thing just reads like a manifesto for his self-believed brilliance.

E) The pacing is just terrible and affects the characters equally as poorly as it does the plot.

F) The prick asks for money for faster updates. Pathetic and against the spirit of fanfiction.

  I don't think he was doing this. My impression is that he was shamelessly asking for donations for his organization, but not shamelessly asking for money in return for faster updates. A small but important distinction.
#+end_quote

He asked for people to donate to his organisation and in turn he would update faster, as someone else said his rational being it would show his boss he was generating interest in their work and therefore he would be given time to continue writing it. So basically he's using it as an add for a company that pays him.

This is pretty much what I was looking to find out in this thread tbh, I didn't understand the community behind it and now that I do I think it makes more sense, it also explains why people are so fanatical about it.

#+begin_quote
  Which brings me to my last question: Do you have any recommendations?
#+end_quote

As much as I hate Severitus I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance by Green Gecko]] although it's been a while since I read it. It's a bit cliched on a re-read but being 9 years old it pretty much defined the genre and inspired most of the fics I can't stand to read. It's also one of very few fics that Harry has a realistic amount of money in.

You listed most of my usual recommendations. :P

** When I first picked up Methods, I couldn't put it down until I had reached the final chapter. I have had that with more fanfiction, but none as deeply and profoundly as with Methods. I've followed the HPMoR reddit ever since, and I read new chapters on the day they've come out. I dislike the recent few chapters, but I am still insanely curious how it will all end.

A lot of things come together to make me like Methods. I like science and intelligence. And a big pet peeve is this ridiculous notion that you can't use science in the magical world. In canon, you have all these ancient science ideas, completely outdated. Basically, all the wizards are just stamp collecting. They look at things and make lists of when what happens. They know what ingredients make what potion, but you get the impression new potions are made by just throwing random stuff together until you find something that works. Which is still science, but in a very brute force way.

Methods basically just calls the magical world out on its inefficiencies and its horribleness. Trying random things is not as smart as testing a hypothesis. Dismissing children when they raise concerns, just because they're children, is not a smart thing to do. Throwing people in a prison where they will be tortured every single day by dementors, is actually an insanely evil thing to do, and the whole magical world deserves to burn for allowing it.

I love Draco's upgrade so he is actually trying to plot and manipulate. I like how Harry basically treats him as a child raised by nazis; not anymore evil than Hermione or he, but simple exposed to racist ideas his whole life. How Lucius is a loving father. Because nobody is the villain of their own story. I love the whole arc of Draco's redemption.

I love Hermione's upgrade in her self-reliance. How she is faced with two people of her intelligence, and how she responds by stepping up her game and becoming a serious player. I love her whole arc of being thrust in the role of damsel in destress (by plot), and her fierce determination not to ever become anything less than a hero as big as the boy who lived.

I love Quirrel's upgrade into somebody who is actually scary. Voldemort in canon had power, but was dumb as a bat. This evil is smart, manipulative. And worst of all, actually persuasive.

I find the writing funny, and thought-provoking. I like the descriptions of actual science, and the philosophical musings on rationality. I like the consistent world building, like time turners being used everywhere. I think there is some very well-written sentences/paragraphs that I enjoy rereading multiple times. Like the realisation that Dementors represent death instead of depression, and what that means for the patronus spell. Or the wizengemot hearing.

I can't quite recall that many examples from the top of the head... which I'm kinda happy about. : ) It means I should probably reread the whole fanfic again soon.

  Admittedly that is not saying much given the low quality of fanfiction in general, but HPMOR still doesn't deserve the hate that it gets.

I think the authors attitude goes a long way towards it. There are few other authors that regard themselves in such a high light and it's grating. Even the way he pokes holes in canon isn't done lovingly like most fics it's very "can you believe this idiot thought this was a good idea? My way is much better...btw donate more indirectly to me and i'll update quicker".

I agree with you about updating the thing, I said further up ITT that the whole thing would probably work better set in Hogwarts University where the characters could be more mature without it being unrealistic.

** I'm a little bit late to this, but I'll chime in.

1. I maybe be slightly biased, because it's the first fanfic I ever read. It's hard to account exactly how much, and in what ways this effects my view of it, so I'll just state it as it is--since it's the first one I read, I may not be objective. I've always been a huge fan, and I'd read the Harry Potter books dozens of times, so a fresh take on HP was incredibly enjoyable.

2. Actual intelligent characters. I like smart heroes, but an author cannot write a character very much more intelligent than himself or herself. With presentation and narrative trickery you can get a bit of a boost (or at least a character whose smarts pass suspension of disbelief so long as you don't think too hard, like Ender Wiggin or Sherlock Holmes), but most of the time you wind up with something like Artemis Fowl. One of the basic rules to good writing is "show, don't tell". This also applies intelligence as much as anything else, but a lot of writers cop out and resort to having a character that speaks a lot of languages, or is good at math, or invents something impressive, or whatever else. Basically, some device to tell the reader that the character is supposed to be very smart. I've always preferred smart heroes to powerful ones, and I've always hated irrational heroes. I've put down multiple novels in disgust when the actions of the main characters are egregiously, unjustifiably dumb. In HPMOR, when characters have dumb moments, but they carefully justified.

3. It inspires me to become a better person. Am I as smart as Harry seems to be here? No. Do I think I can become so? Yes. My understanding is that HPMOR is written as an introduction to rationality, and I believe that rationality is a good thing (at the very least, a good thing for me). HPMOR has put in words many vague feelings I've had over the course of my life, and has also nudged me in the direction of new ideas that, at least, promise to be interesting to think about.

4. I don't mind it being preachy. I've read and enjoyed quite a bit of Terry Goodkind's the Sword of Truth series, which started as fantasy and eventually devolved into Ayn Rand fanfiction. I feel like Yudkowsky has got nothing on Goodkind. This, at least, espoused something I can agree with after thinking about.

5. I really like the analysis of magic. I like analyzing things in general, and I think HPMOR did it pretty well; a good portion of it is so far unexplainable, but by god, Harry is going to try anyway. Also, some portion of it is explained in sufficiently general terms to keep it interesting.

6. With regard to the pacing that some have mentioned, I found it fine. I can happily read a wide variety of pacing, so maybe it's just me.

7. At least part of this is "I like it because I like it". I often have a hard time justifying why I like things, whether it be guilty pleasure music, a movie, or a book. I can't explain to you in any detail why I like Star Wars, but I do anyway. I feel that it's unfair of me to omit this, even though it's not a very good reason.

#+end_quote

They may be intelligent but they are not mature enough or old enough for the intelligence and knowledge that they amass over a stupidly short period of time, if it were set in Hogwarts University with a 20 year old Harry I could stomach it easier but I see your point.

Every other one of your points I can't disagree with, I see how that could be appealing and if that's what you like then fair enough.

At one point, HPMOR does acknowledge this, and attempt to justify it a bit:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness, and if you looked at the difference in maturity between a fourth-year in Hogwarts and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was clear that Muggles were smothering their children...
#+end_quote

I also don't quite agree that they aren't old enough for the intelligence that they amass--I knew a guy in middle school and into high school who was probably on the same ballpark as HPMOR!Harry (although below his level, because Harry is fictional and can get away with being larger than life). Coincidentally, I looked him up the other day, and he's co-authored a paper with Yudkowski.

In the end, writing overmature or overintelligent characters is a flaw I'm willing to overlook, because I don't want to read a story about 11-year olds that actually behave like 11-year olds (or people in their early 20s that behave like 11-year olds, like the Wheel of Time).

That is /terrible/ justification. That's another instance of the author assuming his universe takes presedence over canon. In canon none of the main characters act out of the bounds of reality for their age, in MoR they all do, from day one, regardless of magical background or not.

There are plenty of defects to pick at, but I've learned early on in reading fantasy that every book can be taken apart if your intent is to critique.

Loving fantasy is a lot about enjoying the good things and overlooking the defects. When coming at it with the right mindset, that story has a great deal of fun to offer.
