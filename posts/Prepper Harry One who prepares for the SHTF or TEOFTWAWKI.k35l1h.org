The "F" in the second acronym might be a mistake, but who knows.

  All they wanted was a normal school year and now they're willing to fight for it. An alternative take on the Trio's fourth year.

  Pole shifts (idk what that means)
#+end_quote

"Pole shifts" is a theory which suggests that the geographic poles are going to change location rapidly and consequently cause catastrophes like floods as a result of the moved tectonic plates. While it's true that polar shift has happened, they've only deviated a few degrees in the past ~100 million years. But believers in the theory often cite the supercontinent Rodinia, which existed during the Neoproterozoic era, that caused the only true "polar wander" when it separated. But considering the earth doesn't have supercontinent today, polar wander won't be repeated.

Basically, it's a fringe theory which doomsday preppers like.
