Would like Fics that have the Protagonist (i name Harry to keeep it simple) accidently being dragged into a different Dimension....or he purposely traveled, but then "go astray" and arrives in a Middleage like World or a twisted Mix of Middleage and modern World or whatever. As he tries to get Back and makes preparations, he gets introducted with a Girl/young Woman, who develops a Crush on him, but also might acting shy. While she admires the new "guest", he is rejecting to any advances, for several Reasons (dont interfere with other Worlds or a relationship with her might mess up, the future of some other individual), but mostly because he is to old for her. Yes, i would like him to be as Adult as possible, but no old man. Just old enough, that she might be his Daughter. No matter, if he opens to her, she keeps to be attracted to him. If they have a Session with each other or not, im open for both.

The Protagonist can be any known Man or Woman. So Older Man/Younger Woman or Older Woman/Younger Man (or younger Woman) is accepted.

Although im not looking for Slash Fics (older Man/younger Man) i would take this aswell, but preferably, the other stuff.


** This is very specific.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** This is an pretty specific request but maybe some lord of the rings crossovers might have this. A decent amount of those have harry there involuntarily and wanting to get home. Game of thrones and a song of ice and fire tend to have have harry getting there on purpose. As for the romance part... idk some marauder era time travel fics probably have this.
