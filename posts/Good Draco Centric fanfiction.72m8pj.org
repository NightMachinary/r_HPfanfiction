I'm looking for plot based fanfiction where Draco is the Main character or he is a very important secondary character. So Stories where Harry gets sorted into Slytherin and befriends Draco for example are fine but only if Draco is a part of alot the story and there is focus on his and Harry's friendship and does important plot related things. Something that focuses on Draco's character and the plot alot. Though ideally Draco would be the MC

I will try most ships, I do tend to prefer Drarry but Id prefer a plot based story that happens to have a ship that's not my favorite than just a ship story with my favorite ship.

My favorite Draco centric fic right now is The Code by Aduro I really liked Draco and Bills friendship in it and how they characterized both characters.


** My favourite is Exile by Bennybear. In it, Draco is forbidden from using magic after the war, so he has to learn to live like a Muggle. I really enjoyed it!

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** If you like Drarry, come join us at [[/r/HPslashfic][r/HPslashfic]] too!

But also, to answer your request, a really excellent canon compliant (EWE) Drarry I read recently is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785][The Man Who Lived]]. It has an amazingly well characterized Draco and he is the main character. It takes a little bit to get into, but it is really really worth it. Read through the second chapter before giving it up.

** linkffn(They shook hands by dethryl)

Probably the 2nd best Slytherin!Harry story all around. Believeable 11 year olds, good characterization, plot and pacing all around. Up to sixth year at this point, 900k words, still ongoing (last update was in August).

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness by Mira Minth]]

For all its canon rehashing tendencies and small issues with characterization, the above manages to radiate a breathless, oppresive aura that I have found in very few stories. You know how a percentage of the population gets goosebumps when listening to certain music? Well this does that, in fanfic form.

It attempts a risky gamble, by essentially stripping away Harry's plot armor; whereas in canon he stumbles around blindly, fueled by a vague sense of heroism (almost at death wish levels) and guarded by cleverly placed plot devices, in this story we start from the opposite direction: Harry is first and foremost guarded by his finely-honed sense of self-preservation. He recognises very early that if he wants security he will have to /work his ass off/ in order to be safe.

So all fic long, he works at it. He practices until he's competent and more at spellcasting. He cultivates a wide range of allies and dedicates painstalking amounts of effort to maintain them and keep them happy. He delves into dark magic. But at the same time, Harry realizes that he has to take risks as the situation grows more volatile; and so he courts the older Slytherins that are Voldemort's agents in the school, for as long as he is able; he undercuts the Order and agrees to become the Ministry's posterboy, in exchange for favors and to facilitate future cooperation; he manipulates his allies, frequently withholding dangerous information if there's benefit to it. He rides the razor's edge.

And as the story reaches the later chapters you start to feel that Harry's extraordinary bag of tricks... might simply not be enough. While canon glosses over Voldemort's power and skill, you get no such respite here; he and his Death Eaters are *fucking dangerous*, as dangerous as a 70 year old psychotic dark wizard served by the elites of a hidden society can be. And Harry, impressive juggler though he is... is still sixteen.

And that's the point where Mira stopped writing. Sigh.
