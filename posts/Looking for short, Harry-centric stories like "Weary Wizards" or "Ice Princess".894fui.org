Stories where there's an obvious goal and it is reached within 25k words without a score of convoluted plotlines or Death Eater apologism. Preferably with some humorous scenes. Please no m/m and without Ron/Hermione or a whitewashed Snape in the background.


** There is an author named sprinter1988. Has an awesome collection of onenshots ..majority are h/hr.. you should check it out. Maybe its your thing
