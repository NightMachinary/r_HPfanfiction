Snatchers seem like such a wasted opportunity for Ron's love of strategy and some old fashioned guerrilla warfare. This is how I imagine Ron's return.

Excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄùHermione you're the brains, the planning, the perfect execution, but you couldn't see three moves ahead in chess against a first year. Leave the strategy to me,"

  ‚ÄùAnd what's Harry in that flattering evaluation?"

  A smile. When was the last time Ron had smiled at her like that?

  ‚ÄùHarry's the hammer."

** I'm still working on my between-the-wars Auror gen fic that features a bunch of OCs, Charlie, Tonks, Moody, and a lot of worldbuilding and unique magical abilities that drive the plot. It also ended up involving a lot more wizarding world politics and social unrest than I originally thought it would. I swear it wasn't supposed to follow current events.

The chapter I just posted was intense. It's definitely gone full-on thriller now. I need a fluff break before I start writing the next part.

** I'm working on a fanfic on Regulus Black's journey from mid his 4th year until the Cave. It's long and the first step into my own series of fanfics of unexplored story lines in the universe. The second chapter is being released sometime in the next 48hrs. Right now, we have the beginning of Regulus' journey as he moves to Durmstrang for 6 months for reasons so far undisclosed. It does have some OCs and I expand the magic system, expand on the whole universe, culture and traditions of the Wizarding World, change things representation wise and well, mostly everyone is queer. Trigger Warnings on the tags and it is a fairly dark fic if things go as I expect.

** Just posted the first chapter on ao3 earlier! The basic premise of it is that Ariana Dumbledore never existed - or, rather, the man who was once known as Ariana Dumbledore grows up to be Albus Dumbledore, and his secret life as a trans man remains unknown to the wizarding world.

It's a story about Albus's experience as a young trans man and his search for a "cure" to his dilemma without outing himself, as well as the truth behind who "killed" Ariana Dumbledore.

** Writing my Slytherin Focus story based on a secret group of Slytherins who are against the purity of blood ideology, the dark arts, and Voldemort in general. As of right now, the story is centered during the events of Order of the Phoenix right around the same time as DA is formed with new members being recruited into the group. It's mostly OC-driven and that has been an interesting experience for me.

/Harry Potter and the Beasts of Galar/ is a Pokemon crossover that takes advantage of the fact that the latest Pokemon region is based off of Great Britain. It also eschews the usual Pokemon-fanfic approach of doing a journey to go more for a battle-school vibe. It's very AU. It's just starting out, so I want to be sure that the upcoming chapters set the stage properly.

/Harry Potter, Grandson of God/ is kind of crack taken seriously. Essentially, the gist of it is that Lily's sacrifice saved Harry's life in the same way Jesus's sacrifice saved all of humanity, qed Lily is God's kid and Harry is God's grandson. It's almost at the end of year one. It started out following canon fairly closely but that was boring so now I spend my time kind of following canon but mostly developing zany subplots.

** Harry goes to London in the Summer after Second Year, is really distracted while brooding over how it sucks living with the Dursleys and how his life outside of Hogwarts is bad(teenage angst)...

Doesn't see a car go through the red light, but at the last moment, a blond girl stops the car /with her bare/ /hands/...

Things go on from there.

Still working on the full outline, but the first chapters are coming together.

I am also writing some 2 other stories at least once a week.

One is a Harry Potter with elements of Castlevania, BloodBorne, and HP Lovecraft, where he's part of one bloodline of Hunters who help protect the world from not only "regular" creatures(vampires and werewolves are buffed in many ways, especially older vampires) but also from eldritch stuff. He gets to see a lot more of the magical world, and meet people from other countries who share the same duties as he does(Belmonts, Van Helsings, etc...)

The other is one where Harry goes back in time(reborn as a baby) to be his father's cousin(born to Charles and Dorea), where his father Charles is an Archeologist and he gets close to his family on his mother's side, along with their friends, soon he learns how bigotry is nurtured, how different perspective and familiarity makes people, and how ideology can be far more insidious than he had imagined.

He also learns what a good childhood looks like, sees much more of the world(his family travels a lot, a he doesn't go to Hogwarts until the third year), and gets to experience, in relative safety, things like teenage romance, drama, love triangles, and how a jealous Bellatrix is scary as hell.

And the reason he was sent back goes beyond stopping Voldemort before he could corrupt a whole generation...

** Still writing book four of my female Slytherin Harry series. Just made it to 132k and I'm fearing that it is going to wind up longer than Goblet of Fire because I still have ten chapters left to write.

It doesn't help that I just wrote a scene that wasn't in my outline at all! I started writing last night and things just happened and I wrote a completely different scene than the one I'd planned to write. On the bright side it allows me to a Christmas scene from Snape's POV, which will be a nice change of pace.

For anyone interested, here's the first story in the series (second is a little over halfway posted):

** Something about 70s and time travel. Harry became a DADA professor in 1975. He would try to sabotage rise of Voldemort. Good Dumbledore. No bashing. No overpowered Harry. No deatheaters whitewashing. Marauders would not be much of a focus. Basically it's about consequences and how future knowledge can be useless. Like if Harry changes a thing, other stuff would possibly not happen. For example, if he decides to save Regular Black from joining Voldemort, that particular Horcrux doesn't happen in 1979/80. Or how prophecy is useless if Voldemort doesn't know it. Etc.

Basically an attempt for what if AU canon station points don't happen or changed

**** It's a crack fic based around Harry being the Outer God Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos. I'm just having fun, putting in any half decent idea that comes to me. It's going to become a series later on too.

** I'm working on a Fic where Severus Snape is a Shadowhunter and Petunia finds out and she is also a Shadowhunter. Think I'm gonna call it The Half-Marked Prince. It isn't published yet but as soon as I'm done with the first chapter I'll post a link here. Includes a badass Petunia and probably an OOC Snape.

** Had a sudden burst of inspiration the last two days and added around 2500 more words to a google document dating back to 2017 with other separate word documents added to it going as for back as 2015 if memory serves correctly. The whole thing's specifically for Harry Potter fan-fiction. It'd be nice to know how to keep the motivation up to continue expanding all these dormant AU's I have lying around. It's just a hobby and I don't think I'll ever post anything I'm not completely in love with so I don't ardently need the advice, but thanks in advance :)

** Just published the prologue to my story! I'm so so so excited about it! I would love if you read and left some thoughts :)

*What Sacred Games*

/They say that when a prayer is answered it comes not in a mighty wind or devouring flame, but in a gentle whisper. Narcissa's prayer was answered that night not by a surge of magic or valiant young champion but by the whisper of the Goddess commanding the shadows of death./

/For such a priceless gift, she would have to pay. They would all pay./

** Ah, well I've been working on a treacherously long slow-burn, primarily DM/OC, slightly AU further down the road.

I've been busting my ass off trying to get my ducks in a row, and getting enough chapters complete before actually publishing, but I'm SO PROUD OF MYSELF! I've been dying to write a proper fic for the past 12 years, and there's no better time than lock-down!

It's still early days, but I'm trying to find a properly suited beta for clarity and just general smoothing out and feedback of chapters and character flow. It's romance/humor.

  Harry's botched spell during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament transforms the fierce Hungarian Horntail into an only slightly less fierce woman.

** I'm writing [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29844804/chapters/73434570]] The serpent's secret. At first, Malfoy's twin named Margaret dislikes Harry as much as her brother does. Over time, however, tho she develops and Draco begins to see that his sister is developing a love/hate relationship with Potter that slowly shifts to more love than hate. Feelings are mutual. There will be some character death however nothing too large. This is my first pic so please be sure to leave suggestions down below. This won't have too crazy of pairings tho you will see some F/F and M/M. I wrote this because I couldn't find one like this here. IT only has 1 chapter as I wrote it today lol. Please go and leave feedback.
