And what is your current opinion of it/them?


** Every so often I hit a fanfiction slump where I just can't stand it. I get frustrated that nothing is quite what I'm looking for-too OOC, not OOC enough, too boring, too AU, not AU enough, blah, blah, blah. So I'm periodically checking for updates by Northumbrian, but I'm not looking for anything new at the moment.

Instead, I've been watching anime. I finished Kill la Kill, Attack on Titan, and I'm trying to get into Knights of Sidonia (bland, bland, bland). I'm going to look for Attack on Titan fanfiction tomorrow. Hopefully I'll find something I like!

*** If you liked Kill la Kill, I highly recommend Gurren Lagaan, by the same people. Stein's Gate is also good, but much more intellectual then actiony. Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is also done by the same people as Kill la Kill, though I haven't seen it, I have heard good things. Also Durarara, which is an odd anime, it swaps perspectives between characters each episode or so, but is wonderful.

****** I'm trying to power through it because it's on Netflix and thus easily available. But, it's just so bland and I'm already seven or so episodes in! The characters are bland in personality and appearance. The setting should be awesome, but is somehow dull and uninteresting. The plot is likewise boring and uninspired. Perhaps it gets better? I feel like if that were true I'd be seeing it some now.

I definitely wouldn't recommend bumping it up on your list.

** I've been in a fanfiction slump lately, where nothing I pick up seems to hold my interest. So I went and reread [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/][Worm]]. Now that I'm done with it again, I might go back to fanfiction if I can find something good.

The last Harry Potter fanfiction that I read and enjoyed was Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

** I'm almost done with linkffn(A Champion's New Hope), saw it mentioned here. There are some logical inconsistencies which really bug me, but overall it's quite enjoyable.

Also waiting for linkffn(Albus Potter and the Abyssal Vortex) to update - it's book 7 of a next-gen series which I think is my favorite in the subgenre. Interesting world-building and great OCs.

  Book 7 of 7, and sequel to "Albus Potter and the Chaos Contagion." Will be finished before the end of summer! (Read all previous installments first!) The fate of the world hangs in the balance as Albus discovers that there is a very fine line between power and madness, a very blurry line between right and wrong, and no line at all between our world and the Abyssal Vortex.

*** If you've finished it, I'm hoping you can help me out. I read the first few chapters of the Denarian Renegade & enjoyed it, but hesitated to continue because I was worried that I'd end up spoiled for reading the Dresden novels. I'm only on book 9 (White Knight) of the Dresden series. Do you know how far into the Dresden novels someone needs to be to complete the Denarian series & not end up spoiled for the non Harry Potter storyline? I've not found anything that specifies the Dresden side for spoilers....the author's page just specifies 'slight crossover with Dresden files' but not how far into the series. Do you happen to know?

**** I don't actually know because I haven't actually read the series. I think Shezza makes a mention or two of the novels like how the spinoff is based on one of them and how Molly's magic is elaborated from some other one. It might reference some events, but it mostly just seems to mix the two series. I wouldn't be the best person to ask either way, but most of the content is from HPverse with Dresdanverse supplementing it.

I just looked it up and The Denarian Lord was finished at the end of 2009, and looking at the wiki page for Dresdan it says that the most recently completed book at the time was Turn Coat which is book 11 so it wouldn't be farther than that for sure.

Comparatively The Denarian Renegade was done with the recent book being White Night and then Small Favor for The Denarian Knight

I think the oneshot spinoff (non-canon apparently) was based on Blood Rites.

**** Everyone is assuring you that it doesn't spoil, which may or not may not be true, I have no idea. Instead I will ask, why not just read the rest of Dresden? It is an amazing series, with a fun magic system, and makes you care about the characters.

So I say worry not if The Denarian Renegade spoils, because by the time you read it, you should have read the rest of Dresden.

I'm enjoying each, but I've managed to hit a lull point in all 4 at the same time.

** I'm reading "Love and other tragedies" because it's been in my bookmarks for a while and I haven't read a James/Lily in a while. So far it's good, a bit slow paced, but I like the OCs so far. (Didn't use bot because ffn is down at the moment so I don't even have a link handy. Sorry! I'm not sure if the bot will pull the data when the site is down...)

** Currently reading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble) after a recommendation in another thread. It's ok. Not linkffn(Vox Coporius) fantastic or anything, but decent enough to hold my interest even through the slow parts (around 100k words in). That's rare enough for ANY T rated fic.
