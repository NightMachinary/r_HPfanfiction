Looking for stories where there's not a whole lot of rehash, unless it's different from canon. The point of fanfiction is to do things a bit differently or to flesh out some characters or missing scenes in the books.

Just looking for stories that isn't complete rehash.

Would rather it be completed, not interested in Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione unless it's written well.

Any Era is fine and anyone can be the main character, not just Harry.

Can be as canon or as AU or anywhere in between.
