#+TITLE: Voldemort didn’t just kill the “blood traitors”, half bloods, and muggleborns. He also killed off the majority of purebloods from older generations in order to ensure that his followers weren’t swayed over by their parents, grandparents, etc.

EDIT: Adding text because I realized as soon as I posted this that the title may be confusing.

Basically the idea is that older generations of purebloods, while dark and muggle-hating, had enough common sense to realize that Voldemort wasn't all that their children and grandchildren made him out to be -- probably because they had already lived through a war with Grindelwald. This would also explain why, despite wizards being able to live for 120+ years (Armando Dippet, for example), there are little to no old wizards in canon outside of the Dumbledores, Elphias Doge, and Muriel.

This also ensures, for people who like “Lord Harry” stories, that the Death Eaters have power, because the only lords that are still alive are either young (and terribly polarized) or one of the miraculous few to survive the mass killings.

can also be used to excuse young-"Lord Harry"... just about all the other Lords are young when compared to normal, it's not that strange that a teenager joins the Wizengamot as that's exactly what Voldemort forced through to gain control...

Old fogies whine about the youngsters running the country nowadays, Dumbledore has to be lenient or the Wizengamot ends up empty and Anarchy reins supreme... all the stupidity used to be better hidden & worked around, but the current workers in the ministry had to learn by doing and weren't familiar on how things worked (possibility for addition of lost magics/knowledge) and people like Fudge and Umbridge were unscrupulous in gaining power during a time where just about everybody was lost and panicking... and thus the current system is made up of a bunch of botches barely holding everything together.

Everybody listening to the Daily Prophet propaganda is due to it having historically actually been a good paper with checks and balances... which aren't followed up on or reported due to the Ministry still being in utter chaos and the responsible people being afraid that bad press would topple the government right away.

--------------

This is where Harry the /Boy-Who-Lived/ comes in, Dumbledore, the old guard and a sizeable chunk of the moderates along with a lot of the menial workers at the ministry all want to rebuild the Ministry, requiring overturning of laws etc... and having a poster boy for change giving out a rallying call to the people should keep them from panicking and breaking the Statue of Secrecy completely in anarchy driven craziness.

/At Hogwarts Harry gathers a group of youngsters who together lead in a new age of actually functional and rational systems while cleansing the Ministry/Wizengamot of the rot Riddle left behind!/
