Also, they probably refer to the phrase "Tom, Dick & Harry" when deciding to change the name of their main character to Hadrian but they're too lazy to find out that Harry comes from Henry as many kings named Henry were called Harry. Hence the usage of the phrase "Tom, Dick and Harry" to refer to men in general. To be fair though, that's not really common knowledge as the kings were named Henry, but called Harry.

** I think the biggest thing would be if the series was either entirely children's books or entirely not. (Assuming the popularity of the series wasn't affected by the change)

The target age/audience of the later books is markedly different than the first books... which leads to some shenanigans regarding Dumbledore being [Manipulative, crazy, senile, evil, etc, etc] in fanon as authors try and mesh his actions in a children's book with his actions in young adult fiction.

Actually... I'd be really interested in seeing what the outcome would be if one could magically convert books 5-7 into something for the original audience age or 1-3 into books for the older audience that the series ended with.

*** To be fair, though, the earlier books are ambiguous enough with the things that made them into books for children that if people wanted to actually look for an interpretation that made them more mature they would have gotten it.

For example, the first book. We can have a fairy tale thing, or we can have a manipulative Dumbledore because why not, or we can have a fake stone and a mirror that traps people in their desires and a series of pretend traps meant to lead someone into the trap so that the real stone would truly remain safe.

Sure, some things are harder to explain than that. But most people who do those shenanigans aren't even really trying.

***** Yes and no. Do remember that it's not Dumbledore who set up the defences but the teachers, really. And though I do agree that they are something that you'd think brute force works against, we never found out for sure; for all we know, the whole corridor could have been enchanted against that.

And if Dumbledore actually knew it was Quirrel who wanted to get the stone, he could have told Quirrel to supply “the best protection he can”, and told the rest (bar Hagrid, of course, but nothing Hagrid could provide would be significant anyway) to just fake it. Sure, if someone actually thought about it they would have noticed it, but I don't think Dumbledore would have thought Quirrel that cunning and even if it was a trap Tom probably forced Quirrel because trap or not the stone was there; he does have an issue with that bit repeatedly in the series, being sure he'll succeed and then failing because of something he overlooked when it's something he should have paid attention to. So that “the stone” might have never met the word “philosopher's” he probably wouldn't consider, with his fixation on grandeur.

But yes, I do admit you can't explain it if you mean to give a full explanation that would make it clear that Dumbledore was in full control from the very beginning and meant well and it all went as he wanted and stuff. But it's not quite that hard to explain it in a way that makes sense and paints Dumbledore as neither completely incompetent nor a manipulative villain.

****** The defenses would have to be strong enough to fool Voldemort into believing they were meant to stop him. Defenses a few kids can get through are not strong enough. If Voldemort is too gullible, it means the wizards afraid of him - everyone but Dumbledore and a few others - are pushovers, sheep, idiots etc., and one wonders why Dumbledore couldn't easily defeat him - unless Dumbledore's an idiot too.

It's all interconnected.

I think the biggest change to canon would have been if JKR would have not focused on her plot, but on her characters. Define the characters, and then figure out what they would do. Not the other way around.

It isn't unreasonable to think he wasn't, at the time, capable of understanding that it was too easy. Even later in the story he doesn't really show that much cunning or sanity, it was just his raw magical power and ability to kill that let him take over.

Or if you don't like the insane argument, you could say that Voldemort knew it was a trap, and just didn't care. He thoroughly believed he was the greatest wizard of all time. He may have feared Dumbledore a bit, but he still believed he was better than him. He'd risk a trap if it meant getting his body back.

******** There is this [[http://hpcompanion.com/ps/psessay/][theory]] (that I don't fully agree with, but still gave a whole new perspective to the first book I had never considered before) that says that Dumbledore knew Voldemort was there and Voldemort knew Dumbledore knew it too. If this is true (and the essay makes a very compelling argument that it is, so it's what I believe at any rate), then Voldemort knows to an extent that it's a trap, but perhaps believed Dumbledore had to be present for the trap to be a trap, and there was just NO WAY anyone but Dumbledore could thwart him - the all-mighty Voldemort - which is why he sent Dumbledore away with a fake letter saying he had an urgent meeting in London to get him out of the castle.

The theory also says that Dumbledore most likely had some sort of plan involving Harry that year, but the plan (as always) didn't go according to his plan. I don't think Dumbledore would have expecteded three eleven year olds to get past all those precautions on their own, but he probably /did/ intend to help Harry through them (but not Ron and Hermione, 'cause they have no blood protection to keep them alive). Dumbledore was fooled by the owl to London and left, and that's why Harry, Ron, and Hermione went after Voldemort, but I do not think that was Dumbledore's plan at all. When he realized his mistake, he was probably terrified something awful had happened.

********** I think it's impossible to judge the first book, maybe the second and third even, on the same realistic darkness as the last four. I wish it were different, but I've tried, and in the end had to accept that they are quite different. The idea of Scabbers being Ron's friend's dad's best friend seems silly in the later books. Voldemort floating on the back of a teacher's head at school seems laughable. Like - why would he consent to sit around hours of schooling? The idea of Harry and Voldemort - not to mention hundreds of other students - being in the same room and Voldemort just chilling listening to kids answering questions in class all day is so silly.

I just can't figure a way to slice it where the characterization makes total sense within the tone of the later books onto them. The challenges in the first book are games and puzzles and Voldemort is like a scary dream, but not nearly the ultimate evil and destruction he represents when he puts the burning Sorting Hat on Neville.

Essentially, I'm forced to consider that because it's the first book, some things in JKR's writing had not found it's footing yet (which I whole-heartedly accept and doesn't bother me) and there are just slight inconsistancies of characterization. Not necesarrily holes, but things I think she might have done a touch differently if she was able to re-write it. The idea of Voldemort sticking out of the back of a teachers head in Half-Blood Prince just sounds laughable. But it works in the tone of the first book. So judging it this way, I think it's possible that Dumbledore in the first book /would/ let Voldemort in if and only if he was 100% certain he was still in control of the situation. With the first book's simpler ideas of good and evil, I think this is framed as a genius move rather than a risky one, because Dumbledore knows that Voldemort needs his slave Quirrell and therefore will not do anything until he has his own body back, and as long as Dumbledore knows what Voldemort's after, he knows his students are safe.

So as for why Dumbledore would leave the school - I believe it is a combination of a plot-device and Dumbledore making a huge mistake (one of many, as it were) and thinking his other teachers and his other spells and his other devices are in place to protect the school. Dumbledore knew that Quirrell/Voldemort could not get the stone out of the mirror - but he never dreamed that Harry would go down the trapdoor that night, and Dumbledore knew (perhaps planned?) that he /would/ be able to get it out of the mirror - just not that night (? I haven't figured that bit out yet). As long as the stone is hidden, Voldemort is not a very big threat, but /with/ the stone, he's a massive threat.

Anyway, I'm not positive what's happening in the first book still. Essentially, I'm just trying to say that in the simpler and lighter tone of the first book, I think Dumbledore would have, under specific circumstances and as long as he still had the upper hand, have let Voldemort into his school, and trying to put the darker more realistic tone of the later books onto the plot of the first book may be giving it too much credit.

I think it might appear Harry knows everything because he uses the magic he knows over and over again, but he's not a particurly powerful wizard. He's just pretty powerful in a very very very very specific way, and pretty shite in all other areas. He didn't win because he was better at magic than Voldemort, he won because Dumbledore was better at magic than Voldemort.

Hermione is a unique individual who is constantly shown to read books beyond her years, so I think it's okay to assume she knows things average adult wizards don't bother remembering. Kinda like how I've done no more than basic math since school.

I do agree with this, but perhaps not in the way you mean? I think in the first book a strong wizard is someone who knows lots of spells and can use them effectively. In the last book I reckon there are a variety of strong wizards, each suitable for different things. Harry is the strongest wizard in a very particular type of power because I think he understands how choice effects magic, and how our choices depend on our motivations (love/fear/anger/etc).

******* Ah, of course, yes. But to be fair, the defences were already broken through when the party went through them (the required key might have been much faster before its wings got broken, and there might have been more than just the devil's snare in the pit), and they did have Ron for the chess set and Hermione for the riddle, so it /might/ have just been luck on their part. On the other hand, though, it might have not been, and the traps could have simply been sub-par from the get-go.

My point, though, was that some people weren't even trying to think about it and jumped to conclusions about Dumbledore being some unholy amalgam of Voldemort and Fudge because “clearly incompetent and a dark lord and blah blah blah”. Admittedly the treatment Madame Rowling gave him, that of a plot device rather than a character, did not help this issue, but yeah, it's about some people not even trying.

To be honest, the fact that the limits are not actually visible means that until Madame Rowling makes it clear what the limits are, since we don't know of anything truly impossible that you'd have thought sensible to try, it's up to the writer of any such story to choose. So yes, potentially, she can.

Specifically it started with the fourth book, where the character regressed (abandoning his friends, and talking with his mouth full are two traits he picked up in GoF), wasn't allowed to have a plot relevant positive (or heroic) moments (until the locket got destroyed) and where he becomes completely irrelevant to the story's progress in fact he got in the way. JKR neglected the character IMO.

When you think about it, it's really shocking how easy it is for fanfic writers to replace or remove Ron from the story, and that shouldn't be the case if you consider that Ron is the second most mentioned character in the entire book series and a member of the lead Power Trio.

*** I've got my own theory on this that it's less about attractiveness and intelligence and more about Ron's role in the books. Ron is John Mclane (circa Die Hard 1) surrounded by Neo and Hermione Granger (because I'm tired and struggling to think up a counterpart). In this fantastical world he's the everyman of the group, he's the most real character with real human flaws and problems. A teenager thrown in way above his head.

Now with shipping I'm going to make a sweeping generlisation and guess the majority of people who actively 'ship' are female. As the main female character I'm going to guess the majority of these people identify with Hermione, with the books being a form of escapism I'm guessing the majority of these girls in their escapism want to end up with the hero and not with your regular teenage boy. I think this is where a lot of the disconnect happens. You can flip that around with male shippers as well, they probably identify most with Harry as the protagonist of the series and want their escapism to end up with them falling for the smart girl bestfriend (who may or may not just happen to look like Emma Watson).

I think it's why so many fanfictions brush aside Ron or why Ron is so rarely seen in his own fanfictions. The majority of fanfictions I see are either massive power fantasies of Super Harry saving the world with his massive arsenal of super spells and wealth and his harem of girls or Super Harry going back in time and fixing everything or hell even just H/Hr fanfictions with Ron the Death Eater in them. All these types of ff have no place for a grounded well rounded character acting like a real teenage boy which is why his bad traits get turned up to either accomodate a bad Ron or the authors preferred ship.

I used to be in the Buffy fandom, and there are a /lot/ of fics centered around Xander, who is unquestionably the everyman of that fandom. And very often he gets powered up to match everyone else.

So just the fact that Ron is the everyman isn't all of it. Of course, with the Buffy fandom, the main character is not a boy the female shippers can see themselves with (and there were, in fact, not many young male characters), so your second point could account for the rest of the difference.

**** Ron with a gift for tactics, able to think on his feet, and to weaponize most things, is a concept I like very much. I don't think being good at chess helps that much though - chess doesn't have much in common with combat, it's far too rigid and lacks random elements.

Ron is a talented spy/soldier in DianeCastle's "Hermione Granger and the Boy who Lived". Very AU, with superspy technology instead of magic, but great characters. It also develops the romance between Hermione and Ron very nicely, from her early crush on until they finally become a couple.

It's not like purebloods would live comfortably under Voldemort's regime. They'd live /relatively/ comfortably, perhaps. But, being pureblood means that Voldemort would want to collect you personally, you'd still be his literal slave, have him brand you, devote your entire life and resources to him and be subject to his torment if you fail/he has a mood. Defeating Voldemort is in the best interest of everyone, save delusional fanatics that want to devote their life to him and are dependent on him to enforce the pro-wizard agenda.

B) Been thoroughly +brown-beaten+ browbeaten and not know how to stand up for himself the way Harry did with Draco.

Without the epilogue, the story ends with all the kiddos still as kiddos and it doesn't really matter who is with who. In 19 years, Harry may be less of a runt completely dependent on luck; Ron may no longer be a momma's boy with atrocious table manners; Hermione may no longer be a bossy and naggy know-it-all; and Ginny might finally have had some more lines.

It's is the shared trust under distress, which can form such strong bonds. Ginny is possessed, for the most part, alone, and only when unconscious at the end does Harry swoop in. Likewise, Ginny isn't even present when Harry gets possessed. Every other point on the list above is also done separately;

/Both fought against evil terrorists bent on killing them since they were 11/ I'm not sure how Ginny *fights* against Voldemort apart from the Ministry and the 7th book, and that is not a trait unique to her. She isn't even in the same area Harry for most of the fighting in book 7.

/The guy went on guerrilla warfare, while the girl stayed behind enemy lines as underground resistance leader/, not a shared experience. I'm also not sure 'stayed' is the right word, she didn't exactly have a choice.

/The girl was tortured several times for supporting her guy, the guy went willingly to his death to save his girl (and other loved ones)/ Everyone at Hogwarts was tortured, and Harry went to save everyone. That does not mean he is in love with, say Lavender Brown.

/Finally, after a brief glimpse of the 'heaven', the guy still decided to come back to join his girl, what would the girl think of that?/ Umm, actually no, Ginny isn't even mentioned in the Heaven chapter at all.

*********** Ok, so lets make it clear what we are arguing here: You believe that Ginny is the /only/ romantic possibility for Harry, that they are meant to be together, and that the bond they share is stronger then any other option. I, and many others, contend that Harry is just as likely and able to be with many other characters, and that the relationship with Ginny is simply lazy writing (declaring they are together in the epilogue, but having little evidence of this in the body of the text).

So you have all these points about why the bond between Harry and Ginny so much stronger then any other pair. To show you I can also take a few interactions and build just as special a bond, lets try with Cho:

1. They both share a sexual attraction to each other
2. They both were deeply affect by Cedrics death
3. They both were betrayed by a close friend (Ron and Marietta) which threatens the lives of others outside of their group
4. They both have black hair
5. They are both half bloods (or at least Cho is not a definite pureblood)
6. They both play as seekers
7. She was Harry's first kiss
8. She fought in the final battle
9. She offered to lead Harry to the Ravenclaw Common Room in search of Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem

Clearly they have a strong bond! Just edit in Cho's name in the epilogue in the place of Ginny's and there is no real noticeable change!

No? Not Happy? What about Luna then?

1. They both watched their mothers die in front of them
2. Both were considered outcasts in their youths
3. Both deeply love and respect magic
4. They share many touching discussions isolated in the beautiful forest
5. When no one else beloved in Harry, Luna did
6. Both can be very funny when they want to, and both are very brave
7. Both like magical creatures
8. She fought beside Harry in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and a leader in Dumbledore's Army when Hogwarts fell, as well as the final battle (everything and /more/ that Ginny did)
9. She and Harry shared close quarters at Shell Cottage

Their relationship grows from Harry viewing her as strange to a deep friendship, clearly they were always meant to be together! And before you say they don't share a sexual attraction, well, JK just didn't write it in as it wasn't important to the plot, but they had it all along. It's clearly there!

Actually, I know who has an even deeper bond to Harry... Neville! (such loyalty and bravery, continuing character growth, they both lost their parents to the dark side, both bound by prophecy! It was meant to be!) Or what about Voldemort, everyone is always going on about how alike they are, they even share souls! And you know, all the fights, well JKR just didn't write how it was all the UST, but they got together in the end, you know in the epilogue so /All is well./

If there had been development for the pairings you listed above to be endgame, then yes, I would agree with your points. The point is, that isn't how it happened in canon. For other pairings to work as well as or better than Harry/Ginny, you need character tweaks, changing of friendships (for example, Harry meets Luna in second year and they become friends - or change Luna's year) and other such things.

That's a rather deterministic point of view to have in a series which has a recurring theme of free will being important, that our choices are what make us who we are.

There is 19 years between then end of the battle and the epilogue. That's a long time, and in those 19 years, many, many things could have happened. And yet, Harry (and Ginny) are stuck as book 7 plus a few wrinkles, they haven't grown beyond that. They are loose plot threads forced into a 'happy ever after'. They are the quarterback married to the head cheerleader, due to lazy world building and character growth /they are stuck in the past/.

****** But Hermione fits just about every point there as well - and instead of Quidditch, we have "saved each other's lives several times". It's just that compared to Hermione, Ginny wasn't really present in the early books. She wasn't part of "Harry's Group". If she had been part of the "trio" from early on, the dynamic would have changed a lot, and the romances probably would have been presented far better.

******* I agree that Harry and Hermione have deeper friendships.

However, book Harry really didn't like Hermione. In early books, he always described her as "with bushy brown hairs and very large front teeth", and that was hardly complimentary. In later books, Hermione's physical appearance improved, but Harry now often found her annoying and intimidating, and kept lying to her just to avoid reproaches. For example during the 'Sectumsempra' incident, Hermione almost gloated in her self-righteousness, whereas Ginny stood behind Harry 100%. Imho, that's serious poison in any relationships.

Also in the books, Harry has never positively commented on Hermione's physical appearance, with the only exception during the Yule Ball. But in the few instances Ginny appeared, Harry was showering her with silent praises.

**** Not the first time- Ron's jealousy in 4th year set up the pattern that made the 7th year plausible. If JKR hadn't put that in, Ron's behavior on the camping trip would have seemed obviously out of character instead of merely an exaggeration of earlier issues. Also by inserting a meta-rule of 'Ron's loyalty is unimpeachable', she could have set up better examples of Ron providing the buffer from Hermione's nattering that would normally drive Harry up the wall.

What would have followed, then, was that Ron's departure in the middle of the 7th book put both Harry and Hermione on each others' last nerve, as lacking Ron's grounded voice would have imbalanced the relationship.

** Lots of people have talked about how changing Ron and/or Hermione would have changed how the fandom treated the pairing, but a much bigger difference would be made if /the canon pairing itself changed/.

If Rowling 'shipped Hermione with Harry, it is likely that almost no one would write fanfic 'shipping her with Ron --- and though Dramione would probably still have a huge fanbase, it would probably be significantly smaller.

I also suspect that fics 'shipping Harry and Hermione would be a bit less /defensive/ about it, for lack of a better word: not as eager to ignore the two characters' flaws, to erase their rough edges, or to exaggerate the flaws of non-Twin Weasleys in general and Ron in particular.

I wasn't talking about people being defensive about their 'ship in general. I was specifically talking about defensiveness embodied in fanfics in the form of tilts in characterizations to make the two romantic protagonists more "compatible" and sideline competition. (Popular "tilts" include making Harry more scholarly, making Hermione less bossy, and making Ron extra uncouth.) Are you really going to claim that fanfic writers who do that do that /because/ of the alleged vitriol?

***** Of course people going on about how naggy, bossy and muggle know-it-all Hermione is will affect some writers, who therefore might write her with less of or without those traits so the romance will not be attacked that much by critics. Or simply to "show those haters". "Tilts in characterisations" are not binary. HP's canon has a really, really large range of possible characterizations for every character to pick from, depending on what books you use as your foundation and what plot holes and mistakes and "character is a plot device here" moments you use and which ones you ignore.

What I am saying is that for some people, Hermione is a red flag. They cannot fathom any male loving such a girl, much less the hero. So, "defensiveness" can be in the eye of the beholder - they have a certain negative view of a character, be it Ron or Hermione, and see stories that do not cater to their view as "defensive".

****** This is all well and good, but I still don't see what it has to do with my suspicion that had Harry/Hermione been the canon pairing, fics 'shipping them wouldn't skew the canon characterization quite as much as they tend to do as it is (on average, YMMV, etc.).

As for Hermione's character traits, those who write her with those traits without demeaning her for them catch about the same flack no matter who she is 'shipped with, so I don't see why Harry/Hermione 'ships have that excuse any more than other 'ships do. (For that matter, Draco/Hermione fics probably skew her even more; though I am inclined to interpret their tendency as less defensiveness and more wanting to shoehorn the characters into a particular romance story template.)

Also, I don't buy that people going on about how "naggy, bossy and muggle know-it-all" Hermione is actually has the effect you are predicting. People, IMO, tend to write fanfic characters as they understand them (unless changing that particular character is part of the premise), and Hermione being labeled as above is just as likely to lead someone to emphasize those traits when writing her (or not write her at all) as it is to cause them to ignore those traits when writing her.

******* I said above that canon characterization in HP has not a narrow, but a very wide range of possible versions, depending on which books you use as a base, and which books and plots you ignore. The perils of writing a story where plot instead of characters take precedence. If it's valid to ignore the abuse Harry suffers as cartoonish, it's equally valid to ignore character traits as cartoonish, or lessen those traits accordingly.

With regards to "write a character as you understand it", depending on whether you like a character or not the same trait might be presented as positive or negative. A "naggy, bossy muggle know-it-all" for some is a girl who doesn't give up on trying to help her friends, stands up for what she believes, takes charge, is the smartest witch in her generation and doesn't give up on human rights et. al. for others.
