:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think this was a fem!Harry fic, but I'm not sure. Either way, the main villains were a shadowy illuminati-style group called The Exchequer that stayed in the shadows for ages in the plot to the point it takes a while to even find out about their name. I don't wanna say any more, because that's distinguishing enough for people who've read it and I don't wanna say more to spoil it for people who haven't - mystery fic and all.

Thanks in advance!

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
