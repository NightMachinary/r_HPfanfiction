Looking for any fic where Harry is shy and has to be coaxed into a relationship with somebody. I'd prefer Het, but Slash is fine too.

  Can a child, raised to believe that he is worth little more than the dirt he sleeps upon, find the courage to rise up and face his destiny or will the weight of the entire Wizarding world that rests upon his small shoulder be the final straw that breaks him? (This is a seriously abused Harry - forget canon Harry! Abuse is not overcome in a few months time)

**** Oups, sorry, I haven't read well the topic. He's not in a relationship yet, it's first year but he was "coerced" so to say, into a frienship.
