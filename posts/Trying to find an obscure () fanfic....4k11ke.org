I don't know if this is actually obscure or not, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone else mention it here, so maybe it could be? I read it a while back (maybe three or four years ago), but it wasn't completed at the time, so I thought I'd go back and look to see if it ever got completed eventually...but now I can't remember what it was called or who wrote it.

Basically, there was this alternate universe thing in which the main actors from the movies (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) ended up in Harry Potter's world and Daniel Radcliffe somehow ended up taking Harry's place in the prophecy even though he couldn't do magic. At one point, it seemed like it might have been going to have a subplot shipping Emma Watson and Ron, but after the chapter in which that was introduced (nothing beyond a T rating), it was never brought up again. Aside from that oversight, it was actually pretty great.

I've tried Googling it, but I can't seem to find anything even close. I did find a few stories that sounded like they had the characters meet the actors, but they were all a lot shorter than I remember this one being (I'm pretty sure that it was definitely over 50000 words at the point I had read it - and maybe even closer to 100000 - but it could be longer now if it's been updated) and didn't fit the description very well at all, anyway. I hope the author didn't end up deleting it or something...

Edit: Also, Tom Felton /was/ Draco Malfoy, literally. They weren't counterparts because they were actually the same person.


** Sounds horrible, and you are lucky that you can't remember it.

*** Okay, maybe saying it was great /might/ be a bit of an exaggeration, but it definitely wasn't horrible. The premise might sound like it could be, but it was executed well, and given how much of it I had read back then, I'd still like to see how it ended, if it ever did. It had gone a long time without updating, but it's been so long now that's it's probably at least possible that something could have changed.

** Sounds like fun, but did the actors know how the story ended?

If yes, then it will be kind like a time travel.

Also, did Dan have The Scar?

** This... Actually sounds interesting. I haven't been able to find any fics where the characters are whacked in the face that their entire existence is a book.

Since real people are mentioned, it probably isn't on FFN. Do you remember if it was an older site you used?
