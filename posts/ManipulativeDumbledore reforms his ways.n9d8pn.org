I find it really hard to justify Dumbledore's canon actions, but I hate hardcore bashing. Therefore, I'd love to see a fic where Dumbledore IS a manipulative person blinded by the greater good but then is genuinely taught a lesson and changes his actions and outlook. For me, a good example would be the Dumbledore from A Marauders Plan. Thanks!


** I am writing a fic under that exact premise, with a time traveling Harry/Hermione. Dumbledore made mistakes, and with many fanfics, authors either try to justify them or write him as some secret Dark Lord. In my fic, Dumbledore will be on a long road to redemption, and even make a few more mistakes along the way. Dumbledore is a good man, not a perfect one. We need more well written Good!Dumbledore fics.

** I'm the one of the only human who'll defend canon Dumbledore's actions like he made a plan so Harry wouldn't actually die and everything the fandom accuses him of he knowingly admits like if Dumbledore were truly evil he would definitely be the minister pulling all the strings

*** I don't think you're alone but to be fair I also believe that until the end of GoF he didn't think Harry would survive either. He knew that Voldemort was undefeatable in a fair duel so he instead planned to recreate the circumstances at the Godric's Hallow and strip him of powers through Harry's sacrifice while at the same time destroying a Horcrux.

*** To be fair, I think that Dumbledore planned on Harry inspiring others, so that if he died, someone else (namely Neville) killed Voldemort in the name of Harry. Thus causing the prophecy to not just be fulfilled, but be fulfilled by the two people who could've been the primary targets.

** If you're okay with self-recs, I have a redemption arc planned for my Dumbledore, though I'm not quite there yet.

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3

This isn't EXACTLY what you're looking for, but it's an AU Dumbledore correcting the mistakes of Canon!Dumbles. Great premise.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** I had read one recently where a jaded Harry travels back in time to his fifth/fourth (not really sure) year and has a conversation with Dumbledore, its not outright bashing it doesnt make him out to be an evil person pretty much sticks to the canon but points out his faults and how they effect everyone in future and older Harry punishes him for it (he doesnt kill him). At the end Dumbledore does try to change though it is only one shot. Though in the the older Harry dies I am trying to find it, I'll link it.
