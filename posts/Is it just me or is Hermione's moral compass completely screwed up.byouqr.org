Before Hogwarts, she never had any friends (otherwise she'd not have reacted to Ron's comment after Wingardium Leviosa class).

Her entire sense of good and wrong is based on figures of authority and rules.

Then, after the Troll she realizes that had Harry and Ron followed the rules, she'd be dead. So she lies to teachers for the first time ever.

She does grow later, but I don't think she ever manages to get her moral compass fixed. She still continues following the rules whenever possible.

And when following the rules is no longer possible, she completely loses sense of good and wrong.

Let's take a look at some of the crazy things she's done in "I'm already breaking rules so whatever emergency mode".

-Setting Snape on fire

-Brewing a highly illegal potion with stolen ingredients then drugging classmates

-Starting a secret illegal militia and cursing the contract

-Memory charming her parents

The last one should be evidence enough that even by the last book when she's completely disillusioned with the ministry she's still clinging to rules and when those don't have the answer or when she just has to break them, she's not really got a sense of ethics left to follow.


** She is extremely logical but but not rational. If you have earned her loyalty she will do irrational things in the most logical way possible to save you.

The same goes for her enemies. If she thinks you deserve to be punished she will set up irrational/borderline immoral punishments in the most logical way possible.

So she is a fierce ally but do NOT get on her shit list.

*** That's... actually very similar to how I see her--- after she mostly abandons her obsession with following rules to the letter in SS, her moral compass is based off of protecting herself and her own, and there's not a lot that she'll flinch from when it comes to achieving her goals. If she thinks someone needs to be protected /from themselves/, like Harry with the Firebolt or her parents at the beginning of DH, she'll gladly take matters into her own hands and do what she feels is right for them. And if someone slights her or her loved ones... she had no problem permanently disfiguring Marietta, or abandoning Umbridge to the centaurs, or keeping Rita Skeeter in a jar for months on end, because they earned what they got, right?

I think if she'd been in Harry's position at the end of PoA, maybe at a somewhat older age, she probably would've let Sirius and Remus kill Pettigrew. I feel like Harry has more of an abstract moral compass than her--- he's generally against murder and excess violence whenever it can be avoided--- but I could be wrong.

She really is a terrifying, fascinating character at times, and I rarely find fics that address this streak in her to my satisfaction.

**** Yeah, Hermione's adherence to rules is exaggerated in fandom. She follows rules initially because it is the most logical response...until it isn't. Once she decides the people in charge or the rules they have put in place aren't correct she always says 'f$%# this noise' and does what she thinks she needs to do. She follows her own moral compass.

If Dumbledore had Hermione's personality traits they would have never needed the Potters to save everyone because she would have come up with a plan and taken no quarter.

***** I genuinely just don't understand anyone who considers Hermione any flavor of Lawful Good post-SS--- that entire book is her evolution from thinking that authority figures are God to basing her entire sense of morality off of her own sense of justice. She's the first to rebel against corrupt leaders, and one of her most glaring character flaws is that she thinks she's always right. She doesn't want to obey authority, she wants to /be/ authority.

I mentioned this on another thread, but while she has enough genuine compassion and integrity not to go down this path, I could see her going dark /way/ more easily than Harry despite all the dark!Harry fic floating around. Harry, as a general principle, tries to avoid both revenge and excessive cruelty--- he stops Pettigrew from being killed, can't muster the genuine desire to cause pain that the Cruciatus curse requires, and whenever possible, even tries to avoid causing fatal harm to Death Eaters. Hermione? Hoo boy, is that a different story. She'd be a very interesting Dumbledore or Girl-Who-Lived to me.

  can't muster the genuine desire to cause pain that the Cruciatus curse requires

  Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were somethingdisgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.

  “It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price.”

  And he spat in her face.

  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You shouldn't have done that.”

  As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!” The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.

  “I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”

  “Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart.

  “Potter --- you're here! What --- ? How --- ?” She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter, that was foolish!”

  “He spat at you,” said Harry.

I think the part that was the most messed up with the contract was she hid doing it and never told anyone. Telling people before or immediately after they signed would have made sense, because it would've added incentive, but not telling anyone and letting the curse lash out is ridiculous, especially because Umbridge had a very serious amount of power over both the children and in the government.

***** What she did to the contract was wrong and yeah, she should have at least given an ominously vague warning of the consequences of breaking it but they were in fact quite literally putting themselves through a sort of bootcamp, an illegal one at that, because the War was going to heat up eventually.

Umbridge was gunning for everyone, on the orders of the Ministry itself, the Ministry is absolutely infested with DE greasing palms, people are going missing and the teachers are doing jack and shit to help deal with things.

Marietta could have gotten people killed by opening her mouth. Especially since we see later that Umbridge is perfectly willing to use the Unforgivables on students and then, later still, giddly sends innocent people to bloody Concentration Camps.

Marietta got what she deserved. If things had gone differently, she could have caused the War to be lost before it even really began.

** I never considered her moral compass screwed up, more that she matured as she grew older and stopped viewing the world in such a black and white way--- at the beginning of SS, she's an uptight, naive little girl who thinks expulsion from school is the worst thing imaginable, and as the series progresses, she faces all the dangers of the Wizarding World and has to realize that following the rules can't be what she bases the correctness of her actions off of. She's certainly got a degree of ruthlessness in her, and has somewhat of a troubling 'the ends justify the means' attitude at times, but I wouldn't say that without school rules she completely loses the plot.

*** To be fair to the expulsion line, the Wizarding world is ****ed up. It wouldn't surprise me if Muggle-borns were obliviated of magic knowledge if they were expelled, even if it is only done under the table by former Death Eaters. Quite frankly, the Wizarding World is terrifying to live in as a society, on top of the horrors that exist like Dementors, to the point that expulsion as a Muggle-born, or just not going to magic school, could easily be considered a bad end.

**** I don't think muggleborns are Obliviated, but only because magic doesn't stop happening if you don't know it exists. Accidental magic would still happen, but they wouldn't know how to control it. Accidentally apparating to the school roof in the full view of a dozen muggles or turning somebody's hair blue would just endanger the Statute of Secrecy. So if anything, reluctant Muggle parents are probably magically "persuaded" to send their kids to Hogwarts no matter what fucked up stuff is happening there.

And I wonder what you have to even do to be expelled from Hogwarts other than being a half-giant?

I think Hermione says this line because she's excited about this new shiny world of magic and doesn't want to leave it.

** Genuine question: where does she even follow the rules outside lessons and homework? She is the one instigating the rulebreaking in the first place more often than not.

People base their undersanding of Hermione's character on her first month in the wizarding world, when she was an 11 y.o. kid thrust into a completely new world without any friends or support system. So latched onto the rules to make sense of it initially. But it quickly becomes apparent that it's not in her nature, and throughout the books, Hermione acts based what she personally thinks is right.

Edit: update to your list: petrifying Neville and leaving him like that for who knows how long in the PS. It's one thing to set Snape, who she thinks is cursing Harry, on fire, and another to hex your fellow friendly classmate because he's in a way.

*** To be fair, the later in the books, the more mature the intended audience should be considered.

After the first few books, a much more mature audience is most likely the actual audience.

Hermione did that in the fourth book.

On another note, I would like to point out that Harry used the unforgivable curses successfully in the 7th book, but also posit that that sort of sadism both clashes and fits with his character. Harry uses the disarming curse and stupefy throughout the books when more lethal options are available to the point of using the disarming curse against Voldemort in the final battle, however, he used the imperius and cruciatus curse in that same book to the actual expected levels of the curse. I think that Harry knew he was getting sadistic, throughout the book feeling disgusted with himself to the point of choosing Expelliarmus in the final duel against Voldemort. Of course, I also think that Rowling absolutely did not intend this interpretation to be true.

Rich girl who never personally had anything bad going on in her life, antisocial, arrogant, hypocritical, only following the rules she personally likes and not making a single effort into adapting into a culture she more or less has to live in from now on.
