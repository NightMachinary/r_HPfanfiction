As I grow older, the Dursley's abuse with Harry, I'm fine with, up until the point one of them rapes Harry. That tends to be the stepping over the imaginary line for me. Once that moment hits, I'm done.

I tend to ignore stories that have the Dumbledore/Weasley bashing in the Summary, every now and then, however you will get bashing in stories with no warnings. I read a story where turns out the Weasley's were working with Dumbledore against Harry, I do have to applaud the author for showing it right in the first chapter, but hot dang... once I read that I was out.

Like, it is startlingly difficult to read stories with no Dumbledore and no Weasley Bashing, normally the story has at least one of those. Just disappointing really. They normally have a warning, but sometimes there is none. (Note feel free to recommend any stories that have NO Weasley Bashing and NO Dumbledore Bashing, that'd be great.

What are some of your I'm done with this fic, stories? (Feel free to name the stories, if you want).

** angst porn or abuse porn that's just brutalising the characters for no reason, and the ‘no homo' shit that goes out of its way to be like over the top heterosexual like, you don't need to prove anything. just say it's het and we'll know it's het. It's not a manifesto, we don't care if you're (the writer) gay or not

These fics often have outright homophobic shit in them that basically calls Dumbledore a pervert because he's gay, which is super gross. Like in these fics he isn't a pervert; they're literally just calling all gay men perverts. It's exhausting to come across this sentiment in rl, and just as exhausting when you're reading a story about kids

Conversely I do also hate when a slash fic will go out of its way to demonise the female character who is in the canon relationship with like, you can just say the don't get together. She doesn't have to be evil just for two boys to love each other

It undermines the whole gay thing anyways. Harry is not going to choose to become gay just because Ginny is a total bitch. It's not a lifestyle choice, it's what you are. If he tries to be gay just because he's disappointed by girls, that sounds more like a tragedy...

** A few things:

- drama for drama's sake with ships. If a story is meant to be predominantly about a couple (doesn't matter who) and there's drama just /because/ to cause discord and tension, I won't read it anymore. I'm for drama because plot, but I'm at the age where people should just talk out their issues. I'm looking at you, CW tv shows *cough Riverdale cough*

- if I have to push my suspension of judgment too far to get into the story. Given I write time travel stuff, if /I/ find your reasons for something to happen out there without explanation, I'm pulled out of the story and that's it for me.

- pretentious authors or storylines. I'm cool with author's notes, I'm cool with those top tier authors in whatever fandom, but I'm not cool with stories whose plots are so convoluted that a maze looks simple; or when authors start responding in authors notes with demands, taunts, pleas, insults, trekking readers "they don't get it" etc.

... I feel really old outlining these now. 😬 Edit: words, apparently. Thanks phone.

** I just noped out of a 300,000+ word fic with just 3 chapters to go about 30 minutes ago. It was a well written story with some interesting and original ideas and sometimes the hours you've already invested in a fic keep you reading. In the end the bad parts meant I just couldn't keep at it.

It started out with 11 yr old girls competing for Harry's affections. :-(

Then an adult woman was gang raped and murdered by Death Eaters as Harry's motivation for going dark. :-( :-(

Next a 13 yr old boy attempted to sexually assault a 13 yr old girl. :-( :-( :-(

Finally an adult male groped and threatened to sexually assault a 15 yr old girl. :-( :-( :-( :-(

This was when I decided I was done with the fic.

The icing on the cake was an author's note at the end of the chapter which assured readers that they would never write the rape of an underage girl. As if that justified all the rest of it. When 50% of the main female characters in your story are being raped or assaulted it's just not something I'm willing to read.

** Firstly, specifically and overly dark stuff. The old 'Evil Harry laces his cocaine with the tears of the children of his enemies before he kills the children too' nonsense. It feels like they're trying to write gritty thrillers or horror but just gave up and made Saw-type torture porn instead. I don't mind bleak or generally dark things, but these fics think gore and torture and insults are horror and all of that has serious diminishing returns, narratively speaking. I remember one Youtuber playing the second Outlast game was wandering along and said, in the most wearied tones I'd ever heard on Youtube, "Oh, yet another pit of dead babies."

Secondly, random tonal or character changes without rhyme or reason, especially when those changes seem to mimic author prejudices or act as soapboxes. I've blotted out the fics, but I've seen some where Harry just turns around and starts spouting on about 'The Muslim Problem' or waxes lyrical on how Homosexuality causes Squibs in a rambling horrorfest that sounds like the American News or one of those Baptist Preacher types. Though now I say that, I would like to see an Alex Jones parody where Harry laments how the Muggles putting chemicals in the water is turning the friggin' frogs gay. :D

**** You have a point, but that's not quite what I mean.

At the end of the day, every story is at least semi-issues based. It's kind of inbuilt into the concept of narrative - themes, ideas, philosophies, politics, race, society in general are the foundation of stories by the very nature of them. Writers write what they know, and since all they know is life, that's what they write. Battlestar Galactica dealt with Racism and Religion, Harry Potter dealt with Racism and Immigration and Civil War/Terrorism, Soap Operas talk about Social Issues all the time. They just don't soapbox about it, because that's a jarring way to do it. You make a point by writing the story and indirectly examining it, not by having your character stop and deliver your viewpoints to the reader. That's what pulls me out of it, the feeling that the writer just shoved their character out of the way, pulled on their face, and started spouting their views directly to me.

Though you are right that it can get draining. There is still a place for those stories about those real-world issues to be told, and an important place at that, but no matter how passionate you are about an issue, or how important and live-saving solving it might be, you can't focus directly on a thing on all the time. It's not healthy. You gotta take breaks or switch channels or just release the build-ups and pressures somehow. When it comes to stories, we just let the issues fade into the tapestry rather than being yelled in your face by doomsaying newscasters.

** This is going to sound petty of me, but if a fic has diverged from canon but /still/ kills off Sirius by having him fall through the veil, I'm not interested in continuing.

A fic that starts after the DoM fiasco with Sirius already dead is fine. A fic that has Sirius die in some other way is fine. (I might not /like/ it, Sirius is my favorite character, but I get that character deaths happen.) But this specific station of the canon irks me something fierce. It hinges so much on simple lack of communication from literally everyone involved.

** If a fic is really bad I just stop within the first few paragraphs. Or more likely I don't look at it at all because the metadata (tags etc.) indicate I won't be into it. It's hard for me to quit reading a fic if I'm like halfway into it, since I usually still want to find out what happens. If I do stop, it's usually not noping out over some specific thing, but just reaching a gradualization that I'm not enjoying the story and it doesn't seem likely to change. And even that doesn't mean that it's bad. It just means it's gone in a direction that doesn't appeal to me. And it usually still takes some deliberate effort to pull away from it.

So I'm not bothered by bad or unappealing stories. I just don't read them, ok fine. I'm most bothered by sort-of-good stories where I slog through a huge long fic and then at the end, feel like I didn't get much out of it and it was just exhausting. So these days I'm put off by high word counts, like anything over 100k. I don't want to even start reading a 500k fic unless it seems very promising.

** The only real times I'll generally hard close box is if the opening chapters just don't make sense, or if the story isn't absolutely stellar, and it focuses on a pairing I greatly dislike.

I find evil Dumbledore /boring/. It doesn't make me close box, but I don't find it compelling. I especially have warning signs flashing if Harry starts writing a list of all the points where Dumbledore acted as a plot element rather than a character, as evidence that Dumbledore is evil. Yeah, if you want Dumbledore to be evil, actually work for it, and don't copy tired old tropes.

I rather dislike seeing when bashing is clearly a personal thing for the author. They have a personal dislike for the character, so they bring them up at times where it simply doesn't make sense in world. If you don't like a character feel free to make them evil or whatever (provided you actually put in the work. See what I said about tired old tropes) but don't trash them when it doesn't make sense in the story.

Otherwise, it's mostly a case of if I find myself bored reading it. The biggest warning sign there is if I don't want to go back to that tab on my browser. If I sigh when I look at your tab, your fic's day's are numbered in my book.

** Slash, Harem, bad writing/dialogue, completely OOC Harry all put me off.

​

Recnac Transfaerso, linkffn(1399984), is a really good fic. It's sad, but the story is good and the characters feel true to the story. Alternate take on fifth year.

​

Stepping Back, is a time travel fic that I think is really well done. It does have OP!Harry but that's not the main focus of the story. linkffn(12317784).

A Marauder's Plan is a really good story. Yes, there is a lot of family magic and Wizengamot stuff, but it's not completely overdone like lots of stories and it's written in a way that actually makes sense and integrates well with the plot. linkffn(8045114).

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

He would talk about how she would be his like it was ment to be and then he would talk about if she had all her memories he would take away the ones with "wretched Potter and his spawn" and then thay ("lily and Snape) could be the family they where ment to be. Then it turns around and goes back to the main plot of harry who has no idea that the/a body of his mother is in Hogwarts.

** The inabillity to spell Harry. It's not Hari, Harold, Hadrian or Henry. With how disgusted Petunia is at Harry being a common name, if he had a longer or less common name, they would use that. Unless it was blatantly foreign or sounded Wizard-y. So the long version can be Harryhoudini as all one word.

It is odd the Petunia refuses to be common, but insist on being normal. She is basically Katie Hopkins.
