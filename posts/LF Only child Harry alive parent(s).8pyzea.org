So...I've just read some fanfictions over this weekend (well, it's not over yet!) and now I've got another request, especially since almost all fanfictions with either one or both of Harry's parents surviving to see him grow up give Harry siblings (mostly at least one sister and at least one brother):

Give me fanfictions with Harry being an only child :) (Bonus: Intelligent, driven Harry who thinks he has something to prove (remember: Both of his parents were good at school, even James the prankster wasn't a bad student and he was a favourite of McGonagall because he was talented and skilled at transfiguration and Lily certainly was no slouch either!))

As always:

Please no slash (for the main character(s) - if it's in the background I am fine with it!) and no Harry/Ginny (unless the story is a must read)...all other pairings are ok :)

So, as always: The stage is yours and thank you for your efforts (in advance and in case I forget thanking people - unlikely, but hey it can happen!)


** Well, one possibility is C'est la vie linkao3(C'est la vie). Its not quite what you think, i.e. Harry's a spoiled brat, but otherwise it all fits. Harry is not the main character, that title belongs to "Harry" (or Hadrian depending on your perspective).

half awake and almost there linkao3(half awake and almost there) has Harry as an only child. Its an AU in america with no magic, but it /fits all of your description/.

The Return of the Marauders linkffn(The Return of the Marauders). I'm not gonna lie, this one is cliche as hell. Also its H/G, but things are weird in this universe (I've never hated Neville as much as I do in this fic) so that probably shouldn't be the deciding factor.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

***** Probably.

Seriously though, it just sounds like the author wants a mostly OC barely canon character to be paired up with Harry. Why does there need to be a pairing at all?

If you want a talented Harry with living parents (sort of) you can try linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning). But it always strikes me as a bit odd when someone excludes fics based on who the pairing is (I can /sort/ of understand why no slash, but honestly that seems easier to buy than Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/Lily).

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

****** There is no need - I read fics without a pairing as well (and that includes fanfictions where the main character is a total player and sleeps with several girls/women), still I like fanfictions where the main character isn't emotionally dead and does look at women and maybe even date etc. :)

As for Harry/Lily or Bella? Yeah, not very realistic, but I do love the lure of the forbidden!

As for that fanfiction? I've not read it yet, but I have stumpled upon it several times by now :)

******* Thats not unreasonable. But I think you need to remember that there is not a huge reason to believe Harry would become more talented just because he has his parents. They are at a boarding school away from their family.

More to the point, for most wizards their is a natural predilection towards specific branches of magic, often demonstrated by the types of wand woods and cores (though that is not a guarantee of anything). Harry would not necessarily become talented in any field because his parents are there. He would need to have a radical personality shift for that to occur, because power in the HP universe is based almost entirely on the amount of studying, experience, and natural intellect a person possesses.

A talented Harry probably would be much smarter and spend most of his time studying/researching/learning and would end up with someone who /also/ was focused on that sort of thing (see Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived for a decent example).

******** Thing is: I believe Harry has talent/potential! He just ignores it because pursuing it might lead to more fame and less being "Just Harry" (I mean he tried in the TWT only because he didn't want to die or lose his magic! Otherwise our canon Harry would probably have forfeited if he believed that to work!)

With his parents he would IMHO strive to be the best he can (especially since Lily seems to value academic achievement (his father, too but less!))!

Harry would also lack the baggage that is holding him back! He wouldn't feel worthless, he would stand up for himself, he would prove to the world that he is more than a scar!

Did you mean to imply that Ginny isn't a Weasley or was it just a poor choice of phrasing, and you perhaps dislike Ginny more than the rest of the Weasleys?

****** I do dislike her more in part because she used her status as "the little girl" and "the favourite" (especially of Molly!) to get away with tons of things and she enjoyed getting new clothes (and never demanded that her brothers also get new things etc. - I mean I would have probably writen home to my parents if they sent my brother a robe that looks centuries old while I get a new dress!)

But I didn't mean that here...I just mentioned Ginny before and thus I thought I had to mention her again - just writing "I don't like the Weasleys" kind of wasn't enough!

ps: The Weasleys IMHO doesn't encapsulate the twins and Bill and Charlie (they had already left and are independent entities from the Weasley parents)...I especially mean Ron, Arthur and Molly - and Ginny of course!

Ginny is such a non-entity! We don't even know what hobbies she has besides Quidditch or who her friends are besides the trio, the twins and Neville (ok and maybe Luna!), but unlike other blank (well almost blank) slates like Daphne Greengrass, Ginny is the canon love interest!
