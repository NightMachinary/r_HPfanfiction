Have you encountered any fics where the organisation of a magical hospital or a magical ministry has been different? I'm thinking about the floor guide of St. Mungo's for instance. What do you think about it? Does it make sense to you, or would you have changed it? Do you feel like something is missing?

What about the ministry? What do you find lacking? A food/agricultural department? Economy department? Population registry? Property registry?

If you could recreate the organisation structures of a magical hospital or ministry, what would it look like?
