It's a bit difficult to phrase what I'm looking for, which is why a Google search hasn't really enlightened me any. Are there any stories that you've read that highlight any secrets of the castle? Where the author takes initiative in weaving something new into the school's established canon?

A great example of this is in The Merging, linkffn(9720211), which details things like an extra room in the Chamber of Secrets, more of the Room of Requirement (not simply using it as a plot convenience), and a kind of sentience that reads tastefully.

Basically, this fic is amazing and its attention to detail is amazing and I want to read more amazing things like it. I appreciate any help!


** There is of course linkffn(What you leave behind by Newcomb) and his four founder rooms, an exceptional fic that stands out in so many aspects. Only downside, not updated in more than a year (though not abdonded as far as my latest information is, like a month ago).

And there is the fic that feels like it inspired Newcomb linkffn(An Unfound Door by joe6991). I dont think I ever had an "damn thats awesome" moment like when I read the hidden garden scene.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Canon-ish yet original take on magic. On hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][Arinthmacer]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] - This fic is based on arithmancy being method of spell creation, which is rather stupid and doesn't fit with how magic works. The beginning is also rather canon rehashy. So why I recommend it? Initial arc focus strongly on exploring Hogwarts, there is a lot of "education" added, and the writing is technically competent. (Ongoing with regular updates).

*** All the good fics are dead and/or abandoned indefinitely. It's disheartening, but as I'm a natural glutton for punishment, I read them anyway. Thank you for the recs! I've seen others mention Arithmancer, but you've convinced me to give it a try.

** This is definitely not what you mean, but try linkao3(The Fine Art of Fine Print)

This is a super weird fic where Molly becomes headmaster of Hogwarts and imposes a bunch of weird, crazy rules. Hermione is an Unspeakable doing some sort of research project/trying to save Hogwarts or something, and in the process she discovers a bunch of Hogwarts' secrets. It's also pretty explicit. It's been a while since I read it, but I think I vaguely enjoyed it.
