For close to half a year, I wasn't following the fandom, 'cause my monkey brain can only get into one thing at a time (Worm, in this case, if you were wondering) but now I'm back! But now I don't have a clue about what's hot and fresh off the press (or 5-6 months off the press) :( So please! Have a heart, help me catch up! What's your recommendation for semi-recent fics, or maybe fics that have been revived, or only gained popularity recently? Thank you in advance, y'all!


** Linkffn(Loose Cannon) is a fairly recent fic with an excellent update schedule that doesn't seem to get as much love as it deserves. Lot of fun with some pretty snappy dialogue.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** Well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10556030/1/Royal-Ward][/Royal Ward/]] was just updated on the 4th, and to my chagrin, Dunuelos gave up on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729635/1/Through-the-Wormhole][/Through the Wormhole/]].

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

**** Yeah. He got all the way to Year 3, before he gave up and posted a summary of where he planned to go with the story.

** linkffn(Strange Visitors From Another Century)

You might have read this before, but it was updated 16th of Feb. It's worth checking out, but has really slow updates!

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.
