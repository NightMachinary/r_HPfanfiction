I havent read "House of Healing Souls" completely, but for a good part. The Story of the fic aside, i really like the Building of the Harry/Narcissa Relationship in this (how they enjoy each other) and i would would like to see something like this in other Fics aswell, of course with Lemon elements.

No Romance or Pregnancy like in "Why are you in my House", but more a relationship that is built on Desire and Trust (and Lust). Ok, Pregnancy for whatever Reason can happen, but it would be good, if it only come during the end.

Harry doesnt actively take the Dom part in Healing Souls, but Narcissa....in a way its both, and i enjoyed it.

Let me know, if you know similar fics.


** There's a fic called pleochroism on ao3. Check it out.

****** Oh sorry, that was a mistake when my internet went down and I'm on mobile. Sorry the chapter it starts is about 25. But she is NOT the main ship. She is his mistress
