Yes, I do have a soft spot for the Under-appreciated Ron Weasley, but you certainly can't deny the fact that among the five Gryffindor boys in his year, Ron is the only guy having a Wizard father. Let's break it down.

Harry ‘Voldemort Killed My Parents' Potter

Seamus ‘me mums a witch dad's a muggle, but of a shock when he found out' Finnegan

Dean ‘never known my father' Thomas

Neville ‘I grew up with my Grandmother' Longbottom

Ronald ‘Sixth Son of Arthur Weasley' Weasley.

So, yeah, the prompt is, Ron Weasley being an absolute dad along with the dad jokes and subtly taking care of the other four Gryffindor boys.

I did read one other fanfiction, and it is one of my favorites.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/]]) Ron and Hermione centric- set after DH

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1806117/1/]]) Ron-centric. Ghost Ron where he dies and has to deal with those ramifications.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/]]) Oldie but a goodie! One shot but very well written.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6905950/1/]]) Incredible Ron time travel fic where the tropes are thoroughly explored and discussed in a very realistic way.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/]]) The Red Knight. It's very well known, very well done. An all around great read.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5288841/1/]]) Ron centric, also dealing with Ron's insecurities!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3880365/1/]]) When Ron's exposure to the Horcrux exposes more than just his thoughts, they need to save him.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2954815/1/]]) and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2929256/1/]]) Extreme Ron whump. What happens when Ron decides to take Harry's detention with Umbridge in his place?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2333917/1/]]) Ron and Harry have more in common than they'd thought.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10199030/1/]]) Ron gets in over his head and is faced with terrible consequences.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12120803/1/]]) Ron, Harry and Hermione relationship. Oneshot

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632772/1/]]) Ron has been missing for years. He may or may not have betrayed Harry. And why is Harry hearing his best friends voice all of a sudden in his head?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12742123/1/]]) Ron love to get away from all the bashing! An exploration of his many achievements.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/]]) The other original Ron Slytherin fic. Choices.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632781/1/]]) Powerful Ron with a power he doesnt know how to use. Incredibly well written. Incomplete but the author will be updating.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868266/1/]]) An exploration of Ron and his family.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12870741/1/]]) Ron-centric and major whump. The Boogeyman is real and Ron knows this all too well...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11595257/1/]]) How Ron and Snape become bros!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024932/1/]]) What happens when Ron leaves on the Horcrux Hunt? To what lengths will he go to make it right?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year. 

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805206/chapters/29228961]]) is the massive completed work, Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce! Very Ron heavy, very Ron-centered, a what if Gordon Ramsay was the Potions Master in Sixth Year instead of Slughorn? Bring tissues for this. It starts very light and gets very dark.

EDIT: Here are some new ones I've found!

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214]]) is the completed Series of the Secret Language of Plants! It's very very good. Extremely Harry centered, though. Like Ron isn't even really a super major character, but he's portrayed extremely well, he's portrayed with lots of skill, and he's still portrayed as Harry's loyal best friend. Harry just spends a lot of time on the run so he's not at Hogwarts where Ron is. Ron is definitely amazing in this series, so even though it's long and daunting, it's worth the read. Also Percy Weasley has his reasons for aiding with the Ministry here.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21926938]]) is an 18000 word oneshot with an extremely interesting take on the "Ron is Dumbledore" theory. It's incredibly written.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20796065]]) is an adorable 1000 word oneshot where Ron is a Gryffindor dad and realizes none of his dorm mates have had a wizard father to teach them how to shave.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916]]) is a 10000 word oneshot which is Harry-centric, but Ron is an integral good boi in the story; the Trio are about 27 and it's after the War, but Harry gets de-aged back to 17 years old and his memories regress with his age.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24399721/chapters/58858189]]) is a completed four chapter muggle breakfast club AU. It's a fun read, and a definite interesting take on each of the characters.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20414137/chapters/48425305]]) is an ongoing fic centered which each of the Trio being a MC, and each of the Trio being one of the Founders reborn. It's only four chapters in, but proving to be extremely interesting.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

****** I needed to reply to this comment thread hahaha because it got too long so here goes:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12492790/1/The-Heinz-Dillema]]) is a completed, well-written story in which Ron is desperately asked for help by his Squib cousin to save his dying daughter who has leukemia.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2056512/1/Invisible-Circus]]) is an incredibly well-written, like superbly written, story where Ron is a spy, bringing down the Cause from within. After the War, a new enemy rises.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11768072/1/Rise-of-the-Weasley-Famiglia]]) is an ongoing story in which the premise is Ron becomes a crime boss. The first chapter is amazing, though sadly there is only one chapter and it was published in 2011.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia]]) is a completed fic where, "Ron grieves the loss of his brother and tries to figure out life after the war while trying to navigate his new relationship with Hermione." Very well-written. Incredible plot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13128275/1/How-Ron-Weasley-Rescued-the-Chudley-Cannons]]) is a 6000 word oneshot in which Ron becomes the assistant manager of the Chudley Cannons and manages to bring the underdog up...

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century]]) isn't Ron-centric, but he is an integral character and treated favorably. During the Battle in the DoM, they fall into a time turner and go back 1000 years in the past to the time of the Founders. Ongoing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died]]) is a completed work where, "Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides." Ron and Hermione centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12816401/1/Blast-TO-the-Past]]) is an ongoing, comedic story where a married Ron is blasted into 1994, in his younger self's body. However, his younger self's consciousness is still there.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9885150/1/To-A-Fault]]) a series of oneshots in which Ron is exceedingly loyal and constantly defends Harry's honor, even when attacked for it.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6835305/1/Some-Things-You-Need-to-Know]]) is a completed three-shot in which Ron is worried for Harry the summer after their first year, and lets his parents know.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/Renaissance]]) is a completed, incredibly well-written story. "Set 3 years after DH. Ron finds himself trying to fix a bust relationship with Hermione, help organise Harry and Ginny's wedding, assist McGonagall in her pending retirement and solve the mystery of the stolen Sorting Hat."

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/Ginger-s-Second-Chance]]) is an ongoing, kind of crack-ish tale where Ron, jaded and tired from his terrible relationship with Hermione and Harry, goes back in time to alter things. 20,000 words and two chapters are up

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23036404/chapters/55089451]]) is completed and not Ron-centric; it's Harry-centric, a Drarry romcom, but Ron has incredibly funny and good moments in this story. I'd check it out even though it's not Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13568095/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Betrayal-of-Betraying-Betrayers]]) okay so this one is completely Harry-centric, but it's a hilarious oneshot. I really think it's worth a read.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9742543/1/Boys-Round-Here]]) this one is ongoing and extremely funny. "With Sirius Black on the loose, Harry and Ron arrive for their 3rd year as rambunctious, loud, obnoxious teenagers. Sounds normal. Why, then, is Albus Dumbledore so worried? Is it going to be just a normal year at Hogwarts? Is it ever when a Potter is involved?" Mostly Harry-centric but Ron is a major character.

**** I would disagree. A lot of people like Ron and feel that his character was treated unfairly by the movies. As you can see from the lists below, there are a lot of Ron-centric fics. It's only that other than Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce, most of them are not common recommendations on this sub.

** I can totally see this dynamic within Gryffindor. Ron would totally give them all a bit of a hard time, but be super helpful every time. I always kinda thought of Hermione as the girl "mom" so that would also make a fun dynamic in a fanfic where they were together and kinda "parenting" the rest.
