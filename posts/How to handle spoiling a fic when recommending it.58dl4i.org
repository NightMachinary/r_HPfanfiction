** Good question!! I just recommend it anyway without describing why it fits the request and hope some ppl might add it to their to-read list and then forget why the added it (I do that all the time).

You could also just PM it to the OP and reply in the thread that you have a good rec but that it's a spoiler so to PM you for the link.

I do that. I've got almost 1000 fics in my calibre library and I have 280 of them marked as read (or can't read, as the case may be). When I'm ready for a new fic, I'll pick a tag or length and just browse. I'll read them all eventually.

** If someone is asking for a fic with a certain theme/plot, then they are basically asking that the plot will be spoiled where that is concerned, in my opinion. It would be weird not to recommend a story doing exactly what the poster wanted because you don't want to spoil his surprise since he didn't want a surprise to begin with.

** Generally, if it's a general thread I'd try to not spoil anything, and if it's a request thread and the fic only qualifies if spoiled I'd simply ask them if they want such a thing posted.
